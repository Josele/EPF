			I work though my own GmbH so have limited liability. Even with that, I have professional indemnity insurance. The amount that you pay will be determined by the nature of your work, and level of cover. Some clients insist on it.   
It is definitely possible to limit liability in a contract. My company has a contract with another company. We work for each other from time to time. We've agreed to limit our liability to each other to a fixed amount.

dave        Clearly you raise a good point but... There is a basic rule that must be applied and that is that what is good for one is good for all. this means the rules that are placed within the company apply to everyone and this means the same structures apply across the company. This might not be wanted by the payrolling company hence the problem. Plus it is necessary to have these approved by the local tax authorities.

			Hi again, sorry for resurrecting this thread - eventually we didn't do anything. However we still would like to go to Switzerland (Ticino). Obviously there will be more restrictions in place after the 9th February 2017, when Switzerland will have to impose quotas to everyone (is my understanding correct?).  But it seems that even now the total number of  L and B permits  is severely restricted (eg. only 250 for B permits).   
I was thinking of opening a company in Ticino (with a large capital and income switched to it from my UK company), obviously I would need to find a Swiss resident/citizen as a director (any links of someone who provides this service?). I could then become a (highly-salaried) employee of that company and ask for a work permit. Is that feasible or does anyone have better ideas?   
Thanks again and sorry for the resurrection...

			Whether you can or not depends on your nationality/Swiss permit.  If an EU national then self-employment isn't too much of a problem, but for a non-EU your Swiss permit will determine whether you can or not. L permit holders are not allowed to be self-employed.

			If I go ahead and apply to SBS and complete the MBA program, then my intention is to stay in Zurich and work there. From my understanding and the rankings, the business school doesn't have the reputation, quality and accreditation of other business schools in Switzerland such as IMD, university of St. Gallen etc. However, a positive factor could be considered the fact that SBS is located in Zurich and that provides great networking opportunities with big financial firms. As long as the SBS provides a legitimate recognized degree (which I haven't been able to verify yet), and employers in the area hire from SBS then this MBA program seems like a good alternative.

Tourism in Switzerland is really suffering due to high CHF, high costs, and the currencies from many countries going down, especially Sterling. 
So perhaps not a good time for a new B&B, as many are on the brink.   
Unless you can find a 'niche' market - and offer something others do not offer- like guiding, wiht a good knowledge of local culture, history, flowers, wildlife, etc- which as a newcomer you just won't have. Or offer residential courses, art, yoga, tai-chi, whatever ...   
What I will do if I have to return to work, but then I know this part of the world like my back pocket and have all the necessary contacts- and speak the local language, as well as several others,  which would truly help.

Do note though that in such a case you can be held liable with all your personal wealth if things go wrong - just saying. I think as long as you do less than 100k annually you don't need a VAT number either.   
However, there may be additional requirements and regulations applicable to you so you won't get a clear answer here, even more so as you provide zero info.    
In order to be certain you need to contact the local authorities in Nyon and Geneva as well as those of both Kantons (though hopefully you get info on all four by contacting just one).

U.S. law 35 U.S.C. § 102

The biggest risk? You never know which third party may have an ear in the conversation and may use the information for his own good. Talking on the phone on the train? Very bad idea. No one on the train is bound to any confidentially can can use the knowledge as they wish. Even file the patent before you.

			Thanks, this would not involve any side work actually from my side- or very very little- it will be all automated and self-running   
after I setup my online store it's all automatic because am using "" the dropshipping system"", which means that when a customer orders something it is shipped directly to them from my chosen supplier without me packing or handling any payment.the supplier does all the work for me.   
It means that it is a ""self-running"" online store. I have basically nothing to do except setting-up the store early this year (takes a week) and then it's self running.

			Why would you put all your eggs in one basket with a high-risk investment in a potentially illiquid asset?   
Thee are many ways to 'invest' in the stock market, which do not rely on picking a stock and hoping it goes up   
You have a good piece of capital, if I were you I would invest some of it in yourself by learning how to make money in financial markets, then you can put your savings to use in a diversified and less risky venture than throwing it all into one investment in property.   
Start with:   if you want a mountain of free education about how to manage your own money in a sustainable way

That has to take into account that you won't have guaranteed hours and you'll be responsible for your holiday and sick pay.   
Re VAT, I'm pretty certain that if your sales are over 100,000  , you need to be registered even though you won't be charging VAT to your foreign clients. But this small amount of extra paperwork would work in your favour as you'll be able to claim back MwsT on taxable expenses such as petrol, telephone bills, stationary, delivery costs etc

			Company admin (I assume you mean ltd. company, not sole trader) isn't that onerous. It's just book-keeping, and fairly simple at that. We used to have our accountant do most of the work, but my wife did some training courses and now he just does year end, deals with the tax-office on our behalf and is available for advice. All charged of course!   
If you take most of the income as salary for yourself, then company tax is minimal. Depending on your income level, you might find it better value for money than a payroll company. It's usually easier to handle expenses as well. You can, if you want, take dividends - but this requires careful juggling of amounts to make it tax efficient It's useful for leveling income over a few years.   
You can register for fixed rate MWST which can boost your income if you're not actually buying much.   
However, the main reason to use a ltd. company is that your liability is limited. I.e. under normal circumstances, your creditors can't come after your personal assets if it all goes horribly wrong.    
One reason not to go ltd. is that some cantons don't like one-man companies, and you might have to pay employment bonds and other insurances.

The OP does not have a full time contract of employment abroad so that exemption does not apply. Having income arising in the UK would normally create a UK tax liability however there is an 11k allowance that non residents can currently claim.  
Being joint resident means liability to world wide earnings in 2 countries, credit for tax paid in 1 country will usually be credited. Earn 10k in the UK & there is no UK liability however there would be a Swiss liability on that tax free UK income. 
I still have no idea why you asked if the OP was a UK citizen, it's irrelevant as UK does not tax people for just being citizens.

			Will start with    OK, now to the fun part:   
One way to look at your GmbH is as a separate ""person.""  This GmbH person will do the work for the bank, be liable if anything goes wrong, is responsible for its bills and debts, etc.  Advise you keep all risk at this level.  Toss out the Einzelfirma idea - besides the payroll hassle, you then open yourself up to be personally liable.   
Since the GmbH ""person"" cannot make any decisions, a physical person(s) is designated as GF.  You want to have written employment contract between GmbH and GF to protect yourself as GF.  Compensation if only one part (you can even make salary variable, e.g. equal to monthly net after expenses so that you doing all the work get all the income.)  What you really want in employment contract is that GmbH covers all personal liability for your decisions as GF excluding standard gross negligence, criminal behaviour, etc   
Being shareholder + GF not that much different than being regular employee, except that you will not be eligible for unemployment (but have to pay ALV) and that if company gets in a big hole, you and partner as shareholders could be held personally liable for select debts of GmbH (like some payroll, taxes, etc.) in case of bankruptcy.     
If GmbH employs anyone (even if just you) the GmbH still needs to have registration for statutory AHV/IV/EO, a Pensionskasse if any employee earns over CHF 21k/year, and supplemental insurances like KTG and UVG.  You can do all this separate starting with your Kanton's Ausgleichkasse , but for small start-up consider joining your trade organisation, Gewerbeverband, or local Arbeitgeberverband.  They can guide you to faster registrations and better group rates.   
Yes, dividends are normally shared proportional to share participation.  However, you can make separate agreement where your partner voluntarily forgoes any dividend payments.  As general rule, you want lower salary and higher dividend due to social charges on salary and better tax treatment on dividend.   
hope this helps, good luck with your new business!

Inspection in Europe is useless, what will you do with off-spec, paid for goods once they are in Europe. Ship them back, who will pay for shipping ?   
You need to inspect before goods leave China and before you pay for them or agree to have an independent inspection company attend and seal the containers, somebody like Intertek, SGS Geneva. Steer away from Chinese inspection companies CCIC and suchlike, they'll cheat you.   
This is all fairly elementary for importing by the way.

			Hi all,   
 My wife and I have set up and online store with natural and organic cosmetics. The products we offer were not previously known in CH therefore we think the best next step to get more traction is to get to physical shops. Of course we don't think to set up our own offline shop yet.   
 Could anyone advise how best to approach such shops such as Coop, Migros or others, for potential discussion on getting our products on their shelves? What should we consider before doing first step? 
  Maybe there is someone with similar experience who could share some insight?    
Big thanks in advance for any hints and suggestions.   
PS. I would like to make it really professionally so if someone is willing to help privately we are ready to pay for such a professional advice.

			Totally correct comment about Trademark and protection - only useful if someone clearly infringes AND you have resources to pay to defend it.  Many cases it's just not worth it. 
But back to your original question- why is CH critical registration? Unless your product/service is very specific to CH market, likely not so important in big scheme and OK to skip this 
Free advice: go for major developed markets where protection is worthwhile i.e. EU and USA.  Asia markets (CHN, JPN) more difficult, expensive, and often doesn't matter if you have TM or not.... 
For USA you have already found way to go with USPTO.  One way to simplify is go with service like TradeMark Express - worth the money since they have paralegals to help guide you to only having to submit once ""correctly"". Website is tmexpress.com     
EU is more complicated, since technically you need an ""European level"" TM plus each country grants individual TM in addition.  This can mean several 10k's investment.  Suggest you go with initial EU trademark, gives you registration for later if your idea/product develops into something needing prior claim for individual country registration.  The EU level application goes via an office in Alicante, Spain, website is here:    
Sorry for long comment but one last remark:  getting good internet domains is increasingly difficult so check and see if you can even get domain matching your trademark before you file for it.  Good luck!

I have started a company in Switzerland and I can say that it's quite straight forward with registering the company etc. It all depends of course on the canton and city where your business will be located...   
In Lausanne, I know that you can get free advice from the administration and I am quite sure it's the same in other cantons and cities.   
Regarding budget, you would need to include for rent, salaries, AVS, VAT and other fixed and variable expenses.   
If you have any questions regarding Lausanne please let me know.

69	18.03.2010, 13:01	Newbie	Thanked 11 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    Well, on self-employed vs. Ltd or corporation: 
- To become self-employed,  ! For some business, it is also not possible. Being self-employed is a matter of facts, organization, how you appear towards clients and independance. Those criteria will be checked by the AVS authority. Being registered at the Swiss commercial register has a   on proceedings and bankruptcy. If you are not registered, you are subject to the ordinary legal proceeding procedure, which basically imply a long and difficult process for the claimant. Whereas if you are registered, you fall into the bankruptcy procedure, which means the process will be very much simplified and straight forward for the claimant to seize your goods and obtain payments.   
- Creating a company (Sàrl or SA) means creating a separate legal entity, with own assets and capital. This means the   between shareholder and the corporate entity. Which means that if the corporate entity goes bankrupt, the shareholder will not have to pay anything in addition than the initial paid-in capital. This is clearly a   compared to the self-employed activity for which you will be responsible and liable  !   
- The downside on creating a separate corporate entity, is that it is not transparent at all! This means dual legal and tax obligations (for the individual and for the corporate entity). This means that what is paid in the name of the individual can not be ""transferred"" to the corporate entity (or with significant restrictions). This non transparency is not flexible at all and for non experienced people, it can lead to significant issues. Being self employed means that what you earn through your business is for you and can go directly in your pocket. Being employed by its own company means having a salary (maybe subject to tax at source if you have a B permit!!!), paying 2nd pillar, accident insurance, different 1st pillar rates for employer (corporate entity) and individual, issuing a salary certificate which have to mention also the amount of expenses paid back to the employee and other benefits, such as company car, etc. This means also that the profits realized by the company are in the pocket of the company and are subject to profit tax. Once distributed, they are subject to withholding tax (wich can be claimed back by the individual). The dividend is then taxable in the hands of the shareholder, as income, together with his salary. Furthermore, the net assets of the company (share capital plus retained earnings) are subject to a capital tax... If you start denying the non transparency by having the corporate entity assuming private expenses of the individual, you will fall into tax fraud procedure! Wrong accounting that leads to a tax evasion is a tax fraud! It's penal, with fine, taxes and interest for late payments! Withholding tax is also due, which can not be claimed back as you did not declare the income!!! Well, I'm ""painting the Devil on the wall"" as I would say in French, but all this to say that you can't say ""create a Sàrl or SA, it's easier"".   
In my practice, I recommand a Sàrl or SA as soon as: 
- you want to remain anonymous 
- you trade goods outside Switzerland 
- you need bank financing 
- you will or intend to hire people 
- you intend to integrate a partner 
- you will potentialy face high risks of responsibility 
- etc.   
Whereas if you want to have a small business you run and it is you and you and you don't face special risks, go for self-employment. Also dont' forget: going self-employed is basically free of charge, whereas creating a GmbH implies at least costs of CHF 2'000-3'000....   
There is a lot of potential planning by creating a separate legal entity (2nd pillar, tax planning...) and this is a powerful tool. Nevertheless, it has some administrative and legal constraints and implies costs you don't face being self-employed. This needs an analysis of each individual case and no general answer can be given at anytime, but this might give some guidelines.

			This is a most interesting case, I've worked both in the UK and Switzerland, but one aspect I have experienced is that it depends how long you stay in a country. The UK believe it or not can double tax you too, so be careful.

			If you really wanna become rich, then say no to your kids shopping temptations.     
Tips for retail saving:   
- Save 29% by not taking the kids along when you go shopping; 
- Leave your credit cards behind and avoid impulse buys; 
- Avoid ""just popping into the shopping mall"" that can easily get you into overspending; 
- Wait 48 hours before buying. On larger purchases, think first about whether you really need it; 
- Write a shopping list and stick to it; 
- Buy needs not wants.

			Hi, I am a designer. As you've already had a ton of replies I'll assume that you're sorted out. As one person commented, you get what you pay for. I'd certainly be a great deal more expensive than many of the suggested routes above, but you'd be commissioning work that performs as it should. I use the word 'performs' because design, when done properly, is strategic, logical and measurable. It has specific ideas to communicate. Colours are not randomly used because they reflect your personal taste, they are used because they support a specific emotional tone based on colour psychology. Typography and iconography should reflect specific attributes, they too are not random. Design, as the Swiss know well, should be functional. However, unlike a lot of Swiss design, I also believe it should be humanistic, authentically resonating with your intended audience. It should have personality.

			I had a Swiss client who walked off after his Massage without paying. I phoned him and he also had 100 excuses why he couldn't pay his debt just now. I heard from other therapists I am friendy with that he cheated on them, too. Some people are just notorious cheats and try it on wherever they can... The whole court thing is a big hassle and costs... but in your case of a big sum sensible.     
In your case the amount is extremly high and I would try out everything possible. Go to his house or office (fly over) and make a big fuss infront of everybody or ask openly (not a private email) for the money on his Facebook account... perhaps he would be embarrassed and willing to pay. Just writing reminders will not impress him.      
Or send a heavy ""bad boy"" round as one suggested. :-)  but don't give in!

			Thank you for that tip marischi. I looked at their site and shall certainly contact them for rental of a box. There is a similar shop in Rüti ZH called ""Mauckis"" where one can bring your stuff, she sells and takes a certain percentage of the sales. I have bought a few things there myself already.

			Also, contact your local council; bureaucracy here works really well if you show willing to play along* and build a relationship with they who stamp the papers.    
*Alternatively, do whatever you like at the beginning and wait until the authorities catch up. Usually you get a grace period to do as they require. Go for it and good luck!

(Day rate x 20 days paid per month) - (vacation days ~20) - (sickness days <3 ~5) - (social contribution, paying both sides @~20%) - income tax @10%)   
and no mention of agency fees...   
vs    
Salary - (social contribution, paying 1 side @~10%) - income tax @10%)   
That would put a day rate of 800 as equivalent to 150k salary. What did I miss out?

At IFJ you can get a lot of professional help with any questions about starting up a company in Switzerland. And a lot of courses and seminars are for free.

Theoretically the engagement signed by a non authorized person is not valid. Though it is the duty of your counterpart to verify whether you are authorized to sign. In practice, this is rarely done, except for the official acts (notary...) or with some important customers. The kind of decision making depends whether you act as a member of the board, as a member of the Direction or with a delegated authority. The shareholders' meeting is the highest organ in a SA, therefore shareholders' resolutions basically apply to anyone in the company, authorized to sign or not. Nevertheless, you wouldn't expect the shareholders to decide on the day to day business, which is usually delegated to the Directors.    
There is therefore no happy way to remain fully ""discreet"" and to be the only one to take decisions for the company. The only way to do it is to appoint a representative as a board member (having him sign an agreement which sets forth the way he should act (if needed), which is - basically - only on your instructions). Apart from that, if the board member has single signature and you are not authorized, he could quite manage the company on his own, though he still has to act with diligence (= in line with the interests of the company).

You did a big mistake here because you burnt some bullets. To approach such funds you need to be VERY PREPARED, otherwise you are getting your name dirty for future pitches.    
You must have at least a good earnings growth estimate and consequently a valuation of your company. They need to look at it and conclude that their investment will increase a minimum of tenfold in 3-5 years, even if yourself don't believe it can be so good. Remember that for every $100 that an angel investor or venture capital fund invests, 5 companies will receive $20 each. From those, 3 will go bust, one will barely return the invested capital, but the fifth will give returns >10X.

			Hi all   
I am started a consulting business to help local businesses to set up and work with offshore development teams. Ive noticed with speaking to a small local business that they are having trouble expanding with local resources due to costs, but also have no experience with dealing with offshore, so hence expansion has been slow.   
Does anyone know if there is an online directory that can provide information about companies such as company size, turnover, products etc?   
Thanks

			1) Get on Twitter and dedicate an hour a day to following, commenting and sharing. Living the Brand online is a tiresome necessity but it's a good investment.    
2) Join a local Chamber of Commerce and don't be shy. Most successful people are very willing to share and you're likely to find good local intel. They'll let you in for free at their public events so you can get a taste of the organisation.    
3) There'll be times when it's not fun. It's inevitable but keep your head up and wait for the buzz of signing your tenth client.

			One thing to remember is here when you're 'payrolled' through a company it's more or less equivalent to going through an umbrella company in the UK, on a full salary model.  If you have a ltd company in the UK and you get someone to do your payroll processing, that's something different.  But yeah if you can find 20 people to go through your payroll company then at 5% you would earn as much as each of them does.

Because I do stock for years as a self-employed person and I want to understand how Switzerland works. In Italy for example such situation could not arise because one does not have to substantiate the damage, but prove. There are extra departments of the police measure damage. I did ask an laywer in Italy, he told me never every any italian judge would give any order to storm an appartment without any proof slip taken by the Police.  
At the moment I see a huge mess and sloppiness by the Company and Police.

I do know they can be up to 30% more in the French speaking part than in the Italian part.    
Also, I wouldn't be so sure life is less expensive in the French part. I think taxes and insurances of all types are more expensive here than in the German part.   
To the OP, check Comparis for taxes and insurance costs. Then be happy if you get a salary that is 10-15% more. The fact is there are more jobs in general over there as well.

			it may be a little bit more technical. does your system reproduce the invoice? The system does send an invoice to your clients I guess. In what form? For VAT purposes it is stated that the invoice can not be altered etc. A pdf would generally be accepted. There is reform coming up next year for what to keep as evidence for VT purposes.

			Nice question. i wanted to ask same question but, on different sector.   
I've read most of the comment from other member's.   
Well, i donot how thing's work in swiss but, my advice to you since what attracted my attention was the freelance contract.   
Well, i suggest you accept the freelance contract[whether short or long] because it will help you gain more experience in the industry (know better how the agency/freelance stuff operate in swiss)   
As a mother you may not have sufficient time to handle multiple task. so, why collaborating with these two companies on a partime basis. Register on freelance such as odesk,freelance, take few exam's which are related to your area of specialization. Spend few hour's after your normal working period to get yourself use to the freelance site(s)   
Create a compelling profile and start application  to project on this freelance site(s). Always includes your portafolio when sending your job proporsal and the best aspect of this is that you can also include name of the other two companies of which you are collaborating with offline.   
If, you are consistent you can start getting job invitation/interview/proposal for partime or full time  position on the 1st freelance[ ]. It will help reduce the fear of getting unemployment and help you to dedicate more time to your baby as nursing mother when your offline contract get end's.

			A friend did this and it was really simple. The SUVA person came over, met us in a cafe, took the paperwork he had collected away and along came the approval. My friend produced: three quotes, three invoices, several bills from suppliers and most importantly, insurance (Betriebshaftpflichtversicherung). I have read about people finding it difficult to get registered but for my friend, who also does not speak German but had to go through the process in German, it was simple. The other point is to be registered in the Handel Register but when he called them (he does speak French) they said not to register until turnover reached 100k. Similarly with  VAT, they said, register when you turnover is at 100K. Good luck.

			Your best bet is to speak directly with the Bauamt (or whatever the equivalent is in French - the building department of your local community government). Rules and regulations will vary by canton and community. Moreover, how those rules and regs are applied (or ignored) may also vary, even within the same community.    
Other people's experiences, while helpful in pointing out the most likely path you should take, cannot guarantee that you are in compliance within your own community. The local authority is the final arbiter. Go talk to them, bring along a fluent speaker if you are not.   
Yes, navigating one's way through the jungle of permits, regs, unwritten 'rules', neighborhood agreement, selective interpretation, that is needed to build just about anything here can be frustrating. I wish you all the best with your project.

			According to this presentation, a legal entity that does not have a complete board (Verwaltungsrat) does not have the ability to conduct business. There is then a 30 day time period to correct the situation after the resignation appears in the commercial register, granted by the commercial register office. If this time period is not held to, then the court must decide how to proceed. Possible actions include: 
1. Court grants a new time period to comply under the threat of liquidation of the company. 
2. Court appoints a new board member to the board or representative (Sachwalter) to supervise the company. 
3. Court orders the liquidation of the company according to bankruptcy regulations.   
See pp.24-25:       
Please don't misconstrue this reading of a presentation to be legal advice. If you need Swiss legal advice, contact a Swiss attorney.

145	04.12.2006, 21:45	Junior Member	Thanked 9 Times in 5 Posts	Location: St Gallen	"    HI Nicky,    
There are three structures you can take (Not strictly true there are some others but they will not be applying (ie cooperative and partnership) for reasons beyond the scope)   
1, Sole trader 
2. GmbH  equivalent UK Ltd. 
3. AG equivalent UK PLC   
To setup either of the latter two you will need to follow set rules AND have a deposit of multiple thousands of Swiss Francs (or business usable assets to the equivalent value). The minimum figures are 10K for a GmbH and 50K for an AG.   
For a sole trader you will need to find a name for your business that includes your surname and complete the AHV sole trader application form. You may also find it useful to invest the SFr. 150 - 200 to register your business on the trade register.   
And then of course you will need to open a business bank account...   
And that is it. Now I guess you have some questions as it cannot be that easy, right? So fire away...

			My 2p - if you had good scones, clotted cream and jam you'd get a significant proportion of the UK expats regularly. (OK, not Danish - but maybe make it a ""European"" cafe to give more scope; you could even specialise on different days).   
The closest we've found were decent scones, but with apricot jam   and cream cheese  .   
But don't underestimate the costs - for example, dodgyken doesn't seem to include employer contributions in his wages calculation?

			I do believe you do not own the german VAT number from Konstanz...   
The German VAT is slightly different from the Swiss VAT. For the Germans important is where your service has been made. For example, did you visit the customer in Germany ? or even sent him the product from german IP ?, so you have to bill with the German VAT. If you do not sent him the product from Germany, but from Switzerland so 0% VAT Germany and Switzerland.But be warned there are court cases where the Germans demanded 19% of the Swiss company because the customer was visited. I do use the phrase ""Umsatzsteuerpflichtig ist Leistungsempfänger"" on my invoices to Germany. For the CH Accounting they do see the client is not in Switzerland and for the accounting of the client in Germany it is clear that i did work from Switzerland.

			It appears your goal is to comply with income tax law, although you may not be compliant with labor law. Ct. Zurich indicates that taxpayers normally subject to source tax (Quellensteuer) should file a tax return for supplemental income not subject to source tax:   
""12.  What does a supplementary assessment to withholding tax mean? 
Persons who are subject to withholding tax with tax domiciles in Switzerland or in the Canton of Zurich respectively  will  be  subject  to  an  ordinary  tax  assessment  in  respect  of  their  income  not  subject  to taxation  at  source  (e.g.,  income  from  self-employed secondary  occupation,  pensions,  income  from moveable and immovable assets in Switzerland and abroad, support contributions etc.), as well as in respect  of  their  assets.  In  this  supplementary  ordinary  tax  assessment,  the  income  subject  to withholding  tax  will  be  taken  into  account  only  for the  purpose  of  determining  the  rate.  If  necessary, the  person  subject  to  withholding  tax  must  ask  the municipal  tax  office  in  his  place  of  residence  to forward a tax return.""

You've made some good points and I understand what you are saying. However, I don't consider these to be such major issues that customers won't do business with a non-VAT registered Einzelfirma: 
1. If the customer is running supplier invoices through a small-business IT system for payment, there should be a code to indicate that it is not VAT-liable. These will be reported separately by the customer's system when filling out the VAT declaration.  (Of course, it's also possible that the customer is not VAT-liable). 
2. Image problem: Having a commercially-registered company also shows to customers that the business is serious. The Einzelfirma should consider including the chamber of commerce registration number on the sales invoice and on its website, etc. to ensure that customers see this.  
The fact that the Einzelfirma is not VAT-registered can be explicitly stated on the sales invoice: ""(Name of company) is not liable for VAT.""

			I have been looking for info about how much social security costs for self-employed person.  This leads to the official document. Maybe someone needs it as well.          
I am thinking of having my own business, starting with an Einzelfirma.   While researching official answers to various topics and my questions, I thought people might have the same interests.    
I set up a facebook fan page today and will keep sharing information on it. A lot of them will be sourcing from this forum and further verified by myself. Hopefully this would help.          
Oh, feel free to post anything that has official sources and easy to follow (not 100 page document please) on my facebook fan page.

We hope to open several over the next year. My wife is Swiss, but my Australian german is limited but improving. Thankyou for your advice.

190	06.01.2016, 14:22	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Port Elizabeth SA	"    To help you understand how this works, there are at least three types of  Gegengeschäft/ Offset-Geschäft that I am aware of. Only the last one, I  think, would be of interest to you:   
1) Investment: The contractor agrees to invest in the buyer's country.  An example of this occurred when Saab sold the Gripen fighter jet to  Hungary it agreed to invest in Hungary. It then had a related-company  build a factory there.    
2) Components: The contractor agrees to buy components from suppliers in  the buying country. An example of this was when Saab agreed to buy  components from Swiss manufacturers for the Gripen as part of the deal  to get the Swiss military to buy the Gripen. (A referendum subsequently  rejected the financing for the Gripen project). 
- Under Components would also be design and other intellectual work performed in the buying country.   
3) Promotion: The contractor agrees to promote products from the buying  country in the contractor's country and, in some cases, may even take  (partial) payment for the project in goods (counter-trade).      
You would want to identify these ""Promotion"" opportunities at your end. 		   
Also, there might be better prospects for Gegengeschäft in larger countries supplying projects to SA, such as Germany, France, Italy and UK (and Sweden), than Switzerland.

			Input VAT can normally be deducted from output VAT in Switzerland. There are exceptions for ""Eigenverbrauch"" (own consumption).   
At such time that your revenues reach CHF 100'000, you will need to register your company with the commercial register. The same threshold applies to  charging output VAT to your customers (which allows you also to deduct input VAT).

			As a previously UK based copywriter and content writer (now doing something completely different here in Zurich) I can tell you that there are plenty of jobs in the UK for writers. There is too much demand and too little a supply.   
Good Freelancers in the UK are constantly busy, too.   
It took my agency a year to find the two writers we wanted, they were so thin on the ground.   
BUT! I can't see why you are not able to use the power of the net to set up your business from any country you choose, and get paying gigs in other countries. So if you really want to live in CH, you should be able to get work from the UK no problem.

			Really, think about it.  The Swiss aren't going to let non-EU people get around the permit quota that way, it would be far too easy.   
As a student you're allowed to work a maximum of 15 hours per week when employed by someone else.  Self-employment isn't permitted for students.  After all, you're here to study, not work.

			I'm a yoga fan, but I found Pilates to be far more useful post-pregnancy, helping to deal with a whole raft of minor niggles exacerbated by having a new baby etc.  It's also great for strengthening the core, and for re-building strength.  It was also an oasis of much needed calm when I couldn't think about anything else except how/when to breathe etc.   So, if you want my two penn'orth, I'd go for an introduction to Pilates, every time.  It needn't be with all the equipment either - a mat, a towel and maybe a resistance band.  My UK physio used to run the course I attended and both she and it were fabulous.

			I'll be curious to know how much of marketing has been done to sample the market   
Place your idea on a Business Model Canvas with Switzerland as your environment.  
Product is Mobile app for Sports networking: have you done a pilot test and controlled?   
to understand the swiss market you will need to sample it,  segment your consumers, target those whom you think are potential customers, filter down until you know your buying centres.    
I also agree with other opinions about partnering with a local entrepreneur or firms in such fields - experience is the best teacher.   
Lots of marketing research and sampling to be done. Wish you well

			I am actually in very similar situation to OP. 
I've spoke to SVA (people taking AHV) and while they might send a bill every 3 months you can 'balance' it with your actual income... so if your 'side' income is 0 there there are 0 AHv contributions to pay in the end. 
In terms of taxes, you will have to pay normal income tax from your einzelfirma that you will have to report in the tax form at the end of a year.

			Its not clear from your post how much planning you have done. Have you got a marketing or business plan ? If not , why not ? To put your house on the line is not something to do lightly, even if a bank will lend.   
Planning is cheap if you do it yourself-  and there is plenty of help out there - to have the rug pulled from under you at a later stage because you didnt have an appropriate trading or hygiene permit for food is not...   
Bank will lend against collateral (usually a fraction of its value to ensure they are covered), but I wouldn't risk my house unless the risks were minimal, and there was no other way.   
If you can raise a proportion of the capital yourself, you may be able to get an unsecured loan, which may be slightly more expensive, but is safer.   
Talk to several banks, and go armed with your business plan and see what their reaction is. Talk to some chamber of commerce business advisors (Links can be found on the gruenden.ch website).    
I may be telling you things you already know, but the wide range of figures you quote makes me wonder if your planning is as refined as it could be...

			Well, I am doing a bit of budgeting and well, got a couple of questions that I guess don't just interest me, but probably are relevant to most small business owners and self-employed: 
- how much do you pay your book-keeper an hour? 
- how many hours do you budget per year? How much more per employee? 
- what do you let him do, what do you do on your own? I got some ""package"" offers and half the included services seem rather trivial...

If you don't have someone (or can pay someone) to implement and maintain a system for you, you'll need to look for subscription-based options. Expect to pay about $300/year on the cheap end for something like this.   
If you'll be a one-person company and aren't providing professional-level stuff like online class notes and report cards, grab something simple like a free account with   . Spreadsheets sound like a good idea at first, until you find yourself in spreadsheet hell. A mess of 100-column worksheets, vlookups all over the place, and no data validation or reporting.

To mitigate risk IMO a better location to would be the smaller commuter hubs, Arau, Winterthur, Wohlen, Schaffhausen, Baden even Bremgarten. Then if a successful brand can be established, muscle into Zurich, Luczern, Lausanne or Genf (planpalais would be a great spot) and then into the mountain vilages.

			Heh - yeah, I'll agree if you invest in Oz right now, you'll be hitting top of the market likely in Sydney and probably likely in Melbourne. I'd personally wait for things to cool down a bit.    
My perspective comes from studying the market for the past several years, on nearly a daily basis.    
Immigration is going backwards in most places (except VIC) and will probably continue that trend over the next year.    
Where to park your money? Honestly, there's not that many safe havens at the moment. (and I play many markets - stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies).   
The best investment is always something you love - buy something that you love and will treasure for a while. Earning in CHF and keeping it in cash over the next 6 - 12 months is not the end of the world either.

DHL and other depots all have their delivery addresses 30min outside Zürich which i not practical + they are not so flexible as a privat person with a delivery address business.

			Adding to grumpygrapefruit's idea, if you find a licensed kitchen (restaurant, b&b, hotel, etc) who is willing to rent their kitchen space for a set amount of time - when they are closed for example, so you don't step on each other's toes - then you might be in business. It works in the States, and getting the food handling license that way was easy peasy. Of course, what works in one place might not work in another, and all that...

Beyond that it is a bit of a headache of how to get a certified translation since while some cantons have actual certified translators (traducteur juré in the Romandie), other cantons allow their public notaries to certify a translation as correct, while others had (or used to have) court translators.   
I've been working on getting the translation requirement waived for English language documents, and the Federal Supreme Court seems to follow my reasoning (at least to the extent that an English language arbitral award is enforced in Switzerland;  )...   
... but if you do not fancy going up all the way to the Federal Supreme Court I would simply call the court and ask them what type of translation they require (and whether they can suggest any translators).

II. Assets 
1. In general 
1 When first recorded, assets must be valued no higher than their acquisition or manufacturing costs. 
2 In  any subsequent valuation, assets must not be valued higher than their  acquisition or manufacturing costs. Provisions on individual types of  assets are reserved. 
3 Loss in value  due to usage or age must be taken into account through depreciation,  while other losses in value must be taken into account through valuation  adjustments. Depreciation and valuation adjustments must be applied in  accordance with generally recognised commercial principles. They must be  deducted directly or indirectly from the relevant assets and charged to  the profit and loss account and may not be shown under liabilities.

III. Liabilities 
1 Liabilities must be entered at their nominal value. 
2 If  past events lead to the expectation of a cash outflow in future  financial years, the provisions probably required must be made and  charged to the profit and loss account.

			Hi All,   
I am strongly considering doing some volunteer work with a view to turning it into a commercial venture.   
My thoughts are to deliver training in English in things like Microsoft Excel and SQL. The course would be aimed at older school goers with the benefits being two fold:   
1. Learning the tools 
2. Learning Business English (with the content having this aspect specifically in mind)   
How would I go about starting this off on a volunteer basis? I have been considering contacting local schools etc. but not sure of the reaction I would get or if it would even be permissible.

			If the current owners are running the business then it's possible the business will not continue to do so well when they leave. Look at gross profits, then deduct any salary that needs to be paid to employ someone to run the business then multiply x 4. If the business has any assets then do not pay any extra for them, their value is accounted for in the profits they produce.

			Hi Maire,   
I'm sorted and home about six weeks now. I signed a Swiss contract with Swiss conditions (but wages deducted according a cost of living index and an exchange rate metric), and I'm working from home. My accountant at home registered the firm as an employer in Ireland, and will do a salary payment service for the firm on my behalf each month. It charges for the below (which my company pays for):   
Based on a monthly pay run, the service would be 600 plus VAT per annum, which includes: 
(a)    Registering employer for PAYE/PRSI in Ireland 
(b)   Registering me as an employee of employer with Revenue 
(c)    Monthly payroll processing 
(d)   Annual P.35 return 
After 1 year, the fee would reduce to 400 plus VAT per annum.   
This is what we worked out. Was it the right decision? I don't know. If you need any more particulars, let me know.

			Some information about this:    
I came across it as I'm currently in France and wanted to use a service based in the US. Because of the EU VAT rules, they were unable to supply- I'll have to wait until I get home.   
What I've been unable to find out is whether Switzerland has signed up to these rules. Switzerland has signed up to other VAT rules.

			I remember reading an article about the difficulties experienced by some young Swiss fellows who ran a food cart. They had to overcome some hurdles that I would never have expected. For example, they had a really hard time getting permisison to set up in the parking lot of a diy / home supplies store located in the suburbs. The owners were concerned that there would be too much of a ""food"" smell in the vicinity of the cart.

			Firstly, you're posting in the wrong place; seeing it in the   forum gave me the impression that you were hiring for your own business. Look at the   forum.   
Secondly, keep an eye on the   forum as they occasionally post developer jobs.   
As to roles, you might search for 'graduate' positions, as these would specifically seek developers with little or no experience, but with the relevant pieces of paper. TBH, I've seen plenty of such roles being advertised and start-ups, in particular, will often favour hiring graduates/juniors to keep the burn rate down.

Long story short: If you have only one customer and spend more than half of a financial year in ONE other country... well, then losing your Swiss permit is the smaller issue you have: most likely does this country regardless of which one it is want you to pay tax there.

			Hello. Just read all replies to your post ... Yes, I also think that most muslim women (from other countries) import their clothes from their home countries. However, there is a growing number of converted European women and really, it is not easy (nor affordable in most cases) to get beautiful muslim clothes in Switzerland. Having them shipped from France or UK is often expensive and a real hassle if you have to return items. If you get the type of clothes right (good quality and maybe not too specific for a particular muslim country), then yes, there is a market! I know quite a few women who are looking for everyday clothes that fit all muslim requirements but that can also be worn here and somehow not stand out all the time. Wide jeans, long tunics etc. Not all in black neither. ;-)

The example given in the article was Uber. That really made me shake my head, because so much of what made Silicon Valley has been lost to that sort of get-rich-quick scheme and I think it's killing real technological innovation in the greater San Fran area. When your best-and-brightest kids are just playing whack-a-mole-app-building it's hard to see how that's significantly bettering society.     
The Swiss, on the other hand, are trying to develop technology that's hard to copy. That's a much better long-term strategy.  Real research is often mind-bogglingly hard and drudgerous. The low-hanging fruit is gone, so it's this Swiss path or the path of do-work projects to impress the FIRE industry (Finance-Insurance-Real-Estate).

IFJ will charge 8% VAT on top, one can of course claim it back if the new GmbH also registers for VAT.   
PostFinance charges CHF 145 for the capital payment account, this basically cancels out with the discount at IFJ. It is still a decent deal though.      I experienced some minor glitches and signs of incompetence with IFJ, apparently due to their IT systems being updated at the time. Card payment did not work at all. The system lost track of two of the many documents I had sent, causing a delay of a few days. I also got a few rather contradictory automated e-mails from the likely confused system undergoing an update. The PostFinance ""cash back"" then took over three months (that seems to be how long a software update takes at IFJ).   
If you have no special needs, I would still recommend them. Good value and the service does work. They also worked hard to get around the (arguably unexpected) mess.   
IFJ will proceed to spam the new company with all sorts of moderately useful (or useless) offers. Delivered via a mailing list I could not unsubscribe from despite repeated attempts over a period of several months. That too was caused by the unfortunate software update, I was told.   
Unless they decide to mess with their systems again, I can imagine it might be a pleasant experience to work with IFJ.

			Hi MaybeeSkint 
  First of all, if your tentative payments exceed the definite contributions due, the cantonal compensation office, which is responsible for your AVS encashment, will refund the difference. As you pointed out correctly, the definite payment is calculated from your taxable income.  
  In any case, its advisable to report significant changes in expected income. The compensation office will then adjust the bills for your AVS contributions. So, you wont need to pay contribution payments for income that you are not making. 
  Nice to know for very small scale businesses, but not sure if it applies to you: If you are employed and run a self-employed business on the side, you dont have to pay for social security, as long as you dont make more income than CHF 2300 p.a.  
  Hope that helps. 
  Best regards, 
  Tobiash

			Hello Englishforum,   
I would really like your input on a business idea I'm working on.    
I'm in the process of setting up an online marketplace for used furniture in Switzerland, that includes delivery and is in a number of languages (English, Spanish, Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, German, French). I'm new to Switzerland and I found it really frustrating trying to buy second hand furniture - everything was in German and I had to organize the transport!    
I've put together a survey   and I would be very grateful if you could fill it. It asks about your experience with buying/selling furniture.    
If you have any other ideas/feedback (or want to get involved), please respond to this post.

But how to proceed depends heavily on if the debt collector knocking on your door is just a from a private debt collection agency or an official from the Office de Pursuit/Betreibungsamt. The later can seize your assets and freeze your accounts if you do not take the appropriate next steps.

			Hello, I have given it a try couple of times and it will all depend where your virtual assistant is located. Many companies are driven out of India and I have found that the time difference can play in both ways (positive and negative). It depends how fast you need things done and most importantly the quality of it. Research is not simply using Google. Did you know that Google only covers 6% of the internet.    
It will come down to what type of research you need, language support etc. I manage a global group of intelligence analystsfor a large US financial institution and research is very important in my work. It is a science rather than push the search button on google...One has to know where to find the information...   
On another note my wife who currently does not work has much corporate experience in the US. She also speaks 5 languages including German. Worked in banking and retail...If interested please PM me. 
Thanks, 
Bo

			That 30% p.a. is BS indeed.    
Firstly it depends on a persons marginal tax rate, which is less in many cases. Secondly it's only deferred, so even though you pay less the net effect is less than marginal tax rate. And thirdly, it's not repeating so ""annually"" is not appropriate. Though you get the once-off tax deferment every year, albeit on different income.

301	01.05.2015, 04:52	Junior Member	Thanked 31 Times in 13 Posts	Location: Zurich	"      Okay.    
Thank you, NotAllThere for clarifying my position. And, Thank you, many others who offered helpful advices.    
Yes, I had no idea 1) there is no such thing as ""Master's level  counselors"" in CH (or other EU nations for that matter), which explains  why I thought describing myself as a ""Master's level counselor"" would  suffice in terms of clarifying what I do, and 2) I took Slammer's  question and comments about what I do as a ""Biblical"" counselor somewhat  condescending and offensive, which is why I did not bother to go deeply  into what my training and work in Biblical Counseling entails.   
If my first response came off arrogant, I apologize, Slammer. I was  wrong to assume that my explanation would be enough to clarify things  for others.    
Meanwhile, I am glad to learn that I cannot assume others will  understand what I mean as long as we are speaking the same language when  communicating with people from diverse cultures.     
So, back to the point...   
Based on what I am hearing on this forum, I think what I do in the U.S.  would be equivalent to the job of ""psychologists"" in CH. In the U.S.,  ""psychologists"" are those who have completed doctoral training. They're  able to do evaluation and give formal diagnosis. ""Master's level  counselors"" provide counseling services, listen to people, ask  questions, come up with treatment plans, implement interventions...  basically, helping people to get through their ongoing problems. While  ""social workers"" could certainly do what we do, they cover a lot more  than ""counselors"" as they also work with bureaucratic side of helping  others as well.    
The training I received meets all the qualification (at least in the  state of Pennsylvania, as state requirements may vary across the country  in the U.S.) to be licensed and provide services (what you would call  psychotherapy) at a professional level in the U.S. Only difference I  have is that I am also trained in theology, biblical interpretation of  human problems, and is able to approach things from spiritual/Christian  perspective.    
I have worked in both secular and Christian settings. In the secular  setting, I worked for a social service agency and provided therapeutic  services for children with behavioral problems at homes and schools  (which involves, assessments, treatment planning, developing  interventions, implementing interventions, consultations with  parents/teachers, etc). It did not involve anything Christian, but my  training still qualified me to understand people's problems and help  them. When I am working for a Christian organization, people obviously  come seeking help specifically from Christian perspective. The problems  they deal with is much the same as non-Christians, but Christianity is  something very important in defining their identify and life, so they  want their helpers to share that with them. My clients could be  children, family, adults, and couples, and I do more of the traditional  in-office sessions with them once a week.    
Like NotAllThere explained, Biblical Counseling is not bible bashing or  anything mystical. It's an understanding of human problems from biblical  perspective and helping others to walk through their life, embodying  Christ-like love. It also does not necessarily deny the benefits of  other ways of helping people. There are biblical counselors with PhD's  from secular universities that are licensed as ""psychologists"" and  medical doctors by training who provides psychiatric services. And,  biblical counselors CAN help non-Christians because, like NotAllThere  also explained, their goal is not evangelism, but helping those who are  hurting.    
I hope my effort to clarify things with my limited words don't upset anyone or make things even more confusing for others.    
On the other note...,  
I do understand the language would be a issue in terms of seeking an  employment from CH schools/organizations. I would not want to provide  any services without being proficient in my client's spoken language.  So, that is not the route I will be exploring. I am more interested in  providing psychotherapy to the expats who needs the service in English,  either within an organization that is specialized in English population  or go solo as a private practice. And, I am learning that 1) I need to  have a work permit, 2) I need to have my qualification verified, 3)  getting employed as a psychologist is extremely hard even for Swiss, and  4) being self-employed as a foreigner is even harder.    
Still, it doesn't hurt to explore my options and possibilities before  settling down as an unemployable... right? So, I really really  appreciate all the help you are providing on this matter. Thank you,  Thank you, Thank you.

			The Swiss Post has a wide range of logistic services if you wish to outsource this part of the business. You can get in touch with them here:    
I assume however that the services will be quite pricey but it could still make sense if you sell high margin products.    
Swiss post is a potential solution if you'd like to sell in Switzerland only. If you want to sell in the EU, I recommend to have a look at the specific offer created by DHL Global Mail for Swiss based companies.

			Hi, I've started an online business recently and can share some basic info.   
The place you go for registration is your canton's Handelregister.   
There are two types of companies, broadly - Personengesellschaft like sole trader or simple partnership, where the owners are liable with their personal assets, or Corporations such as Gmbh or AG where the owners are liable only up to the limit of the company capital.   
You can register as a sole trader (Einzelfirma) in which case you're personally liable for everything and your company tax return is part of your personal tax return. A Gmbh (a limited company) will have a potentially higher cost since you need to show CHF 20,000 as capital.   
In Zurich the cost for registering a Kollektivgesellschaft (simple partnership, as we're two partners) was CHF250. That was pretty much everything.    
Once you're a registered company, you need to decide whether you need to register for VAT (MwSt). If you're importing or exporting stuff you may find it very necessary or helpful.    
You'll probably need a bank account but that's very easy to get in a country built for banking   we're at Postfinance who are very start up friendly.    
Then if you need a payment gateway for your website (if you're actually selling stuff online) then use Paypal or Stripe as they're very reliable and simple to set up. Work with your website developer to set it up.   
This are a few basic steps, have a look at gruenden.ch for plenty of start up info and tips.    
I am sure it sounds like a mountain of stuff to tick off, but don't despair, simply deal with them one by one.   
Good luck!

			Hi, I've just opened an online business recently and I can share the information that I came across in the process.   
A sole trader (Einzelfirma) will do, no need for a Gmbh (ltd.) or anything else. 
In general, you don't have to register as a VAT payer up to a certain turnover threshold (although you can request to register), but you will need to register as a VAT payer if you're importing goods.   
In order to keep the VAT calculation and payment as simple as possible, you can chose to register for Saldosteuersatz, but that means you won't be able to deduct the import VAT, you'll just pay a small % on your turnover. But it's worth looking into this.   
VAT is either 8% (standard rate) or 2.5% (reduced rate) - that's valid for both import VAT or sales VAT.   
The Zoll is relatively straightforward - you pay three things on general: 1) import VAT at whatever applicable rate per article 2) import tax applicable for each article and country of origin 3) the custom clearance service - your courier will charge you for that. As long as the stuff from China comes with supplier invoices that show clearly what sort of products you're importing and you have a VAT number, it's not a big complication.

			Hi all,   
We're currently living in Switzerland, and we're thinking about maybe exploring the possibility of buying a couple of apartments in Spain and renting them out. We'd like to know the tax implications of doing this. Therefore, we'd really appreciate if somebody who has more experience about this shed some lights about the following questions:   
* If we buy two apartments out of Switzerland, I understand we'd need to count them for paying wealth tax in Switzerland. Would we be charged also the taxes for imputed rent that apartments in Switzerland have? 
* We were also thinking about the possibility of maybe establishing a firm in Spain, and rent the appatments through it. If me and my wife were the owners of this firm, how would taxes work for us, here in Switzerland?   
Thanks for your help!

Does anyone in the forum have experience in trying to obtain tax réductions for the implementation of a new small/medium size Gmbh in a Canton (or transfering a Gmbh into a new Canton to maximize growth.     
Canton Vaud requires a letter explaining the economic impact to the Canton as well as a business plan, which seems sensible.     
Any tips anyone can offer ?  If it even possible for a 1-3 Million CHF service company to get some tax breaks or is it just for the big corporations ?     
Many thanks for all insights

			Greetings,      
The reduction of the Corporate tax in Vaud is part of a Federal bill reengineering the Swiss Corporate Tax System.  I have seen 2019 as the earliest that would come to force and did not hear about transitory steps in between.     
According the the Vaux Canton website, any size corporation is allowed to ask for a tax reduction or exemption.  The criterias is how much yo will benefit the economic development in the Canton, employment...etc..     
To make the demand, you need to provide a formal request letter as well as a comprehensive business plan supporting your demand.     
Hope it helps.

Also, in order for there to be an issue, his wife would first have to mess up in a way that a) causes a damage which b) constitutes a recoverable claim, then someone would have to sue, win the trial and only then there can be a true liability problem affecting ones assets.   
 While the statements who advocate opting for a GmbH/AG are in principle right when liability protection is concerned (there is such thing like piercing of the corporate veil in Swiss law), they are not very helpful in the case at hand, are based on a fragmentary understanding of Swiss law and make it appear like it was a totally unreasonable choice to opt for a sole proprietorship, which it is not.  
There are over 300'000 sole propriertorships in Switzerland (AG 100k, GmbH 75k), it is a well established and totally fine way of doing business for a lot of cases. I don't feel like trying to scare people is the best way to help them..

I thought Swiss Banks had so much cash at the moment and also with strong CHF-EUR conversion, they could see this opportunity....   
and yup, totally right about this being a small operation, tiny for most standards, but then again, someone has to start somewhere. The places we are seeing offer great returns for rental income.

			Hi, I visited RAV and I kind of felt like in my own country   they said it is not them deciding, they gave me a phone number to some Berfusinformationszentrum where a nice lady told me I should call RAV   anyway, she did that for me (I think due to the fact that my german is quite bad). She said that if one spouse creates a company and does not employ the other one, the other one can get the unemployment benefits (they will not be affected).    
Thanks for all the inputs!

But if you do enough business with these guys they will tell you how it works. No one wants their name on 500 companies. So they use some ones ID who wont mind so much      
But thats just for opening the company, for privacy reasons. Its called a nominee.    
Yes, it can be administered from Geneva and that will be listed as a company expense. As long as you only have expenses in CH and no business here it wont matter a lick. Most of our stuff shares 1 of 3 addresses in CH. You can use your home address if need be.    
If you own an offshore company then you probably wont tell everyone about it if youre living in CH. You are supposed to list it as an asset but most people dont. Many treuhanders in CH have Panamanian companies for this reason. If they do business for some one out of the country the client pays into this account rather than their Shaan/Zug account. Minimizes their taxs and keeps their privacy.    
Cyprus would also be fine. Typically easier and faster for banking reasons, to set up. If youre not doing business in CH then you dont have to worry about taxation agreements.

			Hello,   
I'd like to hear from people who own/work for a startup in the Zurich  area. In particular, I'd like to know what are the common contracts  that employees are offered to motivate and compensate them for the usual cut in salary compared to established companies.    
I don't really know anything about the subject so I can use any help to start  understanding the differences between shares/stock options/virtual  options etc... 
What are the advantages/disadvantages of these different kinds of benefits  from the employee's point of view (also wrt taxation)?   
Also, what's usual in terms of  vesting period and other restrictions meant to incentivate the employees  to stay longer?    
Thanks

In regards to a fax machine: I've sent only 1 fax message in the past three years. People are usually happy with a scanned document via e-mail.

If you're going to sell simple (customizable) products, then WP+WC is a green light for you. Otherwise go with Magento, since it's really a good powered e-commerce oriented CMS.

			Hi, all,   
Great forum. I learned a lot and I'm still learning.    
Here's my question: when exactly is the permit considered ready so that I can open the GmbH. The thread below says that folks can start working for an employer as soon as they register at the Gemeinde. Is the same valid for a GmbH? Can I initiate a process to open it as soon as I register or do I have to wait for the Bewillingung papers to arrive? How long does it take for the Bewillingung to arrive?       
Thanks, 
klaus

As I said in the other post, take time to study those fundings who made it and apply what is best to your case.

			As a self-employed you can write a letter in advance asking for a delay and if they accept they will tell you that the deadline is by the end of the current year.   
Bookkeeping for us self-employed is very simple. You can still have someone do it for you (and my advice is to do so for the first year at least).   
Basically keep track of your work related expenses, car repair, mileage for work purposes (in km not miles!!), equipment, paid services (mobile, etc), etc.  
No gas expenses because they are considered in your mileage.  
If you have an office or home office then add the rent too.   
Then make a simple prospect with your total gross income and subtract each voice in your expenses calculating the total. You will include it and use it in the tax forms they will send you each year to fill out.   
Of course there are many other things to consider and I would suggest getting help at first so you don't leave anything out and learn how it's done.

			Yes, taking a sabbatical year is not to be seen as a bad thing. Even in the business world it's being talked about and considered since our society pushes us to live for our job while we think we are working in order to live.    
I've chosen a freelance path to live more freely and to choose when, how and where to work. It might not be your case, yet time off will surely help you.

			Hi,   
I am doing some preliminary research on a venture I want to start and need your help!   
Much like several people on the forum I see , I see a gap to setup childcare in my home village. Mine being cham, kanton of Zug. 
When I was in the UK I had a childcare business offering session based childcare.this was made up of morning care 9-12 catering for 3 children. Parents did not stay.   
I want to emulate this here in my apartment.   
From what I have read so far there is a fair amount of red tape to contemplate with.   
I am a trained occupational therapist (degree level) and hold the UK beech qualification for childcare.   
I do not speak german and would be only catering for English speaking people(there is a huge demand for this)   
My questions are: 
1) are my qualifications transferable. E.g instead of completing a german equivalent? 
2) specific to cham. I see Zug offer stages utter roles for the canton with the exception of cham. Why? How can I find the cham equivalant / body who I'd need a license from?   
Thanks

			It is growing though it doesn't even compare to US crowdfunding. 
Though I don't consider myself a crowdfunding specialist I was inquired a couple of times about expenses related to creating a crowdfunding portal. Which is not your case anyway.    
I believe it's hard but you can still try applying to one of those portals already linked by others here and you might find the right people interested in your project whatever it is.  
Art I would guess by looking at your nick but I might be mistaken.    
Just take what you like from some of my guidelines here: 
- How you present your project is key, put  , samples, sketches, maybe a good quality video to show you have a solid idea that will become a reality and earn your funders' trust. The more professional the better!   
- Write it in   and possibly French too. English is not enough for Switzerland since you are also looking for quantity in a mostly German speaking country   
- Consider giving some gadgets,   or credits for different ranges in donations.   
- In your funding goal consider the   for giving away those gadgets, gifts, etc to your investors.   
- Mention what you would add to your project in case of going  !! Yes, if you do that people will consider going beyond your goal without the thought that you will simply keep the extra money in your pocket.    
- Study projects that went overfunding and see how they presented their ideas, how they divided donation ranges compared to the goal and what they gave as gifts to their donors.   
- Last but not least,  , and if you are happy of the results go a little bit beyond that!!   
Hope it helps and give it a try! I hope you will succeed in your dreams!!

So if the lease company gets a discount from the car manufacturer, then as long as they show the discounted price on the lease paperwork, your BIK value is lower.   
I'm not sure how that works if the company buys a used vehicle.  But for new vehicles, it is definitely actual price, not list price.

			Thank you very much for that estimation, Phil_MCR. Though Id say its reasonable and I am in principle ready to pay that I also know myself and am aware if finally is hard for me to commit to that kind of investments. But thats another story.   
Also, thats a minimum and I guess there is by no means a warranty that I will find a satisfactory solution or one thats finally totally compliant with regulations (even if I and the professionals that advise me think so). Anyhow, I guess I assume (or at least I should) all that.

			Hi everyone, it's good to be back!    
I did a search and found some useful information, so I'd just like to clarify my situation.   
I am a UK citizen living in the UK right now. I have been working as a full time translator since August this year (and part-time since 2011). I complete self-assessment forms for my earnings.   
From the summer of 2015, I intend to move back to Zurich (or Winterthur) for perhaps 1 year (maybe longer, maybe shorter) - where I spent my year abroad, and I also intend to keep working as a freelancer over there. In fact, apart from tax issues, my work will largely be unaffected by the move.   
Now, please confirm:   
- I should apply for a B permit? 
- How easy is it to prove income/employment as a relatively new full-time freelancer? 
- How about tax? Do I pay both UK and Swiss income tax?! 
- Any additional experiences/insights would be appreciated   
Best regards!

to be perfectly honest, after selling the car at a reasonable residual value, it's all coming to a very low positive zero (couple of thousands plus) with these values, including about 60 customers in 3 yrs, which might not be worth my while. cranking up the utilization to 75% gives a massive 45k plus on the car, but I probably won't be getting that much anyway.   
I am in the process of getting real, not estimated prices for everything and then we have to see how to go further.   
I think I'll have to dig deeper as it's not that shiny as I looked previously.   "	earned the respect of many	Join Date: Feb 2012	Groaned at 17 Times in 14 Posts	Hotel California [Feasibility of renting out a camper van]	"""user137"	Posts: 389	2,275	21	Business & entrepreneur

			I did not see yet where you will perform your activities. Will you visit CH to work or will the work be done from your home country Spain?    
There are considerable costs involved having entities and trusted directors. For a contractor that makes no sense unless you are an accountant yourself and have a trusted family member who is also an accountant in CH...

			More on company cars...   
From another forum post ( ) I understand that:     
So lets assume a 50,000 CHF car, and 35% marginal tax rate. That works out at 0.8/100*12*50000*0.35 = 1680 CHF per annum of additional tax.   
I think that this classifies as a pretty cool thing to do with your GmbH - surely the depreciation and running costs are higher than 1680/(1-0.35) = 2584 CHF/annum which is the pre-tax equivalent break-even point? Just the annual depreciation would surely be more than this.   
Although for second hand cars this is definately not cool, as I understand that the new (list) price counts and not the market value.

			Globally, tech-recruiting is fundamentally  , - in my opinion - especially in Switzerland.   
Does anybody has experience how hard it is to start an ""Einzelfirma"" that does employment services  (""Personalvermittlung"")? There are   that one has to obey, if one wants to do employment services.   
In any case, do you guys think that the idea is valuable to the tech-market in Switzerland? (If you google ""tech recruiting switzerland"", you'll find generic agencies that are doing a thousand things and one of them is tech-recruiting.)

			You can issue a Betreib the first day after payment is due, there is no waiting period or final demand, although it is customary to issue a ""reminder"", it's not legally necessary.   
As you mention the amount is small, your debtor knows this too and is probably going to call your bluff.    
So if you issue the threat i should go ahead with it or just write it of and have done with it. A typical ""shit or get of the pot"" situation !

My first point was that at least in downtown Italian cities' infrastructure is not that bad, anyway better than the Swiss (remember the Funicolare being closed for more than 2 years?), and especially Milan is far better than Lugano on that point (btw. also far better than Zurich, imho, which has been too scrooge for an underground). 
The minor one is that many Italians are un po' viziati i.e. they got used to a high standard, but they complain all the time about taxes, their government, bad infrastructure and that stuff and everything, day and night, forgetting that a huge portion among them at least own their appartment they are living in. The biggest part of the Swiss don't. 
N.B. Of course I'm aware of the fact that many Italians going through the economic crisis are in a real need and that Berlusconi's remark back then about restaurants being full is rather cynical, however don't think that all the Swiss are rich and that Switzerland is far better off in all fields.

			Using a multiple of profits is one of many ways for calculating the price for selling your business. This may or may not be appropriate for your type of business, depending on whether the buyer will be able to generate similar profits going forward: Say you are a well-versed craftsman and you clients come to you because of your skills - rather unlikely that a less capable buyer will be able to keep your clientele and thus, your profits. However, if you have created a business which thrives on its location, but not necessarily your personal skills it will be easier to demand a higher multiple of profits.    
You have not yet indicated which area your business is operating in, which will determine possible channels for selling your business.

			Just as a side note: 
Warrants and options are taxable when sold or exercised, whichever applies. But that's just for completeness' sake as you talk about stock, not warrants.   
Answers to your questions are at the bottom. First some info so you get a grasp of the whole issue:   
You'll probably need, but definitely want, to have a Wertschriftendepot  to facilitate things. A Wertschriftendepot (""Depot"") is similar to your ordinary bank  account(""account""). An account gets money booked into, a Depot gets  securities (including your employee stock) booked into.   
A Depot often costs some three-digit amount each year using any ""standard"" bank (e.g. Kantonalbank  of your choice, UBS, Credit Suisse, etc), I would strongly recommend for you to keep an eye on those costs and go with what cost least. Swissquote or Die Post would probably be a good choice. Whatever your choice you will want to go price  shopping and compare with swiss discount brokers (-> google) as the cost add up over the years, as will transferring your stock from A to B if you happen to change your mind.   
Generally speaking, employee stock is taxed when issued (i.e. booked into your Depot). The positive difference between its value and what you pay is the base for the taxable income (subject to restriction rebate, see below), which AHV and Pensionskasse also is to be paid for.   
So an important factor is the mechanism used to value your stock. For quoted stock its official quote is its value, but for non-quoted stock  things quickly get difficult and obscure. In the latter case you  definitely want and need professional advice. Personally, I would ask  the Steueramt on whom to contact - their mentionings probably won't be  cheap but in all likelyhood reliable (which is what you need most) as they have no interest in this issue and are required by law to help you. I only have experience with quoted employee stock.    
If the compensation comes with a vesting period (e.g. the contract is signed today but you only receive stock at some future date if certain goal(s) are reached by [possibly some other] given date) then that stock is taxable upon vesting, i.e. again basically when transfer into your Depot happens.   
Employee stock can be restricted or unrestricted. Unrestricted stock is fully taxed when you receive/buy it. Restricted stock is only partially taxable, subject to duration of restriction duration. As a rough guide the rebate on taxable income is around 5% per restriction year: 5,6% for one year restriction up to 44% for 10 years of restriction, which is the maximum.   
Your question a) 
 A ""Depotauszug"" (ordered by you from the institute you decide to have your  Depot at) states the securities in your Depot and is used in your Steuererklärung (tax declaration) to determine this part of your taxable wealth. This is akin to the ""Kontoauszug"" which states the final amount in yoru account, which in turn also counts towards your taxable wealth. Additonally your employer must provide a ""Bescheidigung"" stating how much stock you received during the year. To that end your ordinary ""Lohnausweis"" may just carry a remark saying that you received stock (or not), and some supplementary form may state the details (amount, price paid, value, duration of restriction, etc). Your Depotauszug probably should also show when restrictions end.   
b) answered above   
c) Only vested and unrestricted stock can be sold. This can happen in any way buyer and seller happen to agree upon. Usually it's done using some exchange, but with unlisted stock you may agree with your neighbor on some price and have the stock transferred to him and he simultaneously transfers the cash to you.   
b and c) Unless your stock is exchange listed you'll want to be able to sell your stock back to your employer. To that end you'll want to know BEFOREHAND how the price is computed, e.g. by some predetermined and fixed formula that can only be changed with your consent. This implies that you need to be informed periodically about all parameters used in that formula...revenue, cash flow, net income, etc. This will also help you determine if it's time to look for a new job because your employer is going down the drains.   
Additionally, you may want this formula (less some rebate) have define the price you pay for the stock issued to you (unless you pay little to nothing of course).   
Your Depot and your standard bank account can be with different institutions, the choice is completely up to you.

			Hey everyone!   
I've studied in Lausanne for 5 years, but then moved to another country. Now I am developing a small b2b website that connects customers to companies in the country where I live. After doing some research I found out that this kind of service could be useful in Switzerland also.   
My question is - is it possible to hold operations with Swiss SMB companies and accept their online payments without opening any kind of a company representation in the country?    
I am neither Swiss nor a resident.

Ah, NotAllThere - we both posted at the same time.   
I'm really happy that you correctly understood my circumstances.    
It's great to hear that you also believe that there is no requirement for 3 customers in this situation.   
Regarding your suggestion for an alternative; it is something I am looking into, and I intend to use it as a back-up plan. The reason this is only plan B is that the customer and I have made quite an unusual contract (in terms of payment structure) and it would be near impossible to set it up through an agency. The ""unusualness"" (sic) is greatly in my favour.

			Hi everyone,   
I know there have been dozens of threads about this. I read many of them and was still confused about my particular case, so I contacted cantonal officials in Vaud for clarity and wanted to share their response for anyone who, like me, might be overwhelmed by all of the information available:       
(Underlining theirs). To be even more specific, I'm here on a family reunification B visa from a non-EU country and am allowed to pursue one form of self-employment without first requesting approval from the canton.   
Hope this helps others! Many thanks to all who've posted in the past on this topic. I've been learning a lot from those threads.   
Best,   
Anindita

			Pardon me, but this seems like possibly the kind of post that is now appearing on expat sites worldwide, changing the country name only. I mean I can't see how this kind of strategy would work, except if you are fishing for new trends in other markets. Because I can think of dozens of franchises in different countries, that may work outstanding there, but wouldn't work anywhere else. Look at Nestle. They have to be the Master Shin Fu of adapting their brand locally. If you ever get their Nescafe, and I have in Canada, US, Mexico, Portugal, France, here, and elswhere, and none of them taste them same. Now, that's not a franchise, but I wuld never recommend anyone outside of Kentucky to open an all night Waffle House or Piggly Wiggly in Wollishofen.

do you maybe know hat is the most popular platform for selling goods on-line in the French part of Switzerland? Ricardo is number one and they also have the french language option. On the other hand, we have   which is also in use and looks popular. Which one is better, has more users etc. Do you know?

			I like PhilMCR's analogy.  Selling existing ""empty"" GmbH with only cash is tough unless compelling reason to buy, of which only 2 come to mind: 
1. You don't (for whatever reason) want direct cash transfer from entity to your personal account, and want to get cash indirectly via purchase of shares. In this case, someone would buy GmbH shares for discount to cash on hand 
2. GmbH has tax loss carry forwards as ""assets""; for example, if cumulative losses for tax purposes is SFr 100k, it might be worth SFr 20k to offset taxes on acquiring GmbH's other profits. 
Both cases would be a lot of risk for not much gain, and you'd have to have couple years of P&L / Balance Sheets signed off by Treuhand. 
Initial impression I have for your case is to take out excess cash, spend a couple grand to liquidate the GmbH, and get closure.  Another option would be to sign over shares to friendly Treuhand for free after taking out cash - they get a shell for free (but with risks), you save liquidation costs. 
Good luck in whatever direction you go.

416	07.10.2014, 18:12	Senior Member	Thanked 154 Times in 90 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Sounds familiar......and anyone reading this can help protect themselves from a potential risk by ensuring that the payment to the GU is made in tranches (I think the banks generally insist on this too), to only be paid at certain stages of the build eg. foundations down, 20%, 1st floor built then another 20% etc etc.......you should always leave 10 ideally 20% to be handed over only when it's finished and you get the keys, otherwise you don't have much bargaining power.  And don't pay any 'mehrkosten' (extras) until you're sure the work has been done / items delivered, and the sub-contractors have been paid too.     
If there are any problems with the GU, or you suspect any along the way (such as sub-contractors not being paid, and other signs of lack of liquidity), then be prepared to take pre-emptive action, get lawyers involved asap.  Our project (multiple houses) ended up keeping a fair bit of money away from the GU and paying sub-contractors directly, basically because of the mess the GU had got into as the project progressed.

			I think adjusting to life in the Netherlands is easier (of course it depends where you come from of course), the Dutch are usually curious about were people come from and are in general very friendly. 
Switzerland pay higher but also the cost of living is higher, I guess it depends in which city your job would be and whether you are single or moving with your family. If the former, go NL...

			Legally you are only allowed to use the rented object for the purpose indicated in the contract. But as miniMia says - running a business from a rented home if it is just an office and you have no customers visiting/no noisy business, is normally not a problem. Most sole proprietorships in Switzerland are run from home - at least in the beginning.  
The commercial registry does not care, where your office is. Even a letterbox will do  .  (For any type of company).   
One issue you will run into, is whether or not your you can deduct an office cost for tax purposes (usually a part of the rent). Each town/village/canton has its own rules - some are more lenient than others.    
If your wife will have clients often, things change. I would definitely get the agreement of your landlord first and choose a larger building or one where there are businesses already (mixed zone). Or if that is an option go for a house instead of a flat.

			Is your firm planning to hire locally or are they planning to transfer staff from the US?  Because you also need to consider that any American who has signatory rights over any business accounts would have to report those on a FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Report) form.       
Which is another reason why the banks don't like lending to American businesses.

			Hi, I'm looking for a sample debt collection letter in french. The customer (a local authority, believe it or not) has still to pay a portion of an invoice (the VAT in fact) outstanding from January, despite numerous reminders. We are willing to go to the poursuite office but would rather not. I think it's sheer inefficiency rather than unwillingness to pay that's the problem.   
If anyone has anything of use I'd appreciate it. Fortunately, this is our one and only bad debt in 5 years but I think it would still be useful to have something readily available to use as and when.

			If you get this running, you will have to do a tax declaration for both CH and USA. It does not mean you will pay taxes on both countries, certainly in CH, but depending on your situation maybe some in the USA. There is a tax treaty between the USA and CH, so you could claim a tax credit in the USA, the taxes paid in CH.  
You are a prime candidate to talk to a Tax consultant.

			Excellent stuff! My plan is to become a consultant in about 18 months, once my employers decide to give me a fat package to go away.   
As far as I know, as discussed in a previous thread, the best starting plan is to use a billing company in Geneva. They bill my customers, pay my AVS and stuff, keep a 10% handling fee and pay me what's left.   
However, I'd like to have a personal brand outside of the billing company.   
Here's the plan: I already have a web site name reserved & I can get a letter box in Geneva very cheaply (I live in France).  Would it be breaking the law to have a business card made up with ""Frank Zappa, Dodgy Motors*, 128 Cheap Letterbox Street, Eaux Vives, Geneva"" on it?       
* The name of my web site

			I know that Aldi is already carrying Greek OO in their stores here.   
If you could find some way to ""independently"" confirm the ""superior"" nature of your OO, I sugest you do so. There is so much crap out there so if you could ""prove"" that your oil is good/very good compared to other OO selling in CH, you might have something to work with. Otherwise you are just selling an oil like everyone else.   
Since you are selling in 5L containers, you are probably targeting high use families or restaurants. Target distribution would be food wholesalers and bulk food stores like Aligro (Swiss French chain). People will be hesitant to buy 5L unless they have some sort of ""seal of approval"" such as Ktipp etc. or you spend some time giving taste samples in-store. Sampling is very expensive in CH because of the salaries. You could try a market stand to see if there is some interest. Have other popular oils so people can compare.

			It really depends where exactly it is at Militaerstrasse. If it is very close to Militaerstrasse (around the police station and closer) then keep in mind that this spot is quite infamous for drug dealers and a spot for riots at May 1st. The spot is really about the center of the red light district there.  
But if the Shop is located closer towards the river Sihl, then it's much safer.

			So long as you are not duplicating the expenses and subsequently spreading your resources thin, I don't think it can hurt to focus on more than one area.  This is particularly since you may not know in the beginning what area may take off.     
From the administrative perspective, when you do the incorporation documentation of the company, you may have to provide a number of core and secondary areas of focus.     
The risk is confusing the customers who perhaps look at your website and see a different focus than the one you're talking to them about, but this can also be addressed by appropriately segmenting your website.

What Sophie said...  Most (or at least a good number) of the dry goods are already available in the large supermarkets here. What would be interesting are the fresh products (ready-to-eat goodies, local specialities etc.), but these usually have a short sell-by-date, so I'm not sure if a fortnightly run from the U.K. would suit those kind of products. Also, that would raise the question of the ""cold chain"", i.e. ensuring that the products are maintained at a max. temperature of X°C from supplier to retailer. Tricky.....

			Has anyone used Findea to handle their business accounting? Their rates: for accounting with annual financial statements (chf 1500 basic package, at chf 150-190/hr) and for annual tax returns (chf 300). Not sure how this compares to smaller accounting firms in kanton Zurich. They are a partner of startup.ch which I am thinking of using to open up a Gmbh. Any info or recommendations are greatly appreciated.

Yes, scrypt was deliberately used as a hash mechanism in alt coins to prevent them being pwned by bitcoin miners and to delay the onset of ASICs. I think there is actually a hybrid ASIC which does both, but as in all such beasts, it's a compromise. Of course, you can still (just) use a graphics card for scrypt, but these days that's only really gonna work in the early pump-and-dump phase of the coin and you've got to pay attention to make any money that way.

			What you do on your own time is your private business.  I suggest not disclosing anything to employer unless   pertinent to the duties in a potential job or you   interact with customers and your independent work substitutes your employer's value proposition.  If you have a clause in a contract ala ""all software developed during your employment with X is company property"", just cross it out with explanation that you do non-conflicting work on side or add clause ""all software which is directly similar to that developed by employee for X company"".   
That being said, take care that you totally keep things separate even in little things.  For example 
- always use separate, private computer to program or run simulations (your stuff doesn't get worked on, stored, tested, etc on company assets) 
- use totally separate phones (incl. mobile) and email address for anything to do with side business, don't call from work lines 
- don't log into your side work systems, emails, etc. from any company computers esp. during working hours   
If you do this, you shouldn't have issues and avoid potential employer claims on fruit of your labours.  Good luck on your project - and persevere!

			[ramble alert - too little time to edit]   
My one experience with this (so bear in mind the very low sample size!) was that when it came down to negotiating on this very aspect (equity) the startup (8 people but relatively established) was not willing to budge - I would have had to wait a year before getting a bonus that would (possibly) include some equity which would only vest over 2 years (which is par for the course I think).   
Since I was willing to take a very substantial pay cut (~45%) plus forego a multitude of benefits, I walked away when I couldn't get any skin in the game from the word go. Note - I wouldn't have minded equity that didn't vest immediately, but I did want some meaningful future reward to compensate for the huge pay cut, that I would look to when I was working 80 hour weeks in a crappy office / workshop looking at the back of train station all day long.   
So - long story short - however compelling the story is, my advice is to decide your minimum conditions beforehand eg what is your minimum salary you need to live your life (be honest with yourself), what are you willing to give up (eg I was going to give up any cash bonus in lieu of more equity - which can help a small company for whom cashflow is their lifeblood), and what risk-reward makes sense for you (eg how much equity do you think compensates for the above as the previous poster replied)?   
In the end, we agreed to disagree (quite amicably) - I still regret not taking the role but objectively, it didn't make sense for me. In fact, this whole thing taught me how to say no to something.

			Well, as said in the linked post, we don't seem to have a lot of info here on the forum for this sort of situation so any insights/experiences you may have and would be prepared to share will be useful for others who find themselves in the same position.   
It's not a limit on the turnover, it just means the company has to be registered if it's over CHF100,000.     
When only one entrepreneur decides to set up a company in Switzerland, he can be both the owner and the director of the company. The founder is fully liable for the companys obligations. The sole proprietorship in Switzerland is obliged to register with the Trade Register only if the annual turnover is over 100,000 CHF.""

			Shares must be CHF 100 000 - at at least liberated at 50%. Yes it is correct, I have help start up several companies that way. Of course it will also depend on if there are bearer bonds or not, but what I have said is indeed correct.

No, I've done the comic layout digitally, just the panels are separately painted, and I can prepare a print-ready pdf version of the book on my own.      Neither of the two; I'm looking at printing 100 copies and then desperately trying to sell them to whoever might be interested. That's why offset is completely out of the question (my quantity is too small), as are print-on-demand services (my quantity is too large for them to be competitive).      I've sort of published all the pages in my  , but I've repainted more than half of the book since then, because, gasp, it turns out one can learn a lot during a project like that, especially when the starting point is totally amateurish, so the stuff I did two years ago looks simply embarrassing compared to the latter pages. So peek, but imagine the end result better... I'm currently already working on a sequel to my first storyline, so the blog is a little confusing to browse, though.   
I will make a free pdf download available of the book once it's completely ready and lettered, and unless EF bans my future blatant marketing attempts I will surely advertise it here.

			I agree with the general comment that you need to look into your target audience of course.   
If search engines worked for you in UK, they will too work probably in CH too. What you have to consider though is that CH is lagging behind the UK in terms of online adoption of services (let's say 3-5 years lag - my expert estimate    
Now, if you want to look at search engines, Google dominates the Swiss search engine market too (around 95%). However, there is a local player (search.ch) that is still used by certain somewhat elder target audiences. You might want to have a look at them too.   
Also, Facebook is now widely in use, and those audiences are picking up on it (parents) you are looking for. They also offer excellent targeting.   
Hope this gives you some ideas.

			We have a small soft furnishing business - my wife is a textile designer. As I was looking for partners in the interior design business here in CH I did the following. Just googled a few nights, and collected e-mail addresses. Sent them a nice letter in German (one by one), and a catalogue. I got some 3% replied, which is not at all that bad a response rate.   
As a second go I simply walked into some stores with 2 aims: (1) leave a catalogue (printed) behind (2) get the name of the responsible person (usually not there herself) - I got either a name card or at least an email address in all cases.   
I hope this helps...

			I think I can be of help here since I'm in the process of incorporating a GmbH myself. After checking several lawyers and fiduciaries, I'm paying 3000CHF/year for the Swiss director, but I got quotations up to 15.000CHF a year.   
Be careful because Swiss banks treat VERY differently operational business from those that are not. The fees for the bank account are SUBSTANTIALLY different, and they will check that based on:   
- Employees you have 
- If you have your own premises (office, etc) 
- You run a commercial activity   
So, prepare the 20.000CHF to deposit in a blocked account, the fees for the incorporation (from 2.000 to infinite), hire an accountant, and good luck!

There are many other questions, but you need to explain more of what you need before anyone can help you.

If they cause cancer, they will also harm passive smokers.    
Importing liquid nicotine isn't a problem - but selling it is illegal. That's why most smokers are likely to buy their liquids in the EU, rather than in Switzerland.    
I should also ad that I've been using e-cigarettes (and e-pipes) myself - I smoked for a short while in college, some 20 years ago, but have never really gotten over the addiction (I haven't been smoking, but every time someone smokes around me, I nearly freak out because I want one, too :-/  So I started vaping non-nicotine liquids - which takes care of the urge to smoke real cigarettes.

			Make sure to send the bill right before the salary day/week. This way all people have cash on their bank account to pay your bill. Otherwise, your bill will land with others papers and it slows down the process. 
Salary week in Switzerland is around the 24-25th of each month.

			Weebly and six are excellent platforms for someone without any IT skills and outside help that just wants to throw in something that looks good in a few hours and I definitely recommend it to small-time freelancers/businesses.   
Be advised that, as soon as your business grows a little and you have to start getting more specific/add more functionality, you will need to get outside help or get your hands dirty (I really recommend the former), so be wary when you purchase the licenses for these platforms (especially if you have to commit for a year or something, not that uncommon).   
It is not uber-expensive, but something that you can definitely think about when going for these kinds of services.   
I have gone this way and then upgraded to a full fledged site, so if you need any advice just PM me and I can share my experience.

			This is a very good question and one I have been wanting to ask myself. Reason being that I have a full-time job and offer services part-time. My goal is to be able to quit my full-time job and to offer my services full-time. But I want to make sure that I can renew my permit (I have a B-Permit) if I am providing services only and and don't have a contract.   
One of the things I thought of was opening a company in order to be able to provide stable reason for staying.   
I apologise if this has already been answered somewhere, as I am new here and did have a look, but have not found anything yet.

			But not Bern, the capital city?  
Then what about other cities such as Fribourg, Luzern etc? Canton Fribourg experienced the highest population growth of any canton in 2012, and based on my own experience of the influx of ex-pats, it is noticeable. Don't just assume that the ex-pat fraternity revolves around the ZH/GE/BS axis; what's culturally/officially/socially acceptable in one city might not be applicable to other areas.

			Use an open source CMS (I like Serendipity), like the ones used for blogging (Wordpress is also OK). You can work around it so it doesn't have to be an actual blog.   
Once the design phase is completed, updating the content will be a piece of cake, and you don't need html or CSS knowledge, plus you can edit the content via the web no matter where you are.   
If design and a clean sitemap are a priority, do invest in a designer to get you started, it all depends on how much of a mom & pop  shop the business will be.   
And absolutely, get your page on MySpace, Facebook, Flickr, and all popular Social Networks with relevant local communities to promote your stuff!   
For hosting i use hostpoint.ch, their starter package is around CHF9 a month, with 10 GB.

			Thanks, GeorgiU.    
I will sell primarily in Germany.   
1. Suppose that I already have a CH company, but I will rent warehouse in Germany and hire Germans(maybe in part time). 
-- Then I must register a new company in Germany? Can my CH company only register a VAT no. in Germany to run such business? 
-- If it is allowed that my Swiss company only registers a VAT no. in Germany but does no form a new company in Germany, then  
    a. the revenue is generated in Germany, I should pay CIT in Germany? 
    b. What is the meaning of a limited amount of time to hire EU persons? Part-time job? How many hours a week? Even in the limited time job, my company will have to pay some percentage of taxes/insurance for the employee?   
2. If I sell from Switzerland to EU in the way of B2C, how is the procedure of VAT and custom fees? 
-- The individual customer in EU will have to pay the import duty and VAT from the courier office? 
-- Then I have to claim back the VAT on purchase? Periodically or on each transaction?  I have already paid the VAT upon importation of the merchandise from other countries. 
-- If so, it will be very troublesome. Is there any easier way rather than a bonded warehouse in Switzerland?

			OP: You don't owe anything. You're below the threshold for UK taxes and you'd almost certainly be liable for taxes there and no where else. Who your employer is, where you're registered and where your bank account is are all irrelevant. It's about where you actually live most of the time. Sounds like that's the UK.

			The problem you'll have on the Swiss end is that you also need to be resident here for a certain number of days each year to qualify as resident.  With a B permit you're only allowed to be out of the country for 6 months maximum unless your Swiss company is sending you abroad.  Okay a GmbH could get you around that problem, but you also need to have a permanent address here, pay Swiss health insurance premiums, etc, to meet the residency requirements.  If you're resident here I assume you'll also need to file Swiss returns to declare your worldwide wealth at least, if not your actual income, so you'll probably pay some tax here.  You need CHF20,000 to set up a GmbH too.   
If you're not going to be resident as fatmanfilms says you'll need a Swiss resident to act as a director of your GmbH in addition to yourself.

			We own a small business here in Switzerland with more than 10 employees.  As a result we must have what is called a ""Eingeschränkte Revision der Jahresrechnung"" - Limited External Audit - of our accounts each year.   
I find the fees associated with this External Audit very high - we've been quoted between CHF 4'500-CHF 6'500 (we're located in Zürich).  Does anyone else have any experience with external auditors?   
Although the external auditor did a very professional job, I find it hard to understand the fees - considering that the audit visit is typically for less than one day, our accounts are in good shape and we conduct everything in German (so there is no need for an english speaking auditor).   
I do know that accountants are very expensive here (CHF 150+ per hour) but i'd be interested in knowing whether anyone else has been quoted similar amounts for external audits?   
Thanks for any feedback you have?   
Best, 
Gareth

			If you are exporting to the EU then you won't be charging VAT (MwsT). Once your turnover is over 100,000 CHF per year you can apply for VAT registration and you will be able to claim back any VAT on purchases (and that includes business expenses within CH). You, or your accountant, will claim this back quarterly I guess.   
You won't have any export fees to pay from CH but bear in mind your customers in the EU will have to pay any relevant import duty and local VAT as well as any handling charges from the shipping agent or Post office.   
If you are primarily selling within the EU you would be much better off exporting there from China, much less hassle and less cost for your EU customers. But maybe a bit late for that now that you've already formed a Swiss GmbH, unless you form another company in the EU zone.

			Irrespective of the permit issue, you will likely face more obstacles in setting up a bank account for a business as an american.  Unless it is a cash only business, I would look at this aspect before getting the permissions/permits.

			Dear Turboimpreza   
Your main question is if you should have an ""Einzelfirma"" or a ""GmbH"" and that is not an easy one. You should consider the following factors:   
- Risk: As in your old country, you are fully liable with a single owner company with your private assets. Depending on your private situation (spouse, kids etc.) and the riskyness of your business activities that might be no problem or undesirable.   
- Cost: A GmbH brings higher costs (registration, bookkeeping etc.) than a single owner company.   
- Tax: A GmbH is a capital company which introduces taxation on an additional level (company gains are taxed and your income when you take it out of the company in the form of salary or dividends). However, the tax on dividends if you own the whole company is reduced and owning the company gives you timing flexibility on when to pay yourself dividends, therefore enabling you to smooth your position on the tax curve over the years.   
Please note that there are other factors to consider as well (see for example  ), but I think in your situation these are the most important.   
Summing up, with the limited information that I know about your situation I would probably opt for the GmbH to have a clear separation of private and professional income / expenses as well as limited risk. You can easily bring your car into the company instead of cash. Question is if the current value of the car is actually worth CHF 20'000. Exactly because of these questions, the creation of your company has to be audited if you bring assets into the company and not cash.    
Regarding your former company, you could also still use it to carry out your activities. As you say yourself, the taxation is questionable. Probably this entity would be considered to be domiciled in Switzerland for tax purpose since all material business decisions are carried out by you from here. Also, it might generate other cross-border questions (VAT etc.)   
Also to note based on your situation:  
As soon as you have more than CHF 100'000 in VAT-relevant income you will have to register with the VAT authority and comply with VAT law / filings.  
Also from that perspective having a decent book-keeping in place as you need it with a GmbH makes probably sense.   
Hope that helps   
Best 
Tobiash

So such a service would not appeal much to seasoned professionals confident about themselves and knowing exactly where they want to get to, and how to do it in the Swiss market.   
That still raises a couple of possibilities. First, the main focus could be on people less experienced in the job market in general.   
Second, there is potential in coaching even experienced people on getting work in the   job market. The process is slightly different here so for people new to CH (trailing spouses, for instance) I could envisage a special service that some might find useful.   
There may be books available on these subjects but they tend to be fairly general rather than CH-specific. A book can advise on good CV practice but it's one-way traffic only. A human can at least read a CV, make recommendations, then review it again when it's revised. A book can't.    
Plus, there are still services that might have value e.g. the interview practice idea which again, you can't do with a book.

			I believe that if your B permit is tied to your employer, then your new company would have to go through the same non-EU hiring process before they could hire you.  They'd have to advertise the position across Europe and prove to the relevant Swiss authorities that they can't find anyone with the right qualifications who's also either Swiss, an EU national or anyone else who has a valid Swiss permit to do the job.  Here's more info on that:       
Also they will look at whether the company will be creating jobs in Switzerland for Swiss citizens/residents.  It doesn't sound as if that's what you'll be doing.

			One problem no one mentioned is that if Sonos has outsourced production to a specific plant in China, it does not mean the plant is allowed to manufacture Sonos equipement and sell it to third party.   
Also, what does ""original"" mean anyway? It could be ""original"" as created in the same plant but not approved by Sonos therefore not under warranty.   
""Original"" tends to have blurry definition in China.       
Lastly, I would at least go check out the factory yourself to make it offers somewhat decent work conditions.

			I am a (rusty) accountant.  get this confirmed by the VAT authorities in Spain as I do not know what you do, you don't want to do VAT wrong...   
I am assuming you will be earning above the VAT registration requirement limits for Spain or you are registering for VAT voluntarily.   
I invoice a Swiss company from the UK and as Swiss are not EU, you do not charge VAT, nor do you have to declare that income on the UK VAT form nor the EU VAT form (but obviously you do in your accounts/tax returns).  I would imagine that this is the same for Spain.   
If you are invoicing a UK company from Spain you just need the VAT registration number of the UK company and to give them your Spanish VAT number.  You then do not charge VAT and you must declare this on a separate ""services to the EU"" VAT return and separately on your normal VAT return.  Not sure what this form is called in Spain.   
Hope it helps.  Call the Spanish VAT office for confirmation please!

			Don't know about question two, but for question one it should state quite clearly on the tax return when it has to be back by.  Mine's in the top righthand corner of the first page.  This varies from canton to canton: most seem to need to be returned by the 31st March, but here in Fribourg canton the date is 1st March.

			Can't really help a lot because our UK company is dormant, but I can tell you that as a director of a UK company you will have to file UK self assessment tax returns every year.  If you're invoicing through the UK I assume you'll also need to file a company tax return each year. You'll need to file company annual accounts and annual return each year with Companies House and if you file late, there's a penalty and as it's on public record could damage the company's reputation.  These links might help.           
Be warned that getting the Gateway thing set up can be a challenge as they're very slow in getting the activation codes to you in the time allowed.  It took 2/3 attempts before I received ours quickly enough to get the activation done.

Furthermore the software is not yet translated from English to German (we are moving to Zurich) and we were also wondering if there are english speaking kindergartens that we can use like a proof of concept.   
I will appreciate all kinds of answers, together with any info for the kindergarten.

So went to the unemployment office and signed up at the start of the year, since I waited so long, they said payments wouldn't commence for a month, but otherwise they didn't seem at all bothered by my delay.   
Hopefully, I'll figure out the final kinks in my app within the next couple of weeks, freeing up my time to meet RAV obligations to search for a job.

			You do not have to use a payroll if you are not living in Switzerland but you do if you are. The company may force you to go via a payroll company because it is easier for them, it depends on the company. In my experience the more complicated it is for a company to employ you the less likely they are to actually make it happen.

			According to the new art. 3 par. 1 lit. s Unfair Competition Act:  
whoever offers goods, works, or services by means of electronic commerce (e.g. through an online shop) is required to:  
1) clearly and completely indicate its identity and contact address (including electronic mail);  
2) indicate the different technical steps that must be followed in order to conclude the contract;  
3) make available appropriate means for identifying and correcting input errors prior to the placing of an order; and  
4) acknowledge receipt of the customer’s order immediately by electronic means. As an exception, these requirements do not apply to voice telephone and to contracts that are entered into exclusively through an exchange of electronic post (e-mail) or comparable individual communications (art. 3 para. 2 UCA).     
If she is only ""advertising"" the products via social media and the actual contract is only entered into by exchange of e-mail, letters, phone call, she ""should"" be OK... but I understand the teacher's hesitancy.

561	07.10.2013, 13:15	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zurich	"     I have heard that before, several times, about going in with a Swiss partner. I had never really wanted to open a restaurant here before because of, well, many reasons. But, recently, after bringing up a few ideas I had(I was drinking and fed up), I was told by a couple of close collegues, that they would commit to adding their names(they are both Swiss) to my un intentional project. A friend, and hotel director was there and told me I was in...   
Cause I didn't know what that meant, he told me, if I want to get any credit, or any chance of people agreeing to leases, or anything, I need a Swiss ""co-signer"". And now that I had that support(for something I am not going to do), I was ""in"".   
I had asked about a chicken place in St Gallen a year ago, a gerant situation, and was told they liked everything about me, but would not talk to me further unless I had a Swiss person on board since I was a foreigner. They were Turkish by the way.   
And it has been a repeated issue. See, your word, your name means something here. Whether it is verbal or in writing at the Betriebsbungsmapt(or whatever it is called). So, if you bring someone along that can shake their hand, and tell them their last name, far more doors open then where I was at before.    
And totally un related, yet related, I was helping someone exit their apartment that was on this forum. They thought their landlord hated. Primarily because they could speak no German, and the Swiss guy could speak no English; probably. But when I tried to get involved it was a stalemate. When I asked my Swiss friend to call and say the exact same thing, which was basic, as I said in my crap German, all washed over smooth.   
She said her name, talked, and we went on to a smooth take over. She said he was quite brash, but everything was fine. It's how it works here. You present yourself, you keep your name in tact, you earn respect and trust. A foreigner that could easily leave, at any time, does not have a name yet.   
Anyways, I know many EU and not that have opened businesses here.  
If you think being bitter and dropping names on a public forum will do you any good, not only will it not, but it ain't very Swiss.

			We moved a couple valuable pieces of artwork when we moved to Switzerland.  The moving company crated them and we included them on the list of items for insurance purposes.  As others have said I think the only requirement is that you've owned them for 6 months and I don't think they worry about it much when you are moving.  One of our pieces was less than that and nobody checked.

570	03.12.2013, 14:27	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: fribourg	"    The best way to send tea from India to Switzerland is  
1.by breaking your total tea weight into 3 smaller ones or 4 smaller parcels. 
2. To reduce import duty at Switzerland, a tea friend mentioned that ""one should declare the tea as gift"" in the declaration at the Indian Post office. 
3. India Post Office Offers three international services. 
a) SAL (Sea Air and Land: It's the cheapest and delivery takes about 20+days) 
b) By Air : (It cost a bit more than SAL, delivery takes in 15 days) 
c) EMS Speed Post: (The costliest among the three, delivery in 10days) 
You may refer to the India Post Webpage to get the latest rates for EMS. Rates of others need to inquired at the post office.   
About Parceling:  
India Post sends the parcel in traditional methods, that is by stitching the parcel with a cloth and sealing with a wax. Ensure that the packing is done right if the tea leaves are of SFTGFOP1 / FTGFOP1 type to prevent breakage of leaves during shipment.

			I think the best for you is to setup a GmbH, ofcourse as the others said, you can have a one-man company and for that you dont need to register it officially as long as you dont Gross over 100K CHF/year (as far as I remember). 
BUT 
The problem here lies in the liability, as a one-man company (like a freelancing consultant or so), you are completely liable, meaning that if someone sues you for damages and he wins, your home furniture is at risk, that is how dangerous it is. A GmbH would limit your liability to 20K and that is it!. and since you wanna use it as a saving box, putting 20K in the capital account wouldnt be such a bad idea.

			A word to the wise to the OP--these kinds of businesses won't work here.  They depend on a community of people with huge families and lots of friends and cohorts.  They rely on a population of young marrieds looking to supplement their income.  They are dependent on a society willing to open their homes (for ""parties"", a.k.a. sales venues where your friends and families are guilted into buying your product).   
In short, if you understood Thing One about the Swiss mindset and the Swiss lifestyle, you would not be on this forum.  Stick to the US, particularly Utah.  Mormons luuuurve this kind of stuff.

Unless you speak French or German to a reasonable level you will find it hard work as alcohol is a tightly regulated market.   
Selling speciality beer to various outlets for what appears to be essentialy the skiing crowd will not be easy at all.    
Firstly your price will have to quite high in order to cover your costs and make a small (and i emphasis small) profit.   
You are aiming your product towards a market for British people. In as much as you can generalise, the Brits are generaly ""volume"" drinkers rather than ""quality"" drinkers, and i make no judgement at all about this.   
If they can buy a local beer, which is also part of the ""holiday spirit"", no pun intended, for a price considerable less than an expensive imported beer that they can buy far cheaper once they get home, which one do you think they will go for ? Maybe they will buy 1 or 2 of your beers but you need volume sales not boutique sales.   
Also with the value of the GBP against CHF, this will have a big impact on which beer they chose to drink and my guess is, the cheaper the better and you will not be able to compete on price.

			No worries about the disclaimer. I get the feeling I am not really going to find out until I start importing stuff.   
There must be a reason why DPD say we should combine the deliveries. The same ZaZ account will be billed so perhaps that is why they see it as one importer. I will try to clarify it with them.   
I have ordered quite a few things from Swiss companies (reifendirekt.ch, discountlens.ch). The goods arrived shipped to us directly from DE. I can't imagine that they would have to pay separate customs clearance charges for different addressees - it would not be economically feasible.   
Thanks again

I'm amazed that you're looking to buy, considering you only moved back to Switzerland at the start of the year.  You must be doing very well for yourself.

As does Homegate - use the commercial and residential building section to search:

			I am representing a 3D Architectural Visualisation company, based in the UK, which is looking to expand into the Swiss market.   
I am a British National who moved to Switzerland (Vaud) as a student in 2006 at the age of 15 with my family; following my father whose job had relocated to Geneva. In 2010 I moved back to the UK to study Architecture at University, and I have been in the UK ever since. I do visit my family (all of which hold B Permits, based in Founex, Vaud) during the Easter and Summer periods, and work as a Football Coach on a student work permit.   
The company is registered in the UK as a Private Limited company (LTD); is a Business bank account necessary? (All finance goes through a basic Current Account owned by the Director of the Company)   
General business activity involves working online, corresponding by email, whereby the client is sent the product(s) after payment is electronically transferred. The thing that worries me is that to take this across the UK-Swiss systems, extra taxes may come to light of which we are unaware - does anybody know what (if any) they would be or know someone to talk to about this? In linking with the question about the Business account above, I was wondering if the Swiss do this differently in terms of ONLY paying into Business accounts rather than personal current accounts?   
I appreciate that there will be some level of bureaucracy involved (permits/swiss business accounts etc.), but I was just wondering if anyone had a clearer idea of what this would involve?   
Many thanks!

			Good suggestions, thanks Sprinz. I will go to the post office tomorrow and ask them for some clarification.    
The point I've made to the firm handling my mail is that I was totally, 100 % contactable to verify any concerns or answer any questions. They opened the mail but made absolutely no efforts to bring the facts to my attention. If they were truly working in my firms interest, why did they not bother to call me or send me an email? Instead they clandestinely started an investigation into the matter ringing up their invoice along the way. The first I even heard about this was only when I received the invoice many months later.     
Had they called me they would have been told not to bother with it because the matter fully resolved, no fines, no summons nothing. In fact I learned their investigation concluded that the letter had been sent in error, which I could have confirmed without any charges. To settle the matter and in good faith I've offered to pay them for 1 hour of their time but they insist that the invoice with just a very small deduction of 75 CHF should be paid.      
It's not really about the money although we work hard for every franc/rappen. It's the principal of the matter.     
Looks to me like I'm being Switzerlanded!

No, it is possible. We started our online cheese shop from home but we did convert a room in the cellar (we also do catering). It may be more tricky from a kitchen in an apartment though. If you are renting you should also get permission from the landlord.

			As a non-EU/ non-CH citizen, if you were establishing a company that might generate substantial tax revenues and employment, you might be able to get a work permit. See the following story about how this was done (fraudulently):        
English translation:     
As previous noted, since it appears that you are setting up a small retail business, it would be most difficult for you to secure a CH work permit.

			I am planning to sell my business (Einzelfirma) in the next 6-9 months.  I was told years ago by my Treuhand that the sale of a GmbH was not a taxable event, and so had planned on converting the Einzelfirma into a GmbH in the next few months prior to selling.   
I have now been told by the same Treuhand that selling a GmbH is only no-tax if it is at least 5 years old.   
Can anyone confirm or deny this?  Is there any way I can (legally) avoid paying full income tax on the sale price of the business?

			It would probably depend on the ratio of work allocated.  If you work say 80% for the company and only 20% for your own then you would still be considered an employee.  But if it's 80% for your own company then you would be considered self-employed is my guess.

			I'll add some more to that.   
Based on my experience only:   
An agency with a Swiss output such as Xenar, Swisslinx, Elan, MBA, Stamford etc will payroll you. 
A UK based agency working may outsource the payroll.   
I went for a contract for Large Food Company out west and they would have outsourced it or I organise my own payroll. 
I stayed with A Large Bank and I'm payrolled by the placing agents.

			I am a US citizen with a B permit, planning to set-up my own business. I read the previous threads about the specific requirements /authorizations for setting up business as a non-EU B permit holder. EF is a great source, thank you all for providing such valuable information!   
Assuming I will be granted to authorization, can you please advise on the specific concerns below:   
1. My husband is also a NON-EU B permit holder. My B permit has been sponsored through my husband's employer. Assuming I set-up my business and he loses his job & starts to receive unemployment benefits, can my own business help us renew our B permits when the renewal time comes?    
2. Does it matter if I set-up my business as a sole proprietorship or SARL in the process of B permit renewal?   
Thank you very much,

But what they'll do is go to an agency and say - get me a project manager. They then pay the agency. How the agency and the worker sort things out is no concern of the client.      Possibly. He may have be working through an agency. I worked through my GmbH to one client, directly, for two years. After that, they insisted I go through an agency. I've now been doing work for them, on and off, for 8 years.      10% to 50% to...     Probably. Maybe. Again there remains the issue that some cantons (I've heard) view this as the client evading their social responsibilities, and so won't allow it - even though they're getting the money from you. For some reason going through an agency prevent this. Or maybe this story is put about by agencies so you'll use them!   
GmbH is better than einzelfirma, because your liability is limited. You do have to pay employers social contributions as well as employees, and there's tax on any profit. However, your company can pay for a lot of things, so, given the higher income, it's still worth doing (IMO).

			I have a full time job working on the internet. Quite often I have friends who ask me to help them on small projects. Be it consultancy or actually building their site.   
I mostly say ""no"" because I guess the hassle of starting an actual company, paperwork,... just aren't worth it to me.   
I now have a really nice project on which I would love to work, and a potential second one after that helping someone in my family. It might well be that after that I don't do anything like this again for >6 months. So setting up a company still seems too much trouble. But the time I would invest in to this is also too much to do it as a favour and get a bottle of wine in return.   
Does anyone know if there's any ""in between"" options?

			Hi Chris,   
as an Eu member you are eligible to open an Einzelfirma in order to establish your business in Switzerland and the process is simple, however the ability of opening it is usually for those who are interested in immigrating to Switzerland and are not interested in establishing a more expensive alternative (GmbH, AG).   
if you are not planning on becoming a resident of Switzerland and you have no reason to open a GmbH or an AG corporation  i would give up since normally most countries have anti tax planning rules which basically will force you to pay taxes where you reside.

Joomla might have a steeper learning curve but once you learn it, you are ready to start producing. Joomla 1.7 makes it even easier to do so and so do the thousands of extensions available out there.   
Of course to produce something that looks professional, you need to hire a professional. That's the same for all CMS and all web development.   
Regarding Search Engines, Joomla and Wordpress are the same towards Google. Google will crawl any type of website regardless of its technology. If you want to have the prefix added in the Joomla pages, then you can easily enable this under Global Configurations and you will have a ""static"" URL for each page of yours (e.g.   instead of the traditional dynamic coded link). You can see on our website   this effect.

It really is no issue to change location (or add another one) later on at all.    
I fully agree with AbFab: Tax is a secondary issue - getting a business running is much harder. If you have your first million of revenues can you still look into your options. I do not know why you'd limit yourself to a Swiss canton and move your home apartment if your business is supposed to be in Asia.   
We had a company set up in Singapore within 2 days or so. HK is similarly efficient. Both offer tax systems that can easily compete with Zug or Schwyz.

			As to your first question: There's a difference in Switzerland between psychiatrists and ""Psychotherapeut"". The former is a specialist who must have studied medicine at a university, as well as some additional courses in psychiatry. A psychiatrist can also prescribe all the relevant medicine. A ""psychotherapeut"" is someone who may practice, however, he or she will have to work together with a doctor of medicine. The insurance pays for ""psychotherapeuten"" when a doctor of medicine transfers patients to him or her. You can read more about this in wikipedia, seems quite up to date (in German, though):  . You'll see that about four different entities are there for evaluating the profession, it seems it's a bit of a mess (but, of course, regulated as almost everything here... maybe a good thing in the mental health department). I simply do not know if you're allowed to call yourself that if you've not done the necessary education, I cannot help you there, sorry.   
Your second question: Yes, most health insurers do also cover alternative medicine. It is most often done via ""Zusatzversicherung"", so you'll often pay an additional monthly fee for being able to see such a specialist. You'll best check with your health insurer/on the insurance's website how exactly this is handled, and what exactly they'll cover and what not. They'll be able to tell you on request (by email, by phone) if a certain treatment from a certain doctor is covered or not.

			Why do you have to get to Switzerland?  If it's for your study, well you've applied for the visa and providing there are no problems, it'll be granted.  IF you could get any other visa, it would negate the study one and you wouldn't be able to do your course.   
However if it's just because you want to be here, then you're going to be out of luck with no marketable skills or languages.  No unskilled job will get you a visa and neither will voluntary work.   
You can read what's required here:       
But I'll take just the first paragraph:   
""Switzerland has a dual system for granting foreign nationals access to the Swiss labour market. Persons from EU or EFTA member states, regardless of their qualifications, are granted easy access to the Swiss labour market under the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons.  Experience has shown that this category of workers has a better chance of professional and social integration than less qualified persons.""   
So if you want to live/work here, build up your experience/skills, learn at least one of Switzerland's 4 languages and then maybe you can apply for a job in about 5 years and have a chance of being accepted.   
Sounds like we need the long story instead of the short version we're getting at the moment.

			If you look at the thread ""Second business while being a full time employee"" (or something like that) which was on a few weeks ago you might get some more info. Re gruenden.ch if you go onto the site and type nebenerwerb there is the heading ""Zweites Standbein ...... "" which tells you what to do ie register  as having a secondary activity and gives you the links on who to contact. It seems not to be on the English translation. You will also have to pay AHV/IV etc. as fatmanfilms mentioned. 
    estv.ch is where the info. is about  VAT and that only kicks in when your turnover goes over CHF100000. So what that means is that you can start trading for less than CHF500 and worry about the VAT registration later if/when you find you are getting to the CHF100000.

			Ellen, it looks like you have some very nice pieces. I like the bookshelves very much.   
May I make a suggestion?    
For me, the largest barrier to shopping online for furniture is the question of quality. Normally I want to see a piece, I want to look carefully at the construction, judge the skill of the carpenter. I can't do that online.   
So - an online store has to convince the customer. Pictures are good, but sometimes they don't go far enough. Perhaps you could add more about each product, show additional views of important details (joints, backs, etc.). Talk about how the piece is constructed, what makes it a quality design. Show finishes, especially if there are finish options. Show hardware.   
This is the kind of thing I'm thinking about, a discussion of design and construction elements from a larger-scale manufacturer:       
And, a small custom furniture retailer who have a good a 'confidence-building' furniture FAQ page:     
I've ordered several pieces online from a Stickley retailer's website and direct from the Sawbridge website... but - and this is key - before my first order I visited each showroom (yes, I'm willing to travel for the right piece) to see the quality of the furniture up close and personal. I needed to see, touch, and feel similar pieces before feeling comfortable with parting with my hard earned pennies. Subsequent orders were no problem - but that initial purchase required a hands-on encounter.   
I do most of my shopping online, and will take a gamble on most things - but furniture is one where I need more 'convincing'.   
Do you have a showroom where customers might see some of your products? Even a small space, with just a few examples might help.    
Just my 5 Rappen.    
Wishing you all the best with your venture.

			Hi, 
I am a EU citizen currently living in Andorra doing contracting work for an Australian Company. Australia doesn't tax this income as it is earned outside of Australia. 
I wonder how that income would be taxed by Switzerland if moving there? Would I have to set up a company in Switzerland to invoice the Australian company from or can I just keep on invoicing from my own personal name?   
I also find that the online tax calculators give different results. If I put in that I live in ZUG and earn 130,000 CHF and married with 3 kids I get this in comparis.ch: 
Communal 3,704 
Cantonal   5,063 
Federal     7,249 
TOTAL     16,016   
In   I get this: 
Communal 1,076 
Cantonal   1,471 
Federal        698 
TOTAL       3,245   
Big difference! Is either of them correct and do they apply at all to my foreign contract income?   
Thanks in advance for any replies!

			Hi all,   
I am an Indian and now staying in Zurich. Here for a work and will be till end of this year at least.    
I am looking for an opportunity to export garments and handicrafts from India to Swiss. I have contacts all over India with manufacturers and those people who make garments and handicrafts with their hands. So, I can get them much cheaper than the market.    
I thought garments and handicrafts will be good to start with, however I am open for other materials as well.    
I am looking for some guidance on where and how to start in this market. Some expert advices will help. Also, if anyone who is a local resident and is interested in setting this up with me, that will also be helpful.   
Please let me know

I am not sure what it takes to succeed, but minimizing risk, developing 1st maybe as a cooperation with media and comm majors at some nice university with English speaking programs and then spreading more, could be cool. Could be an interesting trendy thing, broadcasting on campuses, slowly working on advertisers. The problem with WRS, it was a massive and professional project, so too expensive, without really having content, trying to please all. Young people will find enough issues to present, especially if it is a mix of hosts from abroad with locals. So you get the content, then you move on to biz and money making, but not the other way around, the idea will die of luck of substance. It's too cheap to get a really good readio now online, with an exquisite content.

There is a specific provision in the EU law stating that if a service is rendered by someone in one country to a business in another country, then no VAT shall be applicable and it is the latter that needs to account for VAT in his country of residence. 
So you will have to issue an invoice without VAT, putting a reference on the invoice that the service is VAT free (according to art. 44 of the EU VAT Directive). The Swiss business will then account for Swiss VAT via the VAT return.

I'm an artist myself and if you can guess...I make ships in bottles and I send them all over the world.  Be glad you aren't sending parcels. I pay 150 chf at least by post...don't even think about a parcel service here    I also make lots of other artwork too and have experience with multiple websites.   
And, just as a side note for the future, you may want to include the option of framing, of course with an increase of price in shipping, but that's just an idea and customers often like that option.   
Most every good sized post office should have a pamphlet with prices for sending letters and parcel all over the world.  It gives all the country codes and weights for any package/letter you want to send, as well as the length of time it takes, so you know exactly how much you will be paying.  It is incredibly handy, so I would suggest asking for one of those.  You never know when a customer may ask for a custom piece of artwork, and online, they want responses to questions like, ""how much for shipping?"" right away.     
Also, on your site make sure you at least let customers know that they are responsible for any customs fees, so you don't have unhappy costumers and they know what's coming.  That probably doesn't apply for letters, but it's safe to add anyway.   
I'd like to see your friend's artwork.  Is your site up and running yet?  Pictures please!

			Where would you want to do your business? If it is online and pick up from home, then maybe restrictions would be less. If you want your own location/bacery would require gemeinde permissions and licences which as others suggested are places to look for.   
If you do something online, you could get customers from other regions as well who can place orders remotely.   
sounds fun but its a lot of work

I don't exactly get the point of why you are asking, why someone would be educated in this field, or you think housekeeping is just for immigrants, and in your case, with not education.   
But the better hotels in the world, their housekeeping staffs are managed by trained professionals. A Hospitality and Management school offers those courses, and people become certified to properly lead others.    
You don't have to go to school at what you are calling ""a prestigious"" school if you want to stay in the same postion for the rest of your life, or get beat out for a management job by a person who has had the proper education. But, for every position in a hotel or a restaurant there is schooling for this, including waiters and waitresses...and hotel managers are trained in housekeeping, kitchen, utility, reception, HR, and so on. So they know what the regular educated or not, housekeeper, cook, porter, dishwasher, inventory, etc is doing to properly organize a Hotel, Resort, Restaurant in the hotels etc.   
I hope that helps.

			Submission in English, lodgement in German.   
What are the taxes you mention in VD?  I don't recall needed to do so when I set up my last GmbH in BS.  This time I'm registering in ZH (although Netnotar is in Olten).   
To date I've paid a deposit against the CHF 800, and need to pay the rest when signing.  Outside of that, other costs so far have been a formal confirmation from Handelsregisteramt that my business name is unique (Netnotar requested this, even though you can do your own search online).   
I see them Monday to sign everything, I have another thread I started that I'll update as I progress.

			This from the official Swiss website:   
""I am an EU national and would like to become self-employed in Switzerland. How do I proceed?   
 Within 14 days of their arrival and before taking up any gainful employment, self-employed people need to register either with the communal authorities of the place they reside or with the cantonal labor and migration authorities and apply for apply for a residence permit for self-employment. Also required are a valid ID or passport and documents proving that the requirements for self-employment are met (business plan, start-up capital, under certain conditions also listing with the register of commerce. etc.).   
People who can prove that they can successfully maintain self-employment are granted an EU/EFTA residence permit valid for five years. The competent local authorities may at any time check whether someone is genuinely self-employed, whether a person's self-employment is sustainable, and economically viable. If these requirements are no longer met, a permit may be revoked.""    
So it sounds as if you could possibly do it on an L permit, provided the authorities are happy.  Best thing to do is check with your canton's migration office and ask them.

			You are right, their tariffs for notarizing anything are already set by the association rules. But as I have come to realize they often don't just bill the actual notary work - for example additionally they will bill ""research"" (which should not happen for something as standard as an address change) etc.     
I have no idea about the prices in Vaud, the rules are different then in Bern I suppose, as well as the tariffs as these are regulated by cantonal law.

			After a bit of dawdling I finally pulled the trigger on this.  UBS were very helpful and proactive, so account will be with them.  Netnotar also had good feedback to a few questions I had, so am doing it through them (CHF 800 for a single owner GmbH).  Banana Buchhaltung ordered.   
Now need to start the process of registering for AHV, Mwst, etc.   
Thanks, Richard

			Thanks for the replies, folks. I am going to ask the registre de commerce in Moudon, but I suspect you're right, I'll have to close down the business and open up a new one in Canada. I've looked into it, and a sole proprietorship is simple to do there. I have a work permit already lined up. If my clients are loyal, they'll be loyal. If not, no biggie, I'll find others.    
It will probably be cheaper in the long run to just pay the currency changing fees than to alter the business structure in order to keep it going in Switzerland.   
I have learned through experience that it's really not worth trying to outfox the system, best just follow the rules (if you can figure out what they are) and pay the (often exorbitant) fees. Oh, and show up with every possible piece of documentation you have in your possession. Just in case.

			It may not be relevant to your project but I thinks its worth adding... I find designing prototype on the computer using CAD, or spending a few chf having someone put on a CAD your design, and then using a 3D printing service (shapeway is one provider) a great way to get prototypes. You can print in metal too.   
Good luck!

			Yes, there are guidelines in place.  If freelancing, then it is the service provider's responsibility to claim the income, cover his/her own insurances & social costs and deliver according to contract or agreement.   
For example, you hire a Allrounder to mow your lawn every second week.  It is up to the Allrounder to cover their own social costs and insurances along with report their income as necessary. When hiring, always try to get everything in writing - a contract to CYA.

			Hi everyone, 
I am thinking to start a small oil business.   
As far as I know it's allowed to transport only 4 lt oil per person, above this there is a tax to pay.   
At the beginning i will personally take care of thhe transport but i am looking for different transport solutions which allow me to bring here in Zurich more consistent quantities.   
Many thanks for you precious advices!!

Do they need to be ""employed"" by the company they own and pay themselves a minimum salary in order NOT to have their AVS contributions calculated on the basis of their wealth?  What is the minimum salary (per couple) as one spouse can be employed and they can be making sufficient AVS contributions in order to meet the quota for a married couple?     Are there any exceptions for entrepreneurs who are setting up a new business so that they are not considered persons without employment that therefore need to pay on basis of wealth?  Usually businesses take a few years to make a profit. Do Swiss have any benefits, tax breaks or incentives for new businesses being set up?       Does AVS contribution amount differ from Canton to Canton?       Does one need to pay where one lives or where GmbH is registered?

			It will be very unlikely that anyone will share any space with you at Basleworld - that is not how it works there. Although I do not know how the jewellery side is, in the watch area the cost of having space can go up to a million francs!! I know several watch brands who cannot afford space.   
What I suggest that you do is to arrange appointments with some journalists who write for Jewellery publications - try and find independents and they might take a photo and feature your product. Good Luck!!!

prestashop.com 
zen-cart.com 
magentocommerce.com   
There are ton's more actually & in case you cant figure out something they all have youtube vids especially prestashop   
In case of registering a business that too an online business I may be able to tell you a little more if I knew what stuff you'd be selling on your ecom website. For instance will you be selling things like clothes,shoes anything tangible or digital media (intangibles) like logos,domain space etc.     
Btw you should know that starting an online store is just the tip of the iceberg, the sites requires alot of dedication & effort to drive in enough traffic to actually make money,there is stiff competition so you need to have a very sound Online Marketing plan as well & yes you need to have a budget chalked out before you dive in.   
Hope this helped & best of luck

We pay VAT and duties at the border - we get the former back as we are registered for VAT, and as the latter is charged by weight and the goods are very light, unit cost is negligible, so we ignore it. We originally intended to distribute in Switzerland only, but are broadening this to Germany and Austria - new idea, less than 2 days. so details not fully worked out yet.   
If we warehouse in Germany, we shall still have to import, and we would need to find a bonded warehouse to hold the stocks to avoid paying German VAT and duty, and would have additional shipping costs from Germany into Switzerland, and then internally in Switzerland.  For the complication that this would add to a small business, we would like to keep it in Switzerland unless the alternative is hugely cheaper.

			Even though I've been reading a lot of posts here on englishforum, I'm new as a member of it, you can read more about me on my profile!    
Now to the subject!   
When it comes to starting a business here in Switzerland, there is a lot of good information out there, especially here on englishforum.ch, but a concluding and practical PDF/booklet in English is nowhere to be seen. I'd like to contribute with that.   
I've just started a project with the aim to produce a free PDF booklet concerning the start-up phase for a company in Switzerland with special emphasis on people coming from abroad. The main target is to build a practical, commercially neutral, ""handbook"" on which ways you could go and what to think of before and during the process of starting a new business in Switzerland.  
In this way I personally learn a lot about the swiss start-up processes as well as contributing to other entrepreneurs, a win-win situation!   
This is the point where I greatly would appreciate your help. In order to do some research and get in contact with people who has experience and know-how in this matter I've put together an online survey aimed towards entrepreneurs already active in Switzerland. You can find the survey  ! 
Please also help me by forwarding this link to your associates which you deem suitable for answering this basic form!   
Hopefully I will be able to post the final booklet here on englishforum when it's done!   
If you have any questions whatsoever, don't hesitate to ask me!   
I also want to thank moderator Mirfield for the feedback before posting this!    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Would you mind sharing your start-up know-how & experience?	"""tandvark"	Posts: 3	783	0	Business & entrepreneur

			Depends on your skills/experience/language proficiency.  As a ""third country"" national you'll come a long second behind the Swiss, EU nationals and people who already live here who have a valid work permit.  These groups must be considered for jobs first here, that's the rule.  So if you and a French national say, apply for the same job and you both have the same qualifications, work experience and language skills then the job must be offered first to the French national.  Only if he/she doesn't take up the offer - and there's no one else from said groups who've applied who can do the job - could the employer then apply for a permit for you.     
It's not impossible to find a job, just very difficult.  If you can find a niche in the jobs/career marketplace that isn't being filled then you could work towards that.  Otherwise gain as much experience/expertise as you can in your chosen field to make you more desirable to potential employers.   
You may need to think of this as a long term goal and not necessarily possible straight out of university if you really want to move here.

I am wondering if I could get some kind of leaflet or information from somewhere about 'what' we *cannot* buy and sell outside CH.  I need a list?   
I am NOT importing any goods or touching inventory in Switzerland. I am also not exporting any goods from CH.  Everything is 'outside' CH, and handled by FBA (Fulfillment By) Amazon.com (and/or co.uk). I'm organised with re: US physical postal address, invoices etc...all organised.   
Just simply want to know what I *can't* do from here in CH in regard to the above.

			Hi all,   
We have a company involved in e-commerce which is registered in Cyprus. I am looking for someone (company or individual), who is offering to co-share an office in the region of Vaud or maybe even Geneva so that we can have 1 office available for work.   
Cheers.

 My French isn't great at the moment, but I am learning. It's looking at the moment like it will be far easier to travel into France to work, I can find far more information & it seems straight forward enough to get my qualifications/experience recognised.

			Hello,    
I've looked through the threads on tax and can't seem to find any information for my specific situation..   
I currently work for 3 schools as an english teacher.I'm on B permit so obviously pay from the schools is taxed at source. However, I've just decided to take on private students, only about 4 hours a week.  How do I declare tax for my private lessons as it's all cash in hand?   
What's the process? Do i need forms etc? I'm terrible at maths calculations. I'm charging 60CHF per lesson.    
Thanks for your help

			Dear all,   
I am looking for a supplier (here in Switzerland or partly France) of used truck or bus tyres (NOT PASSANGERS CAR TYRES) suitable for retreading. 
I would appreciate any contact or a list of truck transportation companies or bus companies here in Switzerland.    
Is anyone familiar how PostBus company is operating. I am trying to reach purchising manager but meanwhile if any of you somehow know how it works. Are they using new tyres or retreading them, I suppose?   
I will appreciate any info.   
Thank you very much

I am a qualified accountant and I used to lecture in bookkeeping.  I was too busy to deal with the CH situation for myself until recently.  My accounts are so simple I do them myself using an excel template I have created.  This is real accounting for dummies (you know .... the old vertical columns/ crossed checked totals etc - from the paper cash book days)  but the figures are accurate, understandable and can be printed out all the way to P&L and Balance sheet.  You can just give the totals (that you know are correct) printed out for your accountant and this should save anyone money

Options are: 
* AG (company with minimum capital 100,000 CHF) 
* GmbH (company with minimum capital 20,000 CHF) 
In both cases you need a minimum of one shareholder and one officer who is Swiss domiciled.  If you are resident here you can be that officer, or you can engage a fiducuiary to do it for you. 
* Zweigniederlassung (branch) of an offshore company (no capital) 
* Einzelfirma (self-employed)  
I opened a branch of my UK company as it was the quickest option.  Essentially its the same as a GmbH without the capital requirements, although to register at the Handelsregister you need a lot of paperwork for the overseas company, proof you are resident, some hoops to jump through to establish that you are independent of the overseas company etc.  I did that rather than going self-employed as there is a lot more information to be provided to prove you have a viable business plan before they let you go self-employed as a non-swiss national.  But it is doable.   
After one year of operation I'm probably about to start a GmbH because there are some potential tax concerns regarding double taxation of swiss profits in the UK, and I'm moving between kantons and I need to go through all the same hoops and paperchase again if I set up a branch in the new kanton.   
Good luck!

			Not sure if this is a ""wanted"" or ""offered"".   
I have been running my branch office from home here in Immensee (SZ) for about a year.  We move to kanton Luzern in June and the apartment there is smaller so I need office space.  I have found a single room office in Weggis which is great, however as that is kanton LU I either need to set up a new zweigniederlassung or bite the bullet and set up a new GmbH.  Not a bad idea but more paperwork.   
As an alternative I have been looking for office space in kanton SZ.  I have found office space in Hohle Gasse (the tech park building), but it's 200 m2 which is about 10 times the space I need! It has two individual offices and some shared space.   
Is there anyone out there looking for about 180 m2 to rent in kanton SZ (between Immensee and Kussnacht)?  If so do they want to share?   
Alternatively does anyone have space to share/rent out for one-two desks in kanton Schwyz?  Preferably Kussnacht but other locations considered.   
Thanks

My search has begun again: 
and I will be looking at a place in central Luzern. I have 2 people interested in a possible share in the areas of music therapy for children and life-coaching for adults. [Depending on how many rooms & professionals are involved for a functional commercial share, I'm guessing rent could be around 400 or 500 per month].   
I'm still very interested in Luzern members of the forum who are interested in teaching, tutoring etc... and would finally like to make their own little business happen!   
NB. I have begun a website that I would be more than happy to share for advertising purposes for members of our shared space.

			The question is what nationality is your girlfriend?  If not from an EU country then she will find it difficult to get a job.  The rule is Swiss, EU nationals (except for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) and people who are already here with permits must be considered for a job first by any potential employer.  Only if they can't find anyone from these groups can they then apply for a permit for someone from the rest of the world.  It's time consuming and expensive for them to go through the process so they don't tend to do it unless the person they want is outstanding regarding skills/experience.   
Another site to try is  .

			Hi there,   
Thanks a lot for your commitment. I wrote emails to them. Except those organizations do you know where to find or how to find warehouses or companies that kind of products. I am a little worry if they allow me to check theirs goods by myself (I plan to check the quality in Switzerland before I make a final order). But, If I do not check I will never know  . 
Except used clothes I am looking for products from latests collections (outlets, last pieces, overstocks). Do you know if there is any company which is doing that kind of business (sells that kind of products)?   
Thanks a lot for help.

			The people who run Frau Meise in Baden should be able to give you some leads if you want to exhibit locally.   
Otherwise, if you're willing to travel to Fribourg, the   would be an option. Their website is a bit old-fashioned, but if you scroll down, you'll get an idea of what their space looks like. They usually display the work of 2-3 artists at a time.

			Hey stevesim, in fact there are a lot of businesses offering company incorporation services in switzerland like startups.ch, MAF consulting and others. Also this companies offer management services to take care of the business compliance with the goverment (declarations, taxes, regulations, etc)   
For an AG you need 100,000 CHF and for an GmBH 20,000 CHF, may be for the GmBH the legislation is more lax but for an AG you have to put the money into an special account (forgot the german name, sorry) and when the company is incorporated this money si sent to your business account, so you can dispose of it.

			Groupon has high profile enough. Ask both, they have very precise guesses on 
how many customers you will get! Do not forget it is a voucher and they make

			Susan, this may be a long shot - and I've never used the site for a similar purpose -  but since you mentioned a retired craftsman...   
Have you looked through the Rent-a-Rentner site?       
Browse through the listings, you might find a retired plumber, carpenter, etc. who might be interested. At least it couldn't hurt to look...   
While it doesn't look like you can post a job offered, look under 'Erfahrung und Know-how gesucht' on the right hand side. This is for businesses looking for something specific, but as your request is rather unusual you should write them anyway.   
Wishing you and your son all the very best.

			Since arriving in Switzerland nearly two years ago I have seen quite a few Expats having a crack at setting up their own businesses. I think that is great but I have noticed the same questions appearing after just a few months of trading and seen a few new businesses never make it past the first year. This is a list of some of the questions I wish I had asked myself before I set up my first business.         
  Is it because you would like some extra money, or because you have a brilliant and unique idea, or because you are sick of working for someone else. Whatever the reason make sure you have enough motivation to get you through the process of setting it all up and keeping it running. It helps to have a passion for it.     
  Do you have a niche? What is special about your product(s)/service(s)/business against your potential competitors? If it is a remarkable new idea  why has it never been done before? You will most likely be entering a competitive market so you really have to have a very strong selling proposition.     
  If you have a good idea of this before you start you can build your business around it. Around 80% of your time as a new business owner will be spent on finding customers and it is generally expensive to find them. If you are planning on e-tailing be prepared to pay quite a lot for leads  advertising on Google will yield a conversion rate of 2-10% - do you have enough margin in what you are selling to absorb customer acquisition costs like this?     
  If you are planning on launching a local business here in CH you have to do it in at least one of the local languages. If you are selling overseas, have you thought through all the logistics and complexities of marketing in foreign countries?     
  If you are going to have a retail outlet, your expenses will be high. If you are selling on the Internet you are entering a hugely competitive global market  will you stand out? Whether it is retailing or e-tailing presentation is absolutely key  dont bother joining the market with an average looking shop/website  you will not win many customers. Please dont do it yourself  it always shows.     
  Quite often a business can seem lucrative on the face of it but after you factor in all the expenses it is hardly worthwhile (I know this all to well from experience). Consider often hidden things like bank charges, FX commissions and rates, taxes and fees, delivery costs etc, etc. Also, have you considered how many units you will need to sell to make a decent living out of it (particularly after all the costs are deducted).   
  It pays to consider these basics before embarking down the very costly and time consuming road of setting up a business.   
  Please forgive me if I am stating the bleeding obvious and feel free to add to the list.

If you are simply disposing of surplus personal or household goods in a private capacity then the easiest would be to use an existing platform say ricardo.ch (the Swiss equivalent of Ebay). Only if you are doing it as a trade (purchasing/manufacturing/re-selling goods with a view to making a profit) will you have to consider the tax implications. Start small and see how it goes before making any substantial investments. If it starts expanding (may be you need to employ additional staff or you need to change the legal from of the business from ""sole trader"" to ""limited company"", or you cross the VAT threshold etc.) then it starts getting complicated and you will need specific expert advice.   
Any qualifying charitable donations you make (I think, up to 10% of taxable income) can be entered onto your tax form (or may be your partner's) to reduce the effective taxable income.

			Just to keep the forum updated (in case anyone has a similar question in future)...   
I eventually found a very nice office space.   
I was recommended a good relocation agent who helped me find what I wanted.   
The fee was one month rent. For that fee, the agent vetted about 40 properties and took me out to see around 20 properties on four different occasions. Once I liked a place, the agent organised the application, the contract, handover, utilities (tv, internet, electric, etc) and insurance.   
It was quite difficult to find something suitable in central Zurich that was less than 100m2. There were a lot of quite unattractive spaces available. And others were nice, but just didn't fit the bill for various reasons. Out of 20, only 1 or 2 were suitable.   
I ended up paying around 4000 CHF per month for a nice private space circa 100m2 in central Zurich.   
Nearly all properties were listed on homegate.ch. So you could do it without an agent. But if you are based outside of town, it is helpful to have someone else set up the appointments, drive you around and finalise the details.

			SBB rail network offers these kind of spaces on many bahnhofs, usually the most likely of them to be free are the less used or further from the major cities, in the sections of the older part of the train stations. The rent is very competitive to normal private entities, and with direct access to the train line. I have no link to them, but you can visit your local train station and inquire, google it, and even times they have postings with pictures at the stations themselves. Best of luck.   
Any chance you are at liberty to say what kind of work you will be doing there? I could be interested in taking a small part for an atelier myself.

			I am planning to start/ organise a indian food cooking class at my house starting next month. I am in Basel it will be only 15 franks per person per session. If anyone is interested let me know.   
The first is a trail class so It wil be only 10 franks enough for me to buy the ingredients I need , I would love to know if you would like to learn a curry dish or a rice dish. It will be quick and easy and since this will be home based it will be more of getting together and learning to cook at the same time to keep it casual and simple. All ideas are welcome as I am still in the working it out phase. I will only start with 5 people and then see how this takes off. I was thinking Monday the 7th of Jan 2013 in afternoon or evening. If that sounds good or any other suggestions to time and date and day let me know.

			Well, there're many ways to market your company.    
It depends on your marketing/adv/pr budget, the level of creativity you want, as well as your goal(s), your location, ect...   
Work on client/customer loyalty programmes, and this may be achieved in many ways. 
Make use of social media, and be creative. 
Events are also a good way to gain exposure (be a partner, a sponsor...). 
Create partnerships in the region you're in as well, they may open doors to opportunities, and allow your business to grow.   
There's more though but hope this helps!

But the devil is in details/quality, like Hyundai vs. MB. What kind of bike one's want to manufacture and sell, and how to market it?   
If you want the bike built for example with the Reynolds or Sandvik tubing, and Campagnolo or Shimano maybe fancy fiber parts, that is different product.    
If you target is the low-end market, and you are not bothered with terrible weld/paint works that is entire different story.    
So it depends, and how deep you pocket is.

			there are certain consultancy firms that will do a deal with a lower rate of commission if you ""bring"" the business with you to them. off the top of my head is 10%..    
setting up gmBh is more flexible but you do need to have all the insurances (liability, pension, sick pay etc) so it is a lot of work.. if you think it is only for 6 months then go to one of those firms, much cheaper that way. good luck.

Thank you for your post. 
We found that, in some European countries they just accept the Trademark registration without doing any research (whether it exist or not). eg:in UK.   
If i apply i do get the trademark registration but the other person who has the similar trademark must oppose my registration in court.   
But we also found out that, the other person who has similar trademark is belongs to common public property. 
eg: ""Mr"" is a public property and also ""Universe"". 
Those words cannot be accepted as Trademark registration unless you change your Nice Class, Goods & Services.   
we must have to change our classes as well and waiting to get the final words from the authorities

			You still have to file a US tax return which you probably know. Any days you work in the USA physically that income should be reported as US income, the stuff you earn while here is Swiss income. The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) would then be reduced slightly if you work a handful of days in the US.   
If you are well under the FEIE in total the US taxes are not an issue.

For example, I quite like the Villeneuve Outlet, near Montreux.  You can park your car once and you will find a Hornbach, an Interio, a Pfister and an outlet mall.     
Inside the outlet mall, there is a linen outlet that carries American and British brands of sheets in sizes to fit those sizes of mattresses.  There is a Columbia Sports outlet that carries all of their outdoor clothes at half-price.  There is a Navy Boot outlet that carries last year's Navy Boot shoes at ridiculous prices.  Plus, there is a tiny, Italian boutique with fabulous little dresses at crazy prices.   
The closest shopping mall experience that I have found is in Lyon, France at Part Dieu.  It's a legit 3-story mall--it even has a Disney store.

			Good ideas I think! 
Having an art business myself (photographer), I am convinced that key to success is on one side the market (and your way of approaching it), but also and similarly important is your passion and relationship with the subject. It's so important to have a relation to either pets (case #1) or to children's education plus animals (case #2). 
As you come up with these ideas I assume this is the case anyway. But it's important to keep it in mind and it will make your approach to it much more authentic and thereby easier to be successful.  
If you love it, go for it!

			Hi Shipsinbottles,   
I do not know much about this business but I think that there are many shops that would be interested in your art, there are also some artists that join efforts and show their works together: paper art and jewelry go together in some shops here in Basel, it is usual to see collective works from different areas together in Jewelry or Ceramic  galeries/ateliers. After reading your post I remembered some  local artists/shop owners that you could contact:   
Glass art 
Marianne Kohler     
Art Shop     
Jeweler 
Beat Lehmann     
Ceramic artist

Software algorithms are unpatentable in Europe, unless they form part of a solution to a technical problem, say, the means of regulating a functioning machine. (The USA is different in this respect). Processes are patentable, depending on the nature of the process.    
Next question; where? Patenting costs somewhere between ""a lot"" and ""an awful lot"", depending on the number of countries involved. If it's Swizzieland only, that's not too hideous, but once you start looking outside, prepare for seriously big bills.   
Should you (or anyone else) be interested in a particularly scurrilous little book on patents for non-patent people, you are welcome to PM me.

			Hey there, I'm a homebrewer from California, originally from Canada, and I am moving to CH this fall. I would love to get involved in a brewing club, especially to learn all-grain techniques and to use some coop-ed equipment. Is this plan still in the works?   
Right now I am extract brewing with awesome results, and I know that the only thing I'll miss about CA when I leave is the amazing hoppiness of west coast IPAs. Let's brew some! I'll be able to import hops on a regular basis since I'll be doing flights back to the US every other month or so.   
Cheers!

			Most entrepreneurs are born that way, you might be ridiculed (no, you will be) until you prove it, but that is, funny-enough a key driving force to making a success of oneself, for many people, even a look which says after you have made it 'I told you so' is priceless, it shines on the face of those many that do make it without a word being said !   
To gain credibility amongst investors you normally have to show a track record or have something so outstandingly brilliant that they will fight to get you...   
The beauty of a young person with a good idea is that they are uncorrupted, or even do not acknowledge the fact that someone is trying to corrupt them.. (you will soon start to recognize people that want to take you for a ride !)    
Keep pure and stay on target but always be prepared to adjust to market conditions, don't lose that anger because it can benefit you if channeled correctly....   
Onwards and upwards my Russian friend, keep your cards close to your chest and only trust those that are under contract or you firmly believe are with you because they want to help you, bring them with you, never rip them off.   
Never think that if someone demands a lot for their help,they are trying to rip you off, you are a risk and always will be until you prove otherwise, something of something is better than everything of nothing, a very important point...   
If you have cash to risk, no matter how old you are you can invest, if it's in a regulated market like a stock exchange you may have to use an adult account.   
Always speak to and get the approval of your guardians before you make any investment, nothing is guaranteed, prepare to lose as well as gain, if your a good investor you will learn from mistakes, a great investor takes a lose as a cost !

			Hi there! I have made a few posts re: visa issues regarding working as a foreign artist, but I thought I might ask whether anyone knows a bit about how the types of gainful employment that artists find in Switzerland.    
I am American architect moving to Basel Stadt starting in October. My New Zealander boyfriend would like to move with me and is searching for possible strategies to find either gainful employment, or a means to secure a residence visa in Switzerland. He is an artist with an MFA from NZ.    
Whether he gets an Artist visa or a trainee visa, what we both wonder is what kind of work do artists with his training background find in Switzerland. I am familiar with the architectural profession, but I do not have any Swiss acquaintances involved in fine arts. It seems that there are many opportunities to do a praktikum in  more ""applied"" arts like architecture, graphic design -- but I am not familiar with other opportunities related to the fine arts.   
Is it common that foreign artists cultivate professional relationships with a local gallery or studio for an exhibition or representation on a long-term basis?    
We would greatly value your advice on what you think is most realistic given the challenge of finding work as a non-EU citizen in Switzerland. Any contacts or resources would be much appreciated!

			I am not sure this is the right place to post my question (if not, I hope, the administrator will move it to the right folder):   
Does anyone have any experience with / knowledge of the Executive Master in European and International Business Law offered by Hochschule St. Gallen? Is it a serious program and worth doing, especially if your previous degree / experience is in a different area (Finance) but you want to move more into Law?  It is quite expensive (especially considering all the travelling that is involved), and I wanted to know whether it is going to be of any help after finishing it.   
Thanks in advance.

Business is about sales and marketing - doesn't really matter in which area you are involve in or whatever position you are in - 90% it is only about marketing and selling. The partner we are looking at is not just doing sales. He can specialize in another field. But on the start up he will have to be involved in sales just like all of us in the group. The partner who we will take on board will share the same percent of profit as with the rest of the board, same voting rights and ownership as with the rest of the group. There is equality and fairness plus an opportunity to expand on their specialized field - as the venture we are looking at holds a lot of possibility. I hope that clarifies your query.

			Unfortunately, the big problem is ""annerkennung"" or recognition. From what I have seen, it is more of a political problem, than academic one. The US does not accept other dental degrees, without re-qualification, and the Swiss do not accept the US degrees. (Politics...) However, if you have a EU dental degree, it is generally accepted here. This is not the case for specialties, like orthodontics. I have a Portuguese friend, with a orthodontic degree from Spain, now working in the UK for years, who would love to work here. However, the Swiss will not accept her advanced degree, and she is not a general dentist.    
I have another friend, who specialized in periodontics in Brazil, to later re-qualify in USA (married an American). Then, they moved to Switzerland and neither of her degrees were accepted. Poor woman!   
Best if your Texan friends contact the SSO ( ), which is the Swiss dental association, for clarification.   
As an American Hygienist, I was welcomed with open arms to several countries....However, with the admittance of the EU hygienists, it is no longer so easy to gain a working permit in Switzerland.  Lucky me, I became Swiss a long time ago.

			You are probably referring to this -   - which is what coined the use of the word ""lean"" in the context of startups in the first place. And you are off by thinking that you can get by just on mock-ups. Being ""lean"" is not about saving on the development, but rather about releasing unfinished work in progress to gather customer's feedback and adjust product spec in response to that.    
Mockups-only prototyping sort of kind of maybe considered as a ""lean"" method, but only to a very limited degree. No sane person would ever commit to buying a product (leave alone subscribing to a service) based on sketches alone.

I always have a full diary with spaces when/where I want them, only because after 4 years I manage it well, and think I'm the only legit' guy still working when I look back at those who were active when I started. There is a high turnover in the 'legit' sector though as folks see 'a gap' and try to exploit it. However people working on the black charging low rates for illegal work mean the 'gap' isn't really as big as it seems. I have more than enough work and actually put work to other people, normally to other expats, but the rates they expect are often unreasonable. Just the other week I got enquires for 3 'man with a van' type jobs that I couldn't do, so I made some calls and I went back to the enquirers with a new market entrant at the rate he wanted and 1 never replied an 2 said ""too expensive"".

			Hi there,    
To make it simple, i am on the process of turning my hobby of digital media (developing websites, creating graphics, editing videos, ..) into an official gig.    
I am a Swiss citizen (born and raised). I have applied for Registry of Commerce (Sole Trading), got aVAT number, but have not yet applied for any insurance. The sole trading would be part time work, as i will keep my teaching job for at least another year.   
I am looking for an accountant / business consultant that understands the field of freelance web services, knows all that is to be know about the Swiss tax / legal system.    
I will be using freshbooks ( ) for all of my book keeping / invoicing / project management, so someone familiar with this web app would be a plus!   
Because of the nature of the gig (part time, low income) I cannot afford expensive bills, so i would be looking for an affordable service.. :-)   
I am located in Clarens (Vaud) near Montreux.   
If someone is interested, please get in touch with me in PM or via this thread!   
Cheers!   
Simon

			Of course there are wholesales here for all sorts of specialist products. I wholesale food products from the UK and there are many more like me. Top CC are a Cash and Carry, a wholesaler of general produce related to restaurants and catering. We have a trade card with them and buy a certain amount from them but for some products we find Aldi (veg) and Denner (wine and spirits) cheaper.   
Just google the product types (in one of the relevant national languages) and you will find some of these specialist whilesalers.

			You'll need a food handling license, ask about it at your local Gemeinde office. An inspector will check your production facilities as well as your food handing and hygiene processes. You'll also have to list all ingredients on the jars in one of the official languages and if you're working from home get permission from your landlord to operate the business from there.   
I don't think it's a requirement, but for your own peace of mind, get your products tested at a lab to be sure what shelf life you can suggest. The food hygiene inspector might be able to suggest one.    
Good luck, and if you need any tips on what types of chutney will sell, do get in touch.

			Hi!   
I don't know how far you have gotten with this however i would be very VERY interested in being involved if you need a writer. I think it is agreat idea!   
I am regularly getting involved with 'start up' magazines, such as BreakIntoParis magazine which then seem to fall flat.    
I am dying to really get my teeth into some magazine writing long term.   
I would be able to contribute to anything related to local culture, music, spirituality, health and literature for example...   
Please do send me a message if you want to speak to me further!

			I'm just starting to explore this so I thought I'd ask here as well - does anyone have any experience hiring interns from EPFL, as software developers?

			I have a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in the United States that provides management consulting services to marketing organizations withing large (usually global) companies.     
I want to conduct business in Europe, and use Geneva as my base.  I have US clients that also have offices there.   
Can I set up a branch office, GmbH, subsidiary, or some other entity without employing a Swiss resident full time as a director?   
My intent is to retain freelance consultants to serve clients here until there is sufficient momentum to bring on full time staff.   
Similarly, can a foreign company set up a bank account in Switzerland or does that company need to be registered here first as a Gmbh or other business form?   
Thank you very much for your input.

			To start a GmBH here you must have CHF 25,000. CHF 100,000 for an AG. So to start the legal structure would be a GmbH.   
I agree with the suggestion of an online business. With CHF 40,000 you do not have enough for an office, inventory, or employees.

			There are a few. Key is to develop your customer base. Good luck with getting a straight answer, I am not sure that anyone serious importer will share their business secrets here. I know I won't    
But to point you in the right direction here are a few ideas:   
Go to the supermarket and see what you think is an overpriced product. 
Check out the supply sources overseas and calculate your landed cost here in CH. 
If there is significant gap between your landed cost and Swiss retail...I would suggest minimum 3x, probably more like 5x to de-risk your project, then you might have a product.   
So if you have found a product you need to investigate your route to market. This is the art and the skill that will make or break you. Go to Ricardo.ch, ebay.ch, scour the internet, search the phone book for companys who distribute this product and approach them for a price. Also visit their warehouse and see how much of a serious operation they are i.e. a serious competitor, or some guy selling out of the boot of his car.   
Do not make the mistake of creating a self fulfilling prophecy where you believe you have found the incredible gap in the market. Maybe you have, chances are you haven't. But that does not mean you cannot make money.   
Importing is the easy bit, creative commercial ideas to create demand is where the real value add comes.    
Tell me...do you have experience in running your own business and selling? Or is this a get rich quick idea?   
Cheers and good luck mate,   
Rich

			Hi,   
Saw you had no replys, I am not an expert in this area but can share a similar experience with customs and import and tell you what I would do in your situation.   
First of all, do you have a company structure? i.e. gmbh, sole trader? If not, then I wouldn't worry about it. To the authorities you are just a private individual going to France to paint pictures.   
If you do have a legal structure I would suggest you talk to the country from which you are exporting and the country to which you are importing.   
So say you go to holiday in France, go speak to the French Customs authority and tell them your situation and ask them for advice. Then do the same with the Swiss Authorities. They are surprisingly helpful and can probably address your concerns. If that doesnt work, go to a reputable art dealer, introduce yourself and ask them. They will probably be more sympathetic and knowledgeable.   
My guess would be that they will not be interested in you, or if they are then the only way to value your creations are at the cost of the input product, and if the input product has been used (i.e. transformed into art) then you are technically not importing that either.    
Good luck...hope this helps your thinking on the matter somewhat.   
Cheers mate

I'm practically open to anything- I just want to run something for children and bring parents together, I love to organize things and I'm crazy about working on a project. The only thing is I need somebody who would love to teach in english (I'm doing Czech sessions).  
PM me for more information.   
Take care, 
K.

			@nigelr I never planned to teach someone advanced stuff that I personally can't handle that's why I'm only interested to teach the basics of guitar work, how to get it going, perseverance, random tips, know the notes on the fretboard etc. Thanks for the reply, I'll certainly focus on getting a website and trying to advertise as much as possible...far from Zurich :P   
@Harriet and Patrick Thank you very much for the tips! I was actually planning to organize the teaching stuff the way my own guitar teacher taught me the first year. He did a great job in my opinion and the stuff he chose is really good for beginners.  
I don't plan on making it something big because time is an issue as I only have one year until I leave to UK to study. I know it is kinda contradicting because I would be leaving exactly when the 'business' could get going.   
So how do the taxes work for this kind of own-business? Suppose I'll have a website and a few potential students, what is the next step? I suppose an informal-business is always a possibility...

			A lot of this has to do with specifics I'm afraid.    
Firstly it depends what business model you have i.e Einzelfirma, GmbH or AG.   
Next the sphere of your business activities, amount of turn over and staff. Stock levels and values also.   
The building insurance for fire and natural hazards etc in most rental cases is down to the landlord but you must have liability protection in place and separate cover for your assets.   
Depending once again what you do you must have cover incase you cause bodily or property damage to a third party coupled with, if necessary, protection against Mr. G. Public suing you.   
If you want to PM me I will happily help you, we insure a lot of business as well as a lot of personal cases for forum members and my OH owns and runs 3 retail businesses in Zurich.   
Best, 
David

			Calling all fellow artists .. I am in the process of establishing an association of professional artists and designer/makers based in and around the region of 
Zürich.  This is to be a co-operative run by and funded by members with a view to holding an annual exhibition (I have a studio in Horgen which we can use for this purpose).   
The aim will be to celebrate the very best of creative work in the region and to promote individual creative businesses throughout the exhibition.    
It will be select.  Everything will be unique.   
The standard which we will set is an extremely high one - we will aim to attract the attention of a high-end client base. As an example of the quality of work , I shall be holding a solo exhibition at Villa Seerose in Horgen on June 14-25th where I will be exhibiting Oil Paintings, Ceramics and also unique, hand-made Rugs, inspired from my oil paintings.  Come along, have a look and make yourself known to me.  I will be in residence throughout the 
whole of the exhibition.   
You can preview a small selection of what will be being exhibited on my site... suzannecannon.com   
I welcome applications from Forum members via PM - members will be selected on quality of work and professionalism.  Example skills which may be represented in the group include practitioners in jewellery, furniture, ceramics, textiles, fashion, photography, sculpture, stained glass, 
calligraphy, wood carving, silver and mosaics.

			Hello All,   
This is my first time posting in this forum, although I have been reading it for a while.   
I have been in Zurich, Switzerland for about two month now - moved here about 2 month ago now, to open an office for our US Based startup that involves selling software and serves to the industrial sector ( focused on energy efficiency.   
I am posting here based on recommendation of somebody from the Zurich LinkedIn networking group..   
I have found the hiring environment in Switzerland to be different than some of the other markets we have been / are in, so our traditional methods aren't getting as interesting candidates as before.   
I am looking to hire for several positions, and any advice / referrals / ideas would be appreciated: 
1) Senior Turbomachinery Engineer / Sales Person 
2) Junior Application Engineer (masters/phD level) 
3) Marketing / Operations Intern ( to grow into a full time role once we are better established in Switzerland.   
You can look up our company at    
You can contact me directly at    
If you are interested or have any ideas, please send me your resume or contact me for more information. For Candidacy English and German fluency is a must.   
Thank You for reading.   
Valentine

From there, I simply pay taxes in the offshore country, whichever they may be and as long as I don't send, say, 100.000 kroner offshore, fly to the country, pay 10.000 in taxes, then come to Norway with 90.000, it should be Ok.   
The country I'm looking at right now is Cyprus, I've been there once (nice holiday) and it seems to be very low on taxes and very friendly for foreigners to start. Plus, if I do need to travel there, at least I can enjoy the beach a little.

			Hi,    
I am developing a concept for an integral project - creating a hub for connecting artists, creative businesses, entrepreneurs and their clients, which will be the first of this kind in Zürich.  This project will have several facets (arts cafe, co-working spaces, creating infrastructure for creative events, offering seminars, coaching, etc.).  The project will start locally but in the future have an international dimension (this is an ambition).  The physical premises have been identified, and the launch of the project on premises is planned for summer 2014, but marketing, seminars and virtual realisation can start earlier.    
I am looking for potential partners.  Ideally, what I am looking for is:   
1) some experience in creative business (experience in marketing and social media woud be particularly valuable); 
2) entrepreneurial acumen, execution experience; 
3) social skills, networking potential; 
4) willingness to co-invest and assume a co-execution role from the early stage of development (must be in a comfortable financial situation, as I know not everyone can afford luxury to work unpaid until the project brings fruits).   
If you are interested to dsicuss this project, please PM me, with a brief introduction.

In a fund this does not exist at all... As you say if the funds return 3-5% then you are headache free.    
The return on investment from a purchase is however much greater due to leverage of investment. ie you invest 100K for a 500K property and your return is 6.5% of 500K which equates to 35% of the 100K investment. Unfortunately you also have to pay the interest on the loan amount but never mind, you should still net over 10%... In Germany this figure is typically over 30% - that is the difference that 1 or 2% makes on the yield...

			To the OP:   
EF is not the ""we know all about starting a t-shirts business"" forum, so you need to accept that people give you the best advice they can.  
If you need more specific advice, go to a t-shirts related company and speak to the responsible person directly, don't come here and get pissed when you don't get 100% what you asked for.    
Calling people f*gg*ts is a bad idea, I don't think your prospective customers will like that at all. If you want to rant about something, please go to the Complaints Corner and don't bash the people who are trying to help you here.   
Read   and learn that before you start a business here.

We have started Italian language school. Meanwhile, earning something on babies/children photography.    
I think in the next 6 months my girlfriend will start speaking Italian so she may try getting a project as a freelancer. I am sure that when she shows her portfolio the customers will love the touch.    
So we are staying optimistic and that is a key to success.

			I can see from an earlier thread that in Switzerland Parallel imports (so called gray market) is allowed.   
My understanding is as long as I pay all taxes at the border etc then I can raise the price a little bit and resell the items as new.   
Is there anybody on the forum who is doing this or has done it and can confirm please? I already import for my use but don't resell, which I am considering changing, but want to make sure I keep it straight.   
The other option is to import something for me and then use it for an hour or two so I can sell it as ex-demo to get around the rules.   
Everything will be music related (guitars, amps, strings etc). I have done this in the past for a couple of guitar builders but I had exclusive rights at the time making me the official distributor, this time would be different.   
Anybody here selling on the gray market?

			I sympathise with any professionally trained person having to jump through these hoops, especially after decades of practice. I hear it's the same for dentists. However, given the reputation of say, the UK Chiropractic governing body and the current legal drama regarding ""bogus"" claims - being able to treat asthma and such - I'm glad the Swiss do what they can to protect patients from sharp medical claims...

			I think it's helpful to understand salary discussions as negotiations where the HR person is the buyer. He will want to hear the price first, consider if it's too expensive (may be good quality but we can't afford it) or too low (something wrong with the good offered, really desperate for a sale?). If it's outside the range the HR might tell you or just walk away from the deal, if it's within range he/she may give you a concrete offer.  
In many countries there are much smaller bandwidths (or none at all) for anything below exec positions, in CH even normal office jobs have a rough 3'500-7'500.-/m range.

			Well, I would suggest going for an Sàrl rather than going as an independent. I have been working for 2 1/2 years as an independent, currently working to set up an LLC.   
Granted that the tax rate for an independent is lower than for the Sàrl, but there are a few other advantages for setting up an LLC.   
1. Working as an independent, you are not allowed to pay any unemployment deductions; thus, you are not entitled to any unemployment benefits if your business tanks (regardless of whether you've worked 6 months or 10 years). 
2. If your revenue exceeds CHF 100'000.-/year, registration at the Register of Commerce is mandatory. 
3. As an independent, you are personally liable for any debt you get through your activity, thus meaning, the ""Office des poursuites et faillites"" (My apologies, it's impossible to translate that into English), but basically they can and will repossess any personal property from you. 
4. Non payment of social charges is a penal offense (Fine or imprisonment depending on gravity and amounts)   
Now, the conditions and advantages for setting up an LLC...   
1. As you have mentioned, the CHF 20'000.- minimum capital is true, however it must be liberated at 50% at time of start-up and any subsequent debt must be paid until concurrence of the capital remaining to be invested. i.e. if you start with a capital of 20'000.-, invested at 50% (thus 10'000.-) and after six months, you have 50'000.- in debt, you will only be liable for 10'000.-. With an Sàrl, you cannot be personally liable for any debt, unless it is foul-play. 
2. The 3 client rule does not apply 
3. There is no longer a minimum capital limit (formerly at 2'000'000.-) and you can start an Sàrl alone (as opposed to the old law which required 2 people minimum) 
4. The LLC requires two bodies: a General Assembly (you are allowed to be a single share-holder) and an Administration 
5. The registration at the Register of Commerce is mandatory 
6. There is a state tax (between 7 and 10% on profit) and a federal tax (8.5% flat rate on profit) 
7. Your company name is protected on a national level 
8. An LLC requires statutes, approved and signed by the General Assembly (yourself if alone) 
9. Capital may only be invested in property, furniture purchases 
10. When working for an Sàrl, you are an employee of the company, thus you get a fixed monthly salary with payment of all Social charges 
11. Non payment of social charges is a penal offense (Fine or imprisonment depending on gravity and amounts)   
Hope this helps...

			Hello,   
I am a relatively new business owner,  .  I am looking to expand some of my line into possibly some ""bespoke"" themes. (ie. not all commercial: Disney, Nick Jr., etc)   
Does anyone have any contacts in the following areas:   
1. boxes: for printing various pictures or designs 
2. bags (canvas/cotton): similar to above, printing, designing   
I have some concepts, but I am not sure where to go to work out some ""rough Draft"" designs.   
Cheers,

I've made backyard ponds and raised fish for years.  My father also had his own fish farm in Thailand.  The future farm is an aqua farm combined with the hydroponics for plants.  The fish waste feeds the plants and the plants feed the fish and so on...

I went to the Office Cantonal de la Popolation and they told me I have to fill a form and send it together with a justification letter, a sort of business plan that explains what I want to do.   
Is there anyone who has done so, do you have any suggestions on how to get accepted? And most important, do yo think my idea would be OK? (I have a relevant Italian degree and experience, but no Swiss certificate).

The basics concept and application is fine (as per the many tutorials on youtube-however at your suggestion will scout a bit more in depth here too).

			Things are getting interesting.  I've been approached by a local guy who came up with a really interesting concept that was implemented as part of a university course.   
He's been sitting on the idea for a couple of years, but it complements my project perfectly, I met up with him Friday, we're going to meet again this week to see if we can make the two things work together.   
He seems to have some sort of company that was setup as part of the university project, although it may now be alone operator sort of thing.   
I'm keen to go forward, the guy seems genuine, I could talk to him and he had a good grasp of the field, it was strange to talk to someone who knew what I was on about.  Many of the things each of us were working tie together nicely, in concept at least, in practice, of course, therw could still be problems.   
If I do move forward, this is going to turn into some sort of informal company for now, while we see if what we want is possible (I think it is, though niche market), is there anything I should worry about?

			From my very expensive experience in my first year here, use an accountant thats been recommended by someone you know WELL. my business turned over about 7000 in the first year and my accountancy fees came to about 20,000ch. A company I would definitely not recommend based in Martigny.

			Hello,   
I know there have been some threads here on similar things but I haven't found specifically what I'm looking, hence the new thread:   
  Im a EU citizen, living in Vaud, single, with a B working permit (I have a full time job) and I want to start a small business. 
  Questions: 
  1.       Can I open my business  and continue working as until now (the full time job)? Is it allowed to own a company and have a B permit for some other work place? (I would like to mention that I will be working alone and I will not have any employees) 
  2.       In which canton is better to open the business (tax perspective, law, etc). I would prefer Vaud as my residence is here. 
  3.       Any legal advice/help I can get in English from some consultant/agency? Any contact details you can share with me?   
  Thank you in advance, 
   VVA

			I'm not sure where to put this so mods please move as appropriate.   
I'm just setting up a small tutoring business for primary school children.  I have a C permit and I'm a qualified teacher.  I obviously have my own health and accident insurance but do I need any kind of personal insurance to protect the business/ me should someone decide they don't like the results?  Obviously I would hope this never happens but I'd rather be prepared!   
Also can anyone recommend an accountant in the Zurich area who speaks good English (as my German is rubbish) who could help me set up the AHV side of the business.   
Many thanks.

			It's entirely possible, and not usually desirable, to be resident for tax purposes in more than one country. Where you pay tax, and how much, is down to tax treaties. Usually, you'll pay at the higher rate of the two countries.

			Before starting any major business plan exercise, which consumes time and resources, I strongly suggest you do a very rough calculation, based on best estimates.   
Try to find out what the rough investment cost will be; then try to gauge the rough operating cost of the business. Finally compare it with the expected revenues from your sales and verify if the margin and payback time justifies proceeding further: 1. with the business plan (fine tuning of the above) and 2. with starting the actual business and operations.   
Needless to say: allow for contingencies and unexpected costs (they vary depending on industry)

			I agree - even if the employer mentions that you should inform him of your second job ""Nebentätigkeit"", it's usually quite easy to get a standard form from your HR responsible. Once you get it signed by your superior there shouldn't be any problems, as long as your second job doesn't conflict (timewise/ conflict of interest) with your primary job.

			My suggestion would be to find a country that has the best trade agreements (lowest tariffs) with Egypt. Im guessing this is either Italy or France. Then ship the stuff there first to limit the amount of duties you will pay on it shipping it directly from Egypt to Switzerland.    
The other thing most Turkish merchants do here in Switzerland is set up a holding company that is set up in Cyprus. This company buys your goods at cost and then sells it to your company in the EU that is a duty free entity, for the price you wish to sell it for in CH.   
So you buy $1Mn worth of goods from Egypt. Well it to a company in Italy for $2Mn. Then the tax free entity in Cyprus pockets the profits immediately. Then you resell the stuff to the Swiss SA for $2.01Mn. Then when the inventory is all sold you can do it over again.    
Most Turks typically trade their stuff through Germany though. I think thats because of the import tax system there but some also import Brazilian Chickens through Italy. So you need to find out who has the lowest import duties first.

I was sent your thread from my mother in law as some inspiration as I would also like to start a playgroup here where I live near Zurich. I am american and now ch with two kids one going to Kindergarden soon and the other 18 months. 
I have thought about it and researched into the law and requirements so am up to date with that, and it would be great to get started... I just was wondering if you can give me some tips and and to answer a question for me... how is it with finding a location? 
I checked out your website and found it great and intriguing...  
Looking forward to some tips hopefully on how to get started!

I am looking for companies and organisations here in Switzerland that are working in the field of Universal Design - Design for all (Zugang für alle).  
And preferrally not only around eDesign, but rather in architecture, product, interior etc.    
If someone know something about this, please let me know.    
I will perhaps study a Master in Accessibility and Inclusive Design (distance from the UK) and would like to have either a part time job in the same field or at least have a company/organisation to learn from.    
Thank in advance,    
Have a great friday!

			Company and other taxes are indeed higher in Germany, but that is not the relevant question.  If you form a company, it's to do something you couldn't do yourself.  Ideally it's a means to collect an investment, and then use that investment to do something large.  During the buildup phase,  your company should not make a profit, or else it is not efficiently structured.  Any profits you make (from sweat equity, or whatever) should be ploughed back into the company, to develop products, markets, or what have you.   
The real key is one of double or triple taxation.  If you have to pay taxes on money when your company earns it, and then pay taxes on it when you pay it out to implement your investment, and then again when you receive the money, say as an employee of the company, then it's a losing proposition.   
There are accounting rules that allow you to avoid this under certain circumstances.  Switzerland (in particular Zürich) are very picky about limiting these circumstances -- forming a company in Zürich is not something I would recommend.     
Other cantons (and perhaps Germany, I don't know) are much more flexible about such things.      
Zürich are very good about recruiting local subsidiaries of large international companies to come here, but they get tax holidays of 10 years, in return for agreeing to employ a certain number of people out of the local market.  Such deals used to be available to small companies, but no more.   
These politics are likely shortsighted -- the canton of Neuchatel did the same thing back in the 80s, bringing a bunch of microelectronics companies in.  After the tax holiday expired, the companies simply left.

			Hi Geo 039,   
I am a California lawyer living part-time in California and part-time in Basel.  I can go over the pros and cons of setting up a US LLC with you if you like.  I set up LLC's in various states.     
Regarding the IRS, US citizens are taxed on their income worldwide.  Since an LLC is a flow-through structure, meaning you report the income on your own tax return, it doesn't really matter if you form one or not - at least for tax purposes.  You can deduct the expenses of your business regardless of whether you run it through an LLC or not.  The LLC protects you from liability and also gives you privacy, depending on the state in which it is formed.

1097	09.11.2011, 02:20	Junior Member	Thanked 39 Times in 24 Posts	Location: Zurich	"      No, not really, but I didnt search for it. In german there is some web-sites that mentioning it.   
  You see, a lot of info is just copy pasted on 90% of web-sites, and very often is not correct. Even  very reputable companies doing that. Recently for example I had to proof hard to someone about Macau branch taxation exempt. Absolutely wrong info almost everywhere.    
  I think this point was clarified in 2008, when they allowed Ich AG, but actually there is nothing about restricting non residents from sole proprietorship in a Swiss Code of Obligations, in contrast with companies requirements .         Yes, but you forgot about magic Burmese week gap.         I didnt like an idea telling this at first  place, but there is actually nothing to hide, so I will   
  I know, it looks confusing, but I had an intensive consultations 2 years ago and I was planning to register one, for a purpose of getting residence after one year as an exceptional, useful to canton economic, culture and so on. (Article 19 of Aliens Act). In my particular non EU case chances of approval was about 99%, but for a number or reasons I give up that idea.    
   First of all I didnt like an idea of surname attached, besides person can register a trade mark separately, second is that they told me that generating 80k+ a year may not be enough, 120+ will be better, but the last, and most important thing is that there is no hallmarking at Cointrin and no free zone at Kloten, and because of that it would be very complicated to run it distantly. Of course there was other things to do as well, but that part of work was also important for me.   
  Then of course a global crisis point, some priority changes so I decided not to take chances.   
  But registration for non resident is absolutely possible. There is a need for address and fiduciary, but I strongly suspect that only address is good enough.        l , I think this is very important.     Expresseintragung

			It's not necessarily the customers which are the 'problem'. I think the law says somewhere that there should be a 'view of the outside' from the workplace and 'daylight' too.  Mind you, being Swiss law, it only says something like 'as a rule' not 'always, in all circumstances'. So if it were claimed that the worker who was 'condemned to the cellar' could walk round the garden for five minutes every hour, that might then fulfil the letter of the law.     And of course, the fact that someone runs a business or shop in their cellar doesn't mean that the law knows about it and has given its blessing.

			Hi again bobo_97, 
Costs of setting up an Einzelfirma (sole tradership and not a company)and registering are more or less as follows for Zurich: 
 You will need written confirmation from your local authority (Gemeinde) which costs about Chf 31. Requirement as to what this is is shown clearly in info sheets published by the Registry. Link already given by jrspet 
The Registry itself will charge you Chf 281 which includes a commercial register extract.   
So, about Chf 310 and you're up and running in ZH.

			Hello George,   
Thanks for your reply - I'm a UK resident at the moment. Since posting, I've had a bit more of a read on the forums and from the looks of it the only way this could work for me would be to set up a Gmbh for swiss contracts and work through that - but this obviously requires quite a financial commitment, without even being sure how easy it would be to get regular contracts. Perhaps a chicken and egg type of situation but maybe I need to get one of those first before I stand any chance of swimming out of the shallows.   
All the best,   
Joe

			The advantage of being self-employed is that you don't need and accountant or any set-up costs. You simply ask for (or download) the extra bit to your tax declaration ( ) put in your income and then deduct all your expenses, depreciation, travelling costs, computer costs etc etc. And pay the social contributions yourself.   
If you turnover is above CHF100k you will need to be registered for and charge VAT. If your turnover is over CHF200k I would suggest forming a company and getting an accountant as if you mess up the tax and/or AHV the amounts involved could be large.   
This has all been covered many times before, see search function...

			If you're employed, then AHV is deducted from your taxes, your employer pays some AHV, you have a different pension regime, and you're restricted on the expenses you can claim.   
If you're self-employed, then you pay AHV - the overall take is less than for an employee, you can offset more against pension   you can claim more expenses.   
That's why they don't like people being employed. I work through my own GmbH, so they don't have the same problem with me.

			You sure? I can work supply and avoid a teachers pension scheme easily I suppose. I've decided to buy a house in the UK. However, some Swiss companies pay out and some don't. Spoke to my current pension company today, they wont pay out so have advised me to transfer my pension back to my original company (libre passage) when my current job is finished. The original company do pay out if I buy a house in the UK. So just make sure you ask your pension company in advance and work out if you need to change it.

			Hi, I too was looking into this some time ago. A lot of people use an ""écrivain public"" (a kind of ghostwriter) and there are a few set up here and there. The niche in the market is that it's non-existant for people requiring text in well written English.  
You could check out the ones around Suisse Romande and see if they have a need for an English writer. It's better to share a potential customer in a non-competitive area (since not the same language) than not being able to offer full service.

Can I keep my GmbH going in Switzerland if I am no longer resident (no other directors or employees but existing revenues expected to continue/grow locally in CH).  I may even hire someone locally soon?

			That website was where I got a lot of info about the various markets. A lot of smaller communities or villages also have Advent or Christmas markets. You really need to check out the individual websites of different communities where you might want to try getting a stand. As for the larger markets (listed on that website), if you are looking for something for this year, you're probably out of luck. The deadline for applications can be as early as June. It's still worth it to try, because there are sometimes cancellations.

			Do you have any special skills or experience that could help you narrow it down a little?   
Just as a comparison for your maths - there are approximately 36 000 Brits here in Switzerland. Its probably fair to assume that only half would regard themselves as ""expats"" in the sense of not naturalised here (ie not in need of ""expat services"")  - so your service needs to be scaled to one that would serve AT MOST the population of a small town but one that is spread from the centre around 3-4 hours drive AND hasn't been done by anybody else before. Thats a tough ask to make successful and viable

			Maybe I've deleted a thread about GmbH owner's liabilities too quickly, because I've found partially contradicting information.   
First, the   (national languages) mentions at least the possibility to increase the holder's liabilities by designing the bylaws accordingly:      So are GmbH bylaws usually crafted to avoid this?   
Second, this website (German, chapter 2 and 3) mentions a liability difference to incorporations with consequences for the GmbH if specific holders can't pay unrelated debts - the other way around, so to speak:       
I'm not sure how relevant these points are but wonder if there are other ""bootnotes"" worth mentioning?

Yes, it has high traffic, and assume the price to match but have no idea, guess only the agent could properly advise you on this.  If you are selling a niche personalised product, I think Carouge suit much better, but that is just my opinion.

But I do notice the nice ones and find a way of thanking eg next time I'm on line instead of on phone cheap tickets to an event or something. Helpful advice has a value - and what goes around comes around :-)

You might get started by talking to your Geminde. There's a requirement for minimum number of qualified staff per children. Also if they're there longer you have to have some cooking facilities and these too probably have to be approved. You have to worry about whether the existing location will be approved for a daycare too.   
Here's a link in German with some of the regulations:     
Best of luck in your venture!

			Hi,     
I am looking for (possibly) German speaking person to join forces and start small Beauty/Massage Therapy business in Zurich together.     
Currently I do massage and Nails (ITEC Irish Manicure and Pedicure course lately) and would love to take more courses to offer variety treatments and better service in the future. It all depends on the demand and if there will be a place and people to cooperate with.   
I was thinking of renting 1 or 2 rooms in Zurich (with good access to parking space!) with someone who is either a Body Worker or certified Beautician to share the costs and join forces in enriching treatments offer.   
I live in Zug and it is too small for serious business if you are only one person with no huge funds... also renting a ground floor space will be rather difficult.   
How about doing DeinDeal? 
Being busy and creating something from the scratch with another professional is my main goal for now.  
The money from CityDeal/DeinDeal is not brilliant but I really enjoy being around people and it is SO MUCH BETTER than staying at home in Zug     
I don't know much about having this type of business in Switzerland... I assume it might be more complicated than I expect, as always  but I hope to find some advice here and/or someone who will be eager to give it a try. I am open to all ideas.   
Izabela

			I am an independent professional in the lausanne area and have just received my workpermit and can operate now in switzerland.    
Now I am looking for an accountant, preferably a small office or an independant person. My administration and yearly taxes will be straight forward. Does anyone have recommendations? And do the hourly rates differ a lot between accountants?    
Second, can I do the quarterly administration and VAT declarations myself and have the yearly balance sheet and tax declaration handled by an accountant?     
Thanks a lot for any referals and answers to my questions.

			a major flaw in the idea is also that most foods are not RFID tagged and the tags (AFAIK) do not contain expiry date information. I can't envision anyone bothering to type in or scan in their food when they put it in or take it out.   
also, what about if you take something extremely perishable out of the fridge for too long e.g. cream. is your fridge going to monitor how long it has been out and the temperature the item has been exposed to? is it going to say it is ok to eat and are you prepared for the lawsuits to follow?

			Hi Everyone,   
Firstly, apologies if this is not the right place on this forum to post  this as I have looked and not found an exact place to post this, so  please bare with me..   
I am a self-employed businessman from London. I have my own online  business [selling stock across the globe from my website and via the  ebay uk portal].   
Business is running fine and making money.   
As this is an online business, I know the rules and facts of living as a  self-employed person here in London, what I need to pay, how it works  etc.   
The question I have is, transferring what I have here and coming over to  Switzerland. My fiancee has a contract in Switzerland which is for a  few years and she is going to be based there. I can run my business from  anywhere in the world. The stock that I have doesn't require much space  and as I import it from other countries, it can be arranged to import  it into Switzerland instead of London. What are the complications with  this? If any?   
How strict are the authorities for importing? Reselling? Postage for parcels across Europe and ROW?   
I know I am asking for a lot of information here but after extensive  research myself, all the answers are not as clear. I have a fair idea  but from people living the same kind of life in Switzerland, hearing a  view from first hand would be apprecaited.   
A few facts to consider for myself: 
Turnover currently in the region of £60k a year. 
Have a Limited Company Registered here in UK. 
Business Bank Accounts in UK. 
As my business is run from a standalone website as well as ebay, 40% of  earnings are made through ebay uk, with paypal all registered here in UK  linked to my business accounts.   
Any help is appreciated. If you need any further info then please ask.

			Thanks for all the comments received. There are obviously some bigger business brains on this forum than mine! 
So I'd like to pick them a bit more if that's okay...   
If the guys in England were willing to sell to me, but ship to another address outside of CH, and then I were to arrange to have the goods shipped here to sell to CH customers (therefore not giving their CH distributor the business), could I legally sell the stuff, which I would obviously be selling at a much lower price than other retailers that buy it from the CH distributor?   
I guess I have to talk to them directly to get some answers, but I'm not sure how to approach them   "	null	null	null	Is this really how it works with distributors?	guest	null	3,488	38	Business & entrepreneur

			Be carefull though: many jobs in the field of therapy/pedagogy/medicine/law etc.. require here an official authorisation. The authorisation to have an activity as a therapist is given by the canton where the job/business is. The authorisation is linked to the possession of a specific diploma. 
Here is the official link where you can find further informations.

			My experience of tax authorities in different countries is that their primary concern is that you are actually paying tax somewhere. Once you convince them that you are paying tax in a country then it gets a lot easier.   
After that it gets down to fine tuning about which country should you pay tax in & what concessions you get.   
There are double taxation agreements between UK & Switzerland so you will not pay tax twice.   
If the payments you get from Switzerland are classed as salary then I suppose they should be deducting Swiss (at source) tax & AHV etc. Don't know how this works if you do not have a Swiss work permit.   
It would probably be easier if the payments you get from Switzerland are classed as consultancy fees paid against your invoices.   
With this approach maybe you could send one invoice now for the year to date & maybe then you are able to claim the earlier payments were payments on account so hopefully you are not in trouble with UK PAYE. I suppose this would only work if you were a sole trader or Ltd. company.   
I assume you have other work in UK & are currently paying taxes so you should get some sympathy from the UK tax people because you are not a tax avoider.

			You can get a work permit immediately with your EU citizenship, this is not a problem at all.   
Now concerning massage therapy, it is my second profession, and I'm still figuring out how it works here. Maybe someone with experience going through the process can shed more light on the subject ...   
From what I figured out so far - Switzerland has two massage therapy professions. One is called 'medical massage therapist' (Madizinische Masseur in German) and is regulated title and practice. The other is not regulated and called 'professional', or just 'massage therapist' (Berufsmasseur).   
I'm still not quite certain if the regulated title is part of the medical services (hospitals etc.). 
The second one however is very similar to how it works in North America - your credentials are evaluated by a professional association. Becoming a member gives you the right to issue insurance recipts covered by your clients' complementary medical insurances.   
Found two professional associations for complementary medicine which certify several massage therapy techniques: 
[HTML]http://www.asca.ch/[/HTML]  -  those guys have the site in Italian 
[HTML]http://www.emr.ch/[/HTML]   
Maybe there are more organizations, don't know.

			Entirely correct for chomage/RAV point of view   
If you work 100% for one particuar client, it may become difficult to prove you are independant company and not an employee in disguise.   
Whatever you hear on this forum some of it will be true and some total rubbish, and all shades of gray in between. Fatmans post is true,    
Go get professional advice, pay an accountant for his time, go with your list of questions and you'll get some idea of what is possible for your personnal situation.

			I have people working for me few hours just once in a while. I pay them cash and ask for a receipt where it is mentioned: date, hours worked, name, address and amount. No need to do a contract. In my case I also do an insurance against accident, which is a general insurance for temporary workers and it is pretty cheap. You pay a fixed amount at the beginning of the year and at the end the insurance company based on the hours declared do the balance. All insurance companies can do it.

			Hello Everyone,   
I recently was asked to organize 'Artist' Way' group based on Julia Cameron's classic of the same title. It's a 12-week creative recovery process that could be done on your own or in a group setting, or as Julia Cameron calls it, Creative Clusters. Currently there's no 'Artist' Way' groups in Zurich and I feel that there's an amazing opportunity to celebrate our multi-cultural richness through our individual creative self-expression.   
Personally, I went through the 'Artist' Way' process both individually and in a group setting and the depth of my inner creative discovery that I found on my journey continues to unfold in my life. I'm an intuitive artist mostly working with mixed media, acrylics, and collages. I moved to Zurich this spring from Chicago where exhibited my work both in group shows and individually.    
My love and passion is to share the ebbs and flows of the creative process with fellow creatives ~ I have written numerous articles on both art making techniques and the adventures in creative self-expression as an ongoing journey. I also taught art making workshops to small groups and companies.   
I don't have any dates set yet for the 'Artist' Way' group to start, however, first week of November should allow everyone to purchase a copy of Julia's book. If you'd be interested in joining the group please post a bit about your creative path or send me PM.   
Tatiana

			You can get an MBA for as little as 2000 dollars these days.  This will not help your job prospects or your learning.  Check out the times newspapers MBA lists for quality.   
What do you want from the MBA? The piece of paper, job prospects, learning, etc, etc.   
There are a number of quality EMBA around that have different formats.  Some are 1 day a week, some are weekends and others are 3or 4 days blocks every couple of months.  There are also (I understand) a couple of quality distance learning MBA around too, but it comes back to the first question; why do you want an MBA?

Africa is a continent not a country. The continent houses 7 of the worlds top 10 diamond producing countries. An estimated 65% of the world's diamonds come from Africa. 
If one refers to conflict/or blood diamonds in Sierra Leone & Angola (countries), I agree with the above statement.        
Diamonds are priced according to Cut 
The beauty of a diamond resides not only in a favorable body color, but more importantly in its optical properties   
Color, Clarity, Carat Weight, Table Width, Total Depth, Pavilion, Culet, Fluorescence, Symmetry, Polish (and markup)

			I have worked as a contractor in Switzerland for some years, and most ""agents"" deduct silly percentages, they do pay all the standard insurances that an ""employer"" has to cover, accident insurance etc.... But generally do rip you off. You may want to check your contract before going about this. As every contract I have had and it's quite a few now have a clause, this is the general translation from German to English. ""You cannot sell yourself directly to the company"". You can take direct employment with whoever you are working for but you cannot ""contract"" directly to them.   
The payroll management company should be able to assist you on telling you whether you can or not.

			Could be quite easy really: Net profit-expected expenses in Switzerland would give you a ball-park figure. You do not have to set up a company in Switzerland and continue to bill via your entity in Morocco. In any case you would have to look at the tax rates and deductibles that would apply in each case. If you go by the Swiss (corporate + income) taxes are lower cliché, you would have to weigh the added expenses (rent, living etc.) in Switzerland.

			If you are talking about customs, then the answer is yes, for all commercial transactions; The same applies to VAT.   
If you have a storage centre in Spain, then I would suggest exporting it directly from Spain to the customer in CH. Quite a few online companies have set up shop in the EU, where the goods are packed and dispatched to CH. I am unaware of delivery times with Spanish postal companies, but unless you have inordinate delays, I would retain the dispatching centre in Spain. However, if you are adding some sort of added value to customers in CH, it may be preferable to retain your base in CH.

			Make sure your contract allows you to do it and that there won't be any conflicts. For example, even if you are doing it on your own time, if you are using company equipment (a laptop, an internet connection, a pencil), then most likely it belongs to the company. You can consult an lawyer to be sure.

			Simply put: until you have a firm lead generating system you DON'T have a business.   
Here's what you can do: 
1) create a killer front-end offer 
2) choose a pool of 5/6 ways to funnel prospects to the offer 
3)  do your math and: 
-> if you break even or miss it by a little: keep, optimize and repeat 
-> if you don't break even: stop using the media for now 
4) wash, rinse and repeat from 2 until you have a good lead generating system 
5) work on the back end  
6) reap the rewards

well if it already is a restaurant (take away) then you should consider startup cost to be the  
fond de commerce (dont know the german word) which is simply the buisiness and not the walls. They are once again extremely overpriced. then there is the permits you need which do not come cheap. It is diffeent for takeouts as you only have to pay to get it and not follow classes.    
Then you should have enough money to not make a single dime for 3-6 months to survive. So yes I am gonna stick to my number which would include a 100k fonds de commerce

			Hi everybody   
My career started badly, as I wasn't sure what I want. I entered into a company job working on desk. But that used to be very boring for me and I never used to enjoy. Then I realized that I want to get into health care career. But again studying 3 years that to leaving the existing job was very much difficult for me. So one friend of mine suggested to go for online course. She suggested me the following site which consists of all the details about medical lab technician career. 
I took admission in this course and I was able to continue with my job also. I completed the course and now working as a medical lab technician. Though it was very late to start a career, but I'm happy now. I would say that it's never too late to start a new career.

			To the OP...   
Right after I first moved here, I put an ad on craigslist.com (of all places!), offering to tutor in English in the Zurich area. I specified that my rate was ""negotiable.""    
To my surprise, I received a response from a Swiss man who was going to be transferred to the US for his job and was wanting to improve his English before he moved. We met once per week for the next year. I charged 40 CHF per hour -- a rate that even he admitted was quite cheap. But since I had no formal training or much experience in teaching English (apart from some tutoring that I did in university), I felt that it was best to keep my rate relatively low.   
Anyways, it all went very well. My ""student"" was just happy to have a native English speaker to converse with on a regular basis (and in the end, I even felt rather bad for charging him!). But I did find that teaching English is, indeed, quite challenging. In particular, my ""student"" seemed to have the most difficulty learning the irregular verbs, so we focused quite a bit on those. But by the end of our year together (and to my relief!), he agreed that his English had greatly improved.    
I wish you much luck with all your endeavors!   "	become a little unpopular	Join Date: May 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	English Tutoring Ideas?	"""der_jerebear"	Posts: 37	2,211	13	Business & entrepreneur

But when you can apply online it's 24/7 access, versus in Switzerland where you have to make an appointment and take time off from work just to get an answer because they aren't open past 18:30 or on weekends.   
Not that I personally care anymore.  But it's a difference worth pointing out in a discussion about how technology is being utilized.

			OK I'm really looking to move now... am considering these hosts:              i tried to do a 5min comparision - and yeah it's rough as i'm pressed for time - but here's the low down (hey it might help someone...)   
looks to me like metahost.ch might just be inching out the others... hoststar a mate uses and their control panel and setup is quirky - certainly NOT easy to navigate and their domains are pricey...    
hostpoint doesn't support ssl email which is one of the reasons i'm moving from current host.   
metahost / metanet seems to have good services is a bit cheaper but lower space - however i host all my photos elsewhere ( ) so i think i should be right.   
any opinions / suggestions anyone??

			ok if you are swiss that changes things. I promised myself I would never work in a hotel or bar again due to the horrible lifestyle and low pay. Salaries are low compared to what you can do with it. if you can live with the rents then you can save ....but do you really want that  .   
The masters is like I said, you will still start at the bottom. As the guy/girl above me did and make your way up. Masters will only speed up that process and allow you to go up higher.    
Also in the hotel industry it doesnt really matter what your position....how many people do I know that got hired for reception ended doing up housekeeping several days a week.  
It is a fun career but so filthy, unfair, ungrateful, and badly paid. once again, IF you have the chance go to azie or middle east when you still have the chance. with your experience and the masters you will go up much faster there....but again no family there....

I want to set up as a therapist in Luzern.  I heard about the possibility of co-renting an office, which would be perfect for me at the outset.   
Does anyone know of these arrangements?  Like renting it certain mornings, other afternoons?  Ideally, I would share with a physio or something like that - some practitioner in the health professions.  There's no way I can afford to start out paying 100% rent!

			Hi,   
I have read the forums extensively for a few months now and havent seen a  post that quite covers what I would like to know, so thought I would  ask here. This post is a bit of a crossover between business &  permits so wasnt sure where to post.   
My soon to be business partner (EU national) and myself (South  African national with UK ILR) are both UK resident and investigating  starting a business based in either Zurich or Zug (CH for various  strategic reasons).   
The business will sell online hosting services to clients worldwide,  but mainly EU based. We will have a completed business plan and  required starting capital before making any applications. We would both  want to be living in Switzerland close to the offices, etc.   
From what I have read so far: 
- We can use startups.ch and a notary to form a GmbH, of which we could both be directors (need one Swiss resident director?).   
- It should be quite straight forward for him to become Swiss resident  as an EU national (needs to register with local gemeinde).   
- I on the other hand will likely have problems as a non-EU national. I  would need to apply for either a L or B (short or long term) Work  Permit, plus a Residents B Permit.   
Questions: 
1. I am wondering if actually getting the required permits for myself  will be very unlikely and/or near impossible, granted that this is a  startup company with no trading history, etc. What will the authorities be looking for? Also, I take it trying to apply  myself would probably be unwise and I should use an agency for this?   
2. I have read about some programmes that the banks sponsor for startups  (ZKB, etc) and found some angel capital & VC associations, but it would be  nice to hear from someone who has done something similar in CH. Is access to capital  for tech startups harder to come by in CH than for e.g. in the UK?   
Any other general advice or opinions very welcome too    
Thanks!   
Regards, 
Andy.

			Hi,   
I'd say you also want to to check out the various exhibitors at the wine fairs - e.g. Zürich and Basel - to see what they offer and what niche you could fill.   
PS. At the Basel Weinmesse, we bought SA wines a couple of times from these guys:  . Perhaps have a look at what they offer and see what you can do differently.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Setting up a Sarl (limited liability company) - warning not to pay any fees which would indicate a payment to commerce registry.    
This is unfortunately a common practice - once you establish a company, you receive couple of invoices, which look like official commerce registry payment slip, with the amount (600 CHF - 800 CHF) also indicating that.   
Please make sure your notary will gather all the invoices for you and send them in one package, including his fee. Do not pay anything else.

But 99% of the market isnt about over-insuring things that are going to go bust. When a bank or insurance companies fixed income department wants to juice up its yields they sell these derivatives and earn a fixed income on these CDS's for the life of the contract. In other words, all of these Italian banks who have been selling Greek CDS's are earning 20% per year, out of thin air!    
Oh, and the other thing. When an AIG has problems with collateral the insured client doesnt demand more of it. He simply goes to JP Morgan and buys CDS's on AIG! He insures against his insurer.    
But when these guys do have to raise more collateral guess what they do? THEY SELL EVEN MORE CDS'S..... That earns them enough money to cover their shortfall. Money out of thin air.    
Its a $50Trillion market. So if banks and insurance companies earn an average 200bps per year on issuances that means CDS's make up $1Tr worth of bank revenues yearly.    
In other words, banks are addicted to them. If you make them illegal credit spreads for crappy stuff like private equity will double, and banks will lose $1tr annually of revenues.    
Its an addiction that will eventually destroy itself.

			I am planning on setting up an online shop for flowers with direct imports and now looking for a business partner who lives in the Zurich area (need to get to the airport) and is willing and able to spend 2-3 hours a day, once it is working - not meant to be a full-time occupation, though things may change if business picks up. It could be someone who has worked in the floristic or artistic field or has a taste for it; a knack for online marketing (web sites etc.) would be an asset. As this would also involve getting corporate customers on board such as companies, hotels etc., it will be necessary to sell successfully. There is a whole range of things that can be done to add value, so ideas and solutions would be well received.   
Anyone with time and dedication for the long haul, the flair and taste for saying it with flowers and an entrepreneurial spirit with business acumen, please contact me via PM. So if you plan to make that change, are not a serial entrepreneur (compulsive!), but would like to branch out, we could meet up, discuss expectations, hopes, visions and dreams and move ahead, if we agree. Looking forward to responses!

I wrote the rest if you have any idea, I strongly believe that we different people could have unique idea since they take look from their own point of view.  
The business plan is not about the real one and therefore I there is no previuse experience. 
In other course which we had (entrepreneurship) I gave an idea of running kind of conference and professor as was the same and knows about my idea sk me to write a business plan for it as well. 
Basically I need to write a business plan for a typical conference,therefore as an initial point I have to know about the regulation for start-up company and running a conference. 
If you know any website which is written about this kind of regulation it could help a lot.

			Ladies,    
For the executive women seeking a job in the CH market, you might be surprised to find out that only 2% of executives are female. That fact aside, a newly transplanted executive must really leverage their female and male networks from their previous place of residence.   
Here is how I landed an executive job at a large company - I used my networks from the US via LinkedIn and Xing to set up many informational meetings.  Many executive jobs are not listed, so this is a great way to get to know of the unlisted ones. Second, I told several of my friends back in the US that I was moving to CH, and they reached out to their professional networks. Professional networks the world over are quite small, so chances are that someone within your contacts back home, is connected to your new home in CH.    
Also, I joined the  . It is great!    
Ladies, please share your tips!

			I phoned the client and they said the letter is all they needed. They ask all people who work for them to provide proof. It is basically to make sure they don't land in hot water as Papa Goose mentioned in his post.   
Now I must think if I should register with Handelsregisteramt too or continue to keep things simple.      Slammer are you from an EU country? If yes then it should not be a problem.

			I would be VERY careful using a sole proprietorship.   
You are completely liable for damages (as is your wife/husband). So, if one of your clients decides that you are to blame for their online business not doing so well, you could find yourself with a world of pain and expense in the Swiss legal system.   
I would suggest working as a freelancer though a management/payroll company (e.g. Accurity.ch) or using a gmbh (more expensive to set up, but you will sleep better).

			My ergothérapist (who has a wide experience in advising patients on how to price their work) tells me to price my jewellery by adding the cost of materials plus 14 chf per hour for 'artisanat' (which I think in this case means jewellery that has taken some skill or talent to produce, as opposed to just threading beads on a string).

			There is a place near us, near the French border, which is for sale at a very reasonable price and could be ideal - right on the famous Route des Cretes/Jura walking and cross country skiing  TransJurassienne trail - with great cycling and VTT all around. It was a Sports Centre, then was a Asylum seekers place for some years. PM for more details and to see if you'd like to come and have a look at it this week-end? It is at the location 'Les Cernets'- half way between La Brévine and Métabief/Jougne French ski resort.

			Hi Anna,    
Getting a commercial space in this area is very expensive. Typically you have to buy the goodwill, normally called the fonds de commerce or something similar. This gives you the right to get the space and fixtures and fittings, nothing more. You then have to rent the space.    
This practice is both techincally illegal and rampant. The problem is that there is a chronic shortage of shop space and a lot of people with a lot of money to spend to get it.    
You are doing extremely well if you can find a space without paying this charge. In central Lausanne this can be anything from 60,000 for a shoe box to 500000 for something more interesting.

			I have an epson ink jet and I wish I had gotten a laser. I like the quality of the ink jet, you can print photo quality, really beautiful high resolution images but for text, it's not as crisp on certain papers because the ink can bleed. I wouldn't really recommend it for business cards.    
I have 8 ink colors and in order to get a REALLY great printout, you have to have fresh ink in each color, you also have to run the head cleaners which can waste a lot of ink. Each cartridge is about $15.   
Toner lasts a lot longer and the printers tend to have better networking capabilities. I have a NAS that I connected my ink jet to and it works well but I've been too cheap to buy ink for the past couple months so I haven't been printing.   
I got the ink jet because I wanted to print my photos and frame them and it would have been great for that purpose but I never used it that way and I ususally end up printing internet articles and proofs for clients. I have printed a few decent size jobs and the ink really does not last long!!    
The good thing about it is that it can handle a lot of different types of paper and paper sizes, I can even use rolls of paper which is not possible with a laser. Epson sells a lot of great art papers, but they are quite expensive and changing a paper roll is a hassle. I think I lost some of the parts I need to even use a roll.    
I have printed cards on my inkjet and I've had good results. You need an exacto blade to cut down the cards to the right size. If you buy the pre perforated paper, it's always too thin for my liking. I have seen people handout worse but I always think that person must be a real cheapo.   
Being a designer, I send everything out to online printers unless it's a proof or it needs to be on specialty paper. In that case, I bring it to my friend who is a printer. You can get 1000s of cards for under $30, why waste ink? For small runs, I go to a printer with a nice digital printer. The printers at Staples (or whatever local print place) are usually a lot better than we can afford at home, they rent Xerox DocuColor and whatnot.   
digital press is good quality now a days.   
goodluck to you!

			Is your mountain hut fairly isolated? Far from other vacationers?   
If so, advertise on the pet corner here, and with dog clubs.   
Seriously.   
When working with my Extreme Belltie, I could not use the recommended training technique - ignoring the little s*d - because of fear of disturbing the neighbors. So in desperation I decided to take him on a training holiday - up on the top of a mountain, far away from civilization and delicate ears.   
I was looking for an isolated hut in the mountains - just a basic four walls and roof over our heads, nothing more needed - and I was surprised how few were to be found. As I asked fellow dog owners for tips, many said ""what a great idea, gosh I'd like to do that too, let me know when you find a place...""   
Who knows - could be a niche market just waiting for you.   
Good luck!

			The swiss property market is not good for buyer's agents. A buyer needs an agent if there are hundreds of object on the market and going through all of them is time consuming. it's also useful if the buyer would like to negotiate more efficiently. In switzerland, there might be only ten objects at a given time on the market for a given region. Negotiation is also difficult.   
Furthermore, Vaud has very peculiar laws, especially for condos. For example the sale of many apartments needs to be pre-approved by the Canton which can take months. You will need to learn all this if you don't already know about it.   
And a final thought. In Vaud, the buyer pays about 5% of the purchase price for taxes, notary, etc. which is usually not financed by the bank (meaning that for property of 1million, the buyer need 50k (cash) on top of the 200k equity). Not sure many buyers would agree to pay an additional percentage to an agent. Perhaps there are more opportunities as a simple consultant charging a flat fee. you would explain the process, give them tips and maybe help them with some calls, but they would ultimately be doing everything (because there really isn't that much to do besides visiting all the 10 properties on the market).

			Hi all,   
We run a small professional services company with IT centric perspective. 
(Managed IT services, simple and advanced hosting, and IT support)   
I am looking to find one to two small companies that may want to share office space in the Zurich Kreis 5 or 6 area.     
We could get by with 4 rooms for our company but I imagine that we would be sharing a space that would be quite a bit larger and share conference resources, infrastructure, and have a larger outward facing network.   
We would also like to be in a situation were we could host small events and public co-working events if the space allowed for it in a secure way.   
If you or a company you know may be interested, contact me.

			It certainly sounds like they are acting illegally but it depends on the details. Basically with the recent revision of the Swiss Cartel Act and the Notice on Vertical Agreements, the legal situation is much like in the EU.   
Price-fixing is very frowned upon and is generally on the so-called ""black list"", that is things that are illegal even if there is not a huge impact on trade or on competition.   
Here is the relevant article from the Cartel Act (this is clarified in the Notice I mentioned above but that is only available in German, French and Italian):  "	earned the respect of many	Join Date: Dec 2010	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	My naive business-mind	"""chrisinzurich"	Posts: 220	3,194	34	Business & entrepreneur

1275	24.03.2011, 11:39	Senior Member	Thanked 174 Times in 101 Posts	Location: Zug	"    You're right, the topic is complex as everyone has a preferred method of organising a holiday. Ours is just one way it can be done and doesn't suit everyone. It is popular in the UK because of the way the Brits travel, therefore I wanted to test the water to get an overview before i head out to do more research on this topic here.   
The Exosphere business model in the UK (which i am looking to see if it is worth replicating out here) is that of a consultancy. We are pretty unique in the UK, which is why we have been so succesful in the 4 years since we launched, because we are flexible. Given that the vast majority of travel companies here in Switzerland seem to be shop front agencies i think we would be unique here too.   
We don't contract specific product so our client's choices are not limited. At any one time we can be working on an enquiry/booking for a villa in the Mediterranean or ski hotel/chalet or a safari in Africa or a cultural holiday in India or a weekend in St Petersburg etc. We are able to do this as our expert knowledge is of the industry as a whole and then each member of the team has specific destination knowledge. If we don't know somewhere we know which travel companies do have a specific knowledge, which ones are good and contact them on your behalf.    
We are a small team with a small number of high end clients and 80% of our clients are repeaters (industry average is around 20%). We have the time to get to know them and their travel habits inside out so they benefit from us being able to organise a holiday suited to them every time. They also know they only have to make one phone call/email to us and we will do all the research for them saving them time.    
At the end of the day our service won't appeal to everyone but as we are a small independent company we only work with a small number of clients anyway to keep our service levels high. Our growth has been entirely through recomendations and word of mouth so i know that we do works.   
Anyway enough of my ramblings. That probably gives a clearer picture of why Exosphere so i'll leave it there.

			Hi,   
I think Ittigen has a good point about paying down your debt first, but as a sometime musician I do feel for you. When I was in a similar situation a few years ago (in the UK) I got around the guarantee when I rented a farm unit as a recording studio by paying a years rent in advance. Maybe you can try a similar thing here rather than paying somebody a deposit to act as a guarantor.

So basically if I have a job where I'm not taxed at source I can work outside of that (provided it's not more than 100k a year) and just add the extra amount to my salary when filing a tax declaration? It sounds amazing!   
Can someone help me what happens if I'm married and my salary is declared on my husband's tax at source sheet (i.e. he is taxed on both our salaries)? I suppose we'd have to file a complete declaration to be able to add the extra money I would be earning as a freelancer.

			Still recommend you do it properly with the AHV office at least.    
Before the last 'expel those horrible foreigners' vote, the Beobachter magazine tested the SVP proposals (which was incidentally voted in) for pretty much day-to-day misdemeanour scenarios to see what the result would be. Well, a fictitious unemployed Portuguese chap (who was born here and had never lived in Portugal) would have been booted out as he committed the heinous crime of helping his mate one sunny afternoon to fix his roof. He earnt a few hundred smackers for it cash in hand and 'forgot' to tell the AHV office.    
Your situation is different I know, but AHV contributions (or lack of) are taken seriously.

Secondly, I would take a crash course in Swiss customs procedures because you need to understand your liabilities importing through supplier declared values, which could lead to a fiscal and/or other audit. Otherwise, in Geneva we have an organistaion called Fondatec of which I am sure there is an equivalent in other cities, who are there to help you with business plans, financing etc etc. Hope it works and I hope its legitimate!

if the goods are fake then you'll get a nice big bill from customs with a note telling you they have destroyed them, and they grass you to the trademark owner, who'll also bill you.   
see     
helping someone out like this always backfires, you are taking all the risk, not your mate, the bills will come to you, not him.   
and not being funny here, but just how many swiss people are going to buy cheap cosmetics from singapore??   
I did it the other way round to you a few years ago, a mate in the uk wanted me to ship him as many nintendo wii's and ds's as I could get (he owns game distribution co. in the uk) and even though he setup dhl coming to pick them up every couple of days and did bank transfers etc etc and we agreed beforehand that any DOA's where his tough luck it was still grief, grief buying them, packing them, waiting for dhl, checking bank transfers, filling in customs forms etc  and still having him moan when deliveries where late, somthing was missing, a box was damaged etc etc, it would also have been quite difficult to explain all the large amounts of money that where going in and out of my account should anyone have come sniffing around.

			Many of these shops are cheap because many people have tried and failed at these addresses.    
Today we go strolling in city centres when there is no traffic, ie on Sunday when the shops are closed. I believe the age of passing trade is coming to an end.    
My approach would be to set up a website, or even sell your art on   If you are unsuccessful there is no charge.    
Another point is that many restaurants and hotels display art for sale. What better way to sell a painting than to have somebody sit in front of it for 30 minutes? I do think the picture frame is equally important.    
These ventures will cost you very little, and you would remain in control.    
Do you know about the Kunstsupermarkt in Solothurn in November and December?

			Hello all.   
I'll be establishing a GmbH in Switzerland so that I don't have to be a male relo hausfrau when we arrive. The biz plan is being prepared (easy since it's just a description of my existing business).     Sure, I'll get the docs notarized and reviewed but, I loathe paying a lawyer some exorbitant fees to open his file cabinet (digitally) and pull out the same form so that he can fill in the blanks for me.   
Many thanks!

			You could also think about outsourcing - financially similar to leasing in that you do not own the servers & you also have the possibility not to have to house them in your own premises.   
Residual values of servers are basically zero; there is practically no market for old servers.  The price/performance ratio keeps improving plus the clever server vendors offer cheaper maintenance on what they sell directly & pretty high rates on used systems (plus maybe inspection fees).

Membership is open to individuals who:   -  Own and operate their own professional services business; and   -  Operate in the Legal, Tax, Finance, Accounting, Business Consulting or related fields   The purpose of the group is to facilitate the networking of like-minded professional service business owners in order to build relationships and alliances among Members. By aligning your services with other professional service providers, you can offer a greater breadth of services to your customers. Members can leverage each others business networks for mutual business growth.    It is anticipated that the group will meet once a month in Zürich.

A small fee to cover admin expenses will be charged to Members in attendance at each meeting.   We anticipate the first group meeting will be held in March/April 2011.   The group will be coordinated by Cherie Lehman (TP Services GmbH) and Amanda Gore (Global Forensix GmbH); however we will look for input from Members to guide us on matters such as selection of guest speakers, and other group initiatives.

			Good afternoon,   
I have question related to operating a business while being in Switzerland on a carte de legitimation. 
I was looking through forum and the yahoo group - and I'm thoroughly lost. Also, the volume and amounts are really not worth the price of a professional at this point. However, I'd prefer to keep things in legal status.    
How would i deal with the following types of income, while in Switzerland. I'm non-US, non-EU person:   
1st - Adsense income  (from google) - servers are currently in US 
I'm thinking about registering a corporation in either Delaware / Wyoming / Nevada - opening a business bank account in US and having adsense income deposited there. It'll be taxed in US federally at 15% (<$50k). I think I shouldn't owe anything in Switzerland, since there's a tax treaty and there's no business activity in Switzerland.    
2nd - web development / SEO activities - non-Swiss clients -same as above.  
Swiss clients (companies) - I'm not sure if it's possible to invoice Swiss companies as a USA corporation without Swiss presence  - my biggest question. At the same time, I could probably convert my wife's carte de legimation to permit Ci and create gmbh- although I'm not sure if it's worth it  - since according to my research it's 20k CHF minimum for a basic corporation structure in switzerland. What are my legal options? (such as using a local registered company for payments).   
Can someone please help me to think this through?    
Thank you in advance

Wooden handicraft items make very nice souveniers that people buy on holidays in moments of madness only to put them on the mantlepiece where they gather dust for a number of years before being promoted to the cellar, respectively the rubbish bin.   
Sorry to be harsh, but unless you have been to the palce where these things are made they don't really have too much other use in my eyes.   
Providing they are not made from forbidden substances (read ivory) you don't need a license but you will need a freight forwarder to custom clear the marchandise on arrival.

			I think some of the entrenched entrepreneurs here would probably find this of interest....   
Check out this organization, Kickstarter - they basically give you an open stage where you can illustrate your project and try to raise funds:   
(this is the example of something where I pledged some $$ hoping it will take off and I will be able to buy the product).   
Some have been hugely successful, like this guy who designed a wriststrap for the ipod nano, and raised almost $1mm!     
Up to you, now!

If the alternative was   income, or shelving library books for CHF25/hr, then of course CHF45/hr starts to look pretty good*.  It's all relative.   
* although not quite as good as it sounds.  Like she said, that's per classroom hour - you then have to spend extra time on preparation, marking, etc. which is all unpaid.   Factor that in and you might very well be talking less than CHF25/hour of actual work.

			When I bought a motorcycle (new) in Italy, I had to get some paperwork prepared by a commercial expiditer, cost around CHF 100.   
Then I had to go do the commercial importation, and pay the VAT (in cash, CHF 1500 or so) and some small amount of customs charges (I can't recall but it was CHF 40 or so).   
If you have it shipped, the shipper will do the paperwork, and add it to your bill, and you will get billed for the VAT and customs charges.

			Hello everyone!   
I just had the Idea to open a small liquor store in the canton of vaud, due to the fact that their is a lack of nice liquor stores in the area where I live. I was wondering if anyone can help me with what would be the requirements to open a liquor store... and I have some specific questions:   
1. Could I keep it open until midnight? 
2. What would be the starting expense for a small one? 
3. Would I need the same alcohol license as for a bar?   
If any of you have any advice or can help with this please reply to this thread.    
Thanks in advance

What you need in case of both FL (Fürstentum Liechtenstein) and the Emirate of Zug, is a legal address there, and not just a POB. Many notaries and lawyers there have, at their entrance, dozens of companies indicated accordingly. One customer of us has a CH-6301 Zug address, another one a 6340 Baar address. All invoices are issued to the legal address, but sent elsewhere, in case of the 6340 chap to Wil/SG and in case of the 6301 one to a Hinwil address (his notary partner).   
Btw. just compare Liechtenstein with the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey and you have it     FL in fact  a member of the EEA, and via its customs and currency and postal union with Switzerland is linked up with the EU etc .  FL far earlier than CH became a full member of the UN .   
One point however should be considered. While people in the Cantonal administration of Zug of course are able to read French, and those in the Cantonal administration of Geneva German, it is to be made clear that official language in the Canton of Zug is German (only) and official language in the Republic of Geneva is French (only), which means that their forms are in just the one official language. And that the taxes are a Cantonal matter. Which roughly means that a Geneva office of a company with its legal base in Zug should have some personnel acceptably fluent in French and Standard-German, because all the printed info from Zug will be in German only.

			Hey Guys   
I am working for a Swiss start-up company connex.io ( ) with quite an impressive story ( ). connex.io cleans, completes and updates your address book automatically by using resources that you already use.    
Right now, we are still developing our products, so it is not available yet. We are developing our product further as well as trying to uncover what people think and expect from us. I was wondering whether anybody could give me feedback about our venture and our product? I ask here, because I believe expats are probably people who would use our product the most, thus give better feedback.   
You can mail any feedback to  .       
Thanks!   
PS: If you think the product is cool, you can sign-up to be a beta tester, which would help us even more. 
Michael   
You can also help us out by filling out our questionnaire.       
Thanks guys!

1. I have a B permit and for example a have a Suisse partner - what type of company is it better to open for us?      The B Permit (if from EU) allows you to open a business, but has no influence on the type of business; that depends on what you want to do.   
2. How much taxes for profit? and what type of taxes there are?  
Like 7.6%?   
3. If I open online shop do I need cash register? Or not?    
4. What are the rules for importing watches from China and where can I get this information. For example in Russia there are different type of taxes for each type of comapny and for each import good.     You pay import tax.   
5. How can I open my company? Should I go somewhere?       You need an accountant (Treuhand in German).   
6. Should I have capital 20 000 ? Or not? and if yes why? there should be a reason why?       You must have 20000 for a GmbH (limited company) but not for a sole trader.   
7. If I import goods for 1500 USA Dollars where should I pay taxes and how can I do it?       The customs will send you a bill!   
8. When my B permit will be finished but I have a business can I get again B permit?      Permits are not automatic and do not depend on the business, but on you! You must be able to prove that you can support youself.   
Ohh. I have so many questions but this are the most important in the begining.    
Also I ve found a lot of links but if you could sent it will be great..   
Thanks a lot   Is this the place to lengthen the post?

			Hi   
I don't know if there are any in CH, so you might actually have a niche there. I've just ordered one from the US and if it wasn't for our beautiful wedding photos the price would've put me off for sure. =)   
I thought Hungary was a lot cheaper, so I checked there... and was shocked. These babies are really expensive!    
But I did love the platform I used to order from the US, I didn't have to download anything and the suggested designs were really nice, though I ended up changing a lot.   
Some things I missed: The leather cover was only available in burgundy and black, while with weddings being far the most profitable events for such companies I would've expected to find white among the colors. Also, sometimes the options for arrangement were not so many, I don't know why a sole pic in a row, for instance, could not be centered. But we still managed to come up with a gorgeous album, though for such a price I wouldn't have ordered anything less.   
I hope this helps, if you need the website just PM me. The experience was really good, and I do wish they were CH based or cheaper. =)

			hi :     
as you guys might know, it's much easier for foreigners to acquire office or other kind of commercial buildings in here in Switzerland, rather than apartment buildings.  Relevant regulations are much less restrictive.     
A problem that I'm currently encountering is that next to a couple office buildings, I was assailed with landlords having big pieces of 'buildable' - need help in here as you see - plots.  Has anybody heard of non-CH people acquiring and developing CH plots ?

anyway for 8% if it was guaranteed, then yes, i could be tempted to go with it. but as economisto said, how much time do you have to invest to make only 900chfs? 9000, then you're talking. the truth is that there are often much better investment options.   
8% very, very low risk? i can potentially see it for a non-scaleable business. but when i hear 'very very low risk' it translates into my brain as 'i am a very very naive person who hasn't considered all the risks' or 'i think you are a mug'.

			Hi! I'm a singer-songwriter new to Switzerland this year. [ZH] I am actively seeking performance opportunities in ski areas, so that I can perform and ski all season. I am especially interested in venues with a mellow vibe, or that specialise in acoustic music.    
I sing and play Guitar as well as Piano, so places with a Piano are a plus!   
Any advice/links/tips are appreciated!   I am open to any and all areas/cantons.   
If you are interested, you can hear my music here: myspace.com/ranjitranjit   
Thank You!   
Ranjit   
ps- Moderator - Please feel free to repost this in the big ski thread if you find it appropriate.

			Hi, hopefully this will help a bit.     
Much to their surprise a friend of mine got a work permit as an ""independent"" in Geneva based on the fact that he was working with expats in English and therefore he argued that his work could not easily be done by a Swiss Citizen. (his is a Brit frontalier living in France).    
In fact this was the easy bit.  What was much harder was that they required a Geneva business address as they would not provide one for a Frontalier living in france unless they also had a Swiss address.  He explained that he works in people homes so has no need for an office.  To be honest this took months to sort out and eventually they accepted a friend's address to be used for correspondance only.   
At the start he had only a couple of clients and it was not an issue with the authorities that he did not earn much.  He also had one client in France at the time and this really confused the officials.  In the end he had to lose that client as they refused to issue the permit if he was also working in France.   
I hope this helps, good luck :0)

			There are two types of license associated with labour Leasing. The first just allows Labour Leasing with people already in Switzerland and the other allows you to Labour Lease with people from any location. I needed the seond option for taking resources from the UK whcih sounds similar to what you are planning.   
I hope this helps....

			Not to be confused with a 'shelf company'. A 'shell' company or a 'front' is what it sounds like...   
Often used to create an ownership structure for various business entities that allow for better tax concessions, or to separate the individual, who may be wealthy or vulnerable, from their business risks...

			I have a labour leasing license for my Swiss company. It took about 4 months to come through. You also have to appoint someone to your company who has experience of operating such a license unless you can prove that you have such skills.    
There is a whole lot of complexity around providing resources on daily rate basis into Switzerland. You have in theory 90 days in which you can provide such resources via a UK Ltd company but this mechanism is really designed for Consultancy operations who provide such services on a fixed price basis to milestones within this 90 day period. The penalties for non compliance are pretty severe: Up to 100k CHF for your company and up to 100k CHF for your end client.   
Finally, the 90 day rule is for elapsed days, not working days. If you are staying here full time then you have about 3 months to get a license sorted out. Also the 90 days is shared across all employess coming through your UK company, not per employee. If you have a large team you can quickly run out of time. You are probably notifiying migration in blocks of 6 weeks using a special form. Migration tend to pick up on this form and will often investigate companies using this notification for long periods of time to see if they are operating 'correctly' so please take care with this.   
To arrange a Labour Lease license you need to put a bond of 100k CHF down which is refundable when you wind up your company in the future. This is like an insurance for the government that they will get paid employee taxes etc should the company go bust for whatever reason.   
There are other quirks to watch out for e.g. you have to pay out within 5 days of signed timesheet being presented. Of course your company may have 60 or even 90 day payment terms to the end client so you have to cashflow this during this period.   
I would stress that the above details represent my experience in this area and I submit this reponse purely to help you get a head start on the sorts of things that need to be considered. It is possible that there are other ways to do some of the simpler steps from above.   
Please feel free to PM me if you think I can help further.

			Hello, 
I've gone through a lot of threads on EF about starting a new business in Switzerland and while there is a lot of good information out there, some of it seems to be dated and at times, a little confusing. Also, could not find anything specific about catering, so hoping someone can help with the following:   
1. I'm married to a German national, we both have an EU B Permit. As I understand it, EU nationals are now permitted to own a business in Switzerland?   
2. I'm going to be working with a partner (also with an EU B Permit), trying to figure out if forming a partnership is better or a GmbH. Leaning toward a GmbH as it offers limited liability which I believe is important - question is, how easy is it to form a GmbH. Can one do it themselves or is it recommended to go thru a lawyer etc? (I understand the difference in capital requirements and double taxation with the GmbH)   
3. If it is recommended to go thru someone, how much does it cost and could you recommend someone?   
Now on the catering side of things-   
4. Does anyone know what permit etc are needed to cater? I found info about restaurants, but that's different, I'm hoping someone can point me to something more specific.   
5. While the plan would be to eventually have our own dedicated kitchen for the business, we will start by using our home kitchens (one of which is big and well equipped, so we can handle decent orders for now) or maybe even renting one when needed - does anyone know if this would be a problem with regards to any regulations that may exist?   
Thanks!

			Contact your AVS office directly or through your commune. Set yourself up as an Independant Consutlant by describing your activity. You will get officially registered if you can provide them with 2 contracts (or invoices) for 2 companies or customers   in Switzerland, even if they operate elsewhere. That is a sine-qua-non conditions. AVS will then ask you to estimate your gains and you will pay yr social charges for the first year on your estimate. You should consult with a Fiduciaire (sort of chartered accountant) to prepare yur end-of-year business results at the end of the 1st year of activity. 
Good luck!

They then paid you back the money with interest on it, in the end I was up a couple of hundred francs, but it was definately not worth the effort in volved.....

			Hello all,   
I am establishing a business in Zurich, and at the moment i started looking for offices. At the beginning i dont intend to hire secretary and have many employees (no more than 3), so i decided to go for a serviced office for the first year.  
I googled it... and found that there are only 5-6 offices in the center, i probably missing something... it is Zurich.   
I dont really care about being on Bahnhofstrasse, or in Regius, i just want the office to be furnitured, with all the IT infrastructure, and to have a secretary service (someone to answer the phone when we are not there).   
Please recommend on an office/ firm if you are familiar with one.   
Thx, 
Vera

			I've already got a few products I think could be quite successful - working in several restaurants around Switzerland has given me a bit of insight on what the Swiss like to eat, and what currently is not on offer.   
Hmm, 4 to 5 grand. Very doable. You have experience in this business, would you consider that a smart investment if, in theory, the product is good? Is it even possible to make that much back in a weekend? Although I suppose, 10 or 12 hours a day for 3 days, 8-10chf per sale, no employees...   
What kind of profits did you enjoy, if you dont mind my asking, at an average fest with your pie venture?   
PS - Would just like to thank you again for this thread. My girlfriend and I have several ideas on the back burner, and having a vendor at a fest in Switzerland is one I have been toying with since October.

			Invicta watches started in La Chaux-de-Fonds but it's administrative centre is now in US. Their watches are made in Switzerland, Japan and the US. Some of their movements are from ETA/Swatch group. Most of the original small watch companies in CH are now part of big groups owning many brands, with parts made in many different places. Very few make the whole thing themselves, like Parmigiani Fleurier for instance. I am not absolutely sure what you are asking for.

			EU countries are given preference for work visas.  Establishing a company may or may not help you with this.   It depends on the capital behind it 
and how much business, etc.   
Canton Zug specializes in such arrangements, and the taxes  
are low.  You might want to find a specialist.

			I use paypal for my website and found them very good actually, they only take a small fee compared to the others.   
For invoicing with different vat rates ( i deal with people all over the world) i bought a program called Businessware: 
You can try it for free on the website, they have a demo online i think. 
Long story short, its a good program, doesn't cost you an arm and a leg and it does what it says on the tin, backed up by a great support team.   
Not sure if that will link to your sites check out part..if you want something like that you are looking at expensive software that can be modified to work with what ever script you are setting up.   
For what its worth, i get an email from my server saying "" he or she booked and paid this with paypal "" and i just draft up a quick invoice, 2 minutes work and at least i know what goes in and out, and rule out any software related issues.

			When I was in the same situation as you, I also got agreement for the landlord, made a rental agreement for my sub letting one room to my gmbh - with cost per month, share of electricity, phone etc. This was then official expenses and was paid by gmbh to me and saved profit (tax). I did all this because with a gmbH it of course needs to be a bit official and especially as a company name will also appear on a letterbox etc.

			Hi All   
I run a running club in the Basel stadt region and I am looking at putting on some events for our members nights in the club house's bar/restaurant area.  
The club house holds around 40 people so you wouldnt have lots of room to have space for your equipment. but we have changing room areas if you need them.   
The first night I would like to do is a '' girls night '' where we have a few local business come in i.e. beauty, hair, nails food and pampering etc    
Also we could bring members to venues or restaurants if you have bigger facilities?   
Please if you are intrested get in touch and post any questions you have.   
Best regards   
Martin

			Hi All,    
I am importing products from the UK to Luzern, we have a lorry coming over every month and are looking ""ideally"" for return loads as we will be empty, alternatively we do have a small amount of space on the outward journey although space is limited.    
Just to make it clear, transport is not our business and we are simply looking to reduce our transport costs.    
I look forward to hearing from interested parties.    
Thanks

			Before I arrived in Basel I arranged an appointment with the BaselArea team - they look after inward investment and generally are a great source of information about starting/relocating a business to the area.     
They didn't raise an eyebrow about my business being the small/life style and were happy to carry out some basic reseach into the ideas I was exploring. I've popped in a few times for coffee since and they would always be high on the list when I am exploring a new venture.     
Find out if there is something similar in your area and get in touch.     
Good luck.

The interest of being VAT registered is that you can recover the input VAT you pay for running your business. Though with such a low turnover you probably will have few input VAT to recover. Therefore the administrative burden (and costs if you can't do it by yourself) to fulfill your VAT duties (VAT registration, filing of returns, VAT accounting, etc.) might be excessive compared to the advantage of recovering the input VAT. If your business expands, you can still register later on. There is also a simplified (forfait) method that may speedy the filing of VAT returns but still implies a cautious management of your VAT duties.   
Except if you have a lot of investments in the first year (with a lot of input VAT to recover), don't do it.

I suppose this means it doesn't have any particular national culture but mixes and matches the best of them all, or at least tries to, or failing that pretends to try to. I never heard anybody mention that we are supposed to have an American culture, and in fact even the Americans that work here have stopped eating lunch behind their monitors and come to the canteen instead so maybe that's a Swissification going on there.   
Anyway, for me ABB is so big that many parts of it are not really a company at all but more a sort of old-fashioned state. In some parts of the company there's lots of burocracy that's basically interested in keeping itself occupied and very little interest in being entrepreneurial or actually winning through, but there is definitely a lot of self promotion going on. In other parts there are some real entrepreneurs and some exciting things going on, but that's almost like a parallel universe and the two universes don't talk to one another much and there's very little sign of strong leadership from the top, with the different sections more or less doing there own things and sometimes even competing directly or buying stuff from competitors that could just as well be bought in-house etc.   
I can't actually think of any CEOs of major non-Swiss companies right now, and maybe there aren't any. Or maybe it is just because there are probably more countries on this world than there are major international corporations so statistically speaking the probability is against it.

I love bookstores, and would like my own but realistically we're both 50 years too late. I would not invest money in a bookstore/cafe unless I really didn't need to make money out of it.

did la chambre syndicale de la haute couture,i was not able to go hunt for 
a job in Paris after i got my diploma as my mother got very sick and when 
the time came for me to go and look for a job i was never able as Paris is a very competitive city,you have very good school there as well as peoples that have graduated from NY and Japan that do come for training and working, 
i did end up working retail as i had to pay bills. 
Yes it was my dream but if i will do it again i will first do my school 
in paris or London or NY,and make certain the school is up to date with the technology. 
now the teacher that tell you it dosen t matter if you don t know how to draw,well i was not  
good at first ,we had class with Beaux Arts Drawing ,and it was tough as i got some bad

			Nearly all multinational companies that I know of have English as their language of ""operations"". That said, they still speak the local lingo in the corridors if no foreigners present.   
This includes: Roche, Novartis, Ciba, DSM, Syngenta, Merck Serono, Amgen, Novo Nordisk, Basilea and Actelion to name a few.   
You do, however, need to be careful, as if you plug into the Swiss affiliate you likely won't get English as the language of choice.

The notary will deduct his fee and that of the Chamber of commerce and return the rest to you and you can do what you want with it, but as it's ""company money"" you will need to account for it.   
Don't ask for any further advice free of charge, if you want i can bill (payment in advance) Chf 500.--/hour, otherwise pay for 30 minutes of a notarys' or a lawyers'  time and get them to explain how to do it, just like we all did.   
Your alternative would be top use the search engine on this site, ALL the information you need is here, if you can't be bothered why should we give out time free of charge ?

You pay 15 bucks or so just to make the call which may/may not include a lot of calling time.   
I was getting phone calls from intermediaries for deaf people. For some odd reason people in the center would transfer the calls to me because I used to handle the foreign calls in french ....    
from being at the other end, I feel the calls took twice if not more longer because everything has been be double triple confirmed. Patience when dealing with these people may not be so good when dealing with admistration for example.   
Look into how deaf people manage this in der Schweiz?! You'll probably get some idea of costs that one could charge.     
Your project has outsourcing written all over it but unfortunately finding good schwitzerdytsch speakers outside of the country may be very difficult ?! 
Do they have swiss german speaking call centers say in Asia right now?  
Anything is possible ...

The other possible way around would be to make it dormant, employ nobody and revert backto being a sole trader under different company name.   
Go ask the notary who set the company up for you !

1449	22.08.2010, 10:55	Forum Veteran	Thanked 1,129 Times in 619 Posts	Location: Ticino & London	"    If I find any information on how to obtain the shareholders; i will certainly post it on this forum.   
I know that shares were held annonimously but through a nominee. 
The reason I know this is because when I bought the Swiss company off the shareholders I paid to have the company ""legalised"" which supposedly meant formalising the shares correctly. 
A lot of Swiss Companies (certainly in Ticion) had their shares held by nominnee shareholders (generally swiss administrator/director of the company) but the beneficial owner would often be a non resident Italian. 
This was the situation with the company I bought.   
I have also noiticed that my share certifcates of my Swiss company appear to be ""Bearer Shares""    which basically would means that the person who physically hold the shares is the owner. 
If this really is the case (I have my devious mind working here); why on earth would one want to disclose them on your capital estate statement on your Tax Return and as a result pay wealth tax on them and then when you receive a dividend, declare the income on your Tax Return and pay income tax on them and then again when you die, just pass them on to someone else without inheritance tax implications as these shares are supposedly held annonymously. 
This is was I suspect my ex Greek tenent is doing. 
He owes my company plus CHF11,000 in arrears of rent and expenses and legal costs and declares to the debt collectors that he has nothing and can't pay while his shop continues to run and be managed by his wife who declares that she works casually part time there. They as a result receive Housing benefit from the Canton and get Legal Aid to defend any action I take against them. 
The Swiss legal system stinks and I thought that Switzerland was highly efficient. 
By the way he is Greek but obtained Swiss Nationality on the seventh attempt only a few years ago and is now scrounging off the country. Perhaps some of you will realise my Politically Incorrect statements about these dirty foreigners coming to scam the place and how naive the Swiss are and are in for some shocks in the future.   
Sorry I went off the subject.

			If you only made CHF300, then it is not only not worth registering to be self employed, it hardly seems worth working.   
If you are not registered, you will not be asked for social payments (pension /unemployment) and your clients may be asked for this. You will also need to pay tax and claim expenses if your income becomes worthwhile.

starting a school any kind of school is very complicated. 
You have the accreditation issues, the costs, the staff, location, the schooling.   
knowing about business does not mean you can run an educational venture.

I'm sure that somehow even an entry level school could work to give small courses but a full blown school is extremely complex.

The comment of the OECD Model Convention considers as ""place of effective management"" the place where the key decisions for the life of the company are taken. This could indeed restrict to decisions of Board meetings. However for Swiss Supreme Court, the notion is much broader and corresponds to the place where the company has its ""effective and economic center"". There are some hints, such as where the board members are living, where they meet, where day to day management is realized and where documents are held. But that notion of ""economic center"" is clearly wider than the ""place where key decisions are taken"". It is basically the place where the activities of the compay are realized. Should there be a difference between place of day to day management and place of key decisions, then it will be decided for the place where the ""center of gravity lies"" (where the activity is the most crucial for the company - may vary from case to case).

			As far as my knowledge goes, if it's public or private limited, they have to submit their annual reports to the commercial chamber. Reports of Public companies are public anyway, for private limited companies, you have to purchase this for a fee, legitimating your requirements, either supplier, customer, or investor etc. as the case may be. Am not sure whether the company gets to know (auomatically) who has looked into the company's reports. This is just to ensure that creditors and debtors get the official statements.

you can by from next online also and get it delivered to CH.  just watch out for the 65CHF tax limit.

1469	null	null	null	null	   Hi there,      The place it's a small studio-gallery and it's in Baden. It has a nice display window facing the road, however, it is not Zurich and it is in a relatively quite area - it functions well for me as a studio and as a place where I give art classes.      I though that it would be cool to use the space - which is quite nice and cosy- in order to get together with other creative people from time to time. My idea was not to get other people's work and just display it, I was, as mentioned, more interested in organising an event, It could be a weekend, a week or a couple of weekends just before Xmas...then we would have to advertise it to as much people as possible and perhaps even consider sending some invitations...there is nothing to loose and it is a platform for showing our work to different people...at least we can try and see how it goes...     If this interests you, could you please send me some samples of the work you would like to display or a link where I can see them? below is the link to my website if you need more info: www.jartstudiogallery.com  	null	null	null	Call for creative people	guest	null	1,073	6	Business & entrepreneur

			Thank you all for your input.  
in reply to Runningdeer:   
1. I'm not too bothered by competition if there is only one company around doing that who are they by the way? (in PM if possible!) after all there are hundreds of carpenters or metal workers in the very same area and they compete and co-exist. I have spoken to many who thought there was no company doing this around la cote, which proves there is still potential.   
2. Concerning the ""cowboy"" handymen, yes they undercut on price, also they only work weekends (usually), also they never last very long because one day they realize it's not paying to renew tools and they can't live from it. The only answer to this is the availability of a full time person and reputation for quality/value.   
3. I'm very much trying to begin as a one-man show but with a very scalable repertory of services.  
I worked in the construction industry directly and indirectly for getting on for 20 years. I ran a waterproofing and insulation company for 8 years. I know who can do what and am competent to oversee, consult or subcontract. After 25 years here I am bilingual English/French, indeed my whole building industry experience was acquired in French, so I foresee no major difficulties there.  
I could organize the building of a house from planning permission to mowing the finished lawn, but that's not really the target (yet). The idea is a one-stop address for ALL the small jobs, ALL the consulting and advising in relation to the existing building and its maintenance or repair. I intend to leave the heavy stuff to the builders who already specialize in that, although I will also be useful as the overseer of a building project - often done by the architect themselves ... at much higher cost.    
4. Networking: Yes I do have good networking skills although I've ""lived Switzerland in French"" rather than in English, so my networks are mostly French-speakers. But here I am on this forum now    
Ruthie:   
I am really aiming at home owners, of which there are very many along lake Léman (Geneva), but another target group will actually be house rental agencies...they often have tenants call up, needing small jobs done and have the same dilemma as for a private individual.  
For example, a light fitting needs replacing, the roller blind is stuck, the garden path needs weeding, the gate is broken. The rental agency would call several companies for that. Each company has a basic charge for travelling to the site. Each will have a minimum time of billing (often one hour). I could go there, (only one basic charge) fix the light, the gate, weed the path, check the blind and fix that or (again, only an example) find the blind too much for my skills or parts supply and inform the agent who would then only send the company for the blinds or better yet with the agency's prior agreement, I call the blinds company, explain to them what's wrong, which model of blind, which part seems to be the cause.   
In the above example, the agency managed to avoid the cost of a gardener and an electrician. The agency also saved a trip for the blinds company who would probably had to fetch parts in a separate trip...I can do the math...so can the agency   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Feedback needed!

			Hi,  
I came across this old thread and was wondering whether you achieved your aim of setting up a soft play centre or whether you gave the idea a miss in the end. I would be really interested to know as I am seriously considering doing the same and would be greatfuk if you were willing to share your experiences. Thanks in advance!

There are principles of equality applied to company pension schemes to ensure that all employees receive the same basic pension. It only works to a degree as it is then possible to have a ""top-up"" pension scheme for higher earners often called in the German speaking world Kaderversichering. However this also falles under the same principle of equality described in Articles 1c of BVV2. This strictly prevents exceptions to the general rule.   
In other words the employee must be treated in the same way as other employees wrt to pension schemes. This includes paying into the same fund. There are ways round parts of the equality principle to a degree as long as it does not contradict the basics of equality, so you could not say for men we pay 75% of contributions and for women just 50%. This though falls under Articles 1, 1a and 1b of BVV2 which basically says your scheme has to be reasonable. In other words you could not say 10% for employees under 45 and 50% for between 45 and 55 then 20% for over 55, because you happen to be 46.    
Now having said all that...   
It is possible to apply to have an exception of not paying at all to your fund but generally this only applies in two special cases:   
1. Where the employee is working for a multinational and does not spend all their time working in Switzerland. 
2. Where the employee is here to do an internship.   
And then there are conditions to be met such as the person has an equivalent fund in another country etc.

Its easy to use and has a very good aftercare service.

In theory it is now OK to sell goods from the EU in Switzerland provided one EU country has approved them for sale.

There are also other exceptions - meaning things that cannot be imported.  There is a Government list of these exceptions, conveniently in French laguage    --

* What is the legal format of the business, corporate legal entity or simply a registered business name held by a sole trader or partnership?   
* Where the business is registered, determines the applicable tax treaties and related rules that will be applied   
* Nature of the business activity: sale of goods or supply of services, type of service and where it is deemed to have been supplied and thus where they are subject to VAT   
* Where the business is managed and operated, as opposed to where it is registered.   
* And of course, the size of the business, if it is only a small side operation it will be exempt for many requirements.   
If this is a substantial business we're talking about then you should seek professional advice.   
Good luck with that,

If you are legally resident, 30 days is super optimistic even if you are an EU citizen   
There's plenty of information on the federal web sites, including in English, about what you need to do. I would suggest that if you are asking about the basics on this forum, then you haven't done enough research yet on the environment of your planned business and shouldn't be attempting to set up in business until you have done so

If you have no particular idea on how to employ people, I would recommend that you try to use a payroll agency to run their contracts. You will have to have fixed term employment contracts with all of them (just for the season I assume) and will need to comply with SUVA requirements and so on.  You probably will have to count on a few hundred francs per head to run the payroll, but will be a) safe from a legal/employment point of view b) more free to run your start-up and get business in.   
Try more a ""local shop"" or fiduciary to run the payroll than one of the biggies (Adecco/manpo/...), you will get better rates (norm is 5-10% margin for the payroller)

			Hi all, 
my wife recently started a SaRL in Geneva and received the first batch of imported products from China (mostly gift products). 
Now the challenge is to sell them of course.   
The question is: can anyone advise on the ""sales protocol"" to be followed when approaching potential big customers like Migros or Coop?   
Does anyone know of a consulting firm to advise you on the right pointers regarding the ""etiquette"" of selling products to Swiss retail companies?   
I ask because she has been doing a lot of call calling just to be told to call the offices in Zurich, but nobody really gives away the contact details of the person/department in charge of purchases.   
Thank you in advance.

			Worst case scenario (from the perspective of a guy): 
- you get stuck paying alimony to your ""wife"" even after the ""costly divorce"" (prenups only hold up with respect to separation of assets, not with respect to alimony) 
- you may actually want to marry your ""true love"" but your current ""wife"" says no, but might be willing to relent in exchange for... 
- you get fined and/or deported on immigration charges.

			First, please excuse my imperfect English...   
The kind of person you need to sale can be very different for one job to another. 
Let me explain:   
Is the job about finding new client? Or about following existing clients? 
Is it B2C or B2B? 
Is it internal sale (phone) or external?   
You have to first make a very precise profile of the person you need. The cost of a mistake can be very high and i would suggest you to search with the help of a human resource professional or company.

			by the way, is your employer going to be happy with you having a side job?   
if you register an Einzeilfirma, your name will be publicly available at the Register of Commerce:    
so, probably it's easier for you to just invoice your clients as a private person.

			We are looking to send contracts to both customers and vendors to sign who will most likely be outside of Switzerland. In the US there are eSignature providers like docusign.com and echosign.com that are government certified for eSignature functionality and does not require either party to get a certificate or a device. The service is also quite affordable.   
We could use any of them but I am not sure how valid/legal it would be in Switzerland. It is possible that it is completely valid as I have heard of financial institutions (hedge funds mainly) around here using a similar service.

			Okay   
So this is what I found so far over different threads of this forum :   
1) you can invoice your customers without having company registered.   
2) you have to put that on income side in tax declaration .   
---  
Questions open :    
1) Can you deduct costs of gaining income (eg.travel costs,hotel stay , PC) without having  einzelfirma ?     
2) Can I subcontract someone (outside of Switzerland) to execute activity while  transfering costs to myself (salaried contractor engagment) ? 
=====================   
In Einzelfirma/GMbH  case   
1) Can I subcontract 3rd party company which is outside of my business scope to perform some activities (imagine IT company as general execution for entire infrastructure - which requires elektrical,other parties). Just example. Can 3rd that be from outside of CH ?   
2) In einzelfirma win is direct salary of owner - in GMbH it's not - you pay yourself salary.   
So can I have unsalaried person executing some work for me - eg. my wife - while actually she would not be working for me - just executing tasks - but these may involve travel and as such - can I put them on my books ?   
Do I need permission from my employeer while I perform non salaried activities ?   
Working for corporation - is competetive operation considered in scope of local branch office operations (eg. mainly financial investment company that doesn't sell anything but all thru partners) - while actually I perfrom educational services (it's competetive operations in scope of Corporation which is US based but not local Swiss office)?   
Thanks in advance

			Ask one of he current stall holders who you should speak to. The ""superintendent"" of the market will often be on hand and will tell you about availability. If it's anything like Zurich I wouldn't hold your breath. The city markets are full and there hasn't been an available stall in the last 7 years.    
Once people have got a stall they keep it, and if they can't man it themselves, they sub-let it. The only way to find out if these are available is to ask every stall holder.   
The privately run markets are generally easier to get into, again, ask stall holders who to speak to.   
After that, you'll need to get a license from the local council and if you are baking them yourself, a food handling license for your premises.

If it is someone with imagination and ideas, then dynamics can certainly be put into play.  But put a process oriented accountant on top, then the company will likely go cold and frigid.   
The most influential factors are in the outlying extremes, not necessarily down the same safe path.  So creative companies encourage its employees to be creative and explore alternatives that get very little attention.  In the outlying areas, there are some needs that go unmet.  So they encourage their people to explore and see it they can stimulate market response.  Hence, a few years ago, Google took YouTube from an embryonic stage to a full blow Internet entity.

Well, actually its not about France but Seychelles. There is an option of french as second language. I thought it could be as easy as branch opening, but now I can see that itll be too complicated and useless even incorporating there is fast, and legalizing documents also is not very costly because of some type of Swiss Consulate is there.(not full scale but they can do it. You can imagine what it takes in place without Consulate)   
But,    
Even there is an Ernst & Young in Seychelles (others I believe a local firms) it is really not worth of going trough all of that.  
But I like the idea itself and a specially a Swiss attitude to accept a companies even from jurisdictions that will not allow company to live. I believe there is some oil people escaping Bermuda right now. Too close to new US administration.   
In case anyone will be interested note that you will need a certified copy of the Certificate of Redomiciliation and the certified copy of the Certificate of Formation. And within a half year you must deliver a copy of Certificate of Domiciliation from Switzerland to the place where company was incorporated., otherwise the procedure will be declared nulled and company would be considered as if it based there (will continue accumulate charges).      as a male Im not really familiar with cuisine but will try to add my penny.

			This would be a for a restaurant. I have a place available, but I think it is too much. Granted, Rapperswil is always fairly a busy location, most anywhere in the ""downtown"" area. However, if a majority of the coverts are outside, well, the snow. For me the rent I found is acceptable in Zurich, but not Rapperswil. I told him I was interested, but at a lower rent. If anyone had any experience in what rent is normally there, then I might have a firmer food to stand on in a negotiation.

			Wow that’s huge piece of info “ How to crack the  RS 142.20 Federal Law on Foreigners Art. 21 Priority  for : EU, Swiss or even existing Swiss B/C permit holders”.   
""The intra-company transfer”- within the Art.30 of RS 142.20   
 It’s possible to waive the requirements for admission (Art. 18-29) such as: 
 -Priority (for EU- Swiss / B-C permit holders-Art.21) 
-Personal qualifications (Art. 22 AuG) 
-Salary (Art. 23) 
However -cracking  the Art. 21 is perfect,  while you are recruiting someone completely outside of the enterprise, irrespective to  the process of  intra-company transfer Act.   
 But as an employer  you can’t  over look the Art.22-23 though you are sending an executive from the intra-company transfer process .So you need to be more specific on personal qualification  for an executive and his /her salary.   
As a conclusion  : you don’t need to prove  the Swiss migrations authority  that : we were unable to find an  employee on Swiss and EU labor market.   
***Though this is very normal for intra - intra-company transfer process to apply for a Swiss work visa !! 
But a personal who’s legally reside in Switzerland doesn’t need a Visa to re-enter in Switzerland;  
It’s something like : A French company is sending  an executive to its Swiss branch , thus he/she ‘s entitled to move anywhere in Switzerland !! But what’s she /he needs:  that her employer will apply for a resident and work permit on behalf. 
I hope, that’s how the RS 142.20-Art.30 work. 
Anyway comments ?  
Cheers ,

			Hi All,   
Thanks for the responses.    
Just FYI, in case this is of interest to anyone else out there & to finalise this post - I also consulted my lawyer and it seems that as long as the company is not actually investing the money, but simply ""advising"" no extra certification is required. Saying that - will have to be careful and put appropriate disclaimers on papers.   
This is really interesting because its quite different from the UK, where rules on ""advisory work"" seem much stricter.   
Hope this is helpful for someone else too.

			Hello, I am not quite sure where your difficulty lies.    
Is it not the case that in America there is a requirement to formally list directors with the company registrar? If so you need that document. (A director in the USA has a right to act on the companies behalf according to Swiss law in the same way as in Switzerland. A shareholder of course does not which I think is the confusion of your lawyer.)   
If not you need a document on company paper which lists the directors and is signed by a director witnessed by a notary public that the said director is empowered to act on behalf of the company. The Swiss Consul offers an apostalate service to validate this by the way.   
The shareholding does not necessarily say that the majority shareholder has any say in the companies day to day business. ie they could be a sleeping partner.    
Does that help? IF not who is your lawyer? You can PM me exactly what they say.

I think there were some previous threads about this too... I think Citizen Space in Zurich has some desks but don't know if this is the type of thing you are looking for.   
Let me know if some sort of critical mass is also needed as I'm also looking for somewhere that's not a hot-desking / desk-sharing type of arrangement.   
Normal going rate for desk-sharing type of thing seems to be ca. 400-450 per month for unlimited access depending on access to meeting rooms etc. Would be interested to hear what a more permanent space in a shared location in Zurich costs....

			That's exactly where I'm coming from. Do you have a feel for how much it costs to rent a small office (roughly 50 sq. meters) in the zurich area (not on the BH strasse)?

We stopped giving them information because they only used our initial starting capital as their source which clearly wasn't much at the time of our inception, but then they failed to update their records, so we stopped giving them info. This meant that we only got a rating which covered our start up amount, which is only about 350% off the truth. I don't rate credit rating companies, but that's another issue which is beyond the OP's question.

It becomes a real pain when I want to do a gig in another country as they immediatly have local laws etc that they want you to register and pay tax etc in that country.   
The fact that you may have your own company etc, they do not want to really know that. Kind of makes the freedom of movement and being allowed to do business on an international level quite tough especially if you are one man GmbH.

			hi guys..  
How does this work?.. I import kids clothes from EU countries into switzerland and sell back to (mostly) EU customers.  The stuff will arrive to my home address in Lugano either by courier or post (or I can drive over to Italy to pick it up myself)  and sent out in small packets by post. What import / export duties am I liable for? What do I need to do to comply?  My business turnover is too small to need to be registered for VAT so thankfully I will just skip that!  
My business is very small scale.. just one step up from an Ebay trader I would say, so I dont want to be spending on getting someone to sort this out for me! 
Thanks

			Hi, don't want to discourage you too much, but considering that Italian is one of the 4 national languages of Switzerland and that many people do have a rather good level of English in the cities, there may not be such a niche in the market over here.   
Nevertheless if you are coming for other reasons (following a spouse, etc etc) and will be here anyway, then you might get lucky once you are already here.

For example 1,000 Swiss Francs per day was circa £400 & is now £600+. Sounds good except living in Switzerland costs the same now in Swiss Francs as it did when the Exchange rate was different. 
Or to look at the other way the UK contractor looking for £400/day is now ok with 700 Swiss Francs per day

			This year myself and a colleague are taking part in the 10,000 kilometre Mongol Rally in a completely unsuitable vehicle. Event regulations state that any car used must have an engine no bigger than 1.2 litres.   
Our team is based in Geneva, Switzerland and we will be setting out for the capital of Mongolia, Ulaan Baatar, on July the 24th 2010.   
This rally isn't just about having some great adventures. We're also trying raising as much money as we can for two very worthy charities. We have chosen to support The Christina Noble Children's Foundation and Mercy Corps leading up to and during this epic journey.   
The Christina Noble Children's Foundation is dedicated to serving children in need of emergency and long-term medical care, nutritional rehabilitation, educational opportunities, job placement and protecting those at risk of economic and sexual exploitation. Whilst Mercy Corps help people in the world's toughest places turn the crises of natural disaster, poverty and conflict into opportunities for progress.   
You can see details of what we are attempting and why at our team website,  .   
I would like to ask any companies or organisations that use Englishforum.ch if they would consider sponsoring our team to help us complete this fantastic adventure.   
In return for any contributions (whether it's equipment or money) towards the vehicle and equipment costs, your companys logo(s) will be prominently placed on the vehicle, our team website and wherever else the opportunity arises.    
For example, we will be showing the car at my sons school sports day in Geneva where up to 500 people will be in attendance. This would be a great opportunity for any Swiss based company to get their business noticed.   
We are giving a live interview about this adventure on World Radio Switzerland at 5.40pm this coming Friday evening.   
If anyone is interested in this opportunity please do not hesitate to contact me via the private message facility or simply reply to this posting.   
Thank you for taking the time to read this message.

			Hi all,   
I'm thinking of setting up a small English editing/proof-reading service, ideally for people whose native language is not English and who want someone to check their grammar/vocab/etc.. in written texts. I've been doing the same sort of thing for friends for years and now, finally, am thinking I could make it into a side-business. 
I've got a degree in Journalism and worked as a newspaper editor for several years, I'm also a qualified English Teacher.  
Obviously the first thing would be to develop a website..    
Any comments on how I should go about it? Or any pitfalls I should beware of?

			actually this topic has been actively discussed here on the forum. search for AVG and you'll find a lot. 
For a GmbH company there's only one exception for AVG: if the owner is the only employee in the company, then the license is not needed. As soon as you hire people and sell their work as contractors, you need the license.   
The AVG law, if you can read it in German or French, states that the deposit is taken for 12 months only.

			Thanks for the debate everyone. It's very useful to hear/see some of the issues played out.   
When I first started coming to Switzerland about 15 years ago, I discussed with my then girlfriend (now wife) about the lack of sandwich shops in Zurich and that we ought to open one. She said that the Swiss would never change their habits and Swiss like to go home for lunch. I think a walk around Zurich nails that one. The Swiss seem happy to take onboard anything from another country/culture as long as it makes sense.   
I can fully understand why British cheese works here and why British beer would find a market. Both products are not imitations but distinctive in their own right. Quality is key, as is price.   
The pie plan continues.   
Thanks for your input.

			I kinda looked into this a while back and found that the Swiss Ski and Snowsports School (   ) have a kind of Mafia mentality about the whole thing. 
What I also discovered was that to operate a school in Switzerland have have to be SSS qualified + a stupid number of years experience in switzerland collected working with SSS schools. 
If this has all changed since I looked (few years back now) then go for it, as its a good idea.

			Hi there,   
I'm thinking of starting a mobile therapy business in the Luzern area and wanted to see if there is a market for this. I know that there are no English-speaking salons in the area and that more and more expats are moving here.    
There's also a lot of mum's living in the area, who might not always be able to go to a salon for some well-deserved pampering    
Any suggestions or comments will be much appreciated.   
Thanks a lot!

The gist of it is: if you don't earn enough then the authorities will view it as ""pocket money"". What this means (as I understand it) in real terms is that while you won't be taxed for it, you also cannot deduct expenses.   
If you do earn over the threshold, then you can deduct business expenses.   
As I said earlier, you don't need a business plan to be a freelancer, especially if you have a partner/husband with a job.    
Check fully with a tax accountant though as they will tell you the limits both for income and expenses (e.g. car use, house/room etc.).

			Hi All,   
I'm in the process of leaving my job in Zurich and will probably transition back to the US by middle of this year.  I'd love to have a small office space in the Zurich area over the next few months that I could work from as working from home with kids running around is not ideal.  Really just need a desk, printer and internet connection.  I'd like to work on some business development stuff but I'll also be doing some job searching as a fall back in case my entrepreneurial ambitions dont materialize.   
To that end I'd be willing to trade some consulting work or a combination of cash and consulting work for the office space.  Just basically trying to minimze the cash component.   
I've got 13 years financial services experience and an ivy league mba.  Most recently I've been the ceo of a zurich based half billion EUR financial information services company with EUR60mm in annual revenues and a EUR25mm operating budget.  I was responsible for driving all aspects of strategy, planning, budgeting, pr, marketing, sales and product development...with the help of a good team behind me.  I speak english and spanish...very limited german.   
In case you have a seat available and are interested drop me a line.   
Best, 
JB

			Invoices issued by doctors including dentists and the like, as well as lawyers etc., are subject to a statutory period of limitation of five years, and that has been the case for decades. I assume the same applies to trustees (Treuhänder) too. Invoices from plumbers, painters etc., if my memory serves me well, expire after two years.

			It really depends on how taxes work in the country. Meaning, it depends if private interest income is taxed or not. It also depends where the backing funds are, if these are offshore or not.

			I've been working as a Chief cook at large establishments in CH, DK, GB, NOR, FR for last 20 years and I want to start own Sushi bar somewhere in ZH. My cuisine is very traditional and am specialised Kansai cuisine which's rare to find in Europe. I'm currently living in the east end of FR (where Mont Blanc mountain is, French Alps) near GE, CH but found ZH more interesting to start with. I'm looking for a partner who holds 'Swiss Patent of restaurant' and this person should search for a place (rent or buy) where we can launch the biz. I can provide fund of renting or buying but this can be discussed if he/she wants to take more shares of business. The partner must also be skilful in marketing and restaurant operations (except kitchen) because myself is the chief cook who's mainly in charge of producing impressive foods. The partner should be a Swiss who's German mother tongue as I only speak French and English in addition to few Asian languages. This is very serious inquiry. Pls PM me to get in touch

			Welcome to the real world, Mr McDreamy    
Why do you rely on a forum, when you obviously already know everything about business and how to run it located from a different country ?!?   
Either you have more information than you are willing to share here (e.g. in order to generate more specific answers?) or you have none at all.    
Your query does not make much sense.    
In addition all ""good"" locations such as 8001, 8005 or 8008 come with a huge amount of investments - unless you think of a take away or similar.    
Plus they are already filled with restaurants, bars, cafés and take aways.    
And a posh restaurant with a new concept - which you have in mind - require a down investment of several hundred thousands CHF.   
You are not very realistic here with your dream respectively the dream of your parents.         "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	start a restaurant in zurich 8001	"""zivchen"	Posts: 11	9,179	53	Business & entrepreneur

			Hi Markalex,   
I think your post was launched a while ago, but I just joined.  I am in the same situation. I have taken a 4 month sabbatical (was due back in Jan 2010) as after 10 years with my company I needed a break.  Now, a recent conversation last week with my boss informed me that our positions will be moved over the next year to Romania.  I have been working for 9 years here in Zurich for the corporate giant and I think now is the time to jump off the ship and build my own boat.. instead of running around the decks hiding and being miserable in my job.  I have hinted to my boss that I would like to participate in the work force reduction plan but now I am concerned about the RAV and unemployment discussion.  I definitely would like to take advantage of the RAV as I build my business up, but when do you have to register your company?  I heard that 90 days is the grace that RAV gives you, then you are on your own. 90 days is not a long time to build up a business considering it takes at least 1 full year (if you are lucky) to turn a profit.   Just wanted to know what you did, how things are going and any tips you can give me.   
Thanks! LVL

The account is blocked until the company is set up by the notary and inscribed in the commercial register.    
If it wasn't this way, i guess a lot of companies would be set up on the basis of a promise of deposit later, many of which would never be fulfilled !   
Don't be cheap, go to a notary or an accountant, get professional advice and pay for it for your particular case, believe me it will pay off as to change things is expensive and if you set it up wrongly and you get hit for tax, nobody on EF will assist you, however if you paid for professional advice you have recourse.

			Hi there,   
Maybe I could offer some free advice:   
Firstly, you need to find out what country you are marketing to. If you are targeting the Swiss market, you will need to buy a .ch website name which can be done from   at 17 CHF per year. If you are targeting another country (like the UK) then you would need a .co.uk name. This part is required if you want to appear in local country listings on Google.   
Secondly, you need some website hosting. Try my firm, our hosting plans cost from only £25 per year, or, £49 per year for database applications. Or try   - UK based, low costs.   
Thirdly, you then need the actual files created, and that all depends on the project you had in mind.   
Lastly, you need to consider business marketing on the internet. This is the biggest part, as there is no point in having a great website if no relevant visitors ever see it.   
Hope that helps you!   
regards   
J

			I can set you up a UK company, where you would get all the reputation and legal structure etc this brings and struture it so you only pay tax on around 1-3% of the profit.   
All very easy to do - and it seems the best way to do it if your friend is not based here and subject to local taxes etc.

- production costs involved like general costs, wages, etc 
- prestige of either country/region or else the producing company 
- the market weight of a country/region/company

So, it's not yet really a consultancy, but rather a simple body leasing. In this situation, the guy would work the same way as if he was alone, so all the marketing and sales are his headache. Of course the contract with the client would have to have my signature.   
Later on, if it works out well, I could think of further expanding and building a real consultancy team. If I take on marketing and sales, then the cut would be higher than 10%, and that's a completely different story.    
What I try to build, is the business model where the employee gets as much as he could earn, and he also takes over important responsibilities, such as contract search and negotiations, illness coverage and so on.

			Usually the authorities only have a big issue with people who are not paying tax anywhere. 
So long as you are paying tax in the UK & you inform the Swiss authorities then it is just a discussion about whether that process continues or whether you should be paying tax in Switzerland & then be credited under the double tax agreement for the tax you paid in UK.   
As a matter of interest it is claimed that taxes are lower in Switzerland than UK (depending on how much you receive, what you can claim against tax, which Kanton, etc.) so maybe it would be beneficial to change anyway.

As for your car either ""sell it"" to your company this way you can get a good chunk of cash out of the company as you buy the car for the most inflated price you find on Autoscout for similar (...) vehicle or you as private person rents the car to the company, The advantage of renting is if you go under, the car remains your property and not the company.

The ALE applicant must declare that neither the applicant nor the spouse was part owner or executive officer of the previous employer, which dismissed the applicant.

			Actually, the UK is one of the cheapest countries for printing. Italy and Spain were also very competitive but you have to speak the local language.   
But, the printing business is very volatile. If you ask for several quotes, you might get a special deal - sometimes a print shop will take jobs at ridiculously low prices just to keep their machines going.

			Well ... I use both Xing and Linkedin, along with other networking platforms, and find the following, for whatever it's worth. ... As some of you know, I run a networking event every month (Venture Cocktail). Virtually all of my European/Swiss contacts get an invite using my Xing list. I find the ""create event"" feature to be very good. I can check on who's coming, who may come, and who said no thanks. Plus everyone can see the list. (May be something you are interested in, by the way!) Lots of folks have made valuable contacts and valuable friends over the years. ( ).    
I personally find the Xing format as well as the pull to be much more European... Linkedin seems to attract more of the American crowd. The other thing is Linkedin gives you more for free...   
So ... if you can handle both, I would use both for a while over here. Mostly because of the Euro factor.   
Just my two cents.   
Good Luck!

			As you know, I too have started a business, and I also have poor local languages, however I have employed people who do and can speak enough English to understand what I want from them. It is a leap of faith but so far it is paying off. Meanwhile I take weekly language lessons and although it is taking far longer than I wanted/expected, the language is creeping in and I understand a lot more than I did two months ago.   
I am fortunate that I have an English speaking Trehande, so I don't make cockups that bring the authorities down on me.   
I personally would not give any of my business to someone on the grounds that they have a language I don't speak. I would be happy in time however to share some of the success of the business with those who help to make it grow.   
Good luck with the venture.

			Thanks for taking the time on this - very helpful and appreciated.  I agree that this has confirmed exactly what I said to my husband last night i.e about them not necessarily being very profitable and just part of larger outfits.   Dont think it is going to be a go-er.  Better get thinking of more feasible ideas!  In your vast experience, do you have any knowledge of what businesses are the more feasible to set up without too much upfront capital and risk?  My husband and I both work in finance and are keen to give this up completely and change direction.  My background is recruitment but this is hard to set up on your own in Switzerland without French mother tongue or the necessary Swiss contacts, although not impossible and I could start this easily from home but hardly a booming recruitment market at the moment so not the ideal time and already a lot of players in Vaud and Geneva.   If you know of other business ventures that are in the most part untapped and a little easier to set up than the ones we have already talked about, would be grateful for your thoughts.   Thanks in advance!

			Hello again!   
Some local publications might suite your target market:       
Published by EPFL with French and English editions.       
Published by various chambers of commerce in French.        
Published in English by WRS in Geneva.        
Published in French and English. Although this is an airline publication, the last issue had a who's who of ""high tech"" Suisse Romande.   
There are other publications that are more obvious but you will find these easily at a newsstand. ""Advertorial"" will be more economical than paid advertising and possible more effective. Obviously you will most likely get further ahead with editors when highlighting some kind of Swiss connection or how it benefits the country.

			Look again at the website to see if there is mention of   which is pay per click. This is the term that refers to people clicking through to your website (by clicking on the ad you have). Whether they do anything on your website or leave directly is another question (which you can of course analyse).   
Otherwise, as mentioned, the CPM (cost per thousand) is normally used to refer to ""impressions"" or people who have (may have) seen your ad when they are on the other website. It is not tied to any type of performance measure such as PPC would be.

			Currently I'm looking for a business partner who can focus on Sales & Acquisition.    
As I'm about to focus more on family matters, I can't spend enough time on the sales aspect.    
I have a small consultancy offering PR, Communication & Business Management for companies as well as private individuals (e.g. PR office for international companies who are interested to be represented in Europe, Switzerland).    
With respect to compensation I thought of a ""commission per client"" or ""commission on business"" option - any other form is sort of unaffordable by me on the longer term.    
If you are interested, please get in touch.    
Thanks and a nice day.   
PS: I'm also glad, if you could spread the word.

			Hi,    
I'm actually working from home as a travel agency. Aside from that, I'm importing some fashion jewelry from Thailand. There is no shop, so I just sell them on the auction website, and to some friends. If there is anyone interested in selling this small business or as a hobby, let me know! or visit    
Thanks a lot

			I'm looking at relocating to Luzern in December (all going well). I've read through a bunch of the posts on this forum about how to work as a freelancer in CH, and I think the best thing to do at this point is stop trying to figure it all out myself and find an accountant who knows the ropes and can do the paperwork for me!   
Residency permit for me shouldn't be problematic, I have Belgian nationality. Just the incorporation and taxation that I'll need help with.   
That being said, can anyone recommend an accountant in the Luzern area who would be suitable? (and not too expensive!)

By having a well though businesses plan you achieve the following:     ·  You experiment on paper and get your head straight about what you will offer and how you will offer it (strategy).   ·  Try to think ways of creating not only value for the customer but also the shareholder.   ·  You number the different fixed, variable expenses (get advice for this is you do not have a good idea)   ·  By then you should have a good idea how much sales you need to break even (P&amp; L budget)   ·  You will understand what risk you put the shareholders or yourself if you do not reach the sales you want    ·  According with your outlined strategy and budget you should know by know how much capital you need to employ.    ·  Think of an exit strategy if things should not run as planed   Those are only some of the benefits you will now before you go live.   	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Dec 2007	Groaned at 13 Times in 11 Posts	Company failure reasons	"""openid"	Posts: 495	2,440	20	Business & entrepreneur

			see this       
Now I ran a games company in the uk, and I must say all the problems are down to the publishers! they created a situation where there are only 1 or 2 big retailers in the uk, they gave the big boys early releases, huge discounts, sale or return, free POS marketing etc etc while everyone else paid top whack, no sale or return, no deliveries if the big boys needed them, oh you want the latest consoles - buy these 10 games too (which are rubbish and you'll never sell) etc etc   
Several times on the latest releases our suppliers would tell us to buy it from the high st. as it was cheaper then trade prices!!   
Now of course all the other game shops have closed, woolworths being the biggest (who where also trade suppliers, but would sell there games cheaper in store then the trade price???)   
And they want a piece of the 2nd hand market too, wtf!!! do ford ask for a cut of all the 2nd hand sales of there cars????   
If it wasn't for 2nd hand sales all the remaining indy games stores will shut! no doubt about it, new games give around 50p profit, yes invest £20-£30 per unit and get 50p return (if your lucky) 2nd hand games give anywhere upto £15 profit, its a no brainer!!

Firstly, these own a lot of the real estate that is suitable for running restaurants and if you agree to sell their products you will get the rent cheaper.   
Secondly, they will often help you get started by contributing massively, say, to the costs of furnishings, in return for you promising to sell their products for a minimum period of maybe three years. This is why you see so many sunshades etc with the names of breweies or drinks companies stamped on them. The restaurant owners probly didn't pay a single rappen for those.

			I think your best bet would be to find a niche with your business planner. 
Write it in really simple english, with lots of explanations. I found that a lot of the Business Plan advice on the internet was written by, as people have said, experts. That means for someone who's not too familiar with P&L and the Glossary it is a bit confusing to read.    
So that could be an option for you.   
Posting some credits from people who can recommend you always helps as well (Ebay and your site) but the best advertising possible is if you give out a few free ones and then let people write positive reviews for you (how it helped them etc.) which you can post on your site. Gives you a lot more cred!

			I don't think you're being realistic here. Guest Houses and B&B have to compete with Youth hostels and budget hotels here in CH, if you're above 80.-chf you really need to offer something better than a room with exterior toilet and breakfast.  
Take easyhotel in Basel as an example:      65.- for a single room!  
And with so few rooms how are you going to pay yourself a salary ?  
I think opening a guest house would be a great idea in many Swiss cities, but you need to be very competively prices, offer a good ""backpacking feeling"" and be centrally located for your (mostly young) guests. Everyone else is already served with hotels that struggle with low occupancy rates. It's something I'd probably do when I have some capital to invest, just for fun, but it's not an easy way to earn money for sure.

			The business has changed quite a bit over the last couple of years.  While I mostly do video, I am starting to get into stills (at probably the worst possible time in history!).   
Lately when people have been calling me wanting a headshot I quote them 250 CHF (which is really cheap for location work!) and most of the time they think that's really expensive.   
Too many amateurs giving it away for free.  The low and even medium market is becoming almost impossible to work in.

			Hi,   
I have experience writing almost 100 business plans for Australian businesses. Mainly they were people from overseas who were looking to migrate to Australia and start a business.   
I think I would be able to help you. I can do market research and analysis, industry analysis, help you develop business strategies and apply them to forecast financials for about 1 to 3 years ahead. I can also put the business plan into a very readable format that can easily be read by investors and bankers.   
I have had similar experience, though on a smaller scale. My husband and I wanted to start a French creperie in Melbourne, Australia. I wrote the business plan and took it to banks. The business bankers were very impressed by the depth of the plan and the forecasts.   
Let me know if I can help you. Of course it won't be for free; my time is precious!

1797	05.01.2009, 12:14	Banned	Thanked 607 Times in 291 Posts	Location: Cowshitsbourg	"    No, I don't, I have an honours degree in chemistry and a graduate diploma in polymer science (I worked in the paint industry for many years). On top of this, I have my intellectual property qualifications. A person who has these is a patent attorney in most countries in the world.   
Some countries in the world make a distinction between patent agents and patent attorneys. The most notable is the USA. A patent agent is entitled to represent clients before the USPTO. S/he will have a degree in science or technology and will have passed the patent bar exam, held by the USPTO at regular intervals and now doable on-line. The patent attorney has these, plus a law degree and a state bar examination. The essential difference is that the attorney can represent clients in court (although in fact few do - some attorneys specialise in litigation and do relatively little pure patent work. This is understandable in a large and, shall we say it ligitous country - and in a common law system where respect for legal precedent requires a thorough knowledge of case law.   
Most patent attorneys do the same work as patent agents, but the financial returns for attorneys are much higher, and it would be rare that a patent agent would be considered for partnership in a private patent attorney firm.   
I cannot leave without mentioning the most bizarre case of all - Switzerland. In a country where even shop assistants do apprenticeships, ""patent attorney"" is not a protected title in Switzerland -   in Switzerland can describe themselves as a patent attorney and charge money for it. This is probably partly because the Swiss Office does not substantively examine the content of patent applications. Of course, if you consistently submit absolute rubbish to Bern, you could suddenly find that Bern will take a inordinate interest in your activities.    
The idea of a Swiss national qualifying examination surfaces now and then, but given that most Swiss patents now come via the European route, which forces the Swiss profession to do the EQE, there is not a lot of urgency. Similarly, most Swiss trade mark applications come in through the international (Madrid) system.

			These are my guidelines which the Swiss seemed OK with. For me the biggest problem was facilities, which should be purpose built. In the UK I worked on one kiddie sized toilet and sink for every 6 kids. I have forgotten the space requirement. Staffing ratio of 2 qualified adults for every 20 kids.  Policy, Rules, curriculum and individual record keeping that is open to parents/authorities. Very careful admission procedure/health statement/ up-to-date immunizations. Training in mop-up/accident/ emergency procedures- clearly posted. Regular Fire and lockdown drills. Sanitation procedures, storage of hazardous poisonous chemicals.  Training in the use of fire extinguishers- which ones do what. Up-to-date training in AED resucitation. Extinguishers and adult hand sanitizers in every room. Strict adherence to door procedure for releasing children at the end of the day. Signed declaration on who has custody or rights for the child. Field trips need staffing ratio of 1 adult to two children. Legal procedures and training in reporting suspected abuse/ discrimination.  There's probably loads more, but the biggest problem is an affordable, purpose built facility. Ask the Gemeinde. One way might be to work in a Swiss Kindergarten for a while.

So 20% expenses could be the pain threshold for the tax office. This is my speculation and not based on any data.

Your best Unique Sales Point is your ability to sit with clients & discuss & refine their requirements; very much easier than trying to do this with email & telephone.

			That makes it pretty much a no-go for me. Don't know how Telekurs justifies keeping my money for so long...   
Most of my clients are ok with doing a wire transfer. However, with LARGE firms, it is often easier to accept a personal/corporate CC rather than generate a PO and all the associated paperwork.   
Thanks for the feedback. Will have a look at the Post account mentioned upthread.

			Hi 
I am just at school doing my patent in Wallis to open anything that is related with restaurant, hotel or catering. 
As we Swiss have not got it together yet, each county has its different laws. In the Gastro situation the same. You would need to ask the Gemeinde, which papers you need to get the Bewilligung ""permission"". I am not sure if GR still needs the restaurant permits or not. Some years back there was a ballot and everybody voted that everyone can open a restaurant without a permit. At that stage it was the whole Switzerland. Some months later some Gemeinde realised that this was not a good idea and some cancelled the legislation.  
So I hope that this has helped. By the way the courses here in Wallis are only in German or French and are pretty hard if you do not speak either of these language fluently. 
Good luck anyway with your projects.

			Hallo BMW, 
I come across a mannequins at JUSK yesterday, the furniture shop in Baar opposite to McDonald, a black one without head, female body only on a nice stand. It costs CHF69.90.   
Is that OK with you? You may come and have a look. Or anything I can help as I am near there.   
Cheers,

			My first bit of advice is to hire an accountant (Treuhander).  They will be  
the best source of answers to all your questions above and more.  I  
have paid CHF 2500 or less per year, depending on the amount of ins  
and outs to be booked.  Plus, the numerous telephone calls and e-mails  
answered included.   
I am an Einzelfirma (single signature private company).  I do have a  
MwSt/VAT number.  Here is the breakdown:   
When I order hardware, I pay 7.6% MwSt. on my purchase price.  This is  
""pre-paid tax"".    When I set the sell price (for hardware sales) the MwSt.  
is included. In the end, I pay* 7.6% MwSt. on the profit made from that  
hardware sale.   
On services, the MwSt is not included.  Thus the term: ""zzgl. MwSt.""  
which means VAT will be added on top of the given price.  I pay* this  
7.6% of the total invoiced price.   
Now, given the two * taxes collected in my account from various  
services and sales, minus the pre-paid tax from my purchases and  
receipts, this is the MwSt. due/credit.   
If the amount collected is more than pre-paid, I pay this to the MwSt.  
office in Bern - respectively, if I paid more pre-paid than collected, then I  
receive the amount credited to my account.  I do this on a quarterly  
basis.     
Also, if you are close to the magic number to get a Mwst number and  
can loosely prove that you could make more if you had a MwSt. number.   
They will give you one, backdated to the beginning of the year.   
However, you must reach that magic number that year or they may take  
the MwSt. number away the following year.  If I am not mistaken, that  
magic number is around 80k.   
One last comment, the pre-paid tax does not apply to purchases for  
your own use.  Only for purchases for items sold or purchases of  
material to perform the services ordered.   
Good luck!

			I'm currently sharing a storefront in the center of Geneva with a bicycle repair shop. My business runs from May to September and so I'm looking for someone to take over the space for the other months: October-April. There would be the possibility of creating an office in the back of the store during the other months. The location itself is a little old and worn, but it is in the center of Geneva (just off Servette) and has lots of window space. Consider using it for just storage and we can reduce the rent to 500 chf per month. The price is very good for what you would have. (800 Chf plus charges)

			something curious is this :     
in some couple - year - old press release announcing some material deal with US broker Refco, ACM is presented as having a strong 'Central Europa' and 'Middle East' presence. No mention is made of Western Europe.     
Then it sounds like the beginning of that firm was perhaps people with cash on hands in these areas that found it nice to have it managed by a firm they would control in Geneva.     
but perhaps someone knows better

			Definitely USM is the way to go in Switzerland. It is pricey but excellent quality, endless combinations, good/simple & timeless design and colours.  
Most offices use it here.    
A link for the website in english:     
If you are looking for any secondhand USM in black, we put an add in the for sale section the other day, as we are closing a design studio.  
If you want new then there are numerous furniture places that will order it for you too.

			Thanks Jester, the idea was discussed with the customer prior to the 
 shooting.  The reflection would be visible, and he said OK.  The clip 
is still not published, should be when the new site is released to the 
public.   
Perhaps, with one of the next shoots we can try without the glass.   
Although, something tells me that it would not be realistic without the 
reflection and all.  That is the idea in advertisement-photography, is 
to keep it as simple as possible for the brain to understand what they 
are looking at.  Thus, without the glass and reflection something would 
be missing, thus confusion and dismay... like some of us here   "	null	null	null	Solved! Precision Rotating Table	guest	null	2,364	10	Business & entrepreneur

			Swiss fuel prices vary greatly - also from canton to canton.   
IMO the Swiss are not so concerned about fuel prices as say the Brits. But come the next fuel hike this could all change.   
The difficulty with such a website is keeping it up to date and if the stations add their own prices, keeping it honest - remember the snow depth report from ski resorts...

			Hi all,   
I am a fairly newbie to web designing, and am doing a sort of ""apprenticeship"" with an NPO/NGO. I am wondering how I should in the future price my services.    
As I am still learning the more complicated bits of databases and content management, I want to offer a price or fixed fee that's realistic. I know what I can offer for writing content, technical or otherwise, that's my bread and butter. But design and forums and membership management is something I am learning and want my business to grow in this area, so I am learning about it.    
What do you think? I am an engineer with fairly good programming skills otherwise.    
Please feel free to PM me with what you know about the market / business / prices within Europe and Switzerland. Would be happy to connect with some of you as well professionally if we can.    
Thanks in advance,

			Thanks for the info, 
Actualy I have been to Raiffeisen as this is where my mortgage is. 
The initial reaction was a bit negative but after the meeting and the presentation of the last few years accounts and the plan for this year it ended in their idea of an account with overdraft to cover the cash flow and the purchase of new material. 
So I should know by early next month.   
I think what realy cliched it there was that a regular client ( Al Jarreau ) who usualy tours in June starts on the 15march . The contract requires a new keyboard (3800.-) the contract has a value of 32,000.- this year, & I have bben able to raise the price for this tour from 16,000 to 19,000.-    
Also maybe the new value of our property ( thanks gemeinde) we purchased 3 yrs ago for 230k and now we have new value of 380.- might have helped. 
I will let you know what happens

			Thanks again guys for your wisdom. Scott, we are pretty much on track with most of your points, except for Credit Check which I will discuss with you later. At the moment we offer ""officially"" only Paypal, prepayment and COD. With regular known customers we will ship small orders on a trust basis that they transfer funds within a few days. Also, local people can do cash pickup by appointment. We offer Euro payment, but warn CH customers that Paypal are to blame that they don't except CHF.    
Mark, I will check out Aduno also. But right now we are in the process of testing the market to see which of our products are hot, and which are not. So far COD seems to be the most popular payment method, although I would have though Swisspost would have evolved from the hand-written carbon copy form for that by now. One thing in our favour is that we are selling proffesional products, so we expect 80-90% will be repeat customers and all payment costs are for them tax-deductable.    
So far we have found the following companies also helpful in setting up for distribution. There are possibly others but these had simple online shops with reliable delivery: The only thing I am searching for now is CH-compatible KMU accounting software that is not too expensive and relatively user friendly. I think Clarina is one popular version, but at 1000 francs its too much right now.

			RapidWeaver seems quite good, I have one problem with long descriptions below each picture, some wrap the description text and others do not. Other than that, I could actually make my next webpages using RapidWeaver, which I intend to buy. I see one can get a FMPRO plug-in and I wondered whether it will also talk with Extensis Portfolio.

			I am involved in creating 3D material for Space education in the Uk and was wondering what the scope for 3D equipment/production is here in Switzerland.   
Is anyone involved (or interested) in the 3D business in Switzerland?   
It is a growth industry in the UK and I suspect there is a good business to be built here.    
Any feedback would be welcome.

			As far as I know, they do not require a business plan although you should have one as a serious entrepreneur.   
When setting up a limited liability company it is different compared to a  
sole propiertorship where you have to file a business plan and to prove viability unless I am very much mistaken.

			Hi all.  Please don't get excited... yet!   
I am in search of: ... persons that are qualified to give seminars and workshops in diverse  
soft-skill areas of interest. See the list of areas below.   
If you feel you are qualified, then continue on: You must have the  
schooling, experience and references supporting your capabilities to  
give these seminars and workshops in the English language to persons  
other than of English-Mother-Tongue.   
You should have very good presentation capabilities and most  
important, be able to travel, deal with European and Asian cultures.  For  
proper invoicing, have a registered company is a requirement.   
Soft-Skill areas of interest: Plus one very important relating to Taiwan and China: If you still feel qualified, send me a mail (please, only per direct post or  
E-Mail,  ).  Include your specifics, experience,  
references and best a photo of yourself, don't forget a link to your  
website.  I am not asking for a CV, just an informal mail with info about  
yourself and your experiences in this area.  By the way, male or female...  
the assignment is not particular.   
I am not promising a job to anybody.  Here is the background, for a  
pending contract I am looking for supporting persons to fulfill the  
corners of the contract that I am not able to cover myself (I am  
experienced in the technical training areas).   
Also,   include your financial requirements.  I would like to get an  
idea about who you are, without the mention of funds.   
Hopefully I will see a few contacts over the next couple of weeks.  I  
would appreciate your information before the 31st of December 2008.   
Thanks in advance!   
Bests, 
Scott

			I am also an American psychologist. You might want to try    
The website is in four languages, including English, although write ups for specific offers might only be in German.   
Once you go to this website, change the language to English, click on the 'Rent' button, and again on 'Industrial Object'. Select the region (Bern) and eventually the city (Bern). Once you selected the city, a whole selection of industrial objects available in that city will appear. To narrow your selection, there is a drop down menu called 'type' - select 'practice' and it will show you anyone with a room for rent in an established practice. Some people look for someone to rent office space full time and others look for someone to rent office space for a few days a week.   
I hope this info helps. Good luck.

			I received much valuable insight from this forum, and in particular a gentleman named Richard, regarding how to form a business entity in Switzerland.  Having successfully worked through the gauntlet, I want to offer the process that I followed so that others may also benefit.  My payback, if you will.   
Background:  I run an LLC in the United States that provides business consulting services to marketing organizations of world class companies.  We anticipate growth to Europe and determined to set up operations in Geneva due to the location of existing clients.       
Research, Research, Research.  Get all your ducks in a row by reading this forum end to end, researching business entities and associated pros and cons, and outlining the process you will need to follow to establish your business in Switzerland.   
My process was as follows:       With a LOT of prep work you can work through this in a week and then allow a few more weeks for the details to run through the normal routes.     
If you read this far... I hope you found this useful.  I will reward you with the single greatest resource that helped us establish our operations in Switzerland.  The Department of Economy and Health!  No kidding.  We met with their representatives whose job it is to help people and companies do business in Switzerland.  They were an enthusiastic resource that provided access to fantastic contacts and references.  I won't name names, but can refer you to their general web site at  .  My strong recommendation is to arrange a face to face meeting, share your goals, and inquire about resources and steps in the process.  They produce a PDF for Geneva, available here:     
I hope you found this useful.  Best of luck to all who read this.  I look forward to many more positive interactions with this site and working in Switzerland.

			Hi,   
My husband is being offered a job in Switzerland.  We are both non-EU, but currently living in Vienna.   
I make and sell handmade Jewelry and handcrafts.  I currently sell them in fleamarkets and christmas markets.  I import more of the raw materials.   
Would it be hard for me to get a business license in Switzerland?   
Does anyone know if the rules and taxes will be very different than in the EU for this business?   
Are there good markets in the Basel area?   
How is the business climate currently?  Does anyone know how Jewelry prices compare to the rest of Europe, for example?   
I know these are a lot of questions!     But any information would be really appreciated!   
Thanks!

Hi Richard,    
Many Thanks; will be negotiating a re-wording to restrict to only the specific project and specific department concerned. Refuse to sign up to a 12 month clause stating the words 'direct or indirect' and business unit(s) as the company is large and a clear restraing of my freedom.   
The agency in question doesnt have any such right over the client and I had 2 agencies chasing me for the role so was not an exclusive introduction but me allowing them to be a representative as would have got the job either way (had no preperation from the agent on  phone or actual interview), I like my agent and have no isse with them making money on this role but fact is they did little other than give general info and make a healthy profit- I even paid the interview flight so any future limitations are not welcome.   
Had initially advised the client I was leaving at end of current contract and its the client who has gone out of way to keep me so doubt the agency will want me to walk away.

			hi all,   
I'm the owner of a GmbH in Switzerland, and I plan to have a Brazilian guy working on a project for my customer (my potential customer is in Mexico, but this is irrelevant to the question). The guy lives abroad.   
As far as I understand, I would not have to care of any of his local taxes or social insurances, as he's not a swiss resident. He would send me the invoices as a private person and I would pay them as a GmbH. It's in that guy's responsibility to declare his income and pay taxes and social insurances.   
Am I right in this thinking, or there are any other things I should consider?     
thanks

Registering a company may help you gain credibility with suppliers and customers - but it's not absolutely necessary to start off with, when you may want to spend that money on essentials of setting up the business. You can always register at a later date.   
If you are going for ""strawberry jam"" (analogy - any kind of food), you might want to make yourself familiar with the Swiss Foodstuff Laws - Lebensmittelgesetz - which is regulated right down to the amount of additives permitted in whatever.   
As Lynn says, Gründen.ch is a good place to start.   
Good luck !

			Obwalden is the Swiss canton with the lowest company taxes. (Like Delaware in the USA?) Many companies are incorporating there. It is somewhat remote, which is why they had to lower tax rates.   
If you are a big company like IBM or eBay, then you can negotiate a special deal with many Cantons.

			I have recently started a 3 month contract in Bern and also have my own UK registered company and am working through an agency in Zurich. They have told me that I can invoice a maximum of 10% of my monthly contract salary through my UK climited company and then pay Swiss tax on the remaining 90% as personal income. The UK and Switzerland have dual tax laws so if you pay 20% Swiss tax on the 90% you will not have to pay that again when you declare the earnings in the UK. 
However if you set-up a Swiss bank account and leave the money here, you can withdraw money from that account whilst in the UK. 
I currently have 2 contracts with the Zurich agency, one in my name for 90% of the hourly rate and one in the name of my UK limited company for the remaining 10%

			Hi Jack and thanks for your reply, these are excellent points and I was aware of the issues regarding hiring and AHV etc. and of course anyone who applies needs to have the proper permit. My intention is to share the profits with independent distributors on a commission basis. Although this type of employment is usually not practiced here in Switzerland it is quite common in the US. It can work very well and affords very flexible hours.

1914	16.07.2008, 17:21	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Prague moving to Genève	"     
I am currently registered as an independent translator in the Czech Republic, but will shortly be moving to Geneva where my wife is posted.    
Can anyone tell me very approximately what proportion of gross earnings one would expect to retain after taxes and other compulsory deductions in Geneva?    
For example, if one invoices the equivalent of 4,000 Swiss Francs per month, how much of this would one pay in taxes, ""social security"", etc.?   
Please excuse me if this question is overly simplistic (or has perhaps already been asked). I am just looking for a rough estimate, assuming that one takes whatever standard deductions might be available, without itemizing one's expenses.   
(I am assuming that one has to declare oneself in Geneva if one lives there for more than 6 months of the year or does this rule perhaps only apply to EEC countries?)   
Many thanks.

Hi Vera,   
I suppose it depends entirely on how much depth you want to go to  .    
Since the beginning of this year, I am PRINCE2 certified. From my experience in the course, I suggest that if you are totally new to the field, a PRINCE2 Foundation course might not be enough to understand the fundamentals of project management as such. Any one have a different opinion?   
I have been working as an IT and business consultant for more than 20 years. In that time, I also managed several projects with only a few weeks of training in seminars, which - today - would not qualify as ""formal"" qualifications and - IMHO - is not sufficient to be really good at managing a project.   
Last year, I commenced a Master of Project Management, based on PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), with the University of Southern Queensland, Australia (USQ  specialises in distance education!). In this course you can really gain an indepth understanding of what is required to be a good project manager.    
Of course there are the costs ... currently (afaik) AUD $1,640 per course (that is about the same in CHF), of which you need to take 8. If you only take the four Project Management modules, you can graduate with a Postgraduate Certificate in Business. And you can spread the costs over several years, by taking only one module per term (or even only per year!).   
You can find all the information about the course here:    
N.B. The MBA you can acquire at HWZ in Zurich is provided by USQ! (see here:  )

There is no difference between selbständig und einzelfirma. They are both terms used to cover the creation of a personengesellschaft which can have one or more people but the owner is the person who takes the full liability.   
If you are wanting to work for a company abroad then you can indeed declare yourself self-employed. The primary reason for not allowing the same situation with a Swiss client is inter alia the issues with AHV. Also in effect you are an employee of the company just not having the advantages this provides and that is something the Swiss authorities are not keen on; vorsorge ie retirement planning is important to them...

You can PM me if you wish for more information on hosting web servers. I work for a Service Provider in Switzerland and would be willing to provide you with technical input on what you need to do should you wish to co-locate equipment to a data-centre or if you want to start-up in your bedroom and DIY.   
First thing is to think up a name for your company and then register the domain. Some registrars are cheaper than others.   
.com is preferred (commercial) for an international presence or .ch as abfab says for Switzerland.

For example (sorry: I can only use an IT example), if working as contract DBA and you screw up, do you personally want to be liable for dropping a UBS trading server... ? 
Indeed, I don't know of any Einzelforma IT contractors... they are all set up as GMBHs or employees of an agency.

			Thanks Richard for clarifying this.   
I own an IT consultancy GmbH and wondered what would happen if the contracts dried up (a possibility in the current market).   
Effectively I am paying 2% towards something I'll never be able to claim against.   
You do have to state whether you or your partner own the company:       
The only way around this I guess, would be either to wind up the company, or maybe work for another company that you don't own for a while.   
It does seem a little artificial though.

Your problems probably start with your certification.  You will need to find out if it is recognised in Switzerland (probably not) and what you may have to do to have it recognised.

			In this context I suspect that freebird's post was written with input assistance, but of course AbFab is right.    
1) Insurance: in principle the same insurances are advisable like for commercial organisations, because the liabilities don't differ, as far as I know. Maybe a company owner can help you here.   
2) I agree that this legal entity should be based in Switzerland but can't help you if and how many Swiss residents are required, this probably depends on the organisation form.   
3) I'm not sure there's a difference between charity and non-profit organisation in Switzerland. For a start   are the four criteria defining a charitable organisation on the federal level. I think that the decision if an organisation becomes tax-exempt is made at the cantonal level, there might be other or more criteria there.

			Hello,   
Over the coming months I will be forming a company and will be opening an associated bank account.  I recently met with UBS who seem Ok, but am wondering if anyone has any recommendations.  What would be really useful for me is a bank who can provide some advice relating to starting a company in CH and possibly even network me into useful contacts (and of course which has low bank fee's   ).  My business is in the high techn area, and I'm based in Lausanne if that makes any difference as far as any regional recommendation might be concerned ...   
Thanks

Capital as liquid assets = 0 ie a car is often enough.  
Capital not being able to be touched prevents it being used for the business which effectively means you cannot trade. So no.

			solution 1: As someone answered in a previous post, check the swiss post web site       
they do not have the requirements of large swiss banks in terms of deposit.   
and services offered are good with full online access  .     
solution2: if your company is a large established in your country and you can count on banking references, go definitely with a branch of that bank. they will be able to do this directly from your country.    
helps as well if you need to transfer funds back to your country. they now the procedure and can do quick transfers while agreeing on a group fees.   
as well while you are in switzerland, if you go to that branch you will be sure to have at least one employee who speaks your language and can understand the document  in danish you present to the office teller...     
dealing with local banks can be an issue when you are from a country with such an exotic language as danish...   
less of a problem if you come from the UK.   
can really be a time saver in some cases.

			I did some English teaching through a company I set up while I was unemployed here. I just had to declare the earning as ""Zwischenverdienst"". The RAV seemed quite happy about it. I guess if you're out there being active you're more likely to wind up back in full time employment either for yourself or another.   
It's a common critisism that the unemployment system can be abused by people using it to finance a startup.   
So, yes. You can.   
Double check with the RAV. It might be best to wait until you are actually on benefit too before officially starting anything.

			You can buy insurance for almost anything, provided that you are willing to pay the requested premium.   
What sort of insurance do you want/need as a caterer?    
Insurance for property damage to catering equipment? Who owns the catering equipment? Where is the catering equipment located? Is the catering equipment always used in a different location? Who is required to take out the insurance - you or the company you are hiring the equipment from?   
Insurance for liability risks arising out of food poisoning? For e.g. a person claims they required hospitalisation for food poisoning after eating at a party where you were catering.   
Insurance for liability risks arising out of injury/death caused to third parties caused by misuse or malfunctioning of the catering equipment? For e.g. a gas burner explodes and causes third degree burns to someone at a party where you are catering.   
The list is endless. You need to specify to your ""insurance person"" what your needs are. Actually, ideally, your ""insurance person"" should be trying to sell you as much coverage as possible. He's either not very good at selling insurance, or he's not willing to take any risk.

			Hi from another Canadian, 
what part are you from? 
To help you with your question about opening your own business, a lot of us do and are successful. One most important thing is your civil status here. Are you married to a Swiss national, have you any permit to work or live, do you have an open AVS? Do you have health and accident insurance in place? 
For any new business, you need to be able to communicate on a professional level in the local language so you can fill out the forms, talk to the governement, etc etc. Or have someone who can really help you with this all the time. If you wish to stay in the cleaning area, you don't need any papers to prove you can clean, if you were doing something like surgery, then you need documents of license of course. 
You need help to pay your taxes, pay your AVS (retirement fund), book keeping, plus other legal items which are impossible to cope with if you cannot read or write in German or have someone who can help you at a moments notice.  
So you can do it, but it will be tough without German.  
Call your local federal registry and ask for documents to read about new business ventures. 
Good luck!

I want to setup a business for importing leather goods (jackets/shoes etc), in the Lausanne area (imports will come mainly from Pakistan as I have some of my family and friends already involved in the export business) .   
The idea is to setup some outlets and later on a distribution (if things work well).    
Does anyone here has an experience as far as what the legalities are?   
I will be setting this up along with my wife (suisse), so hopefully me being a non-EU bit will be taken care of  .   
I have seen the posts for setting up business etc; I wanted to know if there are any ""specific"" restrictions as far as importing leather is concerned ?   
Thanks a lot

			I will start by summarising my situation:   
* I am British and own a Danish limited company. 
* I am shortly moving to Zürich to start a Swiss foreign office of the Danish entity. 
* We are in the process of registering the ""Zweigniederlassung"". 
* I will also be doing some consulting work as a sole trader (outside of the company).   
I have several questions/problems:   
* I need to know what is legally required of the ""Zweigniederlassung"". I have done a lot of research into accident insurance, unemployment insurance, pensions, old age & survivors' insurance, VAT registration, bookkeeping requirements, etc. but it is difficult to find an exhaustive list of what is relevant to a foreign branch.   
* Secondly, I need some help arranging my financial situation as it now spans three countries and my status as director, employee and sole-trader. Can anyone recommend a good English-speaking, Zürich-based accountant/financial advisor with good knowledge of cross European situations?   
Thanks a lot,

Just try calling them (you'll find them on google). However, you might really be better off with an acquirer from another country.

Please make sure, when you are looking for a place like restaurant/cafe/guesthouse in the advert, that the price listed is either for: 
- taking over the business stock and equipments only OR 
- together with the whole building 
Most of the times, the price quoted is for taking over the business.   
To buy over a business might be easy but then you will still be subjected to answer and fulfill several criterias required by the building owner.  Usually they are careful so that the person renting their place are capable to run the business and hence, continue renting the place from them for a long term. 
Questions like, your background, experiences and financial backup are the normal questions they ask.   
Good Luck.

			Main thing is, that you are allowed to consult externally in accordance with the contract you currently have and the employer gives their blessing.  Ask.  If they agree then get it black on white.   
They might get wound-up if you are performing the same or similar job on your off time.  Especially when you are on vacation.  Reason is, that you may be using the current employer's resources and know-how to do a job for someone else.  There is usually a clause in your contract that covers this.  100% of the time to benefit the employer (since he/she is paying you).   
As already mentioned, be sure taxes are covered.  Contact your local tax office for that.  Also, if it is doing anything that you may be injured or where you could damage anything material, be sure to have insurance.  For example, I have 5 Million to cover anything material when performing a job.

This is somewhat subjective. I could buy 10 Picasso's for $100 from a dealer thinking they are not original. When I then sell them for £1000000 each 1 year later I need to pay VAT on the sale price but nothing additional on the purchase price - VAT and Duty free.   
On the other hand if I have a haulier ship them I will likely have a value that is much closer to their real worth in my opinion as I want to make sure they are insured in the case of their loss through fire, theft etc.   
So in answer to your question I would strongly suggest bringing them personally is the way forward as then you can ensure the value is low for customs purposes.

Almost regardless of country you live in, the care of the elderly is strictly governed if this is not family. In Switzerland you need to gain a permit to do this, which requires the production of relevant certificates to show that you are qualified plus having whatever building you use to house the elderly certified as appropriate by the local authorities. This is all not easy and not cheap.    
If this is really the route you want to take and you have the money to do it and your wife is qualified then I am sure the local authorities will be accommodating. But as a business you would really need to have a couple of elderly people staying with you.   
Of course you can do this unofficially, by simply not creating the company and finding an elderly person who wants to live with you. There is nothing the state or any other authority can do to stop two adults living together if they are both in agreeance.

			Thanks for your suggestion. You may be right and I'll follow your thinking when I look. In my experience in the U.S., however, smaller companies try to do everything in-house and so are the right targets for seeking a full-time job, which I am not at this point. The very large companies have so much work they regularly out-source proposals. There is a whole ecological niche in DC for people serving this need. Unfortunately, most of them are military contractors...

You can simply reassign your headquarters to Switzerland and have the Danish company contribute to headquarters a fee. This then is taken as a foreign transaction for company services and is tax deductable. I am not so sure about Danish tax law though so I might need to check up on exactly how it works but doable it certainly is.

			I used to travel a lot internationally with demo equipment. My experience is:   
1. Always have a Carnet ATA with you, correctly filled out 
2. Get your Carnet ATA prepared by a specialist that knows their stuff. Made my life easier. 
3. Know what is required with the Carnet ATA - varies in various countries 
4. Always declare the goods, especially if they are obviously goods (I used to have big aluminum travel cases and always got questioned) 
5. Never arrive at the airport / border crossing outside business hours. The customs guys work Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. Outside these hours no-one will be around to do the paperwork! 
6. And never bullshit the Swiss customs officers - they take their job very seriously, and will cause you a lot of hassle if you try and bypass the system.   
So with the right paperwork, it is easy to bring things in and out of Switzerland.

			Hi All,   
I'm looking to rent a small room/office for a couple of hours a week for the next two-three weeks in Solothurn.   
I'm giving intensive English examination preparation for a client's upcoming Business English exam, and unfortuantely, he doesn't have anywhere suitable where he works where we could meet to do it.   
Does anyone know of anywhere with reasonable rates or of anyone who would be willing to let us use their office/room space?   
Times would be between the hours of 9am-12pm, days not yet fixed but probably Wednesdays and Fridays (although could be more depending on how much last-minute preparation he needs for the exam).   
Thanks in advance!

			Since almost 4 years I've got the perfect job! I work with expats from all over the world, coming to Basel, trying to understand our system and having happy faces once I had a meeting with them.   
During the last years I really needed most of my time trying to understand why people from abroad have so much problems with our system... The answer is quiet easy: The system is perfect, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT! I lived in UK, France and Argentina but there is no country with more rules and laws than Switzerland.   
Last December I've done a presentation for an American business club about our three pillar system. They did not pay me and I did not prepare myself professionally... But I don't remember a evening holding a speach of about 30 minutes and have fun this way... Some of the guests are my clients or even friends now. So in the end I really did win something...   
This evening was a great thing and probably it won't work again this way. But I am damn sure there are plenty of people not knowing about the circle of ""taxes-insurances-finances"". I would like to go on with that because I like look of faces starting to understand,... because I like to help as others have been helping me abroad,...   
I am not an event manger, I won't organize anything (besides that I've got enough work). But invite me (pay me a drink) and I'll tell you what you need to know about our system.

			Thanks, Richard. Your post does make things very clear.   
In the meantime, I have also realised that lawyers here don't really want to negotiate much with the authorities, so am trying to find somebody who is best to present my case without 'Chinese whispers'!   
Yes, I have had 8 years of experience in Mumbai and Dubai, before doing an MBA, out of which the last 2 years have been as a successful entrepreneur in the field of start-up consulting. In fact, I have come to realise that my experience in the Middle East and India does stand as a unique point v/s other EU nationals, around which I can pivot my case to obtain a permit. My company is aimed as business development, helping companies expand to and from Switzerland. I have also made some points in my case about projects that I already have in hand, and local employees that I would be looking at employing over a 6 month period.   
If there is anything else that I might have missed, please do let me know.   
Once again, thanks a lot for your help.

			Hi, Janovich! 
I don't know what you exactly want. But If you decided to pick some ideas from Swiss clothing company, nothing comes in my mind first.    
There is one interesting Swiss brand, which isn't clothing company. It is multi fuctional bag..Have you ever hear ""Freitag""? It is Swiss brand and unique design oriented messenger bags + more producing company. They are even extended their biz to many other countries including Japan, too. You can visit   and read about their sucess story recetly and so on. - there is english version.   
Hope it gives you some ideas. I think they are doing smart marketing activities... Not bulk but unique & focus. I wrote short article about their brand as well. Have funs!

1994	05.01.2008, 00:25	Member	Thanked 35 Times in 22 Posts	Location: lausanne	"    I would say that men doing ""kissies"" with other men still tends to be pretty much reserved for close male friends (no innuendo implied) even in a non-business social context, so that is pretty ""forward"", but in a not-for-profit set up I would expect it to be pretty informal.  But I wouldn't take the lead.. go with the flow.   
Chatting and getting to know people a bit before getting down to business is normal, and unless you excuse yourself on the basis of you only have a short time so do they mind getting straight to it, it would be polite to spend 5 minutes on small talk.  It's very worthwhile anyway because often its a great chance to ask for tips, advice and contacts at a time when people are inclined to want to be helpful... since they are going into a meeting with you from which by definition they want something.   
Last time I was in London I really noticed how many business meetings are now taking place in Starbucks'    
Im not aware of a ""guidebook"" as specific as you describe, but there are plenty of sources of the more basic stuff for countries eg should you turn up for meetings early, spot on and fashionably late, and what should you take if you invited to someones house so as not to offend with too little or too much.  Im sure a bit of googling will help.   
Good luck.

If this is what you are looking for, the only requirement i could see is that you can actually do the job and have a sound understanding of the subject. Normally, a sample of your work should do to convince your future employer. As of late, the tech writters are being asked to put their copy in graphic design programs (like indesign, for example) so save typesetting costs.

			Right. I understand the capital part of it now. Very similar to the danish model (i run a danish ApS which seems identical to a GMBH). Regd. other assets I think it's a lot easier to pony up the cash in advance, and if I have some other assets, I can ""purchase"" them from myself after company creation at fair market value. Besides, with the volume of business we will be doing from the start, we will need the cash anyways.

			I found my Treuhand the following way. The previous one was too hard to communicate because of my poor German at that time, and also he lost some papers, and also he never answered email.   
I just took all Treuhand companies in my area from the Yellow pages and have sent them email in English with my questions. The guy who has answered in the most complete way was my best choice, and we work with him together for all my taxes and GmbH grounding/accounting since about 3 years already.   
This has solved several problems at once: 1) language problem; 2) email as the modern way of communication; 3) energy and pro-active help to resolve my problems.   
I think you would find some young and energetic accountants in your area this way.

There are so many complaints in that forum but only a few about the work that most day time includes.     On the other hand I really started to love drinking tea at all occasions.   Only the tea with the milk is something that I will try in my next stage here.

So many things to think about...

For tax, if you were in the UK for more than 180 days you were obliged to register and there was something about if 90 days continual you may have to register.  Whatever, a work permit was required.      I did that for almost a year  .  You could do Monday to Friday as long as you travelled on those days as travel days weren't counted.  However, if you come and stay then the 90 day rule applies.

What you do need to do is go and talk to a notar about statutes. In order to do this you need to have a reason for creating the business ie what the business will do.    
The authorities are not interested in whether your business will succeed or fail indeed how can they know so they are only interested in a tick list of tasks that must be completed. For the company registration authorities you can write your statutes in any Swiss language or English and this will not slow the process down as the key point is whether everything is there that should be and also whether the monies are correct...

An opening balance sheet. Whenever you start a business you have opening positions. These fall into four type passive debt, passive credit, active debt and active credit. You need to put your figures in to each box and sign it. That is your opening balance sheet... It is very simple to do and should reflect the capital you put in, your bank balance, money owed etc and all balance to zero. All companies should have a balance sheet that balances to zero by the way. 
No you will get a B permit some time after that. The Swiss like to wait and see that your business generates income otherwise they would be giving five year B permits to every Tom, Dick and Harry that turned up and said I am starting a business today. They usually change to B on 1st renewal of the 6 month L, but they can make you wait a whole year... If you form a GmbH/AG/SA/SArl then you do indeed get a B permit as you are then employed

			I just found some stats on this yesterday, which I found very interesting, but decided it was too geeky to post anything about it on here. However, here is my perfect excuse. There are lots of statistics over at  , particularly linked from  .    
The most interesting document for you would be   giving the number of non-Swiss living in each canton. The numbers you are looking for are 139,544 non-Swiss in Geneva, or 33.9% of the population. This includes 4,379 on L-permits (described as ""short-term residents""), 38,517 on B-permits (described as ""residents""), and 96,648 on C-permits (described as ""settled residents""). The equivalent numbers for the whole country are 1,541,931 or 20.6% of the population, of whom 37,969 have L-permits, 422,699 have B-permits, and 1,081,263 have C-permits. You can also see in the document how these numbers have increased over the last five years: Across all of Switzerland, the total number of L- and B-permit holders has gone up by almost 30%, and the number of C-permit holders has not really changed. (These figures are all from August 2007)   
There is also  , which gives the number of foreign residents (their term for expat) from each country. From the English-speaking countries, there are 24,867 from the UK, 1,780 from Ireland, 18,640 from North America, and 2,751 from Oceania (sorry for the lack of detail in the last two). (These figures are for the whole of Switzerland and are from December 2006)

			Inspired by cyrus' thread about not being able to find his receipt for guarantee purposes, I am wondering how folks are coping with the mountain of paperwork that you need to maintain in Switzerland.   
I have recently got all my paperwork in order and am thinking of passing the information on. For sure I can do a FAQ and post it here, but what I am thinking of offering is some kind of package where I will present a newcomer to Switzerland with a folder, hole punch, stapler etc, with instructions such as ""put your payslip here"". I could easily extend that to the more established folks here, who find paperwork a pain.   
It doesn't sound like a grand money earner, but I'm presently unemployed, and don't wish to go back into the corporate world where next year I could end up with a sheer bully of a boss.   
There is also another side to this. From my reading of this forum, there are plenty of ""trailing spouses"" who feel trapped by their situation and would love to do some work for someone else, no matter how mundane. I know from my own experience that it matters not how much money you have in the bank if you don't have some kind of life outside the home.   
Thoughts please?

			you are probably right; I wil still look into the freelance set up fees and paperwork, (does anyone know of a website or office in Geneva that might answer my questions,); but for ease salaried is probably the way to go, all of my admin expenses, taxes, insurance, etc, are covered by the employer I suppose-- or at least deducted from my pay check);  especially since to start it is only less than one day of work a week... so at 25% more pay as a freelancer, even once my expenses are covered, my administrative headache time would not be covered.

			Dear Groovy,   
Thanks a lot for your comments and advise.   
I will have a meeting with AHV just to be sure if all is ok. In fact I wish to start the manufacturing business here . In this case , they should not be worried as I will also be creating some job opportunitues even if it is one person to start with. After  reading all the threads , i am confused and will check with them once again if with a non EU B permit I am really allowed to be self employed.   
I am not sure if I can start an SarL or GmBH and if so and if it make things easier to start.   
But as you said it is better to be sure before I decide to resign.   
Thanks once again.

			Hello everyone, 
        Sorry I am joining the discussion late. I am in Jason's group trying to market Jamba Juice for our class project. I carry duel citizenship with Switzerland and was born in Zurich so I guess I sort of influenced the decision to bring Jamba Juice to CH! All of the responses are very helpful to us and I thank you for your feedback.  
         I agree that the choices of juices in Switzerland are lacking. I too have tried Rivella and was perplexed as to why it is so popular. Probably my favorite juice is the Apfelsaft as the orange juices are way to sweet for my taste. 
           I also agree that we would have to market some of the smoothie choices toward Switzerland with names such as a ""Farmer's Smoothie"" with some sort of Swiss connection. Some people drink these smoothies ""on the go"" as sort of a quick replacement meal, so I think a great place to bring them to would be the train stations. The fact that RedBull was marketed successfully in Switzerland is a positive fact for us. 
            I will be in Switzerland at the end of June and wish I could bring you all some Jamba Juice smoothies to try but I think they would melt before I arrived on the plane!    
            Most of the smoothies I have seen in Switzerland are very heavily based with yogurt. Jamba Juice carries some with frozen yogurt and some that are just fresh fruit based. They also come with a choice of a ""Boost"" which is added to your smoothie which contain variations of vitamins or protein depending on your needs/wants. I guess one question I have is how popular are vitamins in Switzerland and do the majority of people take them?  I know when we visit our relatives always ask us to bring them multivitamins from the US because they are so expensive there. (In reverse I tell them I need my swiss-vitamins which is of course swiss chocolate in exchange!) 
          Thanks again for your responses! 
Cheers, 
      Jamima

There is indeed a bilateral agreement between UK and CH but be warned they have just renegotiated it and your HMR&C will be(is) talking about the old agreement. I am not sure what changes have occurred in the new agreement nor do I know off hand from when they will apply.   
As you are moving here with your wife and family the Swiss will view your centre of life as being here. Theoretically you can lose your permit if you are working for a company outside of Switzerland and living and working there too, after 180 days out of the country. As you will be frequently coming back then there will be no problem.    
By the way as an aside... I actually calculated that you can claim practically your entire salary(80%) tax free working out of Switzerland if you can find this UK umbrella company that will deal with a Swiss company... The remaining 20% will attract minimal tax... It would in fact be possible to lose it all in expenses, but then you would not have a salary which would not work... IF, big IF, you can find the EU based company to charge against then you really are better off working out of Switzerland.

What market are you looking at? There is huge competition in travel services, and you need to target the niche. Airlines love free copy, so get your pal to pen an exciting story about what one may expect on a trip through the bush and add a few photos, then send it around the various in-flight magazines. You could even suggest the airline co-ops some element by adding-on their flight schedule, eg: Trips to the Africa with 100p Expeditions, serviced with 12 daily flights direct to...   
This approach does work and my mate managed to blag a few free (standby) flights in exchange for poorly worded essays.

			Companies can train their staff, and such training can be deducted as an expense. I remember reading some time ago that there are rules regarding whether it qualifies as training, or education not viewed by the tax authorities as a company expense.   
Anyone got any insight into this or examples of what they have found is, and isnt, allowed against tax (ZH) for company employees ?

The personal tax is negotiable if you are wealthy enough and go to live somewhere where they are open to the concept. For example a Bill Gates would be welcomed anywhere in Switzerland with a red carpet. A David Beckham while wealthy would interest only those who are happy to be involved in a tax negotiation and mere mortals earning say 250K per year would be asked to pay normal tax.    
Commercial tax is a different story and here it is always possible to negotiate or defer or ...

			We have found   - and decided to use this for switzerland, UK and germany. They will take aroung 40 percent of the cost of the sms as their commisssion. Probably will use another provider for US and far east (Our main target market) 
It is quite easy and reasonably inexpensive to set up (the only large cost is to set a help number in   country - or you can pay Zong to do this for you, which in my eyes is very expensive - Zong say that this is a ""mandatory"" requirement, but I am a little suspicious about this). 
I will keep you posted once our website goes live and I have a chance to properly evaluate the Zong concepts and realities of the ""percentage"". 
I looked at lots of other providers before I chose Zong, so I recommend anyone else looking for a similar service to start their search here and maybe save yourself some time.

If your business must be registered in Switzerland you could consider a virtual office as your registered business address (Regus.com are reasonable and there may be other Swiss firms providing such services).     
I can see difficulties and/or expense ahead if your business intends to import raw ingredients or prepared food products.  More regulations than a thing made entirely out of regulations. Many food businesses have an excellent business plan at first but forget that Switzerland imposes duty on imported products or ingredients so watch out for that one  .

2056	17.05.2007, 14:42	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zurich	"      This is quite a simple question really. The company that is distributing the goods are committing the offenses of USt (and potentially Zoll) Hinterziehen. ie Evasion of VAT (and Duty). The offense of  evasion of duty payments is by implication of the main offense of Evasion of VAT and is only potentially there ie depending on what you are claiming.    
Why is this so. Imports of goods into Switzerland are free of EU VAT on crossing the border into Switzerland and subject to duty and VAT in Switzerland. The duty part is normally waived on objects imported from the EU with some exceptions. VAT is only exceptionally waived. If the goods do not enter Switzerland then they remain subject to VAT at a point within the EU. If the goods are being sold to an EU VAT registered company then they can claim a VAT free transaction. They however are liable for the VAT in the place where they are located on all the sales they have within the EU. 
VAT registration in Switzerland is not part of the inter-community VAT legislation. ie a Swiss company is automatically exempt from VAT once the goods enter Switzerland. But it is an offense (false representation ie fraud) to claim VAT on goods that never left the country potentially also the warehouse.    
I would suggest this is a variation of Carousel fraud. You can find plenty on the internet about this. In particular the German company will be taking the major part of the can for this. You will only be a participant in an illegal scheme. Note also you will not have any need to pay VAT on the transactions in Switzerland. The whole of what you are doing is VAT free. Until of course the goods enter Switzerland to Swiss customers where you need to be very careful.    
The chance of getting caught in Germany is relatively low. The chance of getting caught in CH and therefore exposed in Germany is however significant.

My gut feel is that you will find a lot of resistance from local interests, that said somewhere like Verbier, may have a more relaxed view.   
Earlier in my expat career, I worked in Val d'Isere for a couple of seasons & a couple of guys were practically run out of town as it was felt that they were taking work away from the locals.   
I would suggest you get in touch with the local authorities in Verbier etc & ask them directly what is the requirements.   
Good luck

If this is through a GmbH or SA then you can put more or less what you want in the package that you receive and this can then easily include childrens education.    
A car is a no brainer irrespective - it would appear your accountant No. 2 is a jerk. How would you claim back the train fairs if your job was selling insurance within a country district where the trains did not go? Or if the trains stopped running at 8pm as if often the case. Car is not going to be the problem, childrens education is what sets a challenge...

Having a room or rooms from your accommodation is possible but often requires a separate entrance. If you have one then you can determine how many rooms you require.    
You can start a company with a B permit although if you are not an EU citizen you will be jumping through hoops - surprise surprise.    
With respect to your pensions you have them the wrong way round ie 2nd pillar is the company scheme. As a self employed person you can choose to have 3rd pillar only and this is then up to 30K per year as long as it is over 25% of your income.   
Taxes: - there are only two types of tax you pay. Income tax and Value Added Tax. The VAT is optional for turnover under 75K and requires more work in the bookkeeping if you have this. Furthermore, you need to register your business in the company register which adds expense. As a self employed person you only need to inform the AHV through your Gemeinde. AHV/IVA is a personal deduction ie you deduct it from the salary you pay yourself. If you don't pay yourself anything you don't pay it - not strictly true as you need to pay a minimum. There are other deductions such as IV(invalid insurance) but you do not need to pay ALV (unemployment insurance) as you cannot claim anyway. You will also need to insure against liability and against accidents. Although the former is optional you are daft if you do not have it!    
The amount of the insurance is dependent on the business and the cover you need and can vary between very little and a lot. accident insurance is relatively cheap and you can cover this through an addition on your health insurance for around 10Francs per month.    
For business premises you can have a room in your house, or rent something specifically for the purpose. If you attempt to sub-let in someone's flat you are asking for problems as they would need to inform the authorities about it and they can say no depending on the business.   
Starting a business in Switzerland is extremely easy you simply tell the AHV that you are from now on self employed. Alternatively you can create a business structure and officially register even as a PLC if you have the capital to pay the deposit.   
Between Scott and I, we have covered all your points. If something is not clear ask a specific question and we will possibly answer...

You can indeed reclaim the VAT and duty paid in Germany when and only when the goods are imported ie cross the Swiss border. In other words you can import them from Germany and then take them back over the border and post them or indeed down the road to the Swiss PO. The point being that when the goods reenter Germany they are usually, dependent on value, liable for VAT and potentially duty - you of course are now not going to need to pay this.   
What you cannot do is virtualize the crossing the border...

			I googled before posting and found a set of guidelines for permission e-mail-marketing at  .   
I was wondering if the law can acutally be put into practice. We get loads of un-asked for leaflets/brochures/samples etc, which are addressed to us,  in our letterbox - it's a legitimate marketing channel. BTW I'm not talking about unaddressed leaflets, which can be avoided with a ""Stopp Reklame"" sticker.    
So, while I am no fan of spam in the sense of e-mailing untargeted nonsense around the world, I wonder how small businesses can now try to acquire new customers, specific to a particular target group, via e-mail without getting fined for it.    
For example, if I wanted to send an e-mail to bakers all over Switzerland advertising a new product - then that would be illegal after 1.4.07. If I wanted to do the same with a brochure - that would be OK.   
Any thoughts?

Dont get me wrong I have been   well advised on some specific topics and tax negotiations by teams from big firms, but we are talking about   well into 6 figures CHF, picked up as part of much larger transactions.   
You are better served for the bread and butter stuff by a good small firm.  I have had good, albeit limited, experience with Bruno Bosshardt at   in Zug.  I just dont use them for personal stuff as I am based in Schwyz and local knowledge is key in CH.

2081	11.05.2006, 20:57	Member	Can anyone recommend a lawyer who's familiar with English and Swiss law, particularly regarding owning a business (normal private ltd) in the UK with its registered office there and running it from Switzerland? Or anyone out there that doing/has done the same?	Posts: 151	" 
			
			Hi.   
I can help you with this stuff.I am pretty much in the same situation myself.   
Except, my business is starting UK companies, and my friends/colleauges over here do the same for swiss businesses.   
I am not sure if you can still run your UK business from here. Pratically, i mean. You hint that you would need to look for local work over here.   
So what do you do?   
If you do computer based work, you can choose where you say you did it. A lot of mine i do on the plane between switzerland and the UK, so one doesn't have to lie.   
In this case, say you worked in the UK, deduct what you can for company expenses, and pay the corporate tax to your swiss account via the company account.   
As far as the UK is concerned, these are franked dividends and there is no tax owing. As far as the siwss are concerned, this money is your savings that you are spending whilst on holiday (it is your savings - you erned and saved it in the UK)   
If you work on material or in offices in actual locations, you will have a more complex time. If you work most of the year in the UK, and a bit in Switzerland, you should set up a branch company of your english company. this is easier than a fully blown Swiss company, and cheaper.   
If you work most of the time in switzerland........ meh. theoretically you should open a swiss company and make the english company a branch. However, i would not do this. You get more tax savings by having two companies, because you must have the swiss one and the English one costs nothing to run. So why kill the english company? Keep it so you can do funky stuff like subcontract work to your self in another country and minimize your tax the traditional way.

			I have two cents which you can have for free.   
The NORMAL WAY (which is actually theway rich folks do it) is for the non EU subperson (I am one) to start their own company and pay themselves a nice fat salary.   
This way your company can do whatever business it likes. the idea is ost often to get a B permit this way, however, not to start a business.   
Clearly this is extremely expensive. The only reason it exists as an option is to make work for lawyers and to allow wealthy foreigners to be treated like real people from europe.   
So you don't want to start your own company. All the lawyers will say you do, but you don't. You really don't. It is like paying an extra 25% tax at least, by the time you add up all the little extra costs for this and that over the year.   
So, the issue is more whether you have a B permit already. If you do, i THINK ( I am really not 100% - you must check) that this means you can do business AS LONG AS YOU PAY TAX.   
My understanding of the law is that Switzerland has no ""work permit"" as such. There are only residence permits, because the swiss have worked out (clever swiss - cleverer than the UK, anyway) that a person who is allowed to live in a place may as well be allowed to work and pay tax there.    
So, if you have the B permit, i believe you are authorised to operate a business. Whether your permit is renewed after you submit tax returns showing self employment, that is another question. My belief is that if you were paying tax, and not injecting crack into your eyeballs where the kids could see it, you would have no problems.   
I could be wrong on this. It is entirely possible that somewhere there is a special regluation that says non EU sub humans cannot operate a business on a B permit. I know EU humans can, and I know you can change jobs without asking permission even if you are non EU scum.   
The thing is, i would do it and submit the tax return. If there were any questions, or if some government Johny made a fuss in german at you, i would start screaming that i was being oppressed, and my human rights are in tatters. And so on and so forth.   
See, it really comes down to your human rights, as a holder of a B permit. If you do not have the liberty to trade and feed yourself (and generate tax) when you lose your job, you become fearful of losing your job and quasi slavery results. this is so against the Swiss adherence to fundmental human rights in the workplace that any minor provision attempting to punish auslanders on B permits by restricting their right to trade to live must be wrong in law.   
That would be the argument, anyway. I say trade on, pay your tax, and let the commisar for cheese catch up with you if he finds the time.

Open standards (specifically SIP) are the way forward. I'd recommend Gizmo (http://www.gizmoproject.com/) as an excellent 'skype like' SIP softphone.

			What does the contract cover ? If the Maitre-D asked if you wanted any more champagne and you said : ""yeah get another couple of cases in for my esteemed guests (except for him over there that got me an inflatable sheep on my stag-night)"" then its pretty clear that you are not working within the confines of the contract. In fact its pretty likely that there is a clause covering such ""on the day"" ordering. If its something that was pretty clearly defined such as 67 three-course meals, and they are charging for 78, even though you only had 65, then you have a dispute.   
What are the added items that you view as ""unfair"" ? Your use of the word ""unfair"" makes we think that perhaps you received and consumed the item or service and were somewhat surprised to be charged for it ?

PP was very slow in addressing the problem even though I had provided them with all the necessary documentation. After 6 months of waiting for the matter to be resolved I gave up and cancelled the US PP account. Lost almost 2 grand but I couldn't be bothered anymore and since then not really wanted to give PP credit card processing a chance again. With moneybookers I do not have chargeback problems because people that want to pay with their credit cards are actually using their CCs to fond their MB accounts and from that cash making the payment so in actuality it is a cash payment that they are giving me. Anyway, to those that use PP I am glad that it is working for them but PP left a sour taste in my mouth and I don't feel like giving them a second chance.

COOP had 2005 overall sales of 14.065 billion CHF vs Migros 15.6 billion. Swiss Bank Corp merged with UBS in 1998 and stopped trading under the Swiss Bank Corp name. Where a business is located will always depend on the product they are selling and the type of business it is. If it is a retail business than the common real estate motto ""location, location, location"" applies. If it is a manufacturing company, then it will depend on the product and where their raw material is coming from. While it has been recognized that employee satisfaction is related to better productivity, management's top considerations regarding where it locates its headquarters will normally be decided on what makes better economic sense. Point in question, a big Swiss pharmaceutical located in Basel recently decided to relocate the headquarters of their generic med group in Bavaria where they were offered better tax write-offs then the ones they could get in Basel. At the end of the day, the bottom line (profit) plays the major role.

			We are currently looking for someone to share our office space at the   in Weil am Rhein - just over the border from Basel. It is roughly 1km from the border, very close to the Marktkauf.    
We run a music distribution/retail (online) and record label out of the office, and would like to share up to 1/2 of our space. It is roughly 45 square meters (maybe a bit more, I'm guessing), ground floor with direct outside access.    
This would be perfect for someone looking for some storage space, a place to do business within the EU or to receive shipments.    
Depending on how much floor space you want, rent will vary. However, it will be less than 200 EUR a month (probably more like 150 EUR a month, but again, that will vary depending on how much space you need or want so it could be less, too.).    
Please contact me privately for more information.

2106	26.09.2006, 16:23	The Architect	Thanked 418 Times in 115 Posts	Location: Zollikon, Switzerland	"    Ok, here's a REALLY useful bit of advice, so listen very carefully. Expats in Switzerland are usually quite web-savvy, and if looking for something will use google (unless they are in here asking dumb questions because they are too lazy to use google, but that's a story for another day). So anyway, I tried a little experiment and put ""Karen Millen Zurich"" into google. Nothing. So I took a guess at   and found there was a site there. But the site      
Now, from a search engine point of view there is almost no content on the site, and any information there is contained within graphics, which are invisible to the search engine. When google arrives at the site, it sees a couple of words, and leaves.   
I've been involved in marketing of a few businesses here. I don't want to go into too many details here, but let's just say that the competition is still scratching around for customers and the businesses with a good internet strategy are scratching around for more staff.   
You don't have to spend a fortune on fancy flash-based sites (which don't work in search engines anyway), but you cannot afford to remain so invisible on the internet if you want to make any headway!   
My point is - why bother with trying to think of marketing ideas when the people who are out there looking for you can't find you?

			Hi there,   
From the Swiss point of view there are no big issues in doing this.  You just hold a ""board meeting"" which decides to establish a branch office in Switzerland and draw up a certified copy of the minutes of this meeting.  After that you can use the copy of the minutes to open a copy bank account, register for VAT, social security and so on.  You can decide to register your ""Branch"" in the commercial register or not, it is up to you.  One thing you will have to do is establish a pension fund for your ""Swiss Employees"", in other words yourself, if you are going to draw salary.   
The big question is what will you do with the UK side of it.  From what I remenber the UK no longer accepts non resident companies, so I expect you will need to do a lot of extra admininstration:  you will need to keep accounts etc. for the ""Branch"" and the ""Head Office"" and submit corporate tax returns in both countries and so on.   
Botton line is that you will need to get advice on both sides for this, so it is  best to talk to one of the international accounting firms who have experience in handling this kind of thing.   
On the other hand setting up a Swiss company is really not such a big hassle, so unless there are some very good reasons not to, I'd go ahead and set up a Swiss company.   
Best Regards,   
Jim.

			We aren't talking about much tax anyway and it seems to worry you! I'd have declared it. But presumably the tax return for 2005 was lodged earlier this year.    
The correct advice is to contact your local tax office and say you forgot and ask them to add it to your joint income - this may well mean you complete a new tax form and start all over. Or at least re-sign the existing one.    
My advice is forget it! The tax people have bigger fish to fry.        your pension fund should have terms and conditions by the book load to explain this. It is common for a pension fund to be frozen until you are at least 50 - especially if there are special contribution terms - ie where the employer has paid a part or you claimed it against tax - like ""pillar"" 3A. But if it was a simple % of your income, then you may be able to have the pension now in a lump sum.

			As most of you hopefully already know,   is an exhibition designed specifically to allow small businesses like ours to exhibit our goods and services to the English-speaking sector of Switzerland.    
Our next Expos will be in Zürich on September 16th and in Geneva on October 8th.   
Additionally, in Zürich we are planning to dedicate one room to use for seminars and demonstrations. It will be a 6x9 meter room complete with chairs, desks and a podium. Exhibitors may book the room at a rate of 50 Chf/hour.   
If you can't exhibit, we hope you will come and visit the Expos anyway!    
Thanks, Ed McGaugh

			welcome, Rakesh.  How's your German?  Because to set up a business and operate as you wish, there will be the need for capital outlay (for shop, equipment and also business setup) plus the majority of your clients will be, unsurprisingly, German-speakers.  So you'll likely need to speak some (as in a lot really)

			I reckon the best bet for this would be if you ran it like a coffee shop. If it were a coffee shop with an internet cafe then you should be able to open late and on Sundays.   
By the way - this part of the forum is for advertisements, I'm moving this message to help and tips.
