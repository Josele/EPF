			This topic is used for travel/day trips in and around Switzerland.   Switzerland means it's OK to discuss continuing events in the neighboring countries or ""How to drive from Switzerland to England/Czech Republic"" etc.    
For travel to other countries, ""Who's going to Ibiza this summer?"" or ""Who has tips about Japan?"", then you can post them in  . An even better idea would be to search online for a travel forum that deals with the region. (Eg: the   or at  ).   
Sometimes we have ""visitor"" members who are coming to visit Switzerland. It's OK for them to post here, as the feedback they receive may be interesting to others here.    
Commercial posts are not allowed, however cunningly they may be hidden.

Swiss airlines does and does not give a  about the law. If you challenge the payment, will you probably get your 10 CHF back. And blocked from any future online booking...       
I'd totally pull that trick with some dodgy ticket website. But I would not do so with any airline I plan to use in the future...

Go 2nd class, it's far quieter and not many people, you get far better view than in the 1st class panoramic waggons which are usualy full of tourists.

			IIRC Stoos has an airboard run - just not sure whether you can take your own tube.   
Even then I'd avoid ""proper"" sledge runs - a tube is going to be twice the width of a normal sledge and you're likely to cause a whole load of accidents blocking so much of a run.   
Stick to hillsides you can walk up and exist on common land.

			One important thing is that the train you take has to stop in the station that is the last one in your area. For example, if you take a ""fast""/direct train that does not stop there your local pass is not valid and you need an SBB ticket for the whole journey (or at least from the last real stop of that train in the area covered by your pass).

			Every year around the second Sunday in December the SBB introduce the new timetable which is carved in stone for the next 12 months.    
The major changes this year concern the Gotthard route under the Alps to & from Tessin. The Base tunnel will now be operational and should cut 30 minutes off the journey. The old mountain route with the looping tunnels will still be used.    
There will also be an increase in prices, mainly on the season tickets / annual abonnements.             "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Oct 2011	Groaned at 544 Times in 344 Posts	SBB new timetable on 11.12.2016, new fares too	Sbrinz	Posts: 11,011

			As far as I know the trains will no longer stop at the Eiger North Wall station which is for many people an important and never to be forgotten part of this excursion.  
The planned cable cars, waiting only for governmental approval, will also ensure that the region will be full of Japanese and Chinese 30 minute tourists - the main thing is of course that the cash rolls in.  
A few years ago I took an American business colleague to the Kleine Scheiddeg - he said it was so beautiful that a motorway was needed.

I think Livignio is really good option. Its great ski resort for families, if you are into skiing or would like to give it a try. The rental is very cheap and skie lessons as well comparing to CH. Also possibilities for langlauf. 
I haven't tried any SPA's there myself but worth checking great food and shopping (tax free zone).

			Hi,   
If you're looking for an educational day out in Zurich:   
There will be a   at the Rote Fabrik cultural center in Zurich. At least 50% English spoken, so no language issues there...   
Some highlights: 
- all your 1980s home computers ready to play 
- minicomputers from the 1970s, like the PDP-11 with proper Blinkenlights 
- lots of creative DIY electronics around computers 
- video games from the very first one (from 1961) to the 1990s 
- Even some Big Iron mainframe computers: an IBM System 360   
Want to show your children what computers used to look like before the iPad? Or satisfy the Inner Geek?

			It does for the next trip.  
At the end we went to Rhine falls and had a bit of a drive around the area before going back to Zurich for dinner. The next day we just walked around Zurich (after stocking up on cheese of course) 
On the other hand, i will never say again that Geneva is expensive. 
How you guys survive there i will never know!

First, forget about the top of Uetliberg. I did not quite realize how much light is up there. The whole path from the station to the hotel is lit, the whole terrace up there is lit, they even had fireworks   No good.   
Walk away a little and it gets better. I went down towards the city, I suppose one could also walk south along the ridge and find darker spots. I found a place relatively isolated and with a clear view. But by then clouds had rolled in. Just a few of them, but they catch and reflect city lights so well, it makes the whole sky way too bright.    
See   for example.    
And that's just for a relatively short exposure time, any longer and the picture is covered with clouds. There's no meteor in there, but there are planes. Those are also annoying. It's probably better to go later when air traffic has slowed down.    
Bottom line, Uetliberg may work but (1) walk away from the top, and (2) hope for perfectly clear conditions. Even so, I did manage to see a few meteors. A handful of bright shooting stars, and once my eyes were really accustomed to the dark (and this takes a while, not just a minute, but a good 15 minutes or so), fainter ones as well. I wished upon them for the clouds to go away, but it never worked    
Good luck to those who go hunting tonight.

			Spent the past weekend in Bologna to see the   exhibit.   
It is indeed, despite some lapses & pitfalls, an incredible smorgasbord of sights and sounds. We were amazed by the sheer number of teenage fans (some w/ Bowie makeup as well!) that on sunday queued almost 3 hours (yep - do buy your tickets in advance, see link below) to visit the exhibit. Saw & heard many older fans singing along to the videos... a touching sight. 
[Note: this is the LAST date of the european tour, the exhibit will move on to Japan in 2017...you're warned...]   
The MAMBo museum is situated right by the city's historic centre, with its piazzas and score of shops, eateries and sundry foodie hangouts which makes for a great weekend getaway IMHO. 
If you plan to drive there are also other noteworthy visits: Bologna's ""Food Valley"", Maranello (hello Ferrari fans), Sasso Marconi, Palazzo Albergati, etc, etc...   
The train station is within 15minutes walking distance from the historic San Petronio church and square, and about 10 from the exhibit venue. There are high speed train connections from Milano Centrale (60 minute trip w/ @ 300km/h stretch if you're into that kind of stuff).   
Links to the Bologna exhibit:     [tour]   
Cheers & beers & rock'n'roll!

			At the end of each season, Rent a Bike sells off some of its bikes and electro  bikes, they have been maintained by professionals, and are usually only lightly used. You can reserve one before you go and see / buy it.          
If you search the site, you find there are several shops around Switzerland, and they also offer plans for individual cycle excursion tours.

			Last September we spent a long weekend at the campsite in Aquacalda, just below the Lukmanier Pass.  It had good and bad points... 
Good: 
Nice restaurant attached to site 
Allowed campfires on pitches (and some had fire places built in) 
Next to a lovely stream 
Fantastic location for walking the mountains round the Lukanier pass, which are gorgeous   
Not so good: 
Pitches were very small (only just room for our 4 man tent and car) 
Site was very small and felt very cramped 
It's high altitude (1750m) and in September it got down to freezing by 8pm every night...  This would probably turn into a plus in the summer though!   
It's the only campsite in the area, so if you wanted to stay near the Lukmanier pass, it's your only option.  If you're going in the off season, it'd be lovely and quiet, but may be a bit cramped in the high season.  It'd definitely be worth calling ahead to book.

It can mean small and squashed together caravans that are old and decrepit and full of weird creepy people who live there permanently and make you feel like you're camping on their private lawn and whom you wouldn't want to leave your children with.   
You can get lovely campsites in the U.K, notably in Wales, the Lake District and Scotland where your dreams would be fulfilled.   
The concept doesn't exist here as far as I can see.

			Depending on how difficult you want to make it - there is a nice high route called Haute Route from Mt Blanc to Zermatt, it can be done in parts - hut to hut or camping. The route is quite difficult carrying the full camping load though.   
There is also 2 - 3 day route around Gotthard pass - Oberalppass. 
You can also go close to Vrin / Vals area. 
There are some trip reviews here -    
Though for this year, it might already be late as it has become a bit cold.

			We traveled with Lufthansa Airlines from Frankfurt internationally, to the U.S. west coast (10+ hours) with a 1 year old and had a very positive experience. All our flight attendants were extremely kind and accommodating to our needs. We didn't have any problems on our flight and in fact Lufthansa service stood out to us as exceptional. We flew to the same destination on a different airline this summer, and in contrast the service was inferior compared to what we experienced with Lufthansa.

			Have a look through the Reka holiday website.  They are tailored to family holidays, although many places are booked a year in advance - people like to be organised here...        
Also, you need to be mindful that not all resorts have snow until mid January so you might want to go somewhere pretty high.

			Walk is quite straightforward. Depending on your logistics check the times of the bus or train for your return trip as they are very patchy especially around lunchtime and/or out of season.     
If you want to do yourself a favor take lunch at La Remise which is excellent, in season you need to book to be safe.       
Just remember that Chamonix is subject to mountain weather, that is to say the forecast is broadly useless and weather can change suddenly so take a good waterproof coat and decent shoes.

We spent a long weekend last July in a small, nice camping at Longemer lac. 
Less busy than Gerardmer, incredibly inexpensive, full of Germans, however I spotted a couple of U.K. number plates, one on a fantastic yellow Spitfire, the other one on a more practical Golf MK IV sw.    
Highly recommended, bear in mind I like minimalistic camping (we have a Salewa Micra tent). Quite place during the week, not much to do around a part from swimming, fishing, cycling, walking, enjoying nature. Just perfect.

			Life of Pi. Just finished it, and loved it. It's described as fantasy, but perhaps not quite the genre you're after.   
Try Steven Donaldson, the Thomas Covenant trilogies (there's two of them). I particularly liked Stephen Lawhead Pendragon Cycle (arthurian legend) and The Paradise War trilogy.   
Another good take on Arthurian stuff is by Bernhard Cornwell - I think it's the ""A Novel of Arthur""  series, starting possibly with the Winter King.   
I'm sure some are available on Kindle.

			Hi everyone,    
Last Saturday we went to the annual event of Konstanzer Seenachtfest, wonderful fireworks (I think it is one of the best in Europe that I have seen)!!!!!    
It happens every year the second Saturday of August. Here is some introduction of the event. If you haven't been there, definitely worth going next year.          
I took some pictures from boat in the middle of the lake. You are welcome to check them out in the following link.       
Just put one full picture here so you know what I am talking about.

With the more expensive tents you get a much lighter, more durable tent that will last a few years and will be better in strong winds. 
It will also pack down much smaller.   
A cheap tent like the one in your link will serve your purpose just fine.

Does anyone know of any coach trips or similar that are available as it only takes an hour to get there by road! Thanks

			Don't think that just because you park on the Swiss side that you can simply load up without concern about customs allowances etc. Those controlling the traffic also keep an eye on pedestrians. I had been over a couple of times to the car and I got stopped on foot on the Swiss side and asked to show what I had bought / matching receipts etc. Of course I had less than the limit...

			Worth paying the extra to take the tunnel, no reported road delays to Folkstone other than the increased French immigration checks     Dover delays: Motorists hit by second day of disruption   
Motorists are facing a second day of tailbacks through Kent, due to delays with French border checks at the Port of Dover. 
The government said UK officials helped at French border posts overnight and remain on standby after motorists suffered ""extraordinary disruption"", with some queuing for up to 14 hours. 
Delays began on Friday night and could last until Monday, police have warned. 
Kent Police said it would ""proactively"" manage traffic to ease congestion. 
On Sunday morning, the Port of Dover said passengers travelling on the A20 were still experiencing road delays of almost four hours and up to thirty minutes on the A2, followed by two-hour delays inside the port. 
A spokesperson told the BBC that current delays were due to more traffic heading to the port, as it continues to deal with Saturday's backlog.      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2007	Groaned at 94 Times in 75 Posts	Horrendous delays at Dover port	Castro	Posts: 4,797

			I will definitely be visiting a supermarket or two! It's an integral/fascinating part of any trip abroad, business or leisure. Hubby loves a foreign biscuit and we'll need supplies/snacks for the kids too so it totally makes sense to have a browse.    
Hotel can be of my choosing. The company one has a very high rate for a family room (and will only reimburse the equivalent of one night in a single room) so cost is a big factor bearing in mind I'm not yet earning CHF. How is the Astra? Looks reasonably sized and priced...   
Having a car might make things easier for my kids in terms of building in naps (and strops due to evening time flights) rather than subjecting the Swiss public to my little angels on public transport. But it's an additional cost/faff when I hear trains etc all run v smoothly. So we'll have to weigh up whether we'll think we'll get the use.   
The Santa thing sounds fun so think we'll give that a go. Any idea how long we'd need to allow for it?   
I'll be back with an itinerary for you to critique. Thanks guys.

There's so much more to do on Crete.  Although, thinking back I'm not sure that my 12 year old was completely fascinated by the ruins  .   
Still, she returned there last year with her boyfriend .   
I found it amazing when I was 21, but then a room with a wonderful unspoilt view was only about CHF 5 a night for the both of us girls, having booked the flight the night before.  With 'Turkish coffee' with the landlady thrown in  .   
Have been there a few times since, always a different experience.

The meeting point is Zurich Hardplatz at 5 PM and the arriving point is Metro Andel near the center of Prague.  
Leaving on Sunday from Prague at 4PM. 
The return price is 69 EUR/75 CHF if interested. 
Cheers

The number of people here on this forum who are interested enough in volcanoes to actively re-schedule their holidays around sudden outbreaks is probably very low, TBH.   
And it looks like most of them are in are in parts of the world where you wouldn't set your foot even without an active volcano :-)

			Hi all,   
A friend from Abu Dhabi who is planning a trip to Switzerland was asking about the scooter ride from Bort - it's a 4.5km run it seems. He was particularly asking about suitability for children aged 6 to 9.   
From what I can read on Tripadvisor, young children will have trouble keeping the brakes pressed for auch a long time.   
Does anyone on EF have direct experience of this scooter ride?   
Cheers,

How are they supposed to know you weren't just going to be a little late collecting the ticket? If they'd simply handed it on to someone else because you were five or ten minutes late at the reception desk you'd have been cross, and understandably so. These things are done on trust, you've now proved you don't deserve that trust.   
Each commune/gemeinde has access to a very limited number of these day passes, which they subsidise so that locals can have a day traveling around the country.... maybe making a trip to visit friends or family that they couldn't otherwise afford. Others buy them just for a cheaper day out, but that's fine too. By reserving and not collecting your ticket not once but four blooming times you've deprived others of that chance. 
Hopefully you'll get a bill not only for the four tickets but also a nice fat administration charge on top.  
How you were allowed to reserve tickets after the first or second non-show is a mystery, but fingers crossed you're now on your local commune/gemeinde blacklist and will never be allowed to be as selfish again.

			Get the free Musée Suisse smartphone app.    
What you should do beyond museums depends on your interests. You could walk around the lake to Le Bouveret and take the ferry back. You could walk to Chillon castle, take the trolleybus back. You could take the train to Gstaad, have lunch at the Posthaus Rössli and return (fare CHF 50, resto menu is online). You could go to Monthey and visit the Fondation Gianadda and see the Zao Wou Ki exhibit and the car museum. You could go to Vevey and see Musée Jenisch Vevey and see some Oskar Kokoschka paintings and others.    
We did all of that and much more over the past 2 weeks we stayed in our flat in Montreux.

			Hi   
Anyone got any advice on where to go for a day shopping trip, mainly to buy cycling clothes & accessories, but also a few general clothes (not designer)?   
I have researched this forum on places to go, how to get there (by public transport from Zug), customs procedures, etc.  I have a GA and don't mind a bit of a journey - quite fancy making a day of it.  But where to go for the type of shopping I want?   
I hope this isn't a duplicate post, I did try to do a bit of research on here first.   
Thanks, 
Alison

			Yes, sounds like my profile, only I'm a little older. I treat myself to these few days WITHOUT family as a rejuvenating cure (only started last year, so a bit too soon to say if it's working or not!), it clears all the cobwebs, forces me to practise a bit of German while enabling me to truly appreciate what a beautiful country Switzerland is, especially off the beaten track.      
Beats in my view far away holiday with long flights and crowds, but again, I am quite contented with little, probably why I feel so integrated in Switzerland!

			Two points on comments made.   
It IS possible to do it in one day from Zürich, but you would have to get on in Chur as mentioned, meaning you miss out on the St. Moritz-Chur stretch, effectively 2.5 hours/one third of the journey - I don't really see the point in that.   
Secondly, it's not possible that the journey from ZH to St Moritz and/or return from Zermatt to ZH are included in the ticket price, those two journeys alone cost a total of around 200chf (without half tax)    
It's a journey I keep meaning to do but never get around to doing - I have a GA so the journey would only cost whatever the seasonal seat reservation costs, it's just always finding the right time to do it, as I would certainly spend a night in both Zermatt and St Moritz at either end.  Not been to St Moritz yet, but have been to Zermatt many times and can never tire of the place!!

187	03.04.2016, 14:12	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 9 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Basel	"    When I first moved here, I had a half-fare card. I kept a track of how much I spent on train tickets every month. Initially this was quite low.   
After I'd been here some time I realised that (due to changes in my circumstances) I was spending so much on train travel that it was worth my while to get the monthly general abonnement. (Incidentally, it is possible to buy an annual general abonnement which, at CHF 3656, works out cheaper than a monthly one, but you have to pay the total amount up front).    
I kept the general abonnement for several years, and really enjoyed having it as I could travel further afield in Switzerland at no additional expense, as well as making all my regular trips.    
Then my circumstances changed again and I cancelled my general abonnement (mainly because I couldn't afford to keep it).   
At some point (can't remember when) I also had a monthly travel pass which covered my canton, plus the half fare card. This enabled me to travel freely in Vaud (useful for my daily activities), but I could also benefit from reduced travel costs when I went outside Vaud.    
Most recently, I have had a monthly pass which just covers one specific journey, plus my half fare card.   
In summary, I would suggest that you get a half fare card to start with. They aren't expensive and will quickly pay for themselves if you travel any distance. Then keep a track of your expenses and after a few months work out what option (general abonnement, monthly pass for your canton, or point.to-point pass) is best for you.

Basically, it's a grand menu and you just have to pick the most scenic place.

			I'd like to take some visitors (i.e. no 1/2 tax) up to the Schilthorn since it's close to us, offers great views of the mountains, has the cool/kitschy James Bond museum, and the revolving restaurant.   
The last time I was there I was skiing for the day and my lift ticket (63 CHF) covered it (afternoon would be even cheaper at 48 CHF). Why would anyone pay the single fare of 102 CHF for the Stechelberg-Schilthorn round trip      
Am I missing something here?   
cheers, 
dave

			This is why I'm only occasionally Canadian. It's embarrassing sometimes... and still the border yoiks are dickheads even as a citizen. Takes hours, makes you feel like shit.   
Got stopped at Halifax and grilled once about why I was going there - apparently ""Home for my father's radiation therapy"" wasn't a good enough answer. Eventually I dropped into full-on down home speak and she let me through, because I guess nobody but a born and raised Maritimer would ever talk like that.    
Sigh.   
Anyway, it was a Harper idea, so fingers crossed Trudeau Jr. will nix it.

			Hi guys,    
I am planning a day trip to Lungern on Saturday, however the cable car to Lungern-Schönbüel (panoramic view) is opening in April.    
Do you know if you can reach this point by car? How far you can get to the top for a beautiful view on foot or by car?    
Has anyone done snowshoeing in the area? Or has any recommendation for it?   
Thanks in advance for your insight.  
Cheers.

Eastern itself in switzerland , there is nothing going on, because everything 
is closed on friday and sunday/monday, except the shops at the airport/stations. It will be quiet the easter weekend in switzerland.

I'm planning on trip around (by car) Provence starting from nice for about 6-7 days on the 1st week of May.   
If anyone has been there, could you share a good (not too expensive (around 100 euro) hotel or b&b? also if you would like to suggest a routing, I would appreciate too.   
Thank you in advance.

			Le Chalet did not disappoint, but mind you nothing would with beautiful Gruyères under the snow, no tourist in sight, and the slopes of Moléson almost to ourselves, as CA Fribourg were not on holiday. I went for indeed 100% Vacherin fondue, although it no longer appears on the menu because apparently too many people trying it for the first time don't like it. I loved it but still think I prefer my moitié-moitié.     
Bindella Italian restaurant was where we ended up in Fribourg and the food was top range Italian, gorgeous, but service a bit slow.      
B&B on a farm, 5 minutes walk from the centre of Gruyères, was a little gem and outstanding value for money:    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2010	Groaned at 19 Times in 18 Posts	Combining Fribourg and skiing: where?	McTAVGE	Posts: 2,000
219	null	null	null	null	"    You are quite right, depending on how warm the spring is, there could well be snow on the walk between Männlichen and Kleine Scheidegg, we have certainly encountered it at the end of June, and of course the White Giants (the Jungfrau and its neighbours) are snowy all year round and with glaciers visible.  Only the end wall of the Jungfrau and the Silberhorn are visible from the floor of the Lauterbrunnen valley, but a higher elevation will reveal the three peaks, and there are mountains such as the Breithorn at the Stechelberg end of the valley should you head that way, and Schynige Platte and the Beatenberg visible if you walk down towards Interlaken.   
I would also recommend Lauterbrunnen as a base to rent an apartment for a week...... but then I would say that, wouldn't I, seeing as I spend nearly every holiday god sends here  ?

			One of my very favourite train journeys is the trip from Montreux to Château d'Oex.    
Sadly you are just a few weeks too late for the Hot Air Balloon Festival, but it's a beautiful trip and Château d'Oex is a lovely village - especially at this time of year with all the snow.    
If you like travelling just for the fun of it, and if you enjoy hot chocolate, then I recommend going to Villars-sur-Ollon and having a hot chocolate at the café La Gourmandine. There's not a lot else to do there, but the hot chocolate is really wonderful. Here's a   I wrote about one of my trips there.    
A little later in the year, you could travel up to Les Avants to find the wild narcissi, which are a beautiful sight.    
Finally, (for a suggestion outside of Vaud) I really enjoyed visiting the   caves, near Interlaken. IT's a great trip - you travel by train, boat and bus from Vaud... and the caves are beautiful. They offer guided tours in English too.   
Have fun exploring!

You have a couple of options if you don't mind the 1.5 - 2 hour drive up to Lenzerheide.    
The local Swiss Ski School has the tradional groups lessons and are very good, i highly reccomend them for groups lessons. If you prefer a more private situation then id reccomend contacting Epic Snowsports. There is an add on another forum section.    
Ski hire can also be easierly done in Lenzerheide with several ski shops having equipment for young and old. Lenzerheide also has a free to use beginners / kids area.   
I hope this helps,

			Also, if you do not get a reply today, send them a picture of your suitcase (or similar) and any identifier to help the search. Baggage tags?     
In principle what happens is that they have a suitcase somewhere with a luggage tag and the flight information that belongs to you. The luggage tag will be scanned and that then will show up in the tracking system. From there as soon as your luggage has been identified it will be flown to your final destination. There again it will be scanned and then finally you will be contacted for the delivery.     
IF your luggage has lost the luggage tag (identifier), it helps giving them as much information on your luggage as you can.     
And for the future: always staple/tag a business card on the inside of your suitcase. If it gets to the point that they open it to search for the owner, they will find your business card and can contact you accordingly.

			Have searched online but can't find all the info we want.  We're thinking of going to Beatenberg today and taking the Trotti path down - it shows as open online.   
What I'm wondering is if there is a way to hike to Vorsass (with a 5 and 8 year old -- so something like 2 or 3 hour max including adding in the fact that they are much slower than adults).   
If not, is there a way to hike back down to the bottom where you get the funicular from the end of the Trotti path?   
Also, is there an age limit for being a passenger on the Trotti?  We were assuming the 5 year old would have to ride with an adult, not sure on the 8 year old.   
We'll take the funicular if we need to to Vorsass, but if there's a reasonable way to avoid it, it's really the Trotti experience we're after.   
Alternatively, if there's a child-friendly Trotti path within an hour of Bern you can recommend, we're open to suggestions.   
Any other tips greatly appreciated!

			I am going to Lucerne's Xmas market next Sunday. We will be in the town for about 6 hours. Does anyone have any idea if shops have exceptional opening during the advent period, or otherwise things to do apart from the market? Did the Transport museum a few years ago, but don't know the town otherwise. Any restaurant recommendations for a fondue or somesuch ?

			Help needed from the group...   
...a friend of ours was going again this year and offered to book a spot for our son as well so my wife could take him as he and I had a great time last year.   
Long story short, she has had a lot going on lately, forgot to book our slot and all dates are booked out    
If anyone has booked and cannot make their date or knows of a friend or colleague who cannot make it, we would love to go in place.  Of course we would pay for the cost and send some chocolates as a thank you.   
Please PM with details.   
Thank you and Merry/Happy Christmas to all!!!

			Yep both beautiful - my neck of the woods- but in the Neuchâtel Jura, not the Jura Canton.   
The word 'Jura' confuses many. It is a Swiss Canton, A French  department, a French region (that includes Jura, Doubs, Franche-Comté)  and a Swiss region (which included part of Vaud, part of Neuchâtel, part  of Bern and part of Basel Kantons too- with the massive long hike from  Geneva to Basel, doable over a week or more, on foot, by mountain bike  or ski de fond/Langlauf.   
BTW 10.30, calling Le Doubs a small river is a bit unfair. It is 453 km long and the 10th longest in France- so a 'small river' it is not       "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Dec 2007	Groaned at 15 Times in 14 Posts	Your recommendations for Canton Jura	Deep Purple	Posts: 5,158

			Hello! 
A friend from England is coming over to visit next week and we'd like to try snowshoeing for the first time! A colleague at work suggested it and will lend us their snowshoes... But the next step is knowing where to go! 
I don't mind travelling for while, and would like go into the alps, rather than the Jura. Any trail suggestions? Something easy and not tooo long...Thanks!!

			It is called the GTJ (grande traversée du Jura) - your main issue will be to hire skis at one end and return at the other- unless you bring your own - and of course, accommodation- plenty of inns and mountain hôtels on the way, but not as cheap as camping. Get in touch if you need advice for the middle part.

However, they have been traditionally driven by organic growth from mass transit systems where the advantages were clear and allowed for high throughput systems. But this is dependent on automated/self-serve barriers.   
The contactless cards doesn't really make sense where there is manual checking. The current system of visual checking is faster, albeit less secure.

			Hi,   
This may be coming too late but I just saw this post and thought  I'd share ourr experience. 
We camped a lot this summer, mostly in Switzerland and the Eienwaldi campsite in Engelberg was probably the most incredible place for us and the kids- lots of outdoor activities for kids, own football grounds, small paddle pood, playpark, ping pong table. Totally accessible- we had no probelms with a wheelchair at all. 
For the parents- gorgeous views, Titlis at a stone's throw and a small thermal pool in an adjacent hotel.   
Well be back   
(ps. we cam back there on a cold September weekend and it was still packed with people, mainly families- that's got to mean something)

			I also used rentalcars.com (Now based in Athens !) and booked a Ford Escort with EuropCar at Bristol airport. I did the pre rental checks and found 5 items not listed. The office which was responsible closed at 5pm, so I went back to the issuing desk and got them to note down the extra damages, all now OK.    
Later, driving on the M6 a warning light came on, and there was no driver's handbook. I stopped at a service station & looked closely and decided it was the tyre under inflation warning. So I adjusted all the tyres to 2.5 ATU and reset the tyre check system. No other problems, but not having the handbook could have been a big problem. I have the tyre check system on my Skoda, so luckily I was aware of it, and knew what to do.

I've walked from the station once. You have got to cross to the opposite side of the road, there is a underground pass that will lead you there. Once there, you have to climb up a very steep hill right to the top.   
After the seemingly endless climb, you will see some residences & from there, you'll be able to find your way to the farm. (may need to ask for the direction cos I can't remember the turns but it is fairly easy after the steep climb.)   
Have lots fun...with the slope. :P

I'll definitely google it all. The movie tour might be fun, so I'll look into that as well. Now... any suggestions to keep us busy in the evening apart from the usual musical? As she'll finally officially be allowed a drink or two, I'd like to take her out for a cocktail or a drink. Any place to suggest? What about restaurants? Are there places a bit less common than the usual chinese/indian/pub grub/sushis I tend to go for when in London... I don't know, something unusual like a restaurant that serves desserts before starters, where you eat in the dark or where you eat while watching a show/a play... anything that could be fun and different?

			Didn't see this earlier or I'd have tried to put you off.  Marwees is at least a T4 hike which is only for decently experienced hikers.  As you describe yourself, you probably shouldn't go beyond a T2 if you're looking at hikes on Hikr.   
BTW, altitude is nothing to do with the blue and red trails.  Only difficulty.  You're unlikely to find a blue sign lower down but you can find plenty of red ones higher up.

			The Herbstmesse is pretty much the same every year, Mike (well, not the same as it was 544 years ago, but you know what I mean...). So if you liked the beer tent at Messeplatz, it'll still be there and you'll still like it.   
Having said that, the rides at Messeplatz have in fact changed since you were last here, following the redevelopment of the Messe buildings.

			Dear all, 
I have recently visited Geneva during the week-end with some friends. I had quite low expectations as Geneva did not sound like a very fun and interesting place to me, but I changed my mind during the visit.   
We found out about these ""Greeters"", who are basically locals offering free walking visits to tourists and bring them off-the-beaten tracks. Our greeter was a young man studying architecture, he had a great passion for his city and showed us things we would not have seen by ourselves. We really enjoyed it because it is a great way to see the city from the inside and discover things besides the touristy spots (the water fountain, the old town, etc). We also had nice discussions about the everyday life, our personal lives, and compared living in Zürich with Geneva. At the end of the stroll, we even went out for a drink together. The best thing is that it is very genuine: these Greeters don't event ask for tips or any money.   
I recommend it if you want to visit the Romandie with a local :-) I am not sure if it exists in other cities of Switzerland but it would be great to have it here. 
Cheers, 
Alain

			Hello, my SO and I will be in Murren later this week, and would like to take a scenic route back home to Neuchatel on Satuday. I'm looking at the GoldenPass Panoramic schedules. In order to travel on the Panoramic trains both from Interlaken to Zweisimmen and from Zweisimmen to Montreux, we would have to leave Interlaken Ost at either 1pm or 5pm, and it's about a 3 hour journey to Montreux.    
Any thoughts on which time of day might be better for sight seeing? Also, any suggestions on whether to book port or starboard side? Does 1st class offer anything more than the usual wider seats?

			Hi, my SO and I are planning to rent a car from the Basel area and drive along the Rhein Valley, the weekend of September 19. We'd be grateful for any suggestions for routes/highlights. We're planning on being away one night, but would extend to two nights if there's enough to see and do. We like to hike and drink wine (sometimes contemporaneously), and I'm a bit of a WW2 buff. Our budget is mid-range. Also, any tricks on saving car rental costs in the Basel area (like the French side of the Geneva airport)?    
Thanks, 
Swissward

It can be easily avoided by going over the Col de Riedmatten, which is right next to it. The Col de Riedmatten is steep on the Cabane des Dix side (i.e. the uphill side if doing the walk in the ""normal"" direction), but not in any way difficult or dangerous.   
I don't remember there being any other ladders...  a few cabled sections, especially if you go all the way to Zermatt via the Europaweg, but I wouldn't rate it as any more than a solid T3 on the Swiss Alpine Club scale.

			I always check on the ticket machine which has a map same as here :   
Calculate your number of zones from start to end. 
Check how many zone extension you need and get your ticket at the machine. 
If you destination is outside the region on the map then I usually go to the ticket counter .

			Hotel metropole right next to the SBB.  It's not great, but very convenient.   And Starbucks is next door so you can get your fix. 
Avoid Basel Hilton.  They are supposedly closing soon, so not putting any money into maintenance, etc.

2. You could check the weather forecast the day before and then make the reservation based on the weather forecast. 
3. I looked at the number of bicycles available for a number of the tours to judge which ones were popular. The tour with possibly the greatest number of bicycles, about 200, is Airolo to Biasca (#12).  
- You could buy an all-in ticket through RailAway, taking the train from Basel to Airolo. Then ride 40km on your rented bicycle downhill direction Biasca, stopping at a Grotto for lunch, e.g., Grotto dei Due Ponti. Then continue to Biasca and drop bicycle there. Return to Basel on train. This would be a full day.   
Also, these tours are self-guided with signs.

			Easiest would be to follow the Limmat to Baden - about 25 km and flat.  Return by train.  
You can also look up any ""Slow up"" events - usually a loop of 30-40 km of roads closed to cars and open only for non motorized vehicles.  Great for kids and adults.

			Hi   
So I visited it saturday.  Just about the hottest day of the year!  We went in at the west entrance.  Didnt do any of the crafts, (well saw the wood saw and blacksmith), but managed (just) to do the complete tour, see and go in all the houses.  Was a really good trip and the SBB 30% special deal made it a very reasonable day out.   
Having gone in the west and finishing in the east entrance.  It didnt make a great deal of difference I dont think.  Doing it the other way round may have meant more downhill perhaps but very little difference.   
Would probably do the museum again and next time just concentrate on seeing the crafts rater than the buildings   
Long an short of it from all this waffle.  The museum gets my vote and I recommend it as a touristy site for any visitors.

			I have no idea about St. beatus caves, but I went to the Vallorbe ones quite a few times and they're quite nice. You can go pretty far in the mountain. But it takes only 2 hours max to complete the tour, so you'd better add things to see to the trip to make it worth it. The Jurapark is not far, for instance.

			Not for Swissward, who knows what the problem with the parents is, but  'I cannot walk very far' can mean anything. Heart trouble, lung trouble, hip pain, knee problems, or just lack of training. 
The Spouse mentions a problem with the altitide which may have to limit Alpine trips, even in a cable-car or a post bus.  A friend of mine had a stroke while still young and can walk up gentle hills with a stick quite well, IF the surface is smooth. Downhill however is a problem whether it is smooth or not.    
And don't forget, even if heart and lungs are fine,  from the age of about sixty upwards it takes longer  to 'get going'. Pulse rate is down and the blood circulation in the leg  muscles is still in 'watching TV mode' and hasn't increased yet. The  first ten minutes or so can give the impression one is totally incapable  of managing a longer walk or a bike-ride. Take it really easy to start with. Give yourself time to enjoy the wonderful countryside.

			What kind of trip do you want to do, and what do you expect form the travel agency? Individual circuit? Group circuit? In what language? Only a package with plane tickets, hotels, transportation in the country (train ir rental car) and possibly a few excursion? Once you know what you want, it will be easier to find it.   
We just came back from 3 weeks in Japan with the Troll. We booked everything ourselves except the Japan Rail passes which we got from a travel agency at Bellevue (the one over Mobile Zone). Found everything on the Internet. Plane tickets were booked directly on the airline's website.   
Cannot help you with a travel agency, but can highly recommend the destination. We had a great time! Feel free to pm me if you have any queries.

Also some outside activities, lake tour is good, or maybe an e-bike tour somewhere? you cover quite a distance barely breaking a sweat. alpamare, go karts.. etc.

			If they wanted to buy a tent I think Aldi and even interdiscount sell them for like 50 CHF or less.   
There is a nice campsite which couldnt be any closer to the water without it floating, by Montruex.  Its cheap as chips and lovely spot.       
Others I know of, one by the oympic museum in Lasuanne.  Balmers in Interlaken has already been mentioned.  Hermance on the French Swiss Border.     
Maybe its better to plan activites and sights and google campsites near by based on that?

Inter Soccer have morning football camps in Etoy:    
Bricks for kids lego centre in St Sulpice might work (can't see ages marked):     
Poppins in central Lausanne:    
As you've already spotted, most places don't run full day sessions for kids of that age, only from age 4-5 upwards.    
Otherwise, your best bet would be to get talking to other parents at the crèche and see if you can work out some swops (if they're around), or find a babysitter who can watch your daughter (see Croix Rouge for a list of babysitters in your area:  )

			Yes, it can be purchased from the French ticket machine at the SBB, as Adrian said, and I have used a credit card there successfully as well.   
Its a great deal on the weekend when an entire family can travel for little more than price of one.   
On weekdays, its worth it more when doing multiple-leg trips, such as Basel-Colmar-Route du Vin by bus 106. A direct day trip to Colmar you wont benefit much over single ticket.   
You can also economize by buying only for the zone you need, Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin, which are cheaper than the entire Alsace ticket.

			Hi, Obvious answer but we have been going to Portugal for the past 20 years, second week of January and you can't go wrong. We stay at the Marina Hotel in Vilamoura and it's perfect. Our main reason for returning is we can count on one hand the amount of days lost to weather.   
Vilamoura has 5 courses, then on your doorstep you've got Vila Sol, 3 courses at Quinta do logo, 2 at Vale do Lobo and San Lorenzo which has just been redeveloped, but to play usually means staying at the Dona Filipa Hotel. This is just the best local ones, there are many more!   
The Algarve although great can be expensive, so a lot of golfers are now heading to the Antalya/Belek region of Turkey. Courses and hotels are normally All inclusive and really good quality and value. Main problem we found was we like to get out and about a little in the evenings, and the Turkey option was not great on this front. But hotels and courses could not be faulted.

			It shouldn't be too hard to find a place which rents gear. For example, Bächli has a shop in Zurich and rents out  , but there may be better deals out in the small mountain towns.   
Also, don't underestimate the dam. I know people who were quite active climbers leading up to their trip and turned back after a few pitches. It is long, and overhanging, and there really isn't a place to rest. One planned to bring some sort of hanging seat next time, to be able to recover better while belaying.   
And finally, WTF is a ""certified lead climber""? The Swiss gyms that I know will let anybody sign a form saying that they know how to lead, and you don't normally get to practice actually installing quick draws in the gym. Personally, I'd only go out with somebody who I trust both technically and attitude wise, and excepting IFMGA level credentials (which of course, are a whole nother level), I don't think any certification would be part of that judgement.

			Unless you will be travelling a lot, there isn't really a cheap option, but these Travel Cards below offer good value.                
Your village probably sell cheap day tickets, ""Gemeinde Tageskarte"" costing around Fr 45,-- per person per day for unlimited travel on that one day, but you need to reserve them early as they sell out quickly. Look on the website for the Gemeinde where you live.

Viz, for post-thermalbad frolics we chose baden and for pre thermalbad plant-nursery visiting we chose the plant-nursery. Saying that we never made it to the plant nursery because we smoked some plants (out of respect, obviously) of our own and forgot to get off the train at the right place. Whoops! thus we spent ages in next-stop Frick waiting for a train back to the start and wasted a whole lot of time. But we got to see Frick! it turns out that in 2007 a huge dinosaur graveyard was uncovered at Frick: my guess is mass suicide. boom boom. Baden was great. we stayed at the hotel du parc and hired their bikes and rode down river: it was all very picturesque. then it started pissing it down and that was that.

			Don't forget to get the hotel to give you the free public travel passes, which you can even use to take the yellow ferry boats across the lake.    
Then when you are bored of the Jet D'eau you can go to the baby beach with tyre park.    
Jardin Botanique is nearby with birds and animal enclosures and is just a nice place to chill out.

			Hi, good choice for your long week end!     
Food: it depends on what you're looking for... a nice restaurant? Grotto? Pizza?     
Sightseeing: the castels of Bellinzona & the local market (on saturday till 1pm) , Valle Verzasca (such a beautiful place!) and Cardada (above Locarno, for a nice walk and a stunning view).     
Relaxing:   for the kids.  
Just next to it:        
Hope it helps :-)

			was at Holiday Inn Express Arena towers 2 weeks ago, close to the Biljmer Arena which is a main train station with 15 min direct line to the airport and to the main city. Rates are at par with the smaller ones near the city center. The neighborhood is a quiet business district.  Kids will appreciate the cleaner air at night  . My problem was there was none of those coffeshops close by.

			I'd skip the Glacier Express. It takes too much time, plus I prefer being outside, on the mountains, and have the time to enjoy the view.   
1 day: Instead of Jungfrau I'd do Schilthorn. Way cheaper, less people, and in some sense better view because you see the Jungfrau as well.   
2 day: Then the glacier you can check by visiting the Aletsch as suggested below plus Zermatt area   
1 day: You could combine Titlis and Luzern. On Titlis try the scooter and devil bikes.   
1 day Ticino: Bellinzona, Locarno, up to Cardada   
1 day: You could combine Zürich with a great hike to the Grosser Mythen. Or, I you'd prefer a lazy day, then Zürich, Rhine Falls, Schaffhausen, Rapperswil, then take the ship all the way back to Zürich, and finally up to Uetliberg.    
and/or:   
1 day Klettersteing in Braunwald, there are routes with different difficulties, and you can rent everything in the hut up there.   
1 day: Lausanne, Montreux, Les Diablerets, Glacier 3000

I'm very relaxed about German trains. Even when things go wrong they tend to not to go catastrophically wrong.   
I don't know if its a cool design in the software or that I've just been lucky, but I've often noticed that when changing trains to another train on the same platform or across the platform that the car with my reserved seat stops in exactly or close to the place where I got off. So I hardly ever need to drag bags the full length of the platform.

			Contrary to what was posted earlier, the GA card does NOT cover the transportation by funicular from Locarno to Orselina (Madonna del Sasso), at least that is what the attendant on duty explained to me today. Nor is there a disocunt with the Swiss Demi-Tarif Card. One-way fare: CHF 4.80, roundtrip: CHF 7.20. However, one can walk up for free in less than 20 minutes using a beautifully prepared trail.

			Hi there Baltser   
Have you looked at the Swiss Alpine huts ?? 
These vary from quite comfortable houses, to very small basic shelters. Most are on the top of the mountains here, and all are in the middle of walking paths of mountain trails.   
You need to bring your own sleeping bags of covers, as just duvets or blankets are supplied. There might be showers ( if you're lucky ) or just washing facilities.   
They are relativly cheap, and can serve evening meal and breakfast.   
It's possible to plan multi day walks, walking from hut to hut.   
Hope the weather is good for you ...

			hello ef! i'm going away for a couple of days at the weekend, centred around a trip to an animal park i bought on groupon a year ago and has to be used up very soon. it'sStricklers Raubtierpark btw. So I'm thinking of staying in Bern itself a few nights and go from there, or something, not entirely sure tbh.    
which is kinda why i'd like to know 'what to do in canton bern?' . are there must see things? for eg, it says on google maps there is the 'ENtlebuch Biosphere' which sounds a bit lovely (although the weather looks a bit crappy this w/e).   
also what's bern city like for a night out?

			Hi all, thanks for the recommendations. We went to Bourgogne in the fall, so we'd like to try somewhere different. One factor is the weather: the forecast is MUCH nicer south of the Alps, so Ticino has the advantage of nicer weather and less travel time. On the other hand, we've been to Locarno before, but never seen Austria or Bavaria. One option we considered was traveling from Zurich to Salzburg on Friday, then overnighting somewhere on the last night (Sunday) on the way back to Neuchatel, so we're not traveling 8 hours on Monday.     
So I think the question is: south or north of the Alps? We'd be happy to stay in lesser-known places or explore some hidden gems, given our parameters.   Thanks again.

			Thanks for the recommendations. We ended up stopping at:   
-> Austria 
Zimbapark in Bürs 
Huge Interspar in a kid friendly mall including a decent Italian restaurant     
-> Zurich  
Rosenberger Restaurant in Hohenems 
Really good food and super kid friendly, definitely recommend this chain.    "	become a little unpopular	Join Date: May 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Recommendation for supermarket along drive to Serfaus, Austria	fochtnj	Posts: 11

Yes, I saw the yurt package on the GP website and it did sound fun. This time round, because we are combining with the Morges Tulip show, we are a little pushed for time...oh, and with a 14 year-old daughter in tow, we opted for the easy option of staying where the nightlife is! But next time will be what you suggested. Thank you!

			Glad to find this post...   
We've been in ZH since Jan and have tried to start as we mean to go on; and have managed the following so far: 
- St Moritz for White Turf (train - 3hrs) 
- Bern for YB vs Everton game (train - 1hr) 
- Milan for sightseeing, shopping and risotto alla milanese (train - 4hrs) 
- Konstanz for sightseeing and shopping (train - 1.5hrs)   
We've also the following booked: 
- Graz to visit frends (flight - 1hr) 
- Istanbul + Dubai for sightseeing and to visit family (flights - 2.5hrs, 4hrs)   
..and these are on our agenda: 
- Geneva as a comparable to ZH in CH (train - 3hrs) 
- Monaco via Nice to see how the other half live! (flight - 1hr) 
- Vienna + Budapest for sightseeing (overnight train - 9hrs + 1hr) 
- Berlin to see what's left of the wall (flight - 1.5hrs)   
The kicker here is that weekend tickets to all of these destinations are available at under CHF 200 return, if you're a little flexible with times.   
If anyone has tips for getting tickets under CHF 100 return to other ""must see"" destinations, I'd love to hear them!

			For anyone wanting a fun day tomorrow make your way up to Les Rasses for Operation Waterslide to end the ski season. 
Entry is 15CHF and there should be lots of fun/food/music

Is there anyone travelling to Geneva from Zurich by car coming Thursday-March 12 /friday / Saturday?

			Why don't you fly with easyjet from Basel (return Ticket will be around 120 sfr), Hotel probably in Nice will be cheaper then Monaco 
The Return Ticket from Geneva will be half the price, so you have to pay around 65 sfr.

			Hi everybody,   
Not sure if this really belongs in this section, but I couldn't find any better one, so here goes:   
Does any of you have any recommendations about medium (well, not long, just for 1-2 weeks) distance hiking in Europe, in April?   
Criteria are 
- not too many cities 
- not too many people in general 
- no vertigo triggers    
What I've seen so far are trails in Hungary, Romania, Georgia... While locals keep telling me that it isn't safe to walk around there.   
Cheers,   
Thierry

			A bit late now as we are getting towards the end of the season. I took a couple of Neuch expats to try their ski legs a couple ot times at the very small resort of Les Fourgs, on the other side of the border- perfect for learning and very cheap ski hire and lifts. Snow is disappearing fast- but if we go again, I'll tell you about it. Best would be to have a few private lessons, with a few friends (they might be interested)- your best bet is to go to Les Fourgs or Métabiefs (both on French side, near St Croix and above Vallorbe)- Swiss ski school in the Jura tend to do group lessons on a weekly basis - rather than odd hour here and there.

			If you like some celtic/french atmosphere you could rent a house à la mer in bretagne, the cornouaille is very nice (better climate than the northern coast), lots of things to see, beautiful villages, very good plâteaus de fruits de mer, sidre, regional beer, ideal for biking and BBQ. 
The negatives are: the bathrooms may smell of piss, the climate is very variable and water temperature is prohibitive. further south in the atlantic coast is more expensive i think.

			Odile, I don't know how much you want to spend but we stay at chslet abode with the alpine club in St martin de Belleville in the 3 valleys france. You can google alpine club and they come up. Their website is their name with co.uk. It is in the luxury bracket and owned and managed by a british couple that live there. There is great attention to detail, facilities, services etc all for such a reasonable price in the luxury sector. I sold luxury ski holidays for a long time and they are by far the best value properties in that bracket. They have parking, a chauffeur service, great personalised food etc etc. have a look at their website and contact Helen the owner if you have any questions. If she asks how you heard about them tell her sophie from switzerland did and says hi. She should know who I am.

Any advice from someone who has been in the past or lives in this area would be great.   
Or...is there something else really cool somewhere else that we should be doing?

			Hi Peter   
Have a look at   its a mix of old with a beautiful new extension. Rooms are good, and the food is very good. They used to do 'specials' with even better food and a hot tub, for birthdays, aniversaries and so on.   
Plenty of mountain wanderwegs of different durations, and you can take the cable car up from Kies - Mettmen which is a good start for your trip.   
Enjoy the mountains.

			Heading to this area on the weekend and had assumed we'd put the kids on creche / ski school etc.. However we failed realise that all of that stuff is closed on Saturdays - because it's 'change over day' for the holiday people.   
Anybody got any tips or secret clubs or something?  We'll be 6 adults and 6 kids ranging from 2 - 9 and we'd like to have the kids sorted out on Saturday and give us a bit of ski time. We've tried a couple of baby sitters and maman de jours but silly expensive. Even finding a private teacher for the kids is hard and not really suitable, in ski school they'd get lunch etc.   
Are we destined to just take turns each at child care?

			The Greenwich based Ski Company often has 'filler' places at very low prices- just check with them if you, a couple, a small group or family fancy some last minute deals. They do have groups coming over from UK that do not actually fill their accom to full capacity- and will sell the last few places at really low rates. Just check with them:      or call 020 8858 9535.   
They are based in Torgon, Portes du Soleil, but also do weeks in Crans, Les Crozets, Arosa, and more.   
This is NOT an advert- I've been a very happy customer for about 20 years- bringing so many school, family and friends groups with the Ski Co. Just tell them (Gerry the boss, Ollie or Becky his right hands) that you are in CH and do not need transport. They do their own excellent in house ski and snowboard rental, are right next to the slopes linking to the whole to the Portes du Soleil- work very closely with the Ski/snowboard school that is in the same building, and the Gold Test ski shop, in the same building too- their own brand. Tell them (or not- I get nothing from recommendations- that Odile sent you). Look the up on FB too. Staff are all Brits, Kiwis and Ossies.

			I'll have to dig up my old notes on where we went. For sure, get off the touristy squares and into the back streets. There are some real gems.   We did have a hot chocolate (ciocolotto?) on St. Mark's Square - could have been at the Café Florian - 12 Euros but worth every drop. It was a pot of melted chocolate and a pot of foamed milk, and you mixed as you wished. It easily serves two.

			I figure one hour/pass on average on a bike, more in a car as you can't pass tour buses and campers.   
My wife's father was from Stavanger, and until a couple years ago I spent an average of two weeks a year in Norway (mainly Oslo) for work (NRK).

			Well, snow cover has been poor in the Jura, otherwise there are many easy accessible resorts not far from Neuchâtel for the future, with special train tickets combined with lift pass and even lunch. La Robella is 2 mins walk from the train station in Buttes, and perhaps you could try Les Bugnenets too- but check snow first.   
Champery-Les Crozets is really nice- cable-car up to the restaurant and shops- then a huge bowl with slopes for every level of skier- difficult to advise more than that. Lots of beginner slopes as well as reds and blacks of every shade. Restaurants dotted around the mountain are nicer than the one at top. Young guys I know there are all crazy snowboarders  though    
I like Champéry because it is a small town before it is a resort- but you won't have time to visit this time. The best if the view of my favourite mountains, les Dents du Midi. Another time, why not go to Verbier- train to Martigny, change for Le Châble, and then bubble up to Verbier and on to slopes (without changing bubble = avoiding Verbier queues).

			In December we stayed in a cabin in Schwyz. We booked it through airbnb and it was titled Kleinod - little gem in Rickenbach. If you Google that you should find it. It was well priced and clean, spacious with views to die for. It's a mountain cabin though so not much help for visiting Lucern since you'll have to pay for the cable car each time. Very nice for a few days to get the Swiss mountain experience. Highly recommended.

			Well, some offers can be purchased online (like cheap tickets to milan from zurich) and other offers (like Interrail global or Interrail one country Pass) can be purchased online (interrail.eu) or at the ticket office (zurich HB for example).   
1.Make plans well ahead, where to go.   
2.Buy tickets well ahead( it is possible to purchase rail tickets 3 months in advance, so be ready at midnight in europe to buy your ticket online to save a lot of money). Reservations should be made with the ticket purchasing. 
3. Compare prices in the internet  of every country where you want to go, for example when you want to visit a city in germany , it could be cheaper to buy a ticket in germany (from the border station to your destination) and a ticket in switzerland(with a half tax card)

			I have travelled on the Golden Pass train.  Twice I made reservations for the Panorama seats, but on other occasions just used my Swiss Pass.   
I have been able to occupy Panorama seats more often than not.  One time it was only the coach at the rear.     
If you are travelling the route as a one-off trip I would definitely recommend booking a seat in advance rather than gamble on being able to get one of the seats

			What a gorgeous GSP! 
They do husky rides in Flumserberg (go to    i think).  I didn't get chance to take my neice because they book up quickly and don't cram too many rides into one day but it sounded really good.  You can do a short ride or a husky experience.  Flumserberg is about an hour on the train from Zurich

Last time we flew my mom over for a visit, she used her miles plus about $40 in fees to get here. We used my miles and I think $95 in fees to get her home. However - most programs are changing the rules on 01 January so all bets are off.   
OP, sign up for fare alerts and keep your eyes open. My last trip home to the States the airfare was only 668 Francs. At that price you could buy the round-trip and just skip the return leg.

			So I ended up finishing my time at   in Mollis as it worked out easier for me than the mob in the Ost Schwiiz.   
The team have a great number of staff that speak English if German is a problem for you. You also have the option to do a 2 day test course which is finished off with a flight of about 7mins from a height of 600+m. They have a about the friendliest pricing I could find in CH. Plenty of secondhand gear available to help it be more affordable.   
Other languages: Hungarian, Italian, German, French...... of course English   
Thomas Kuene is a great guy and happy to help you into the sport.

I just did a day trip with a guest that worked quite well: train to Chur, and then the scenic train to Arosa. We had about an hour in Arosa, though everything is still closed at the moment, and then a couple of hours in Chur. It's a decent bit of train time but it's all scenic and it turned out to be a good day trip.

522	19.11.2014, 23:09	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 13 Times in 4 Posts	Location: Winterthur	"    Honestly, I can't follow your rant, neither.   
Well, if you use a tool the wrong way, no surprise it seems to be highly unruly. But thats not the tools (websites) problem, but the users one, of course. If you try to use a potato peeler to open a coconut, you will eventually fail.    
SBBs site sells tickets,  (you say: domestic)   (trains/buses/trams etc.), and   (or terminate here).     you   purchase train tickets on SBB's site for Italian national (domestic)  trains, or lets say French, or German, or . whatever foreign domestic connections, which are not under SBBs fare control/sovereignty.     I know of, though you   (almost)   on both, on  , as well as on   for example. But you   compare or even purchase foreign domestic train tickets on bahn.de, nor on trenitalia.it,  !  I think you got this first part of the message, dont you?!?    
Let's say, if you want to buy a flight from Zurich to New York with Swiss, and then from NYC to Boston by a US-american airway which provide this connection (but not by Swiss) thats exactly the same and you have to purchase two tickets on two different sites, why then should it be different for railways, though  I totally agree  it would be extremely convenient for the traveler, but it just simply contradicts the free market idiology! (except that Swiss probably fly to Boston from NYC as well!?)  However, your compatriots would probably call it a socialistic approach then, I suppose?    
Second thought you have to know: You will have to change the train in Milano. From there you can take the high speed train from Milano to Rome, which takes only 3 hours for about 600km, because its max speed is over 320km/h (an experience for itself)! But this is a national (oh pardon-me: domestic) connection!!!   
Third thought:  . Thats the simple reason   (like TGVs, trenitalias, or DBs do), since the fares are anyhow the same for whatever connection you are interested in. Well, except for some international trains, which, however, are not Swiss railways cash cow!   
I hope this clears your initial novice confusion.      It was neither a question of time, nor of inability to track back, but of not being available at all. SBBs site   suppresses any information as soon as they are available (quite contrary to other sellers).       As it says, ZVV is thought for ZVVs fare network (canton of Zurich plus some adjoining ones), though you find the same (schedule) information as on SBBs site, just differently presented (since it accesses the same data base), and cannot sell Switzerland-wide tickets!      ,  !       OP, if you do not really have  to take care about 100 bucks, or even less (see below), I thoroughly would not advice you to travel by bus; it is just a horrible experience I would not even wish for my enemies, especially not for 12+ hours duration.    
And finally: A one way ticket Zurich-Milano can be as cheap as CHF 28. A one-way ticket Milano-Rome can be as cheap as  29.  
That means you can comfortably travel for only about   both ways, if you are smart enough. Hardly beatable, I think.

			Shops will be closed, only  shops direct in the station will be open. 
The area around the station is the drug and redlight district of frankfurt, the area is not very wellcoming , especially for women. 
The only hotels i would recommend are the intercity hotel(direct in the station rates from 79 Euros or the Le meridien rates start from 139 euros). 
Better stay outside that area and try motel one the the messe  station (rates start from 69 Euros) or at the eastend (69 Euros as well)   
Kaiserstrasse is one of  the worst places, frankfurt has to offer

			Hello... and a nice day ahead tomorrow as my neighbour is taking me to Lavaux to explore the vineyards and do some wine tasting. I've been looking on the forum and Lavaux official website, but it really is not obvious where you can go without booking. 
I assumed you could just turn up but I am now concerned that this may not be the case. My neighbour is a wine maker and you certainly can turn up anytime at his place! 
Has anyone got any name, place, where you can indeed just turn up with the view of buying a few bottles, of course?

			Thank y'all, again, for taking the time to respond.   
I thought I should let you know what we ended up doing.   
One day, we just took a tram ride through Zurich and then a boat ride on Lake Zurich - the four hour tour. Very convenient, of course, as it did not entail any walking whatsoever.   
The second day, we took the train to Lucerne - walk 100m to the boat to Vitznau - walk 50m to the train up the Rigi, take in the view over the mountains (no walking) and the same way back. We were so lucky, because it was all foggy on the way there, until we made our way through the clouds on the way up to the Rigi, right into the sunshine. And on the way back, it was all sunny.   
My dad was happy, could take little naps here and there - and with a boat, it seems you cannot go wrong for a man.

			7 to 8 years old is difficult, maybe the Zoo (  Tierpark)  
there are two parts, top and bottom. Top is conventional, bottom is children's zoo (Free).   
Outside the Gotthard cinema, take the Bus nr. 19 towards  , & get off at   stop.  
Walk eastwards, & then walk through the woods & down the hill.  
Halfway down is the zoo entrance, at the bottom is the restaurant, kid's park, & river.                    
School holidays in Bern too, so there might be pony rides (about Fr 5 extra) 
Feeding times,   10.30 Uhr: Seals,       14.30 Uhr: Puffins,         15.30 Uhr: Seals     (again)   
Small animal zoo, & Restaurant and playground are down by the river.

 -The Iron and railroad museum 
 -The 2nd WW fort (Pré-Giroud Fort 1939-1945)   
You can also fish some trout nearby the cave parking lot (for a fee of course).

			Take the train to Gruyere and back.  It is essential that you become familiar with Gruyere and the cheese factory tour and the Cailler chocolate factory tour in nearby Broc because when you start having visitors, this will be the number one thing on your itinerary.     
Trust me, I have been there now about 12 times.  Ditto for the day trip to Montreux and Chateau de Chillon.  Take the train to Montreux.  Walk along the waterfront.  Hop on the bus that runs along the lake and stops at the chateau.  Tour the chateau.  Take the bus back to the Montreux waterfront.  TAKE THE ESCALATOR right next to the lighting shop up to the gare, (unless you want to carry a stroller up 5 flights of stairs).   
On a clear day, take the car to Leysin.  Park at the gondola.  Take the gondola up to the restaurant Kuklos.  Eat fondue in the revolving restaurant, (not the self-serve cafeteria on the lower level) and watch the crazy parapenters jump off the mountain.  (You need to check the dates on this--the gondola might be closed for the season.)

			So I am trying to plan a day-trip for the hubby and I this weekend. I was thinking hiking up Uetliberg with a picnic and then back down by way of the Planetary Trail and wrapping up the day by relaxing for a few hours at a spa or sauna.   
 I've been looking at reviews here and elsewhere online for the Thermalbad Zurich, and am also interested in the Hamam part of Migros Fitnesspark. There are a few other options but looking for advice... I'm in charge of planning the entire day and have a budget. So I was thinking just the minimum general admission for the Thermalbad for us both... or the minimum at the Hamam, but is there anything better I should consider for a bit more? It seems like you do not get a towel or robe at Thermalbad but at the Hamam towels are included in the admission price. Can't tell from the website, even when translated..what is all actually there at the Migros one. I understand that at the Thermalbad there's the rooftop pool, three different baths and a steamroom all included in general admission. Has anyone ever tried the Hamam?   
Any info appreciated, thanks!

			If you are still looking for a beautiful but relatively close scenic spot, try Thun. It's around an hour away and easily accessible by train. I went with my partner a few months ago and it was wonderful. Very traditional and Swiss, especially if you stay near the old castle at the top of the hill.   
Also try to make it to the lakeside, as the view towards the Eiger and Jungfrau is simply breathtaking! You can stop there in Schloss Schadau, a large (surprisingly pink) castle-turned-hotel for a great brunch.

			Thanks very much for the advice, Dragon5. 
We have skied many of the Swiss places and are all (except wife) confident skiers (and all now snowboarding also) , so I don't think we'd be overwhelmed by a large area: just would need to be careful about maintaining good communication. My wife would look at lessons on beginner slopes. This is sounding very positive: I will start looking at possible accommodations: ideally, it would be great to find somewhere with alternative ""activites"" (spa, pool,...?) for my wife as she may not want to spend all day every day on the slopes.....not sure about evening activities for my kids - they will probably be fine playing cards (as a family) along with a movie night or two..... 
Cheers,

I started early, a bit before the official start, when the roads were already closed for cars. Also, it rained a bit, maybe that reduced the crowds.

			Flims/Laax is very professionally run and perfect for your requirements. There are lots of walks you can do too. Thoroughly recommend doing some night sledding if you can and have dinner at Startgels, one of the restaurants on the Flims side. not cheap but worth every penny and the experience of night sledding is just magical.

			Firstly, its BASE, not base, jumping. Secondly its one of the extreme forms of skydiving. What you are suggesting, doing it straight off, would be equivalent to trying to fly a 747 when you have a private pilots license and can see your way around a Cessna on a good day.

			Hi EFrs,   
I have friends coming to visit me next two weeks. They consist of 4 families with children (about 15 persons including the kids). They will be staying only during the weekend (Friday-Sunday). I'm thinking to rent a vacation house (Ferienhaus) near Zürich. Any idea about where to look (e.g. websites)?  
I found some options near Walensee and Flumserberg from  . However, they only rent out for a whole week. I'm going to contact them whether it is possible to only take the weekend instead. But, is there any EFs who has experiences with them?

			Last bump.  
 driving to Munich from Luzern on Sat 20 Sept. I'm willing to carry a friendly fun passenger (or perhaps 2) up there for company on the trip.   
I intend to leave Luzern around 0900, I'll travel via Zug, Pfaffikon on up to Munich city centre.   
I return same route on Monday morning.   
If you're interested in a free ride PM me...

			Shloss Lauren will be a problem, from the train side you cannot access the lift without a token, which you get from the other side.   
It is better to arrive from the schaffhausen side, with the bus, and then walk from there across the bridge or down to the bottom. I am not sure about the boat, but you would need to fold the prams up to use the road train which will take you back up to the train station.

			Hi All,   
I recently went to this Outlet. I'll have to back up what someone posted earlier in these threads about the prices being very normal or even higher, with no real discounts to be found. For what would be considered a fair price in USD for the item, will be the price you will see in Euros. 30-40% higher than what I would consider a good price coming from Canada.   
If you are from the US or Canada, this place is definitely not cheap for an 'outlet'. Nike / Adidas running shoes are around 80-100 euros for the nicer models (the out of style clearance ones that aren't selling can be as low as 50 euros). I wouldn't say this is extremely expensive or anything, but for an outlet, and a place where you are normally looking for deals, it definitely is not cheap.     
I think if you are used to normal brand prices in Europe, you might be happy with these prices, a North American would definitely not be.    
Also, when I was there, the place was completely overrun, can barely walk through some of the stores without bumping shoulders.    
Pros: It is a very nice outlet by American standards, you can do all your shopping in one place, and you can make a trip to Swabian Alps / Black Forest out of it.

Take the train into Champery very early Friday morning and hike to auberge de salanfe. Saturday hike to Auberge de Chindonne, Sunday back to Champery.  Here's more info:  
Btw, there might be snow on the dents du midi but the trail goes at a lower altitude around it.   
What you can do will depend mostly on the weather. I'd prepare 1 good and 1 bad weather option and decide on Tuesday/Wednesday what to do.   
If the forecast looks iffy I would rather go to a ""popular"" mountain place (Chamonix, Zermatt, Riederalp, Grindelwald, Leukerbad). There are often many hiking trails in these areas, there are more bad weather options for when it rains and cable cars bring you quickly up to a nice altitude. 
Also, even the popular places aren't very busy in-between the summer and the winter season (minus perhaps Jungfraujoch).

			Yesterday, myself and the trouble-and-strife went on a beautiful hike in the Fribourg pre-Alps. We drove up to Crau Rappo from Le Mouret, on the road from Marly to Bulle/Broc. From there we walked to La Berra, passing just below the peak of Le Cousimbert and back again. It took us 4 hrs all in, including a couple of refreshments breaks. The reason I mention it is not just the fantastic vistas; the Alps to one side, the plains down to Lac Neuchâtel in the other, but it is not too taxing and we saw many familes with prams and the elderly along the route (as well as a handful of MTBers). Was a perfect day for it too  . 
Next I plan to bike it.

			On my way back from a work trip to Geneva we decided to stop over in Ivrea, which is on the way down from the Mt. Blanc tunnel in direction of Torino.   
We slept in a modern / cool B&B called Spazio Bianco, which is located in the old town (Eur 95/night, incl. very nice breakfast).   
Apéro right below the B&B at a bar called MoMa - I can't remember just how many different permutations of the classic cocktails were on the list...! (heh was nicely buzzed by the time we went to dinner)   
Had dinner at a restaurant called La Mugnaia, in the old town. De-li-cious 4 course menu for 42 euros p.p. (wine not included).   
At a short walking distance from the B&B you will also find a very nice patisserie called Balla and right besides a trattoria, ""Blupum"", run by one of Italy's most talented chefs, Davide Scabin... Would have been our first choice, but unfortunately was closed (warning - need to book ""well in advance"" we were told). I'm looking forward to a foodie safari in the coming weeks, so hopefully I'll be back with some more foodie reporting...     
Bon voyage!

			Hi all,  
We are looking for a holiday house/apartment for rent within 3-5hours drive from Zurich. Country side or mountains? Any one stayed somewhere where they can recommend?  
It should have 2bedrooms at least. If in Austria , France or Germany bordering CH is no problem too. We need the place from Oct13th for a week! The idea is we're a small family and did some intensive summer travels and this October holiday we just want to stay near by in a child friendly area in a fresh air nice little town village with some short easy hikes with the kids.    
Any suggestion?!

			Thanks for this, I just bought 6 ducks  .  
The procedure can be found here  
You will have to bring them to the start between 12.30 and 14.00 at Rathausbrücke. They will collect them and drop them all together into the water. It will take roughly 30 minutes for them to arrive at the finish. You can collect them at 5.30.

			Hi Nev, 
Thanks so much for your suggestions.  I made it to Chateau Torbillon.  The view and the light were absolutely stunning.  I got up there sometime after 3 p.m. and the sun was just starting to go down.   
I obviously got a late start.  I had hard time finding the courage to face the cold.   
I did wander around the old town, very charming.  Great for taking pictures.  Most shops there were closed, but there was a cafe open.   
Afterwards, I headed to the concert in the Catherdral.  The singers were impressive.  And afterwards, I walked around and looked at the Christmas lights.     
I missed the cake and drinks after the show.  I didnt find out that was happening until I was back home

 If you go up Sunnegga is another place for having a good meal on the terrace - you have that buffet with salads, soups (an Austrian style goulash yam), rösti, etc. and the prices are also very good.

			Hi All,   
Need your help in finding a restaurant near Baden. I have been there on a biking trail a couple of year ago..I have been trying to find the address of the restaurant for a long time now and finally decided to ask all of you.   
The restaurant is located in a village. I remember seeing a log factory beside it. The restaurant has its own Fish Pond and you can do your own fishing. Most of the fishes are starving and you dont spend more than 5 minutes to catch a fish. They prepare the fish caught by you and its absolutely delicious. Planning to go there again. In case someone else is interested, we can go together too.

			We live in Hergiswil and can see Rigi from our balcony. Really, the view from up there can be very unpredictable, particularly on a partly-cloudy day. This summer is especially wacky. According to the current official weather forecast, as early as possible Friday before noon would be the best time to go up, but lately the daily forecasts have also been subject to sometimes radical day-to-day changes.   
Alternatives that come to mind (weather permitting, of course) are the Berner Oberland, Zermatt or Appenzell (e.g., Säntis).

			I too am biased in favour of this area; here is Lauterbrunnen, described in an article I read recently as ""one of the most beautiful places on God's green earth""       
The Jungfrau region is very popular with tourists from all over the world, but don't let that put you off; there are hiking paths to suit all abilities, through shady woods, across open moors, amongst rolling green turf, and by tinkling mountain streams, all with amazing views and often chiming cow bells.  Lauterbrunnen has the 2 sites, Camping Jungfrau and Camping Schützenbach, both within easy walking distance of the little town itself and the train station.  Actually both campsites are just tucked out of sight on either side of the valley in this photo.   
Welcome, and I hope you enjoy your time in Switzerland and become as fond of Bern and its Oberland as we are.

			Hi we recently arrived in Schaffhausen from UK and my teenage son is looking for any existing groups/individuals who play war of the Ring that he can join to play with. Is there any out there, or anyone interested in playing?

			One ore park that I forgot to mention: 
- Rieterpark - it has a museum with Asian art located in a very interesting modern building  . 
In the park you can walk , there is a small playground, a viewpoint from which it is possible to see the lake of Zurich and the Alps when a day is clear. There is also a cafe with very decently priced salads, sandwiches and cakes       "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2014	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Places to visit in and around zone 110 ZH	Ovi23	Posts: 25

			Just to close the thread, thanks all for your inputs.   
This is what we finally managed to do during the long weekend:   
31st night - Drove to Rheinfelden to see the fireworks by the waterfall. The experience was good but it was too crowded. 
Drove back to Zurich after lurking around Rheinfalls for a while. Had dinner at Langstrasse (thai) and finally reached home around 3 in the morning. 
1st: Drove to Obersaxen, Rufalipark. The kids did enjoy the ride as well as the Badesee and the Speilplatz.  
In case you have kids, you can plan too.  Its worth a visit. 
2nd: Street Parade. Got wasted 
3rd: Recuperated   
Although not one of the best itenaries but was able to keep the temperature of the home down to a comfortable level.  "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: Mar 2014	Groaned at 3 Times in 1 Post	Need Ideas for Coming Long weekend	cupidinluv	Posts: 20

			We drove to Malcesine on Lake Garda 2 weeks ago (a Sunday).  It's a good location for water sports. We left Zurich at 12 noon stopped 1 hour for lunch along the way and went over the Gotthard Pass as it was our first time and we wanted to see it.  There are a lot of roadworks on the route and a lot of traffic jams.  Despite keeping to the 120/130 (IT/CH) Autobahn speed limits we were very surprised to arrive finally at 8pm.  If you drive up the East side of the lake it's one very busy (particularly Sat and Sun) single lane road with a 50km speed limit.  The return journey took 6 hours helped by a drive-thru McDonalds lunch!

Zermatt in winter, really the only thing to do is ski. The weather has a habit of being horrendous. At the top of Klein Matterhorn temperatures below -20 are a daily occurrence and often there are very high winds.   
Zermatt is summer, is warm, you can ski (although it is limited), hike, bike, walk around town without breaking your neck, it is quieter without being a ghost town.. it is generally much more chilled out and relaxed.   
Go and learn to ski somewhere else and have a nice summer weekend in Zermatt.

Lago Maggiore could be another option. Staying at Stresa perhaps and visiting the islands.   
Also one of the towns in Emilia (Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna) could make a nice stop.

			Visit the castle and amphitheatre on the hill. Beautiful vistas and an impressive place to visit. I think there is a museum as well right next to it. There is a cable car straight from the other side of the river.    
Make sure you have a meal there. Most restaurant serve amazing food (but avoid any chains or similar looking places etc like the plague). Along the river is mainly, and sadly, really ugly, so stick to the main parts of the old town and the hill, as described above.   
Enjoy!

			Never been there, but as a rule of thumb, always watch how strong/weak the currents are in a river. The same spot could be safe today, might not be as safe tomorrow.    
Remember, water is not our natural environment, we are very vulnerable in it so take it easy until you are comfortable with the current.

			I used to live in Burgau just down the road from Günzburg, little town on the Danube. 
There are two villages if you go direction of Krumbach for a few Clicks Kleinkötz and Grosskötz, with B&B and some hotels, busses run every hour.. 
Interesting little tit-bit of history (warning Godwins law may be invoked) 
From the Kaiserreich onwards, during the 100.000 man army of the Weimarer Republic to our ""buddies"" '33 to '45 and after that up to the eighties under American control. The whole area was an ammunition storage and surplus dump. 
Lego got the area for very, very cheap but only if they cleaned the place up of all munitions, this was done with a fine tooth-comb over a long period of time, longer then the actual building of Lego land. 
Sadly three people were killed by exploding ammunitions during the clean-up. 
If I recall there is a plaque in the grounds somewhere.

			3 years ago we bought a voucher for a 'freedreams' Hôtel stay in CH, where you only have to pay for meals. Had a lovely week-end, not cheap as the 'compulsory' menu and wine was quite expensive, but we were very happy, and bought another one for the Grisons- same again.   
We were then contacted by Freedreams to ask if we wanted to buy a card valid for one year, rather than individual vouchers. We agreed, but due to health and family problems, were not able to use it even once (CHF199) and forgot about it. And yes, now got a bill for 189CHF special renewal price ! for this year. Phoned them to say we didn't want it, and that we had not been able to use last year's at all- but they said it was renewed automatically- so an annual card, not a card for 1 year- and we had to give 3 months notice to cancel. I e-mailed them to ask them to reconsider- but verdict arrived today- pay up or else. And yes, I've checked and it is somewhere hidden in the small print. So you've been warned  (and yes, it is me who has often said 'never sign a contract without making sure you understand the small print   ). I thought some of you would really enjoy knowing that even the Swiss get Switzerlanded...

			Thanks for all the suggestions. For some reason I didn't get to see the replies before coming back home again, but all's well as we decided to go to Mürren for a couple of days and had a fantastic time! Quiet (but not too quiet) and relaxing small village with a good choice of restaurants, ATM machines, hotels, a small supermarket, post office and some souvenir shops mostly.   
Even getting there was quite an adventure, taking the gondola from Lauterbrunnen and small mountain train at the top to the village. Going back home we took the Schilthorn gondola down to Gimmelwald where we walked around and had a look, and stopped by at the cafe/guesthouse just by the gondola. Very nice village, but I agree that there doesn't seem to be much happening there although it's most definitely worth visiting for something different.    
While staying in Mürren we also took the fenicular up to Allmendhubel (a 4 minute ride up to Mürren's local mountain top) where there was a nice restaurant, a flower trail and children's trail/mountain playground. Unfortunately they were in the midst of building a new playground/trail while we were there there (which looks to become very nice at the end of this month). Instead of taking the fenicular down again we took a very nice mountain walk (easy, mostly quite flat strolling -also with a 4 year old) and stopped by a nice mountain hut where we had excellent home made food before we continued down to Mürren again.   
And I mustn't forget Schilthorn (the James Bond film location if someone is wondering). The gondola ride isn't long from Mürren: first around 6 minutes to Birg, then change over to another Gondola for another 4 or 5 minutes. The weather couldn't be better, and what a view at 2970m!   
An unforgettable adventure. Next time we'll see if we can visit Grindelwald on the other side of the valley.

			Do you know what I mean? They are flodable booklets with loads of discounts or even 2 for 1 offers, etc. Unfortunately, they never feature your local attractions, only those quite far away. I've got several here- but they are of little use as attractions are too far most of the time. I've got a visitor coming next week, and we will go to Chillon where I will be able to pick up one which will cover some of my area's attractions.   
A plea here, if ever you get some of those, and there is a voucher for Yverdon Bains (spa) - I'd love to hear from you and get as many as you can get me. Happy to look through mine for any special outings for your family too.

We're a group of 4 guys, wants to visit Ibiza, Mallorca and perhaps Barcelona as well, from Zurich in last week of July for 4 days.   
Any help, deals or ideas will be very helpful.

			Hi all, 
In Italy there is a website called ""viaggi avventure nel mondo"" where basically there are people organising travels around the world using local public transports, local apartment, etc...It is a way to travel alone with no extra-costs for the single room, and where you can meet many people... 
I was wondering if there is something also in Switzerland, so that I can leave from here (I live in Basel) without going back Milano to fly... 
any suggestions?   
Thanks 
Paola

			All those suggestions are excellent. Probably the best parks for your needs are Margarethenpark and Schützenmattpark. You and your daughter will meet plenty of other expats in both, but also hear lots of German. Both parks have paddling pools in summer.   
Kannenfeldpark, near the Novartis Campus, is also quite attractive.   
Bonus: all three of these parks have a café in or adjoining them (Schützenmatt's is the best, IMO).   
Okidoki can be something of a zoo (and a very noisy one at that), especially when it's raining.  I think you'll find  , a little further into Germany (you'll need a car) much more inviting and overall, more tolerable!   
And if you have a car and a full day to spare, I guarantee that your daughter and indeed your whole family will love  , rain, hail or shine. (Entry fees apply, of course -- also to Okidoki and Nepomuks.)

			Hi, 
I live in Czech Republic and me and my buddy run a website about cars where we review cars, make reports from events and just whatever media related to cars, all original production. 
I've been to Switzerland a week ago and it got me thinking about what the local car scene was like. I'd like to make a road trip/documentary about cars in Switzerland and the best thing would probably be to find some car clubs or attend some meeting events. 
Is there any place where I can find some info on the clubs/meet ups or contacts for someone who could help us get around when it comes to cars? 
Any help's appreciated.

			It the city centre!   
The bridge furthest away in the photo is Quaibrücke. Burkliplatz and Bellevue tram stops are on either end of the bridge, or you can walk there easily from HB - just turn left out of the main entrance of the station, cross the road at the pedestrian crossing in front of the large Coop supermarket, walk round the Coop to the river and there's a path that runs along the river edge all the way down to the lake - takes about ten minutes.   
The body of water beyond it is the lake, the large church on the left is the Grossmünster, and the church opposite is the Fraumünster.

			Depending on your fitness, you can do the very nice hike starting from ShyniggePlatte to Faulhorn to First and then take the cablecar down to Grindelwald. The path is not that bad and I have seen plenty of family with dogs doing this trail. However, it does take 6-7 hours of hiking albeit with some of the most amazing views all along the way.

			Some of the books by Michael Morporgo about animals could be interesting (The Butterfly Lion etc) for her. Look at the reviews on Amazon.   
In our family we have recently been enjoying some novels by  Louis Sacher who is a great American author for children this age. My son's just finished reading ""Holes"" and then watched the film of the same name - he was utterly blown away! There's a Boy in the Girl's Toilets by the same author was also a hit. They are easy to read but quite complex in their themes and movement sometimes through time.   
There's a lot out there. you are sure to find something she likes and the suggestions here seem pretty solid.

			That's what I think also but I'm hoping someone has maybe used the Swiss Pass to purchase tickets and can tell me for sure. We can order them online and there isn't an option for it so would I just choose GA for all of us?  The cost difference is significant as in if they don't get the discount we won't do the brunch.

			Also train to Alpnachstad, change to another train up Pilatus, admire the views and either come back the same way or descend with the cable car and make way back to Lucerne, finish up somewhere in Lucerne old town with nice meal or a drink before getting back to Zug.

In case anyone is reading this in the future, they had no difficulty getting there on their own.     
You purchase the Floomzer tickets at the Chrüz chairlift (unless you buy the SBB combo before hand).   
They did the Early Bird which allowed them unlimited rides between 10-12.  Because of the train schedules, gondola, etc. I'd guess they didn't start before 10:30, maybe a little later.  They still managed to go down 5 times so it was well worth the money.

			The train journey from Zürich to Milano with Cisalpino sucks. The Italian trains adjust to the tilt and cause a lot of people to suffer from nausea; they are also dirty and excruciatingly slow until you pass Chiasso, then they speed up to what I'd consider to be an express speed.   
Avoid. Take an airplane and keep your love life and romance alive.

We are heading there in a couple of weeks. Not sure if you are aware,  but the island  is renowned for its beaches.  You're staying Costa Calma in the south, great location and jandia beach is nearby. Huge beach fantastic for walks. Seeing you have the car, Correljo in the north has large sweeping sand dunes, if you like the Sahara feel. Also parque natural nearby.   
We go with family to Atlantis suites which is all inclusive, so tend to eat in than out.   
Have fun.

The ""excursion ideas"" link on the sbb page will also help.

			We go to Provence every July/August and try to avoid the Autoroute du Soleil & Lyon as much as possible. Going via Annecy, Grenoble and joining the Autoroute du Soleil at Valence works ok, but for you, I agree with the other poster who mentioned Sisteron. The E172 between Grenoble and Sisteron, over Col de la Croix Haute is a decent enough road and not too slow. Sisteron is well worth an overnight stop for sure and has a number of decent hotels in the centre of town, but I could not say whether they all take dogs or not.

Just go to the airlines' websites and price up your options.  If it is a real emergency then ask your (health/accident/3rd party/travel - whatever) insurance company.

			It's a great park, highly recommended...and I don't agree that the food standards are poor...Better & wider range of choices than any theme park food I've ever experienced, had some pretty decent Mexican food the last time I was there   
Like any theme park, you want to plan your day efficiently to get the most out of the visit which also includes avoiding the usual times for lunch...Especially for the expats here, I think it's a good idea to experience the restaurants, at least once, rather than brown bag it considering most have probably come some distance to get there in the first place

			Not sure about your question, but if that option doesn't work out, you might investigate parking at GVA in the P51 Long term parking lot and then starting your trip from there. Information about the daily rate is available through the GVA website. The only caveat is to watch out for holidays because that lot might be full, but it is possible to make a reservation. It's also much easier to get to the airport than Cornavin if you are coming from outside of GVA.

The bus is run by SBB and leaves just behind the mainstation in Zurich. It's a new service they now operate because so many people choose ""Fernbus"" insteas of train as it is a lot cheaper and does not take longer!

Our budget is not 600 CHF. After my initial searching it appeared that this is what we would have to spend to stay a long weekend in Lucerne, even for modest accomodations (hence my request for alternative suggestions).    
As for the groan: You took my question and made a very personal and unfair judgement out of it. I'm not looking for anyone to agree with me, I was just looking for an answer to my question, thanks.

			It almost, but not quite, makes me think about borrowing some under 16 year olds!   85 CHF for a day, 2 adults and up to 5 children, on boats and trains and buses all over the GA network.  . And no need to have a 1/2 fare card, though you do need to buy a separate ticket for the family dog.

			I spent a couple of hours today with a 60chf day pass bought for 45chf on ricardo. Am not from industry and do not wear either jewelry nor watches, but still thought it was worth the time and money.    
The design and craftsmanship of the jewelry was very good.  The big names - Rolex, Cartier, etc. were about as welcoming to the non-trade public as a Nato summit would be to Putin .. however, the lighting and architecture of their exhibits, even from the outside was quite interesting.   
The day card can be used for unlimited entries and exits, not personalized. So the wife went in after me on the same ticket. Hopefully she's not coming out with a 100,000chf watch, negating all savings.   
So if you and a few friends have an hour or two each,  worth sharing a day pass for a glimpse of fashion and design.

Could you give any more suggestions as to which part of it is more beautiful / desolated / difficult? I've been to Creux du Van and it is quite awesome, but I am afraid that area will be swamped with tourists, no?

			Hi All,   
Friends from Singapore are visiting & I wanna plan something fun for them.   
Thinking of doing night/afternoon sledding + BBQing on the mountains. Anyone knows where this can be done?   
PS: I have my own BBQ pit as well & we would have a car, can we just set up a pit in the mountains & start grilling? Would we get into trouble?   
Cheers, 
Moto

			Hi LearningAlways,   
Unfortunately I'm not able to see the timetable you mentioned. If you click on the link it brings up a menu of various kinds of tickets you can choose from.   
The cheapest I've seen was 39euro from the SCNF website; not sure if that would be available from SBB.   
Thanks for your help though,

			And so I went. 
I arrived at around 8:20 or so, parked in Laax.  
People were already starting to arrive, but it was still not crowded.  
The weather was cloudy at the bottom   
I was the last person to get on the gondola, so did not have to wait, which was nice (the feeling of being a canned sardine was not especially nice, though...but you get that everywhere).   
The weather at the top was foggy, but the fog was quite thin.  
I could actually (barely) make out the mountains in the distance...on a clear day it must be magnificent. 
I went up to Cram Masegn, where we were told that due to windy conditions you could not reach higher points (e.g., the glacier).    
The snow was very hard in the morning, my joints started complaining very quickly.  
As time went by, the lower parts of the pistes started becoming softer, and as more time went by they became full of slushy moguls.  
The wind also seemed to pick up at the higher points, later on.  
So you would start skiing very hard snow at the top, and finish up over slushy moguls. 
The snow conditions did not make it the the best fun for me   
Overall it was not too crowded, i'd say. i did not have to wait more than 3 minutes in any queue.  
The pistes  did feel crowded at times, but I think that was because skiers at my level were struggling with the moguls    
The resort itself is amazing, at points it feels like it's just one huge piste.  
Everything feels new. The 6-seater lifts are children-safe, fast and very comfortable.  
The piste selection is huge and the pistes themselves are wide and well-groomed.  
With so many many of them, though, you may make the wrong turn somewhere and end up somewhere you did not intended to be (as I did a couple of times  )   
I could not unfortunately make it to the other side (Fuorcla, LaSiala), because piste 43 was closed.   
I'm definitely going back sometime. 
However, it makes for quite an expensive outing: lift pass + parking + gas make it a well over 100chf day trip.  
For me, it's probably not best for single day trips. 
Next time I'll be staying for a little longer    
Also, the ticket guy said i could not get the 5chf card deposit back  
But he asked if I had any other resort's card with me (which I didn't), so I think that it may be a good idea to bring one with you the first time you visit the resort, it may save you 5chf.   
cheers

			Since weekend hikes seem to be today's topic, my husband & I walked from Feldmeilen to Zurich Rehalp this past Saturday.  While the mountains were hazy, it was still a beautiful walk as previously mentioned - through neighborhoods, pastures and woods.  We wandered off the Panorama trail onto other wanderwegs so it took about 4 hours.

			Perhaps since now is not really practical for you, and you plan to go anyway later this year, you can make a special point to see those folks then? Offer a sincere apology/condolences  to anyone that expects you to turn up now.    
It is tough and I've been there and felt like a ""bad"" friend. But sometimes it cannot be helped, and sometimes the friend/family appreciates your visit later, after the intial fuss and shock have passed, and they think everyone has forgotten. Does that kind of make sense?

			Another +1 for Chur-Arosa.   
The Jungfraujoch trip is even more amazing in the summer - stunning Lauterbrunnen basking in its green and summery valley, and snow and glacier right at the top.  Slightly more predictable weather, as well.  However, Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald and Wengen then become busy with people there for hiking, base jumping, paragliding, and the like.   
Have a great time discovering this beautiful land.   
Hobs

			It's a bit tricky for me, as although we've got similar aged children, skiing is a big part of what we do on ""snow"" holidays.   
For me, my initial reaction is Engelberg, heading over to Brunni rather than the main place (Titlis).   
Somewhere we go to quite a lot is Pilatus for day trips. The first stop has a play park with snow around it, but not accommodation.   
Otherwise resorts that I think would be of interest would be ones where you are near the snow at the start of the day (i.e. rather than having to treck up any mountain) e.g. Arosa, Laax, Flims, Crans-Montana (specifically Crans) and Gstaadt.   
Alternatively you could look for spa resort-type places in the mountains with no ski facilities. But I don't have any recommendations for these in mind.

			Great offers for Hotel accom,, many with children free or very cheap- 2 nights for 249CHF per person, with breakfast, some meals and spas, etc, included. But they seem to all be the other side of Switzerland (apart from Charmey, Villars and Les Diablerets). I suspect that perhaps the Swiss German Coop magazine may have similar offers but for Romandie- to encourage people to visit areas further away. I would be interesting to swap info. perhaps.

On the other hand, several hours train ride in one day depending on where one comes from are quite tiring. If your event could be done from e.g. 10 to 5 with a lunch break, that might be something though  .

In general I prefer skiing in Austria over Switzerland or anywhere else for that matter.  Reasons (general): 
- Better lifts / infrastructure. In my view the Austrian resorts have made much more investments into this in the last ten years than the Swiss.  You rarely see t-bars etc anymore. 
- Great snowmaking capabilities 
- Much better food / drink options, both on the slopes and in the resorts.  The Austrian know how to make a cosy mountain hut. 
- Cheaper

			For those newbies scarred off by high CH hotel prices, always make sure to check out the vacation rentals or ""ferienwohnungs"" in CH. The main swiss tourism website lists them all, and they are typically 120 CHF for a house/chalet.  We loved the Ferienwohnung Pensa in Silva Plana, Engadin.  Beautiful views of the lake.

He's had a lesson and some previous experience. He knows - and understands! - the basics of skiing. He just feels that he needs to practice and I agree. That's why we're looking for easy slopes, so that he can focus on the skiing and not flying off a cliff    But thanks for the suggestion! Like just about anything, learning from an instructor is infinitely better than learning from a friend. And nothing helps more than practice! practice! practice!

			West Yorkshire!   
I think that Andermatt is a nice village...and its accessible by car, train, bike, etc. But...there are other alpine villages that are indeed nicer, but some of those are harder to get to than others because they are rail only (Murren/Wengen).   
It all depends on what you fancy. I think places like Fusio and Zinal are much more satisfying to spend time in compared to other 'popular' places...but...its all in what you are after: eating, night life, ease of sport, price, etc.

			Lenzerheide definately has what your looking for. Unless you come here during the peak times, xmas and halfterm, Lenzerheide is nice a quite with a relaxed feeling. Theres plenty of options for all levels of skiers/boarders aswell. The beginner slope is actually free to use and some lifts you can buy a day pass just for that lift. if your a beginner its great as you wont waist your money on lifts that you dont need.  
Please feel free to pm me for more details regarding hotels etc.

			My favourite destination in the mountains is Mürren.   
I worked there one Winter season many years ago, have been back a couple of times over the past years in the Winter and also with the whole family for a few days in the Summer.    
Quiet and relaxing, cosy and small, beautiful views across the valley towards to the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. For an adult with a young child, you will find the Eiger Guest House, just opposite the station very good and friendly.

			Check covoiturage.fr. It's cheaper and faster than public transport. If you are lucky you will find someone who does the journey every day, perhaps from Annemasse or Saint Julien en Genevois.

840	28.04.2012, 22:02	Junior Member	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: aarau	"    Hi there, I know there is a lot in the forum about trips to Jungfrau and I've been reading for a couple of hours now and of course I'm still very unsure on what to do..    
my brother and his wife and 2 other adults are coming from Central America on April, they would love to see Jungfrau /Swiss Alps..  
we could do Friday to Sunday on this trip, but my husband prefers Saturday to Sunday (?) I could convince him..   
Sunday night we need to be back to pick up someone at Zurich airport at 18:00 
I was thinking going to Wengen (from Zurich) - on saturday, and from there take the train to Jungfrau maybe on the sunday morning? 
is Saturday to Sunday too short for this trip? 
the train trip from Zurich to Wengen seems very long... (a few changes )  
I've never done it ..  
all adults are very fit (they run marathons and hike a lot ) but I'm coming with my 2 children, ages 7 and 11, so the hikes shouldn't be too steep...    
Maybe staying in another little town would be a better idea if the train connections are better??  
also the price is a bit of an issue , if we are spending so much money for going to Wengen/Jungfrau, wouldn't it be better to stay an extra day??   
another thing, they have never been to Switzerland before, so going in a cable card is a must...  I suppose we'll find some at Jungfrau or Wengen (?)   
Thanks for any info you can give me..

			It's also possible to get tram passes from a hotel if people are going down the night before.  We went in October and stayed at a hotel that gave us a tram pass good for the entire time we were there.  We are staying at a different place this weekend and they also have an offer for it on the website if you look closely enough.  They typically don't give you one unless you ask, but if people are staying in hotels it might save you 20-40 CHF so I'd suggest asking.

			The 12.11 train is fine for lunch at 1- which is a good time as the restaus are quieter by then. From Fleurier there are buses to Pontarlier too, 2 mins after train arrival (bus waits for train).   
We love the train to UK- and it is only 1 stop tube in Paris- from Gare de Lyon- although if we have big cases we take a taxi, about 10 Euros, no prob. It helps too that our destination is just one hour by train from St Pancras, so no change required. A leisurely day reading, watching the world go by- much prefer it to plane.

And then saw a posting about it on this forum, but it was from back in 2009.     
Has anyone done it more recently?    
Some web research indicates that it is only for groups.   
Maybe I can scare up enough people....

I'm taking a mid-career break and spending the season in Vallorcine up the road from Chamonix. I'm keen to meet up with others who plan to spend time in Chamonix and are: keen ski-tourers and/or weak but enthusiastic ice and rock climbers. 
Thanks

I will recommend the Cliff Walk highly. My 3rd trip to Titlis but the cliff walk was clearly the highlight. Especially the Buddha Rock in the distance made it quite a special moment. 
Hope you were able to find company to get to Titlis.

			Just to complete the thread....   
Just been to Bern and picked up two tourist visas. All I needed to get the tourist visas was cash and the passports of everyone travelling (no photos, filled out forms or swiss visa required). We have UK passports - process may be different for others.   
Cost was 42chf per tourist visa and a 53chf charge because my wife wasn't there in person. A total of 137chf.   
I got there when it opened at 09:00 and was out just after 10:00. You hand in your passports, they get taken away and then returned a bit later along with the Visas and the bill (which has to be paid in cash I believe - didn't see a card machine). I had 3 people in front of me one of whom had something complex to do so your wait time may vary. The embassy is very close to Bern station, about a 5 minute walk.   
Guy behind the desk spoke Spanish, German & English whilst I was there.

			Visited our first market yesterday - in Innsbruck.  It was wonderful!     
We left around 8 am and arrived at noon. Headed straight for the market (taking photos along the way) and warmed up with some glühwein and bratwurst. Walked all around the stalls and shops in the area.  Found a vendor selling glühbier - it was quite tasty also!     
We also had time to visit the Tiroler Volkskunstmuseum and Hofkirche.  Beautiful stuff and the church is amazing.  Home by 10 pm.  It was a wonderful start to the Christmas season for me - I have about 14 more on my list!

			Hi Friends,   
I am planning a trip to Italy and found this link -     
I have used taketours many times while I was in US and they are reasonably fair priced and takes to all good places. The only challenge I feel is the amount of time they allocate for each sight is too small.   
But I have never taken their service in Europe and don't have an idea of how it is. Since they are US based, the service quality may be different here.    
Just like to know if anyone has experience of using taketours for Italy travel? Any suggestion will be helpful   
Thanks

			It's Sennenchilbi in Arth, SZ, on November 9 & 10.   
It's a two-day event celebrating the farming traditions of the area.     
The big day is on Sunday, Nov 10.     
At 9.00, there will be a traditional yodel mass at the Catholic church in Arth.   
At 10.30, there will be a concert from the local music club with a free apero.   
At 14.00, there will be a   featuring sheep herds, ringing of the cow bells, lots of folklore costumes, yodelling, goats, cracking the whip and many more highlights.  Right after the parade, at the Zwygarten, free coffee, Lebkuchen und Nidla (whipped cream) will be handed out.   
Following the parade, there will be folklore dancing and many other activities.   
So if you don't have any plans for next Sunday and live in the area, come on over to Arth to get a taste of Switzerland's proud farming traditions and culture.          "	null	null	null	Nov 10/Arth SZ: Free coffee and gingerbread cake  at the Sennenchilbi	guest	null

			Completely different suggestion, but have you considered jucker farm, or the dinosaur museum. The Dino museum in aathal has a rocks and minerals museum across the road, which might appeal to a young girl. The other suggestion would be the glacier museum at lucerne. There is a mirror maze and a big indoor museum which is really good. My kids are 12 boy and 14 girl and we had a great time there.

I attached a pop-up from the most famous website where to buy/sell second hand SNCF train tickets. This popup comes up when you try to submit a ticket where there is your name on it.   
Long story short, it says: 
1. this ticket has a name on it, hence we don't let you sell it coz the person using it may get a fine of 200 euros (but again, this never happened to me, & I did this at least 10 times) 
2. next time, we advise you to get the ticket sent by post, in a sncf office, in a travel agency, or in a sncf ticket machine. (these are probably created without a specific name) 
3. next time, if you buy a ""imprimé"" sncf ticket, we advise you to wait for the last minute to add the name of the passengers & to not be logged in when buying the tickets (it prob inserts your name automatically on the ticket if you're logged in)

			We just had a lovely short getaway in Munster Valley. We've done the Alsace wine route many times & attended concerts in Freibourg, but it was our first time to Munster Valley.   
Munster town is small enough so that traffic is light, parking is (mostly) free and you can actually get lots in the centre...yet an important enough town that the Tourist Info office is well-stocked with maps, offering good advice on accomodation etc.   
We timed it so we caught the weekly Saturday market. It cannot compare with Muhlouse but is worth shopping at. During this time there's also new wine (Sauser) lots of mushrooms, great selection of potatoes etc.    
Also pop across the road (other side from the carpark) to the Union of Textile Workers building. Great bargains in linens, bedspreads, towels, really cute tablecloths and gifts for Christmas.   
Best of all, right near the market is l'Agneau d'Or. A little gem of a restaurant we would go to Munster just for Martin Fache's cooking, and to be pampered by his wife who runs Front of House. His creative touches delight & surprise, but the ingredients take centrestage. Even a starter with traditional Choucroute (Alsacien sauerkraut) is wrapped in crispy bacon, and Munster cheese melts over it as its brought to you. Please order the duck confit nestled under potato mash, with braised porcini mushroom bathing everything. The menu prices are already good but his lunch specials are amazing value. Perhaps because the crowd is light during the day, specially in this low season? Then he slips in Amuse Bouche like seafood soup....extra granitas.... lunch has not been such a pleasure in a long time.   
We decided on a B&B in the mountains, Ferme Grand Hetre. Since we wished to do some walking it was perfect. 15-20 mins drive up from town, its very quiet except for the soft cowbells in the barn nearby. Massive rooms with comfy beds, super clean, and only 65 EUR for the 2 of us (90 for 3 people) That includes a hearty breakfast of juice, coffee/tea, bread, home made cheese. Unlike some other B&B's in the area, they accept bookings for a night.   
Farmer Jean Mathieu and wife Natalie are warm + welcoming. Do take up their offer of Table d'Hote i.e. to eat dinner with their family, whatever they themselves are having. 22 EUR got us aperitifs, more wine to go with smoked pork, mashed potato, salad... coffee and liquer made by Jean M's dad... dessert. The company of other guests + chatting with the family made it a very enjoyable evening.   
Tip: besides Munster cheese, JM makes bergkase (mountain cheese) Mild yet flavourful, it will appeal to those who like Cheddar or Sprintz. At 15EUR for a whole kilo, its also a good buy!   
Tip: shopping in the many LIDL in the area is fantastic value. We thought fresh foie gras was already cheap in the Carrefour at Muhlouse but it was only 10 EUR here! Huge cans of duck confit for Christmas dinner too :-)   
Tip: in Munster, get some takeaway Choucroute. Available in bottles with meats already included.... or pick up smoked meats to heat up for a super dinner back home.   
After all, its only 2+ hours drive from where we live in Lachen (near Pfaffikon) For people living near Basel it's really a nice day trip.

			We highly recommend the Interlaken area, though not the town so much. And if you have the choice of going at a time when the weather is clear, the views will be much more beautiful.    
Continue on to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, as far as Stechelberg. From there you can take the gondola all the way to the Schilthorn revolving restaurant, which is hokey but has the most gorgeous views on a clear day.    
Or, get off in Murren, then walk through the town, have lunch with a great view. Then walk to Grutschalp along the top of the cliffs and take the other gondola down to Lauterbrunnen, postbus back to Stechelberg if you parked there. The walk to Grutschalp is mostly flat, and there are other walks/hikes of varying degrees of difficulty from Murren.    
Go soon before the snow, though I am sure it is beautiful then, too.

			Hi, 
Can anybody please suggest what is the best place to stay around Montreux, Vevey or Colly to cover the vine yards in Lavaux? i have planned the weekend in this area and would like to cover other interesting activities, if any. 
I am looking for hotels as it will be probably 1 or 2 nights stay.    
Thanks in advance

			I have a person who wants to make a tour with me taking in Interlaken, Lucerne, Zurich, a day at Titlis & Bern City tour (optional) with a mountain pass or two thrown in. I intend that, for him, it could be a 3 day tour but only one thing, he needs a couple of people to share costs.   
My bus has 7 passenger seats, this could be therefore for around 200CHF per day - 3 days (possibly negotiable), cheaper if you bring more people.   
Anyone interested PM me.

			Been there Sunday, i would say the exhibition is a bit overrated, because 
most items of the 220 pieces are ""small "" and behind windows. 
There are only 4 Warriors and 1 horse, to get there you have to queue up 
for about 30-40 mins, to pass the warriors and the horse will take another 30 mins, because people take all the time in the world to have a decent look( because they paid for it).The Museum was really crowded last sunday afternoon, therefor you can't enjoy the movies and the explanations. 
The guide to the exhibition will cost 58 sfr (available in French, English and German), most of the stuff sold at the museum shop is really crap (like chinese souvenirs)  and overpriced (for example cookies in a qin printed tin for 20 sfr/170 gramms).If you want a reproduction of a terracotta warrior back at home , no problem, 750 sfr plus shipment. 
The most expensive item is an exclusive evening at the museum for about 8000 sfr (don't know how many companions are allowed). 
No photos are allowed(even mobiles) !

			Since I am a newbie from California, I may be the only one looking forward to winter since it has been a hood long while since I have experienced one! I am sure come March I will be on here complaining. I live next door to the thermalbad so I plan to take full advantage, including enrolling my toddler in swim class. If there are any fellow moms of toddlers who would be interested in forming a play group (maybe four or five of us) where we could take turns weekly meeting up at each others homes for hot chocolate tea coffee and a snack while the children play, please pm me! I live in Enge.

			Step 1. Drop the bags off within the required windows for your flight 
Step 2. Go to the airport without bags 
Step 3. Fly 
Step 4. Collect at the carousel upon arrival   
It works, I think it's overpriced but then I do pay for airport parking instead.

			Hi,   
I'm planning a weekend trip to Davos on either 11.-13.10., 18.-20.10. or 25.-27.10. to try out some mountain biking. The time of the trip still depends a bit on the weather conditions.    
The idea would be to arrive in Davos by train on Friday afternoon/evening, spend Saturday and Sunday morning biking in the mountains and leave on Sunday afternoon/evening. I was thinking of staying in a hostel, such as Youthpalace Davos or similar (I'm not too picky on accommodation).   
I'm not an expert mountain biker, even though I have been doing a lot of ""normal"" biking. Therefore, I'm thinking of doing easy to moderate routes and renting a proper mountain bike onsite.   
If you're interested in joining for trip, please let me know. I'm coming from Basel, but it would of course be possible to meet in Davos. I would also be happy to hear experiences or tips regarding mountain biking in that area or somewhere else.   
Cheers, 
Pete

The other offer, 35 CHF for a companion pass, can be used by a guest.

			Just popped out to check out the Benichon events in Fribourg and thought it is worth a mention here....   
If you are interested in fresh local produce, artisan producers, and a bit of good country Swiss traditional fun, Fribourg is the place to be this weekend!!   
There are food and traditional craft stalls all along Rue de Romont and Rue de Lausanne, with a huge tent set up in Place Python to eat and drink.... plus for the little ones there is a ""petting zoo"" setup in Grand Place where you can look at some cows, goats, pigs etc.   
There are demos of meringue and biscuit making, ham smoking, cheese making, traditional needlepoint and woodwork etc etc    
Plus the local restaurants are all having special benichon menus (for a variety of prices).   
Also all open tomorrow....Well worth checking out

I've no idea who the OP was, I was merely doing some research into some property websites and my search led me back to this forum. I posted in a thread which seemed the most appropriate as I know many people on here book their accomodation through such websites. If you are looking for a room or hotel then the Airbnb would seem a sensible place to book but I'm amazed that people pay such prices for an apartment or house. Another website I looked at added 20% as their booking commission plus the payment fee.

			Was a great day, we only managed four of the twelve farms. Chicken (bought lovely egg or our supper), horse (pony rides, nice horse-steak and wine), milk (petting oo, milking robot, horse and trap rides) and pig and llama (only three pigs, lots of llamas, band in the barn). 
With little ones (3.5 and 5) it was enough, but I must admit that if I'd knwn there were chicks in the next farm I would've stopped again. 
I hope they do something similar in spring so we can see more babies.

For me, if you click on a red marker it will give you a typical google maps pop up square with the name and address of the object.   
The Green markers already have a photo uploaded for them and clicking on one of the green markers brings up the name, address and the photo.   
Maybe try a different browser and see if that shows the window?

Since they all charge for admission normally, this lowered the barrier imposed by our frugality to going in, walking around, and deciinge whether we wanted to spend time there. If we didn't see much of interest, we'd quickly be off to the next museum.   
I think the hours this year are from 2pm to 2am, so one issue is your museum endurance! I'm pretty sure it started later the time we went, and we pooped out after 4 or 5 hours, but felt it was worth doing.

			Train to Lucerne and walk around the old town a bit, then the boat to Vitznau, then the train up to the top of Mt. Rigi, where they can eat a late lunch and walk around to see the views. If they have energy, take the boat to Fluelen at the far end of the lake, then train back to Basel. Gorgeous scenery and not too much walking.

I did the Vendage in France for 9.5 days in the Beaujolaise. I wanted to do it for the experience, but the experience is also getting paid for what you will find one of the hardest picker jobs out there.

Rehearsals are usually on Wednesday night at the Bischofshof, right next to the Basel Minster.      . Some german knowledge is required for understandig the conductor    
On Wednesday, 4th of September, we will start rehearsing Bach's famous Christmas Oratorio (all six parts):    
Concerts will be on Dec 21 and 22 at the Basel Minster.   
If you are interested in joining this once in a lifetime experience don't hesitate to contact me or just come to the Bischofshof (address: Rittergasse 1, Basel) at 7:30 pm on Wed 4th of September (or any other Wednesday).       
Come and join! Don't be shy, give it a try!      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Sing with us the Christmas-Oratorio from J.S. Bach! (Basel)	opernball	Posts: 6

			Hi all, 
Starting to plan now our family holiday for Christmas now (too late?), i thought of trying to escape for a while from the Swiss winter, by flying with our kids to Gran Canaria. 
I noticed there is a fair deal in Coop Travel (flights+hotel). Since i never worked with them (or with any other travel agency, in fact - always took separate flights and accommodation arrangements) - I wonder if anyone here has an experience with Coop Travel. Do they generally offer good deals? 
Any other tips will be welcomed. 
Thanks!

			We loved Davos this summer (although we have been quite a few times).  There are some gorgeous hikes which are easily accessible for a young one (and end at mountain cafés with great play parks .. Eg Rinerhorn).   
We stayed at the Sheraton and can not recommend it highly enough - both our kids had great fun.  The eldest quickly had a possee of friends and the youngest made lots of use of the playpark and the lovely pool.  What is more, they were incredibly helpful with my list of special requests for our youngest son who has various disabiilities, including borrowing a bed from another hotel to meet our requirements.  Plus kids go free ..can't get much better than that!     
Enjoy.

We were told when the market was.... so buying fresh food and then a trip to Monoprix (the one inside the shopping centre is the biggest) to get the missing bits, bringing it back and cooking some lovely food and we had a great weekend. We stayed at   Les Z'hirondelles and the lady who welcomed us just needs a phone call before you arrive and was very friendly.   
In Yvoire I stayed in Hotel Vieux Logis. They were a bit run down and I didn't try the breakfast there so I can't comment. We got a room on the top floor which had a FANTASTIC view over the old roofs of the village and lake Geneva and the lights on the other side of it (Switzerland). It is one of the cheaper hotels there though and desparately needs refreshing, but we were happy   Yvoire is kinda cool to walk through at night when the tourists have gone. We drank Champagne at 3am by the port ... watching the twinkling lights and watching the boats bob up and down a little.   
Annecy and Yvoire are both fantastic places I'd recommend too. Two of my favourites.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	One night fun/quirky/cute trip idea from Lausanne?	WhiteLady	Posts: 17

			Small amount of shopping .. An intermarché.  Not enormous tourism value really.  I normally go on to neighbouring town of Beaucourt for the Super U.   
Or if you are wanting touristic diversion, stop off at St Ursanne or Porrentruy or even Glovelier and connect to the Chemin de Fer du Jura for visiting Franche Comté.

			We have a big room at the back of our house which I'd like to be used more often (btw it is for rent for family/childrens parties, etc, with kitchen and WCs/handicapped access, sits 40)- and I thought maybe we could organise some   
- crafts sessions. Bring stuff you make, be it knitting, sewing, crochet, macramé, quilting - whatever- and let's share skills, teach each other, etc. Plenty of power points for sewing machines, etc.   
- cooking sessions- taking it in turn to teach a special dish, your speciality or something from your home country or you learnt to cook abroad, etc- then eat it together (and share cost of ingredients).    
What do you think? Would anybody be interested? (we are 35 mins from Neuchatel, 40 mins from Yverdon or 55 mins from Lausanne).

			There's a big wine fair in Sierre in the beginning of September (vinea). You can try as many wines as you like for 20 chf.    
The big opening of the wine caves happens -as far as I know- only once a year and it has been the case in May. Went last year and can recommend it, it's a great way to get to know the local wines.

			Anyone interested in joining a sailing trip from Athens to the Greek Islands, leaving 24th August.   
There are 2 spaces available on short notice due to an accident of a crew member (bike, not sailing accident).   
It is 800 Euro per place for the 2 weeks for the sailing charter + the usual costs.  
It is privately organised, not a commercial one. Currently we are 5 + the 2 open places.

			Generally I would set focus in front of infinity. Bear in mind that the sharpest point of any lens is likely to be from 5.6 to 8 stop down to 16 & you will loose definition due to defraction.   
The Nikon 20mm f 3.5 is OK, nothing special, a very old design. The 24 f 2.8 is way better. It's very difficult to build a fast wide full frame lens, which is why some wide angles are breath takingly expensive.

			Belgianmum, thanks for the explanation of the wg, neither Odile or myself have a crystal ball, so did not understand as OP had not explained.   
Now someone has furnished the OP with details for places to rent at campsites and mentioned the air BnB thingie   
otherwise OP could look into those flats that are rented by the day, week etc, they usually come with all the necessary & OP could help out with some basic shopping, as not usually supplied with salt/pepper washing up liiquid and the like.

Most increase their normal price to compensate for the commission. The main disadvantage is that there is no contact with the owner until after the booking has been made.    
The locations of properties is not determined the airbnb. It depends which owners decide to advertise with them.    
Renting a privately owned apartment or house is always much more reasonable than a hotel. It's just a shame that these big websites are springing up to try and sell them to customers in the same way as hotels without having to worry about quality, maintenance, cleaning or anything else other than advertising and taking the money.    
Even the normal advertisers are pushing owners into more and more expensive advertising packages and heading towards commission based models.

			That is a bit like asking how long is a piece of string.  There is so much to suit all interests.  A bit more specific info. would be helpful.     
Are you mobile or just staying local?  What are your interests.     
There are many threads about places to visit and things to do.  It is probably best to search those first

			A bit far from Davos (2.5 to 3 hours) but Brigels also has a chairlift that's open in the summer.      
Another option from Davos is Scuol   this only a bit more than an hour from Davos    
Kiental (im Kandertal) is another option   but this will be much quicker from Basel.    
Brunni is also nice but again better from Basel. They also have serveral offers for children and children don't pay for the ride.    
Hope you will have a good time!

			Just came back from a week near St gallenkirch, in montafon - thanks for the advice, Slammer! It was fabulous. Really beautiful area, we were up the mountain and went for lots of lovely walks - brilliant for couples, singles, families. Lots of nice restaurants, good service. Went to a nice water park - Alpenbad Montafon - a bobsleigh and flying fox (steel cable over a lake) and cable car in Golm. Really recommend the area for summer or winter.

- I do have a 2 years baby 
- Don't want to get freeze :-) 
- I would like to have the tipical Swiss scenario, caws, mountain small lakes   
Could you kindly advice?   
Thank you!

			Did you specially want to go to Karlsruhe by bus? It is a coparitivey cheap train ride, if you buy the ""Baden-Wuttenburg  day tickets. These tickets are for a days return travel,  can be used by up to 4( or is it 5?) people, so makes it a very cheap option if you are travelling with others.  From Basel it was 25euro last time I bought a day ticket.

			My suggestion would be Meiringen. It is under 3 hours by train from Lausanne. You can go up the Alpen Tower for paragliding. The Grimsel Pass, Susten Pass and Gross Scheidegg are all within easy reach. Brienz is just a few minutes away. Meiringen is a quiet town with accommodation ranging from small b&b's to luxury hotels. I can recommend a great b&b if required

			Hi Rico C, 
I live in Dällikon and to go by public transport you need to take the bus 491 until Affoltern and then take the bus 62 to Mühlacker. Then you need to walk for 10/15 minutes. 
It's so near us but to go by public transport takes minimum 35 minutes  
Cheers

			It'll be very busy with the jazz festival currently running so accommodation will be hard to find. The Tralala is a lovely place to stay in the old town and nearby the Museum is a lovely restaurant. Or Le Rouvenaz on the lake side but be sure to book ahead. Rouvenaz has rooms too but i'd say it would be fully booked. A boat trip is nice to do in good weather. Vevey (nearby town) has a lovely farmers market Saturday mornings, actually you might have better luck if you need a place to stay to base yourself there and take the train (5 mins) into Montreux. Enjoy!

			We took a tageskarte and travelled to Lugano from Zurich on Swiss train. 
There is a place called belinzona , I think, that has some nice castle. 
3 km from Lugano is the village of gandria which is worth spending a day. 
We stayed at restaurant and hotel on the main road called Ristorante le bucce di Gandria 
. has a bus stop just in front of it. The view from the hotel room was great. 
One of the locals advised us that the best pasta in gandria is available at our hotel only... 
There were costlier ones in gandria village just next to the water. 
And Lugano requires another day 
Enjoy your stay

			Branch out.  Take the S3 to St Ursanne and wander down to the ""beach"" on a lazy meander of the River Doubs. Stunning scenery and a beautiful minature medieval town to wander through in search of drinks and picnic tea supplies.  My son's psychomotorik therapist took him there for weeks to help him desensitise his feet.  First they paddled with wellies, then with shoes, then just in socks and now he wades in with the best of them, bare feet, to plop pebbles in buckets and generally contemplate the wonders of building a miniature damn.   
You'll love it but it's more of a half day trip from Basel.   
PS. Be sure to take little one sliding down the thick stone banister outside the medieval church .. Well known for its portico frescoes but better known as having one of the oldest slides built into its stone steps.  All those kids bottoms over the centuries have made it super smooth!

			haha.   
OK - to give a bit more background.. what I am interested in observing is the timing at which the ""false"" dawn and the ""true"" dawn occur.    
Take a look at this video which shows the phenomenon occurring twice:       
(Keep an eye on the counter/marker in the bottom right hand of the screen)   
The false dawn occurs towards the end of night and is marked by a vertical-ish column of light appearing from the horizon in the direction of the rising sun. That then disappears and is replaced by the ""true"" dawn which is the horizontal spreading of light across the horizon prior to sunrise.

			simple answer, yes, but with a half-tax card you might find it's cheaper to buy a round-trip ticket (35chf or so) rather than the '9 o'clock pass' price...   
I highly recommend you speak to your local ticket office of the SBB. I find them very helpful and they always seem to suggest cheaper options if there are any available...

			Officially they should only be sold to residents of the local Gemeinde/commune where sold... but...   
Some communes/G sell the tickets themselves at the Townhall,and do not charge for this. Others, like mine, have appointed an official seller,usually a kiosk or tobaconnist- and they charge an extra 5 or more CHF for the service, hence the difference in price.

			Just made use of this and thought I would share the love...   
Through the Post Bus website you can buy half price day passes for the local transport networks (sorry, website only in french, german or italian).   
These are particularly great if you don't have a half-fare card, or if you (like me) have family/friends coming to visit.       
...we regularly use these with guests to travel from Fribourg to Gruyere and the Cailler factory at Broc (lovely and relatively cheap day out).

If you're set on this particular adventure, an idea would be to stay at Trift overnight.  Then you're talking about a one-hour hike in pre-dawn light rather than a three-hour hike starting in the middle of the night.

			Now that summer has started it is time to do some weekend trips around switzerland. We usually go by car or public transport, take or tent, and do some walks, not too difficult or long ones, we like to keep it relaxed. I thought it might be nice to share our experiences, and figured here would be the right place.    
We didn't feel like getting up early or packing our stuff on friday so we left quite late in the morning by car to arrive at the camping site in Flühli just before midday. It is a typical swiss camping, by which I mean it has mainly season places. the 'real' camping site is a small grass field at the side of the main building/entrance. It has a kids playground (with swing, slide etc) on one side and according to the website there are 10 places, although there is no separation or anything. In our case there were just two other families with mobilhomes, so we had all the place we wanted. Not much shadow unfortunately but I am not going to complain about that when we are only staying one night.    
We set up our tent and searched for a spot along the river to have our lunch. Although we are usually well prepared for our trips and hikes this time we weren't, so after lunch we drove to sörenberg to the tourist info, which wasn't located there where the gps sent us, neither at the bus station where the blue ""i"" was, but somewhere in between the Volg and that busstation on the main road, on the left side when coming from Flühli. We found some maps, and asked for a hike to see the typical chalk formations that are on any Entlebuch photo:  
As we all know summer came late this year and there was still to much snow to go there. So we decided to do another tour. The lady advised us to take the cable car to rossweid and walk around there. We usually prefer to walk uphill and take the cable car down, so we decided to do that. We followed the wanderweg up direction rossweid until the first crossing where we choose to go direction Salwide. there we choose direction Blatte, then Blattenegg, and so to Rossweid via schwarzenegg. There was still some snow at this height and the wanderweg from blattenegg to hindere Steinetli was out of use due to possible falling rocks, but everything was clearly indicated as we are used to here in switzerland. close to Rossweid it was kind of a building pit becaus they are building a water playground there that will be opened end of july, we saw a lot of the wooden equipment which looked really nice but it didn't look like a water playground at all yet. Too bad we had not asked the tourist info lady when the last cable car was. We arrived at 17.20 (had started our small tour at about 15.00 to give you an idea about the length)whereas the last one went at 17.15 (I actually saw it going and thought well we are in time there are still cablecars moving) So we had to go back on foot, bad for the knees and we don't like going down at all, but it was fairly quick.    
A disadvantage of the camping is that there is no person of the camping permanently there, they come by between 6 and 8 pm and than you get te key to the lavatories etc. then they pick it up again in the morning before you leave. So before the lady of the camping came we didn't have acces to the toilets etc. Everything was nice and clean though, and they are even rebuilding and modernizing it after the summer hollidays so no complaints about that. After we had enjoyed some belgian beers and cooked dinner we went to the village to see if anything was going on there. We had another beer in the only pub and did some 'observe the locals' for entertainment.    
next day the lady who would come pick up the keys at around 10 in the morning didn't turn up until 10.40. So i would definitely ask whether there is a letter box where you can drop the keys off rather than waiting for her next time. Then we went on to Flühli's main attraction:  
It was nice but the water really cold (I know it is meant to be cold but for me it was so cold that it hurts, but for my husband this wasn't a problem so maybe its just me) 
We meant to grill at a grillstelle near the river (Waldemme) which we passed by on our way to the kneippanlage (indicated on the map 'anreise' in the previous link) but there was a party in the village and laziness made us decide to grab something to eat there.    
In the afternoon we drove to Entlebuch itself and walked the following route: from Entlebuch to Finsterwald via veebode and Schluechtberg. and than back down to Entlebuch via Chilewald and along the grosse entle in the end. it is 3 hours walking time according to the yellow arrows. And along the way we discovered it was mostly the same as this path  
At mettilimoos there was this place where they made a 'moorbad' to walk in with your feet (and also possibility to wash them off) which was kinda cool.  
Near Entlebuch station we ate a good ice-cream before driving back home.   
In general it is a very beautiful region with lots of walking possibilities that are all quite easy. We had expected it to be more special (as in different from just beautiful swiss nature), but yeah it was just beautiful swiss nature, which is not bad at all. We really enjoyed our trip, although we want to go back later in summer to hike to Hengst (where the picture of my first link was taken). wie also want to do the Brienzer rothorn but we will probably do that from Brienz.

			Stuttgart.   
Strasbourg is good for eating and enjoying the pretty old town, but not really for evening entertainment.   
Basel's good but the atmosphere isn't as lively as Stuttgart and it's much more expensive.  Easier to get around though and prettier.

It is strange but catching and releasing the fish back to the lake is considered crueller treatment, against being beaten to death with a truncheon! Once caught, the fish are not allowed to be put back into the water!

			Hi,    
Would love to find a suitable 2-3 hour hike near the lake and am quite overwhelmed by all the options. Our caveat is we need it to be stroller-friendly (taking our 2-year old) and would ideally like to stay somewhere near the trailhead, and use some form of public transit to get back.   
Anyone experience something along these lines they would recommend. We're flexible with car vs. train to get there. as well.   
Thanks for any suggestions -- Melissa

			I think he means E.     
On the airport website you can find the daily schedules, from which you will see that Assassin is right, midmorning to lunchtime is the best time for the large long haul departures.  The landing runway is too far away to be of interest.   
Edit.  Last time I checked, deck E was only open twice a week ... so check before you go.

Suggest you get the free papers from the shops with the travel sections. It is a lot easier to understand with pictures and their layouts.   
i just rummaged through my paper recycling.  Found  
'Mit ADLI Tours einfach gut reissen' it is for May/June 2013, so presume there will shortly be one for August/September  Although it is mainly in German, believe you can get the gist what is on offer from photos/charts  and when you decide to go further can try to translate the relevant section on-line.  I would suggest you collect the relevant free papers from various shops.  Noticed Denner have a section as well, although you may already be getting them in your post, unless you have opted not to get junk post. It is not necessarily a paper with only holidays, often it is 2 to 4 pages within whatever else they are advertising.

			Well it was lovely, and yes a bit further than expected. We actually went via Frasne-Poligny and nowhere near Geneva! Kids loved it - and I was so impressed with our primary school taking all their Year 1 pupils, some only barely 4 years old. And none of them cried about being home sick- even at bed time when we all went to our tents, 8 kids + 1 teacher/assistant per tent.    
And it really reminded me just how different Swiss schooling is, compared to UK at present. A kid had a nose bleed on the bus, and the teachers help without putting gloves on (yes, what happens in UK!), a kid falls over and a teacher gives said kid a huge hug and a kiss. A child feels a bit sad, and again gets a big hug and kiss and sits on the teacher's knee for a while. In the evening we all sit on the grass in the campsite and sing songs, with a couple of teachers playing guitar. Other campsite users come along, take photos, encourage and clap - and nobody even thinks there could be anything wrong with this. Wonderful - so much trust and old-fashioned and healthy innocence. Lovely.

			Take the train to Domodossola (in Italy) via Brig, have lunch there, and then take the FART train back through the Centovalli into Switzerland to Locarno - there's plenty of campsites around Lago Maggiore.   
If you want to extend your day, go to the castle at Bellinzona or take the bus up to Sonogno or Bosco/Gurin.

			You could also look at some of the camp grounds that, as well as camping, offer very comfortable chalet type cabins units as well. from mamory, the main camping ground in Blois was one that I saw last summer that allowed dogs. If not there, it was one of the nearby towns with the camp site being right by the edge of the Loire, on the downstream left bank of the town. The camp ground also had a superb restaurant.

			You probably know this site, if you're considering sleeping in straw, but I'll link it anyway:       
The weather should be slowly getting better and warmer, but coming from Cali., it will feel cooler. But I would imagine that the farmer would be able to provide extra blankets, if required.

			Have you heard of Allgäu airport? You can get there by bus from Zurich very comfortably for only 15 euros. 
You can fly with Ryan air to really cheap destinations such as Edinburg for 18 Euros.  
You no longer just have Zurich and Basel airport to fly out and in from. The bus takes 2.5 hours but it is door to door service and no stress. Check out my video tip...

			i found milos too touristic for my taste (but i went in mid july)   
karpathos is a paradise for me. great, empty beaches in the end of july last year and some of the friendliest people i have ever met. i don't know, there was something there that made me love it. there are some direct flights from germany and austria. otherwise there are flights from athens and from rhodes. i was informed that there will be one from thessaloniki too soon. we will most probably go again this year.      
kythira is also a beautiful island. there is an airport with flights at least from athens. nice beaches, nice people and some nice green and waterfalls and places for hiking       
skopelos is another favourite of mine. i suppose you have to fly to skiathos and take a boat there or fly to athens and take the boat from there. perhaps a bit too much travelling if you only have one week.    
for the historical sights, take two days in athens, as others have suggested  and go to the acropolis museum and perhaps also sounio   
have fun!

			Last year a mate of mine complained that my shoot Italian was to blame that I had fallen over the Majola pass instead of the Stelvio as I had originally promised and it seems that I owe another one of my dwindling stock of friends a lunch after the poor man was forced to look at a picture of a serpentine road with a vanishing point, think Wiley E. Coyote free-falling in a road-runner cartoon, this time around it Isn't not ain't going to happen. 
There you go a treble negative in a working sentence. Suck it Shakespeare.   
Slammer gingerly mounted the Iron pig and headed to St. Moritz. 
Very gingerly. 
The day before I had been in the middle of what would have been called a casualty, mummy had shot out of the drive backward without looking, thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster for the bikes ABS and new brakes. The bike stopped, slammer didn't, let me tell you inertia is a real bitch, ergo the two little personal airbags between Slammer and the bikes tank took the strain. My eyes popped their sockets and I swear, no shit, that I burped two squishy lumps into my cheeks. 
Turned out mummy had quite a potty mouth and she went all Grrr woof woof on me, however I was a bit preoccupied by matters most, ahh, pressing to give her some well deserved stick so I was not spontaneous until much later when I was able to relax with a cold beer and a bag of ice. 
Biiiitch.   
Saturday morning waxed hot and humid, stewing in my biker rags riding through the valley of death aka. Rheintal I could see the heat flimmer on the motorway, I was overheating and looking forward to going up into the refreshing coolness of altitudes of over a thousand meters. I passed Buchs and chugged through Liechtenstein, a whole country that fits in the viewfinder of a cheap digital camera, just take a step back. Passed Chur and turned of the main road at Thusis    
first stop at Lac Mamorea.   
Not a natural lake but a dam and underneath the 10 degree cold water a drowned village.   
I had a coffee in St Moritz and spent a half hour amusing myself watching the expensive cars crash into each other, a black Ferarri had taken on a VW and lost, I think Mr. Rolex was more pissed that the crash had happened with a commoner's car than the actual damage. 
There was a sprinkling of Bikes but they ran into the Harley and Ducati type of ride, a mite out of my paycheck level. 
By now the Beemer with just over 200.000 Kilometers on the Tacho   
toasted this event with a beer, hey it is a Bavarian bike you know.   
has had it's share of knocks and scratches and looks a bit ratty round the edges, patina is what you could call it but it's well earned and I do not care if the St. Moritzians hitch their cocaine filled noses over us I rode on and left them to their lifestyle of riches, shiny Porches, boob jobs and glitter. 
Slammer is not a St. Moritz person. 
Sod `em. 
I decided to take the Stelvio from the Italian side and took the tunnel down to Livinio 
I have said it once before and will say it again, the Italians should never have been acquainted with the internal combustion engine, some god must love Italians because it is certainly not superior driving skills that is keeping them alive. 
At the intersection of the approach to the pass I stopped and watched the cabaret, white lines on the road must be only for decoration nobody took a bit of notice, bikes and cars weaved in a dance of tin. 
One guy did the Knight bus magic stretching trick as he shot at warp between two cars. 
Amazing. 
I would not be soo pissed with the Italians if they were not always so well dressed.   
Riders on the storm. 
Dum de dum de dum..     
The further up that I rode the darker and closer the clouds got. The sky was  paynes grey, drooping and heavy with wet, not much longer now I could hear thunder and the snow capped mountain tops glowed with the flash of lightning over and over again. 
As I was going up and up a steady stream of italian regged bikes was heading down and  down, maybe they knew something that I didn´t. 
At the tri-starte border, Italy´, Austria and CH I stopped again and  looked down at the road I had just drove on. 
Lightning flashed, blinding me, followed  by a immediate explosion of thunder, that was  very, very close. 
Even before I had finished shouting FUgggggg! I realized that lightning zapping a lump of metal happy to conduct a mega-volt charge of electricity possibly igniting the tank full of flammable liquid just a millimeter in front of my sore genitals could ruin my whole day. 
Time to boogie. 
I decided to spend the night at the summit there are four or five hotels but as I drove through they all seemed to cater predominantly for the MTV generation. 
It's PAARDY time, paardy, paardy. paaaardy! 
Along with St. Morizians another thing that the Slammster just can not abide. 
I carried on and down the Austrian side, just over the summit the clouds cleared and the sky became a deep vivid blue the crystal air showing the mountains in a high contrast.     
 As you see some Italians where arseing around, ahh! for the wonders of the SlamKam. 
It was starting get a little late, my balls felt radio-active, I was getting saddle sore and it was way past beer O'clock.     
This whole area is a national park with Switzerland to the west and the South Tyrollean Dolomites to the east. It is also the site of one of the more brutal WW1 battlefields, Somme, Verdun, names that have burned themselves into the collective memories, however almost forgotten is the fierce alpine fighting, mountain for mountain, valley for valley, village for village, fighting in a hostile environment always in danger of dying either by man or nature. This part of the war took men and material to the absolute limit. 
And the soldiers died like flies.   
Spot the bunker? 
Today mountaineers climb the peaks with all the flashy gadgets and glittery gew gaw's known to man, and when they get to the top and look down at the world below they feel a sense of achievement. 
Pussies. 
In 1916 soldiers of the K&K Monarchy occupied the peaks and dug in, climbing the mountains taking heavy 1875-model 10.5 mountain cannon with them and building fortifications, in some cases actually tunneling in the glaciers, all done with mules and the technology of the 19 century. The logistic obstacles must have been staggering the soldiers superhuman. 
The alpine war was fought without mercy, only last year did the glacier release five of the fallen, they where identified as Italian soldiers and taken home where they were buried with full military honors. 
Almost a hundred years on I spent the night on the former Ortlerfront in the Franzenhöhe Hotel at an altitude of 2188 meters for 50 Euros incl. breakfast. 
Red wine and grappa extra.     
Vans and a few late cars struggling up the dangerous pass, not a place to be when the light is failing.   
Somewhere there must be a law against drinking grappa at high altitudes, now along with my other discomfort I had a thick head to take care of. 
I turned over and slept until almost noon. 
I had now to choose the way home, either back through Italy or carry on down and return by the way of Austria or over the Umbriel pass and the Often pass that would put me in the ballpark for home. 
I rode up the Stelvio again and through the hotel-complex eventually turning right at Umbriel, immediately the steady stream of Italian bikes dried up and apart from just the occasional bike or cycle the road was empty. 
In short absolute biking heaven, Slammer got into a dream state and the curves and hairpins and turns rolled easily under my wheels. 
Two hours later I was home.

			Hi,    
We are going to france this year and staying  here     again not hotel but gites to stay in. The riding is 15 euro for 30 minutes and 25 euros for an hour lesson from age 2. The instruction is offered in english.    
Good luck on your hunt.   
I also found this place which we though about going   which has ponies too and lots of activities and was our top 2 .. the search site is great as places  are all recommended  for kids and lots of options to narrow your search to what you are looking for.

1107	28.03.2013, 12:36	Member	Thanked 143 Times in 66 Posts	Location: BADEN	"    since no one has much prior knowledge about the island ,or maybe, no one is willing to take the time to explain it out,  I might as well give you my impressions of the island. 
I went there 2 weeks ago. 
Reached Locarno on tageskarte tickets 
Just 5 min walk and you reach the Dock 
One has to travel by ferry to reach the island 
Charges for round trip are : 
Without half tax card 33 franks per person ( the tageskarte is of no use here) 
With half tax card 29 franks 
Journey time 75- 90 mins 
Beautiful views 
Land on the island and pay 8 franks per person as entry fee 
Time taken for a moderate nature lover to see the place 60-90 min  
I did take some time to feed my baby  
Not a very stroller friendly place 
There is a restaurant on the island 
Toilets - free of charge 
Ferry in every 60-90 mins, so check for the return ferry timings as you start the tour. 
IF YOU ARE SOMEONE FROM THE TROPICS , THIS ISLAND WILL NOT "" WOW"" YOU. 
So I would end my description with the thought that great expectations lead to disappointments  
AND PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO GET DOWN IN ASCORNA TOWN ON THE WAY BACK, I found this place worth a day or two stay. 
As I left ASCORNA , felt good, that the money spent on the ferry tickets was worthwhile. 
So the whole  trip would take the whole day if you include ASCORNA too. 
Hope you have great time in brissago islands

The Cable car opens all year round, except for 12 days in November.   
Yes, there are shops open. For more specialised snowboard stuff I'd suggest   - just turn left at the front of the station and left again at the crossroads, then it's about 100m on your left. There's also a ski/bike shop Titlis Sport at the base station, but somewhat more limited, as their main shop is in the village.   
If you're coming by rail and have a halbtax card it may be cheaper to book in advance with  . Depends on your situation, of course.   
Hope you have fun and if you'd like to meet up for a chat or a beer send me a PM.

			I recently went to Paris and had exactly the same issue as you do - not being able to get the online reservation. However, there is a decent solution - you can climb the tower by foot - it is not as hard as you would imagine. It took us about 15-20 min to get to the 2nd floor. There are 700 steps to do that and you do a difference of about 170m altitude. I think for a guy enjoying the Switzerland this effort should not be a problem. The big advantage is that there is practically no queue to make it by foot. Also, you do not need to go on the top (summit) - the views you will get on the 2nd floor is more then enough. 
P.S. - the views from Eiffel tower compare to nothing else (Arc, Sacre Cueur) simply because from Eiffel is surrounded by all the famous buildings. So, just do it. Do not waste your time in the line and make a short workout to the 2nd floor. It totally worth it.

They may already be booked for Christmas but I reckon it's worth giving them a call/email to find out.

			As Wolli just said are thermal baths in Switzerland something the Swiss take rather seriously...    
I was once with a group of 40 or so international students in the one in Vals and it was a great place. Not sure if the elderly Swiss thought so as well when we were having fun there though... so if you are not in a group expect it to be quiet. Very quiet.   
I know the Swiss users cannot imagine that there are things possibly better over any border, but if you are planning some weekend getaway can I highly recommend to visit Austria:   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thermal baths in Switzerland?	kjmvzug	Posts: 11

			Now I know that Hotels can be expensive here - mind you, compared to UK they are actually quite reasonable by comparison.   
So how about a thread for people to post recommendations for really good value Hotels in Switzerland, say less than 100CH for a double per night, including breakfast. With a short description + maybe some indication of activities and things to visit in the area. There are some excellent bargains to be had, either because they are a bit dated, or because of less touristy location.

Just as an FYI, with most credit cards, paying in a currency other than CHF IS more expensive, because you have to pay a conversion fee which is between 1% and 1.75% of the price, some also have a minimum fee for every purchase.

			Not quite the same but you guys obviously know the mountain - I know you can get a mountain bike up there but is it possible to get a road bike up there? I skied up there this winter and noticed we had to cross some paved roads. It would be a great road climb but not sure if there is paved access all the way? The only reports I can find are of mountain bike routes but there is Tarmac up there, question is, how far does it go? Anybody any ideas? Thanks!

If you must go to Italy in May, fly to Bari and drive southwards.

			My parents are visiting in mid-May and I'd like to take them to Graubunden for the day, since I think it's a beautiful area and they've never been there, whereas they've been to a fair amount of the rest of Switzerland. I would rent a car in Zurich to have the flexibility to stop by small villages. We are interested in a combination of great scenery as well as seeing the traditional architecture in the Romansch areas. A short hike would be nice, but nothing too strenuous. Does anyone have suggestions for a nice route with a few places to stop by? I loved the scenery in Scuol, but I'm not sure how accessible that is at that time.

			Somewhere like Rigi (a popular day trip destination from Zurich) won't have snow on top - not in July. So normal walking shoes will be fine. Of course if you plan to climb the Matterhorn etc. that's a different story.   
An umbrella might come in handy, weather is pretty changeable in the summer. I wouldn't bother with a rain coat though.   
Zurich is full of tourists in the summer, so don't worry about blending in.   Enjoy yourself, take in all the scenery and old buildings etc. and don't be afraid to be seen looking at stuff. Keep an eye on your wallet as you would in any city, but that's it.  The Old Town is quite walkable so there's no need to bother with trams unless you actually want to ride one.

From your description of him there's no way he'll make from the Station to Uto-Kulm by foot, and the little electric car is really going to be the only way up for him. As for a wheelchair, even if he did go for it, I certainly wouldn't want to be pushing up, and moreover trying to hang on to it on the way back down. It is quite a steep ascent.

			Swiss can actually be cheaper if you travel at the weekned.  The price you see is the proce you get.  No add-ons for luggage etc.  It all depends on how full the aircraft will be.  In general Swiss will get you to a major airport whilst generally Easy jet dont.   Eg Easy jet don't fly to Heathrow.

Makes it much more enjoyable to help people who have first tried to help themselves. That being said, a bit more info on your interests would help us narrow the search - otherwise I'll assume you're looking for a little taste of everything.   
Anyways, I can't help much for the first leg of your journey as it's a bit outside my stomping grounds. Although, while near Davos, I might recommend: Scuol for an amazing  ; the Swiss National Park if you enjoy hiking (stay overnight at  ); a cable car up to 3000m Diavolezza to see the glacier; or a taste of Romansch culture in  .    
For the second leg of your journey, I can also only really comment on Vaud/Geneva region. I personally would spend less time in Lausanne and Geneve as I don't think they have much to offer relative to surrounding areas/villages. Nonetheless, you'll find plenty on what to do by perusing EF. Off the top of my head: the walled town of  can be combined with the amphitheatre in   (aka Aventicum) to visit one of the largest Roman settlements;   are a MUST in September and can be combined with   on the lake (not to mention stunning views); try to get to the top of Dent de Vaulion or Rochers de Naye for some seriously gorgeous panoramas.   
Lastly, spend some time looking into any festivals and events taking place around that time. There's sure to be something.

There is a discounted fare that includes entry for the museums, but am I right in thinking that if one of us uses the halb-tax card ( so the inclusive fare would be just over 70chf for that person) then the other can get a 35chf ticket which after adding on  the 22 for the museum, would still save another 15chf approximately?    
Or am I missing something here?

			Going from Geneva to a tennis tournament at Via Campagna 4, CHIASSO, 6830.  Google says to go through Mont Blanc tunnel and head east across Aosta etc.  However, last week I saw a horrendous queue for the Mont Blanc tunnel and think I should avoid this route.  Does it sound OK if I use the Swiss route and take A1\A2 around Berne and Lucerne then San Gottard tunnel?  
With regard to accommodation.  Should we stay over border in Italy?   Accommodation recommendations in the area whether it is ITA or CH would be appreciated.  Happy to stay up to half hour away by car if it makes financial or recreational sense.

is a great place and location - with a restaurant just up the road by the forest (les Cottards), and another across the lake (l'Auberge des Tailleres) - in a non touristy location by the Lac des Taillères in the famous Vallée de la Brévine in the Neuchatel Jura. They may allow you to pitch tents in the grounds for those who want to camp.

It wasnt what I though it might be anyway: I kinda expected another Swiss small town, one of those (quote from a blog) dots in the Swiss sticks, that is, another  quiet, vague place with a weird sense of people hiding! But thats all by the by because Niederglatt is pretty, doing good business, and has a nice pile of town centre houses that are various in decoration: turrets, gables, tudor-style black and white, and other stylized housing thats   And a river flows through.

			Hi,   
we did such a tour last summer with our whole family (most of them are 50/60+) and they all enjoyed it very much. So I think it's a good thing to do with parents  We took the ""Kulinarische Appenzeller Route"" as my family's roots are there. You can find it here:  
There are many small restaurants along the way and we also visited the Schaukäserei. 
However, there are plenty of other routes available which might be good as well.

			hehe super guys you delivered    
now the person who was spot on regarding my taste was Art.   
my problem isnt with switzerland , because its nature you cant go against it.   
my  problem is with people suggesting places that are ""great"" and ""fantastic"" in CH ,where in reality the descriptions should be more like this:   
""Lets start with the fact that 90% of the places are $$hit, now if someone was pointing a gun on my head and held my family as hostages thus forcing me to jump in the water i would jump in this and this place""   
;pp   
sometimes i browse this site to check out whats up  
and some of the pictures remind me of the aftermath in chernobyl  p     
For the friend who said about Athens i agree , i dont like Athens either. but ill tell you what. lets say the judgment day comes tommorow and someone asks ""how was it down there"" ill be like ""i experienced some of the most magical landscapes"" and you will be like ""i seperated my trash in 7 different bags,cant really get any better than that, can it?""   
i really apreciate all of your feedback!   
Nik   
ps.please treat this message with humour

			This sounds like fun. I don't have a fancy camera but would love to come along, take some photos and explore a bit. I'm sure we could wander around Klein Basel and find some gritty locations. I found the red light district by accident the other day. Please PM me if you are planning a group exploration for April.

			Hello!  We are looking to rent next winter season for our family to ski.  This past winter we have been in Morzine/ Les Gets and it has been wonderful for both husband and I and our two young children.  We love that it also is only a 1 hour drive from Geneva.  We are both advanced intermediate, not experts, so off piste is not of concern to us.   
Next winter we would like to either be there, or another place just as family friendly and pretty and close by.  Megeve has been recommeded to fit this.  As well as Les Carroz.  Has anyone been to Morzine and also to Megeve that can offer an opinion?  Or other suggestions within an hour drive?     
(I realize that there are so many others within just 1 1/2 hr or 2 hrs, but we'd like to keep the drive easy on a Friday).

			Well it's Schengen so you only need a an official ID to travel.  Whether someone considers an expired passport as valid will be interesting.  50/50, I'd say.   
Get in touch with your embassy or consulate if you want to make the trip.

Also, 2h35 Venice-Milano, and 2h55 Milano-Rome.   
As you are not near an airport, I wouldn't fly, but take the train, in a triangle (you'll have to pass Milano to/from Luzern).

			Hi ya   
The link you're looking for (in German only, sorry) is    
Getting the Weil from Mulhouse - nightmare! Take the train to Basel Bad, then bus or train to Weil. It takes no time at all from Basel to Weil. Everything in this region goes through Basel (almost), but the trains are frequent. Don't worry about getting Swiss francs, you can pay in euros in Basel.    
Getting to the Black Forest, you can also take the train to Zell, then bus to the mountains... Not sure if that's the part you want to be in...

These are always stuck at the top for people to read, learn and follow.   
You may have posted in the right area, but think about it... Using a one-word title like ""Searching"" is not very descriptive.  Thus, you are catching a hard time for not reading the sticky threads and following the guidelines that help keep this forum somewhat organized.   
You DID agree to follow the forum guidelines when you signed up    
So, if I were you, I would ask the moderators (kindly) to change the title to something more appropriate and better descriptive of the theme here.  Got it?

Ferries: cheaper, longer break, more opportunity to stroll around 
Tunnel: faster, more frequent service, no sea-sickness.   
You pays your money and takes your choice.    
Either way, the driver should take regular proper breaks along the route.

			I can suggest many different vineyards, but they will be either near Macon, about 45 minutes to an hour from Geneva, or from there to Beaune(add another 45 minutes to the road), or near Zurich. There is some good cheese making tours you can make near Belfort, but that is out of the way if you are keeping it all near Geneva.    
Halbstax card will cost you 125 CHF. It is cost effective to have it for the whole year. And you can use it also to travel in Germany and Austria as well.

			Hello,   
We are visiting Zurich over the Easter long weekend, and would appreciate any tips on things to do and see.We have two small kids 1y and 4y.  
Already planed is the zoo and boat cruise, I need help with a day trip ski area for kids, and Easter egg hunt type event for kids. Also a nice place to go for Sunday brunch.   
Thank You

I read from the link below:

			I always go to Skyscanner or Ebookers for this type of thing. The cheapest airline seems to change all the time. I avoid going to airlines directly for general information, although I may go there to book once I've decided what I want.   
When it comes to connecting flights, it can also make a big difference where you change. Some hubs are more pleasant than others. I don't necessarily see non-stop long-haul flights as a plus, you just have to avoid the nasty airports.

			Last Saturday my wife and I went on a day trip to Gruyeres Village. We had been to that beautiful place a couple of times before and we thoroughly enjoyed visiting it every time.   
We also discovered that there was a temporary exhibition of works of the Polish surrealist artist Franciszek Starowieyski at Gallery of the H R Giger Museum, which is located in the village on the approach to the Gruyere Castle.   
Those of you who like the style of works of H R Giger (the prominent Swiss surrealist artist, who produced the artworks for such films as Alien, Species, Dune, Batman Forever, etc.) might enjoy visiting the exhibition of Franciszek Starowieyski too.       
The exibition has been open since June 2012 but it is due to finish this spring (the exact date is not known).

But I have also been in the position of buying tickets from Basel to Milan, then buying my on-going ticket from the station. there has never been a problem with being able to get a seat on the next train heading to Venice.    
  I don't know how much cheaper the advance, internet price is than buying that way though - as others have suggested, by looking at the total ticket from Switzerland, using the special deals, could be the cheapest for you. That was the sort of ticket I was on, the time I missed the connection ( 25chf to Milan, plus whatever the price was from the SBB for buying the ticket between Milan and Venice. )

			Just for anyone with a future interest:    
There are at least 2 pools inside that lead to the outside area. One of these is where you are allowed to take the babies/children. It is normal depth and has some of the massage vents too and is located right next to the children's area. The pool itself was 34 degrees, the air temp was also warm and the little one thoroughly enjoyed it.

			Went today. The sun was shining, it was fantastic.   
Parking is 5CHF (follow the natureeisfeld parking signs) and the pedestrian entrance is no longer through the 'campsite', you now have to walk along the main road for a bit.   
The ice is really rough compared to previous years, can only assume that slush has frozen on the surface.   
The large loop is circa 2km, so says Nokia Sports Tracker.   
Enjoy!

			Hello,   
We are looking at 4-5 days away at Easter, in one of the German-speaking cantons as our son is taking his German speaking exams after the holiday (forget Oberwallis, we can't understand a word!).    
We are after either a nice and welcoming b&b/farm or self-catering. Any Brit will know what I mean by ""cosiness"" and ""snugness""...struggling so far in all my searches on internet. Heidi style or a more ""light and airy"" version, or a combination of both!   
We are tempted by an outside jacuzzi (hot tub) with views of the moutains or a lake, but we might be pushing our budget.   
Must be able to accommodate 4-6 people, so if you have had a nice discovery in the past, I welcome any recommandation. Thank you EF!

			We are going to leave for Tanzania soon, We are taking a flight first from Geneva to Amsterdam via EasyJet then from Amsterdam to Darelsalam via Turkish Airlines. The problem is there is a 3.5 hours gap in Amsterdam for changing carriers, I think it should be enough but because there are multiple carrier the risk is driving me crazy now.   
  I wanted to know in case of weather problems/flight delays I end up messing up my trip will any travel insurance cover the cost of finding an alternative solution to continue my trip? Can any one recommend any trip specific travel insurance?

			I have been having a bit of bother establishing the best route/options to get to the Three Valleys for a ski trip coming up in March.   
Has anyone ever made the trip and recommend some tips?   
The rest of the ski party travel into Moutiers from UK and seemingly have a direct overnight route on the eurostar.   
I am aware I might have to make several changes, but want to minimise that given I will have a fair bit of luggage to carry (2xsets of skis, boots, ski wear and clothes for the week) but prepared for it none the less.   
Seems getting to Geneva seems to be the first point, which is not a problem. Then do I go for trains, bus, coaches, any special ski runs that occur, or is there something direct from Zurich I am missing?   
Thanks for any help in advance

			Like the previous post mentioned, Malbun/Liechtenstein is nice.   
For a quick activity, and a bit of exercise and fun, head to Steg (I believe its called). On the way up to Malbun, after you drive through the tunnel, on the right hand side of the road is a restaurant parking lot.    
Here you can park, and walk up the mountain to a nice restaurant. Enjoy the pictures of the building's/area's history. Enjoy a warm drink, a beer, some fondue, or other food on the menu. Then request a sled for you/your group members, and head back down to the parking lot on your snow sled. It is a good route, with fun turns and a nice long straight away towards the end that you can really get moving on.        
Werdenberg, in Buchs, is a nice, old village, with a castle you can walk up to, to enjoy a nice panoramic view of the Rheintal. If you do not want to walk up to the castle, enjoy a walk through Werdenberg, the old buildings, and take a stroll around the pond. On the eastern side of the pond is a nice cafe you can enjoy a Latte, or drink/nibble of your choice.    
Sargans also has a cool mine you can visit. It is called Bergwerk. A good friend took his son, and he was quite impressed. Interesting to go inside. Good food and drink and experience! Take a tour, or just enjoy a beverage or food in the mine.      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2010	Groaned at 30 Times in 24 Posts	Things to see or do in Sargans?	cdcdoc	Posts: 794

Thanks to all for your messages.   
At the end I have booked one night in Gstaad, together with a Snow and Rail offer from SBB.   
The journey will take three hours, not too much difference with others such as Davos or Arosa, and as it is said that Gstaad is 'the place'...   
Just FYI, I will stay in the Posthotel Roesli (280 CHF) and the train+pass (280 CHF). Not much money left for restaurants...  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Lively ski places- Gstaad, Zermatt, Davos, Arosa?	odaterse	Posts: 23

			We went on one of the walks organized by this group  . We really enjoyed it as the paths were well laid out, with a stop for Gluhwein half way, and then there was fondue at the end! Perhaps there are similar events where you are. As a novice snow shoe walker, I would recommend going as part of a group or organised event, as in my (limited!) experience the snow shoe paths here tend to be poorly marked.

			Just a small headsup for those in the centre of Basel this Wednesday and fancy a long lunch.  The 27th is Vogel Gryff, a traditional festival organised by the three honourable Societies (Ehrengesellschaften) of Kleinbasel, which are called ""zum Rebhaus"", ""zur Hären"" and ""zum Greifen"". On this day the three heraldic figures ""Vogel Gryff"" (Griffin), ""Wild Maa"" (Wild Man) and ""Leu"" (Lion), accompanied by three drummers, three standard-bearers and four jesters, who collect money for the needy, parade through Kleinbasel, the part of the city that lies on the right-hand bank of the Rhine, performing their traditional dances along the way.   
The day starts just before 11 when a boat carrying the ensemble above fires cannons as it passes middle bridge and then lands at Klingental to start the day.       
The ""parade"" then makes its way onto middle bridge for its yearly ""2 fingers up"" to Grossbasel before it continues though Kleinbasel performing at various locations (mostly outside bars - see note below for times).   
The traditional dance performed can be seen here as I filmed it a year or so back:     
Other notes: 
The police put on for one-day only the old traditional style English bobby hats.  The Fisherstube Brewery brews for one day only a very nice bock beer.   
More info  (in english):         .   
If you want to see the ""dance"" at another time of the day this   has the locations and times on it.   
It may not have the ""big bang"" of Fasnacht etc, but I like it and thought I would share some information about it  .

			We were skiing in Leysin on sunday, and although we didn't use them we did see lockers at the base of the cable car, to the right of the cashdesk.  They were big enough for a rucksack and shoes etc, so would probably fit a carry on type suitcase, but not a large one.  There may have been bigger ones that we didn't see though.

			I think you will find it difficult to find a ski area within 2 hours of train ride from Zh that DOESN'T offer the facilities you are asking for.   
You are in Switzerland and it is high season for skiing and anyone will like to take your money......plenty of options.

			Hello all,   
my wife and I will be visiting Zurich for three nights in early August from New Zealand. Obviously this is a long flight and what we would really like to do is relax! We plan to go on a good tour to see some of the natural beauty of Switzerland. Could anyone recommend a good tour please?   
Secondly, we are really excited about eating some great food! Any recommendations for good traditional food?   
Finally, and most importantly, where to stay. We don't mind staying up to an hour by train out of Zurich itself. What we really want is a nice place to relax and unwind after a long flight. Prefer if there are a few shops nearby if we need anything, and has to have a good pub, but I don't think that will be a problem!

			Ive been wondering if we've been living an overly decadent lifestyle...or if this is just normal?  In short:  who else likes to go to France (Alsace/Jura) for dinner and a hike on the weekends?   
I've noticed that many people (Europeans mostly) consider a 100km day trip to be lunacy which would require hotel reservations and at least three days time to complete.  Surely we cant be the only ones to do this as we always see Swiss cars out and about.  But im wondering...how many of these Swiss cars have English speakers in them?   
Are these people grocery shopping?

			Hi, I am Hanna and I just registered at the forum    
I am organizing a skiing week in Arosa (19-26.01.2013) and are looking for nice people who would like to join us. We rented a cosy cottage in Arosa, 300m from the ski lift. The cost is 50CHF per night. We are now 3 young families with small children (age 0.5- 4 years) and some single people who are declared to go, however there are still free places, so if anybody is interested just let me know! We will be happy to hear from you! Most of the people who go are my friends but mostly they don't know each other, so don't be worried about not knowing us, we are nice people   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Skiing in Arosa 19-26.01.2013	han20	Posts: 1

I think its silly that if you have already paid, and been up, that you are forced to que with the others who have just arrived.   
Lesson learned though, dont ski to the bottom until you are ready to leave or its dead.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 31 Times in 20 Posts	Engelberg - Cheap hostel/hotel deals	Chrisso	Posts: 563

It really is beautiful and am sure your date will love it. Google it and have a look. Kusnacht is 12 minures from stadelhofen and its a 5 minutw walk from the train station.

			La Gomera is lovely, but perhaps too quiet for many. I agree with Busby about Puerto de La Cruz in Tenerife- the old town is still there, with excellent restaurants, and the municipal series of landscaped pools by the sea front is great. Hire a car though, so you can drive up to the green north and the orangeries, etc. One of our daughters lives in the South- but when we are there we tend to drive to Puerto or further North for the day.

There is not a great deal of difference between the other markets in the German speaking areas.  Zurich is one of the larger ones and is undercover within the Bahnhof.  There are also smaller markets elsewhere around, particularly in the Old Town.   
In some towns, they are spread over several areas.  Basel and Lucerne are examples of these.     
Hope this helps in planning your Christmas market visits.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Christmas market reviews	gigetta	Posts: 42

			Yes Le Chable is great access by train, change at Martigny. Also great to avoid queues in Verbier, as the bubble from Le Chable does straight through. Our girls when little loved doing the Royal Wave as we went pass the queuers  We used to rent a flat in Le Chable, but there are quite a few simple hotels at very good rates- but can't recommend any as such. All close to the bubble.   
If you are a beginner it is a long long trek all the way down to the Verbier (can't go down on skis/board to le Chable), with some more difficult passages. Not recommended until you are better and stronger on your board. And whatever you do - DO NOT BE STUPIDLY tempted to do the Tortin Wall run from Lac des VAux down to Siviez until you really know what you are doing.

Both offer decent views, but I still prefer the Niederhorn. You see both lakes, Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau.

			Really very hard without some budgetary guidance and what is important for you.   
And of course, most of us who live here are the worst people to ask because we dont stay at hotels.   
Based on a famous website that give trip advice... I recently recommended the Helmhaus on Schifflände, super central for Bahnhofstrasse, old town etc, modern, fair prices, but no special amenities.  The colleague was very positive about it.

You still get a good view from the top, and if you walk a bit you can improve it. 
I would recommend doing the whole walk, from Felsenegg to the S10 train station...its a great walk and the views along the way are spectacular.

			Leukerbad is fine for all ages, as discussed in this thread:       
for (young) ladies as you I would recommend the Linder Alpentherme, very chic with excellent services. 
and the Clarins Beauty Parlour is miraculous.   
just for swimming in hot water the big Burger therme is really for everyone from families to singles, but lots of young people too.

			Oh dear...perhaps we will have to give Zermatt a miss this time. We were keen to avoid French resorts having experienced them in french/english February half term last year , so thought Switzerland might be an option. Can anyone recommend Swiss resorts that perhaps won't be as busy as Zermatt, but which are still big enough to keep a group entertained for a week (not too fussed about nightlife - just somewhere good for skiing)? We are totally flexible as to location...

			Hey ya'll   
Was planning to get the first ski trip out the way this weekend. The itch has got too much    
Was going to hit up Engelberg, but after weighing up the options have deemed Saas Fee to be of preference due to number of runs open and overal snow cover.   
I have never been before so thats another plus that it is a new resort to venture.   
Just one friend and myself, both skiers, are making the trip from Zurich HB. Looking to get the 6:02am train.   
If anyone has been itching to get up there but hasnt had anyone to go with or simply just wants to come then by all means, join us.   
If it is of any relevance we are both intermediate/advanced type skiers, i.e. we'll pretty much ski anything.   
Here is an interactive map of the area:       
The following runs are open as well as the freestyle park/half pipe etc:     5a   10   10b   18   18a   19   19a   19b  "	null	null	null	Saas Fee_Saturday 17 November	guest	null

			Having skied in several resorts I'd recommend checking out the latest edition of the 'Where to Ski & SnowBoard Guide .(it comes out each year and is unbiased) Not only does it give good objective info on the resorts but you can get a clearer idea of costs and of specific facilities -ie lively nightlife or quiet and picturesque.It also gives details and ratings of the Ski schools and the relative costs of ski passes .For example while Zermatt is a brilliant resort -I would suggest for those who can at least ski red runs -its not cheap and has the most expensive ski pass in Europe I'm told!  
The Guide has a web site and last year's copy -which should be dead cheap  to pick up on Amazon-will give you a good idea.  
Have a great trip .

			I think this is what you need:             
 	 	 		From any airport around the world, your luggage travels directly to  your railway station in Switzerland via Zurich or Geneva Airport. No  matter which airline you fly. This means you arrive at the airport and  your luggage is automatically forwarded to your destination station

			Thanks everyone. Yes, I noticed that antony25's post was a little late to the party, but the information is still valid for future reference    
As for the bikes, we decided to make things a whole lot easier all around and just sell what we have here and buy something else when we arrive. This will cut down on shipping logistics, parking while we look for a place to live and registration / insurance questions can be put off for a while... And of course ""tosser"" will be biased, but what they had in stock looked good and priced right, so it's not a big deal to us.

The bottom part of the beginners' slope is very easy and wide (you can exit the poma lift at several spots before it gets steeper at the top) - with a pizzeria/café at the side, and the ski school, with the majority of instructors who speak English, right there. The great majority of skiers there British, as the Greenwich based Ski Company has it's base just below (seen in the middle at the far end of Sbrinz's link) Or you can park at Plan de Croix (by another Café/restaurant) and take the T-bar (not everybody's favourite lol) on the right- again the top is steep but you can exit before)  or take the very modern 4 (or 5?) chair-lift up to Tour de Don, and the lovely 2 slopes with Poma (button) lifts there. The return to Plan de Croix is via a Black slope - but you can return by chairlift. Fabulous views of Vevey/Montreux and the lake from the top.   
The Glacier at les Diablerets is very gentle too.   
For beginners with a low budget, Les Fourgs near Metabief/Jougne, between Vallorbe and Pontarlier is the best value. Wide, shallow slopes, with the ski hire/ski school at the bottom, with a café/restaurant above (Le Snabeuzi). Very cheap and easy peasy.

The exhibition celebrates the friendship between Pablo Picasso and the American photographer David Douglas Duncan. In 1956, Duncan was a war photographer for Life magazine when he met Picasso in his villa La Californie in Cannes.    
This exceptional exhibition creates a dialogue between some 150 photographs taken from 1956 to 1973 and as many works by Picasso, thus enabling the visitor to dive into the intimacy of Picassos work and research, through a variety of media, such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, drawing and engraving.

			A good place for photographers ( Top of Lugano ):       
Once reaching the top ( Kulm / Vettas ), walk downstairs towards the WC for a great lookout, and then walk upwards towards the Church / Museum for another great lookout, and further on for 4-10min uphill for the best the place has to offer.   
Funicular ticket includes entrance to the Museum ( operates at certain days and hours ).   
To do both cheaply, get the Ticino Discovery Card.       
Enjoy!

			At the risk of being a killjoy, enjoy but take care. Sledging is more dangerous than skiing.  In maybe 6 sledging trips I've been with people who have broken ribs, coccyx and in one case their neck, let alone days of soreness from using muscles they'd forgotten they had.

			I'm wondering if there is a way to go to the tiny lake near Louvie. I checked and it seems at least there is no established hiking route (regardless of difficulty) passing there in any hiking maps. So I guess it is very difficult to get there without really professional equipment (I mean, not just hiking sticks and shoes...)? But from Google earth the terrain between Lac de Louvie and that tiny lake seems not so difficult (e.g. not too steep).

			I agree with Swisspea and would also like to add that Eurail passes are not really a ""saver"" although Eurail does promote them like that. They are moreso a convenience ticket, often referred to as the ""golden ticket"" in blogs since you can jump-off whenever you like without queuing for tickets. A major deal-breaker is that you still have to pay a supplement if you want to travel on fast trains exiting switzerland. Lausanne-Paris TGV for example.    
For Switzerland, get your hands on a ""Half Tax 1 year"" as Swisspea mentioned and when planning travel, check out ""super-saver tickets"" and monthly specials on sbb.com. They have some great offers that will far outweigh the Eurail pass option.

			I have just spent an hour in the amazing Basel shipping museum down the harbor. 
Always wanted to give it a visit but as they close at five not had a chance until now. 
Inside, the usual guff about delivered tonnage and coal imports etc. 
But! There are also little tit-bits of information that I found fascinating. For instance, the Strassbourg to London shipping line, started in 1850, Basel to London, change in Strassbourg until 1936 when the first ships sailing direct London to Basel docked in Kleinhüningen. 
Little land-locked Switzerland has in fact a sea-harbor. 
Imagine, if Big bang II had not happened British EF'ers could be taking the slow boat to Basel right now. 
They have lots of intricate and detailed shipwrights models of Swiss ships, both inland and ocean going. 
There is also a lot on the history of the Rhein and maps and Litho's of the Rhein before it was channeled and tamed. 
A large scale model of the harbor as it was in 1936, one of these things that you can gape over for ages. 
However the Pièce de résistance and well worth the visit alone is a beautiful and ethereal bone ship. 
French sailors made them from bone and wood, both animal and human bone. 
Made by Prisoners of the Napoleonic wars who whiled away the boredom, these bone ships are extremely rare and to fine one in Basel blew me away.

Take the 15 0r 16 tram to the top of Bruderholtz, then walk over the top of the hill and along the farmland track till you get there.     
I am heading there now.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2008	Groaned at 26 Times in 18 Posts	Today in Basel- PUmkin festival	biff	Posts: 2,364

But there will be quite a few places doing this (moving the cows from their summer pastures) in rural areas around about now.   
We had an Alpabzug yesterday in Interlaken.

			The other week, I drove from Blotzheim (where i live) to Delemont in Switzerland, but we took the country roads via Ferrette etc, past Ferrette, it got really quite hilly and bendy, quite picturesque.   I would recommend that.   
Also look at the Vosges mountains, some nice roads around there and its not too far,  just beyond Guebwiller /Thann etc...

			Hey guys,   
It's not really an ad, but might people be interested on that.       
Me and my friends are looking for a place to rent for the whole season (december to april) in Davos.   
So far, we are 8. And we need at least 10.   
Let me know if any of you guys are interested.   
PS: Admins, I posted here linked to the other section because it might be applicable for both situations.

			Refuges are also a bit on the rough side (sometimes no running water or electricity, usually heating is from wood, some dormitories, but some you only have one key, so if it's you well you'll be alone).   
There's a   you can look at.   
We once spent the evening/night in a chalet above the vallée du rhône. We picked up the key from the tourism office in a village (can't remember the name now) then drove 30min, hiked 1h-1h30 and took ""residence"" in this little rustic chalet in a clearing. It was a snowshoe hike, so pretty cold, and it took a long time to heat up the living/dining room. Toilets were in a hut 50m away. There was electricity and cold runnign water and lots of cookery (plates etc, and what you need to make a fondue). It was 10chf/night/person.

1461	15.05.2012, 02:49	Member	Thanked 46 Times in 31 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    As a bit of a fan of railways and railway travel, I have travelled over each of these routes.  If you really enjoy railway travel and are happy with seriously long days, you can probably work out your own itineraries with the SBB online timetable.  What I recommend (starting from the Zürich area), is the following ""bite sized"" chunks.   
Golden Pass (part 1). 
Zürich - Luzern - Interlaken - Bern - Zürich. 
This is a comfortable day trip not requiring too early a start or late a finish, and covers the Luzern - Spiez part of the Golden Pass route.  The Zentralbahn part of the route is scenic part, particularly over the Brünig pass itself.  You can do this on a regular Halbtax day-pass (or a Gemeinde day pass).  If you splash out on 1st class, check the timetable for the Luzern-Interlaken trains with a panoramawagen (indicated by a triangle symbol on the timetable).  There is no special booking required.   
Golden Pass (part 2).  Zürich - Bern - Zweisimmen - Montreaux - Lausanne - Zürich.  This picks up the Golden pass where part 1 left off at Speiz.  The most impressive part of the route is the descent down to Montreaux, with an excellent view over lake Geneva.  Again, this can be done on a regular day-pass ticket.  If you want a seat in the panoramawagen, you need to book this especially, though I've not done this myself, so I can't comment on how easy it is to get.  The regular 2nd class carriages have big windows and a good view anyway.   
Glacier Express. 
You can't really do this comfortably in a day.  If you want to do the full route (Zermatt - St Moritz) on the special panoramic train, I suggest you spend one night in Wallais, perhaps in Brig, and head up to Zermatt in the morning to catch the train, then ride to St Moritz, and stay there (or elsewhere in the Engadinn to keep the price down a bit).  You could then do the Bernina the next day, or just head home.  To ride the special train, you need a regular ticket (which could be a day-pass or a Gemeinde pass), and also a special reservation, which costs something like CHF20.  If you are feeling pro-rail, you can get back to Zürich in the evening from St Moritz (which will also be covered by the day-pass if you use this for the ticket).  I believe it is not possible to get back to Zürich from Zermatt the same day, if you do it that way.   
If you just want to see the view, though, you can do the trip in bite-sized portions that are each possible on regular trains (no supplement required) as day-trips from Zürich.  The route of the Glacier Express connects with the main SBB network in Brig, Andermatt (via Göschenen on the Gotthard line) and Chur.  You can do a single leg (eg Zürich - Bern - Brig - Zermatt and return or Zürich - Bern - Brig - Andermatt - Göschenen - Zürich), or longer portions depending on your personal endurance level.   
Bernina Pass. 
It is possible to do Zürich - Chur - St Moritz - Tirano and back in a day, and there are ordinary trains that accept ordinary tickets without supplements.  There is also a round trip involving a Postbus from Tirano to Lugano that goes around lake Como to make a round trip out of it.  This is entirely covered by a Swiss day-pass, but needs to be reserved (you can do this at any main railway station).  Obviously if you do the Bernina pass route, it involves stretch from Chur to St Moritz, so if you are doing the Glacier Express in parts on the cheap (ie without paying the supplement), obviously you won't need to duplicate this track.   
If you aren't a completionist and just want to have a day out sample trip, I would recommend the Zürich - Chur - St Moritz - Tirano (over the Bernina) as the single best one day trip.  The railway from Chur - Tirano (via St Moritz) is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site, and is quite spectacular.

			The most obvious choice would be the  .   
Having said that, I bought my coverage through my auto insurance provider, Axa.  Breakdown cover is provided as standard in Switzerland, but they extended the coverage through a product called   for all of Europe.  It costs CHF73- per year.   
The one (and only) time I've had to call them, they were superb.

			Last winter, we got bundled up and met with some friends in the woods near Zurich and had a bonfire and sipped spiced wine. Then we walked a few kilometers through the woods, carrying torches, and ended at a really nice and cozy fondue restaurant. It was such a fun night...   
I'll ask my husband later what the place was named, and if he remembers, I'll post it later.    
Would love to do something like that again this winter.

			hope your trip was good.... just in case you head to the area again in the future.... we discovered some really nice places along the way....    
Creux du Van... it is quite a spectacular site... in the canton of Neuchatel, you can walk or drive nearly to it and park your car at one of the 'farmer's restaurants' for instance the 'La Ferme du Soliat' in Couvet. From there you walk for 10 minutes for some stunning panorama!      
Another thing (not for pregnant ladies though) is the champagne tasting in Moutiers. There is the Mauler champagne which dates back to the early 19th century   and for CHF 8 per person you get to see a movie about the history and production and you can taste as many champagnes as you like, for CHF 13 you also get to visit the cellars.    
Enjoy!

But as you say ,most (all? as far as I know) Basel-UK flights are effectively from CH, so you're allowed a proper Duty-free allowance. Some other European flights, particularly within France or with French carriers, may be viewed as internal to the EU, so on those you would not.

			Hi all, 
I am hoping to drive to Interlaken from Basel for some Canoying fun. I have been white water rafting with Outdoor interlaken week before and want to try the canoying stuff.   Would love to have some company. I have a car and can take 3 comfortably. You have to bear the cost of the activity for yourself (approx CHF110). Check their website for details. Weather permitting of course although for canoying a little rain doesn't matter.

I have not done the whole trip, but the view was amazing in the via mala gorge.

			Just to give a short update, we ended up going to the Zurich zoo, and having a grill by the lake afterwards.  The next day headed off to Luzern, played at the Verkehrhaus Museum (that place is awesome), then took the cable car up Mt. Rigi.  We spent the night at a B&B about halfway up the mountain.  I can really recommend this experience, as it was so lovely waking up to the view and being able to go right out and enjoy it!  Took the steamboat back and then some photos around Lucerne's gorgeous old town.  Topped it off with a fondue dinner. (Swiss enough ?   )   
Thanks for all the great tips!

			the boat takes 2 hours but its a nice trip and you can enjoy a nice beer.   
Troubel with the train, is both at SH and SaR, are both some distance from the river, and with an inflatable kayak on your back, its not what I woudl want to do.    
Another option if that is too lomng, stop at Diessenhofen... its sort of half way.   
Personally, I just love the SaR to Sh on my kayak.

			Stayed there in mid July. AMAZING place. Had breakfast (included, very good) and dinner twice, once on the ""inclusive"" option (Halppension in German) which was a 3 course menue with two choices (beef fillet was what we went for), very good but small ish portions. We went a la carte the next night, though more expensive was absolutely fantastic food except for the desert variation, which I found a bit disappointing. Agree that SPA is also good, but infinity pool is really small (compared to pictures online). If weather is good I def recommend hiking from hotel to the Engstling falls (about 2 hrs next to a mountain brook) and then taking the cable car up and walking on the Alm (amazing alpine scenery). Then a bus back to opposite the hotel (both bus and cable car are not cheap though). All in I would def. recommend this place. Have fun!!!!

			[QUOTE=rashoop;1641768]jrspet, biff, and everyone else,       
For those more seasoned than me (and my wife), would you make hotel reservations in advance, or just wing it? The idea of traveling when we are is the primary ""season"" is all but done, and we're hoping for more lodging options, and smaller crowds. OK, not paying peak rates certainly is appealing too  .   
Bob[/QUOTE   
I have rarely booked hotel accomodation in advance, anywhere. Invariably when I have, I have arrived at my destination and found nicer local , little hotels and pensions  but have been stuck with the prebooked venue.  It also takes away the flexibility to stay somewhere on a whim 
or alter an itinerary.    
YOu will certainly be able to find places as you go.    
On the other hand, I am aware that frequently hotels are cheapest to book over the internet.

Price of one place I know if available, 5460 for the Xmas week for max 6 persons, + 200 final cleaning, + 30 per person linen/towels + 210 sauna usage (all CHF) 
no idea of the local tourist tax or if you have to pay, but if you did you pay to the local tourist office 
Hopefully you will find somewhere more reasonable   
Bear in mind you  would need either 4 wheels with winter tires otherwise chains as you will more than likely be travelling in the snow

			Trains between Coppet & Gland are cancelled due to an overhead powerline failure. Passengers need to leave the train and use the extra special buses. The damage happened at 7 am, and will hopefully be repaired around noon, midday. Passengers should allow an extra 15 to 20 minutes for their journey.              
It seems trains are operating OK in the opposite direction, Lausanne -> Geneva.

Your post could not have come at a better time!  We have visitors here in Zürich for the next few days, they are a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 adolescents).  They have visited us before in the 4 years we have been here, so they have been to; the Uetliberg and Planetenweg, Rheinfalls, Rapperswil, Landesmuseum, Alpa Mare, Zoo, Lindenhof, Tiefenbrunnen, Badi Juch (all excellent).   
If you (or anyone else.....) could recommend some other activities, we (and other forum users, I am certain) would be delighted to hear them.   
Thank you

			Hi,   
have lived here circa 11 years and tried most places.   
Since you are looking for good skiing (variety of terrain and levels, with good ski schools), good accommodations, good apres ski and dining options, and accessible by train, the best by far is Davos.   
Flumserberg is also good, and closer, but skiing is less varied, accomodation more limited, no real centre of town as such, apres ski limited, dining limited, but accessible by train.   
Best way to find accomodation in Davos is homegate or go to Davos and check out the small ads in Co-op (Davos Platz). Prices for a one bedroom with a view approx CHF 1100 per month depending on availabilty. Ski pass approx CHF 1200, but includes Flims and Lezerheide (as others have mentioned).   
I wish you all the best,   
W

Apparently, this is the 5th time it is being organized.   
Has anyone been there before? 
The movie sound is via a special frequency on your car radio but would you happen to know if it is possible to choose languages? Or is it German dubbed only?   
Looks cool... 
By the way, there are also some other fun things being organized (models defilé, helicopter tours, potato race...)

			I took a delightful river rafting trip on the Vorderrhein with a river rafting company.   
Positives: 
- Good equipment including neoprene suits, wind jackets, life jackets, boots, and helmuts 
- Gorgeous scenery (rafting through the Grand Canyon of the Switzerland) 
- Not that strenuous 
- Not too much white water but enough to make it exciting even for teenagers   
Neutral: 
- All river rafting staff were from an English speaking country.  Some could speak German, others only spoke English.   
Negatives: 
- The group needs to lift the boat.  That's fine when the group is big but ours was small and I wasn't too keen on straining my back.   
We parked at Reichenau and took the train to Ilanz, where the company was waiting for us with a shuttle bus.  We were taken to the river, where we got our gear, instructions and embarked on our trip.   
Reservations are required.   
River rafting is a lot of fun with a family or group of friends.  All participants must be at least 10 years old.      "	null	null	null	River Rafting on the Vorderrhein	guest	null

- A 1st class ride (top of the boat) from Flüelen to Luzern.

			Don't know about Luzern, but in Zurich there are several places. The flea market at Helvetiaplatz *can* have some lovely stuff - but remains a flea market; the market at Bürkliplatz by the lake is probably more to your tastes, with antique gems between the odd, weird and jumble.   
You'd need to get there around 08:30 to cast your eyes on bargains but I've found several nice pieces - including lamps - for reasonable prices.

			Dear All,   
I started exploring about this Gemainde tageskarte only today. Seems to be agood option. But I have few doubts regarding the booking and usage. I saw a lot of posts in EF related to this. But I would still like to clarify few things.   
I live in Zurich Milchbuck (8057 ). I am not sure which Gemainde I belong to (Is it the Kreisbuero ? ). 
Can I book the tageskarte in any other gemainde and use it . I can see in the below site that Rumlang has 6 cards. I would need it on 14th and 15th next month.    
My friends are visiting my place on those days, they are coming from Germany. Can I buy these cards for them also (Can they also use it or it is only for those registered  ).     
Best Regards, 
VV

			""Auch die Zirkusse Nock und Harlekin präsentierten sich aus Tierschutzsicht erfreulich. Pferde, Kamele, Zebras und Esel geniessen an fast allen Standorten Auslauf und Weide. Der Umgang mit den Tieren in den Manegen dieser Zirkusse ist respektvoll und korrekt.""   
English translation: ""Also the circuses Nock and Harlequin appeared pleasant from the animal protection viewpoint. Horses, camels, zebras and donkeys enjoy exercise and pasture at almost all locations. The contact with the animals in the rings of these circuses is respectful and correct.""   
Much work has been done in recent years to improve the already high standards of animal welfare here in Switzerland and in the UK.  Most of these improvements follow the guidelines laid out by Dr. Marthe Kiley-Worthington in her report commissioned by the RSPCA.  This report was published independently after the RSPCA decided not to do so.     
And some animal activists do not always tell/show the truth.  I remember looking at a copy of BBC Wildlife magazine some years ago which had a photo of a hippo at Circus Knie in his travel box and implying that this was how he was kept when not performing.  I had been to the show that year and know he also had an outdoor area and a water pool he could enjoy whenever he wanted to.

There's some great walking in the Carpathian mountains, and from there you can head down towards the Romanian border.  Or you could head down to the Black Sea resorts, as there's no games down there.

			In Bellinzona there's a little yellow postbus (Number 4 - direction Artore -  ) that runs from just outside the train station and takes you up to the upper castle (Castello Montebello), should save you a bunch of time, the walk down is quite nice, you'll end up in the middle of the old town near the town hall.

			Hi,   
Saturday weather should be perfect.   
Here is my suggestion:   
Cross the mont blanc bridge coming out of the train station (Gare Cornavin) by foot to go on the other side of the lake. Stay in the old town across the lake where you can find all the tourist attraction, i suggest you take the mini train since you have a baby with you and later walk around for your window shopping       
On Sunday, if your up for a quiet tour you can take the United Nations Office tour:    
With the Red Cross Museum just across it.   
maybe someone here is updated on hotel prices but it's high season rate atm due to the fact that a lot of international conferences going on.

			Hey folks,   
As a visitor to Zürich I got helped out by a nice CouchSurfer, who bought me a public transport daypass for Wednesday the 13th. Only problem is, I'm leaving the country by the 12th - a very unfortunate miscommunication.   
With the dayass (Tägeskarte), it is possible to take pretty much all trains, busses, trams, boats and other forms of public transport in all of Switzerland. Hence: if you have a day off, this is for you!   
There's no reason for me to make money off this, but it would be nice if you could pay me the CHF 44 I paid for the ticket. Probably the easiest way of getting it to you is by mail.   
Interested? Text me your address and I'll send you back my details for wiring the money. If you're afraid this is a hoax: feel free to wait before wiring until you received the ticket - in this I'm supposing you're not an a*hole.    
My phone numbers: 
+31 6 44 838 131 (Dutch cell phone) 
+41 77 93 62 315 (Swiss cell phone)   
Hope whoever's going to use it is going to have a darn good time!    
Mathijs

			Did it with my work team  last year in Luzern.   Was quite fun as we went all over the city and outside too, using several forms of transport.   Stopped for a few beers a long the way too!   
I think it would be better in a bigger group than with two people.   We divided our group into three teams, each following different routes around the trail.   That way we could make it into a race, which made it more fun.

			Thank you for the advice all!  I just wanted to update the EF on the conditions at Zermatt.  The Glacier Palace and the last leg of the gondola going up there were closed this past weekend (June 2, 2012); I didn't see any notice on the Zermatt website prior to going there, but then again I wasn't looking for it.     
So we walked across town again to catch the train up to Gornergrat instead.  The views were spectacular.  The cost is 80 CHF round-trip, or 40 CHF if you have the half-price card or other similar transportation deal.  We stayed there for quite a while, just enjoying the view.  The one souvenir shop was closed up there.  There appears to be one restaurant but we didn't go in.    
We did see a wild goat on the side of the mountain, though!  The views of the Matterhorn and the mountain range were wonderful.  Be aware that after around 2pm your photos will be backlit, but still beautiful.  It's a bit like Vancouver but you get to be really close to the mountains after only a 35min train ride, which also offers spectacular views of Zermatt and the Matterhorn.   
Overall we had a great trip and I finished it off with a yummy cheese fondue!

			Hi there.   
Welcome to the forum.   
I am unsure if you know about Reka:     
Your husband is likely to get ""reka cheques"" through work - this is like discounted money which you can use to pay for a variety of things, including train travel and petrol.   
Some places of work offer 1000CHF worth, at either 20% or 33% reduced. 
Ask him to ask his work collogues about the fringe benefits.   
Otherwise these holildays can be paid for with ""real money"".   
You could also team up with a friend, with or without children, to go with you.

			My (US-American) teenage kids will be spending a few weeks with me in Zurich starting about mid-June, and will be left to their own devices while I work. So here's what I was thinking, to get them out of the apartment: organize a photo scavenger hunt, where they have to find things on a list and take a picture of each before going on to the next.    
They'd have to be things that would appeal to a 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old girl, both of whom would rather be at home gaming and watching anime on their laptops. I'd give them a map and they'd probably get some kind of passes for a month for all zones. Oh, and I'd rather they were in places they could enter for free. I've thought of a few things, and a friend has suggested a few too. Of course, there'd be some kind of reward for getting them all. Anybody have suggestions for things to find? They could also be things to do, like ""drink from one of the fish fountains at Bellevue"".   
Another idea I had was a culinary scavenger hunt, separately. So ideas are welcome for that too.

			Our experience is that it's no problem , we have often stayed overnight at many woodland sites where there are fire places with grills set up by the locals ... these are much safer than making your own fire place ..   
have you looked at the ""Schlafen im Stroh"" ? sleeping in hay .. there are many farmers who will let you sleep in their barns for a small fee , they provide a linen sleeping bag and usualy a breakfast if you want it.

			STA travel.  
They have plenty of experience with 'round the world' tickets.   
And as mentioned, I'd look at using a UK travel agent and starting your 'round the world' from London instead of Zurich, as it probably is cheaper.   
I found you a great article online:     
I'd also try Thai airways, because I know they do good deals from Zurich and they are part of the star alliance. Maybe find a Thai airways agency ? I saw one down a side street in Seefeld a couple of weeks ago - but sorry, can't remember the street...

			In the Swiss-German part there are lots of spectacular, nature tours. Last year we visited the Trummelbach Falls (in the valley of 72 falls). First time in our lives we saw numerous waterfalls inside a mountain. It was breathtaking! Also around the area there are many hiking trails.   
There is also the Swiss Italian part: Lugano and Lucarno.  Take the special train  (windows are higher and wider so you see the panoramic view outside)  that will take you through the Cento Valle. The view is beautiful. You will pass and see several waterfalls, deep gorges, thick green forests, etc.

			Dear all,   
I tried to create an event but alas I think I have no permission yet. So I found out there is this event called ""Festival of Nature"" ( ) this coming weekend and there is a free public hiking/walking event of forest or some sort (I just managed to translate the page using google - it seems interesting to me)       
The date is Sunday 13.05.12 and takes place in Lausanne (Chalet-à-Gobet) from 9 - 12 o'clock morning.   
The event is free to join and there are just 8 places left. If anyone is coming along please reply here or send me a PM ok?   
Merci.   
p/s: Would appreciate if someone could post an event for it...

			I have always found this exhibition incredibly boring.   
The organizers seem to go out of their way to make the exhibits as dull and lifeless as possible.   
With proper planning and imagination and some visitor involvement/participation thrown in, the exhibition could be made to be much more interesting. Unfortunately, most stands consist of a few leaflets and a bored representative sitting on a chair.   
I have attended three times now and I will not be going again.

			Hi Guys,   
in early June a friend and i will be hiking across  Switzerland, as part of this we will be taking a hiking path up to  Leutschachhütte SAC and from there the hiking trail ends and we're left  with the step accents to Krönten, Chli/Gross Spannort and Schlossberg.  My question is if there's a reasonable (hard walking, minor climbing but  NOT overly dangerous) route from Leutschachhütte SAC in the valley to  the east to Spannorthütte SAC in the valley to the west which is east of  Engelberg?   
I ask as from satellite imagery shows some rather  large ridges to tackle and possibly glacial ice between the  aforementioned mounts? We will have suitable clothing/weather protection  and walking crampons/poles but no climbing gear (no helmets).   
Any tips most appreciated.   
Thanks.

			There are a couple decent and not so hard climbs in the Grindelwald area. You can climb the Schwarzhorn on the First side or up the Klettersteig Rotstock at the base of the Jungfrau Massif. Both are pretty decent areas and the views are amazing. From there you can shoot strait past Brienze over to the Gothard Tunnel.

			The Jura is great too - go to Nyon then up towards the Col du Marchairuz and walk the ridge in either directions with fabulous views of the Alps. Or over the top and down to Lac de Joux and walk around the lake - and have lunch at La Truite. And of course you have to go to Gruyères- along the lake to Vevey and then up towards Fribourg. From there you can do the loop by Chateau d'oex, and Gstaad, then on and over to Charmey (visit the spa baths) and down to Bulle and back to Vevey.   
Or along the South shore of the Lake to lovely Yvoire for lunch, and visit the Jardin des Sens, and back via Villeneuve and Montreux.   
Or to the spa bath at Val d'Illiez and walking in the Champéry area (take cable car to top) opposite my favourite moutains, the Dents du Midi.   
Or to the Rhone Valley and up to the spa baths at Ovronnaz. Or keep going on to Sion and up to the Val D'Hérens and really cute Evolène and the Arolla Glacier. There are virtually millions of fab places to go from Geneva, in every direction! Enjoy.

			We have two medium size upright carry-on bags that we have lugged around for many years, on smooth and on cobblestoned surfaces. One is WORLDBOUND and the other PIERRE CARDIN. I bought them roughly 8 years ago at Marshalls and Ross in the US. Those shops have very nice brand name suitcases at reasonable prices. They were roughly $60-$80 each. Our bags have big wheels (in hard rubber/plastic material) that do not spin sidewards. On cobblestones do not use bags or suitcases that have small wheels and the ones that spin sidewards. The wheels that spin around are very good on smooth floors like at the airport but not on cobblestones. Good luck on finding better quality suitcases with sturdy wheels!

			Hi, 
as far as I know, guides take no more than 2 people (it makes  sense, either you want safety and pay, or risk your life over few  bucks). Even most experienced guide will not save 5 people falling at the same time on glacier.  
Local guides ARE the guides taking up the people usually  
But it would be interesting to know if there are reliable services being offered below official prices. We are also planning trip there in beginning of july

The view from the top looking down on Zurich is also beautiful. There a nice restaurant at the top and if is sunny and blue skys you can see miles.  Take the Uetliberg bahn from Zurich main station.

			Definitely stop off in Montreux (coming down from Bern just head over towards Vevey, i.e. more East towards the Valais) and get a Kebab ""Bani-Bane"" with chicken at Paradise. It's a big restaurant right in the center of Montreux, loads of bike spots across the road. Best Kebab in Switzerland!!!

			One of our favorite walks starts in Croy (about 1h train ride from Geneve) with a walk up to see the quaint village and gorgeous monastery at Romainmotier.   
Then we walk along  , following a small river for the most part, and pass by two nice peaceful waterfalls*, ending up in La Sarraz (where there is a castle to visit, if you wish). In La Sarraz right next to the train station, there's also a decent place with an outdoor terrace and a nice view to reward yourself with a panache or whatever.   
In the area, there's also a loop  featuring different water fountains (see #4).     *This map doesn't include the second waterfall. Follow signs (very well signposted) to Ferreyres a little while after the first waterfall.

			I have done the Jungfarujoch trip once as a day trip from Basel, with a visiting friend.  Yes, there is room to throw a snowball.     
When we were there, there was also a short slope where one could go down sitting on a round plastic disc - hardly a great toboggan run, but acceptable for people who have never been in the snow before.    
On a clear day you can stand in the outside snow area and take photographs of each other from various angles, with a choice of three different mountain peaks in the (real) background.

			If the weather is fine, train from Wilderswil to Grindelwald, (make sure you get on the right end of the train or you can find yourself doing the trip in reverse), to Grund, cable car (gondola) to Mannlichen, approx 20 minutes, wonderful panoramic views from Mannlichen and plenty of hiking trails if required, or down to Wengen by Gondola and back to Wilderswil by train via Lauterbrunnen. This is a round trip and can take the best part of a day if required.

			It's definitely one of the moat dramatic locations to go hiking in the Jura mountains, you won't be disappointed. If it is a clear day then as well as the stunning cliff faces and region, there will be great views across a large part of western Switzerland and the Alps behind.

			At this time of year, I doubt that you will have any problems. I have never had any problem with just arriving and pitching a one person tent, even in the height of the summer school holiday period. The only shortage tends to affect people who have large caravans and/or are wanting a spot with electricity.    
But, I don't know when the season opens here. I have cycled and camped through parts of France before, at Easter time, and was surprised to find that many camping grounds were not open for the season - I think the first weekend of May was the opening time for manym with the end of September being the end of the season.

			We are very lucky in Neuchatel as Easter Friday is always a Bank Holiday, as well as Easter Monday. Which other K/Cantons have Friday off?   
If you want to join in an Easter Egg race with the children, either go to:   
Buttes/La Robella (NE) egg (chocolate) finding races will take place at 10 and 11, and a massive race for all at 14.30. Lots of activities for kids, food, and free access to the Feeline big luge run. 5CHF for adults, 2 for kids, and free fro 5 and under. Only about 200m from the train station. About 35 mins from Neuchatel or Yverdon.   
Another egg race will take place at Fribourg Botanical garden, on Saturday 7th  at 14.00, meet by the fountain Chemin du Musée.   
From 7th to 9th April  10-18.00 at the Musée du Fer near Vallorbe (VD)    - there will be a Festival des Couteliers/cutlers festival. All about knife and sword making from all over the world, with demos, etc. 
Adults 12CHF, children 6, family 27CHF   
And on Sunday there will be a big Easter market in Chateau d'Oex (VD), with demos of local traditions, farm animals, donkey rides, Swiss fighting, grass scooters, wood carving and local foods.   
In Payerne a big Brocante both Friday and Sat 10.00-20.00 and Sunday 10.00-18.00.

But is sure looks a lot like the Matterhorn on the packaging, so if the Matterhorn is to fall, they should change the packaging out of respect.

			Cinque Terre sadly had massive and terrible floods and landslides last autumn, so I wouldn't go there now without checking what the situation is.   
But Tuscany is beautiful in June, with the poppy fields and wild flowers - fly to Florence, or Pisa or Rome, hire a car and just take a right or a left - and see where it takes you- and go to the sea for a few days but water might not be warm enough for you - it was 19C and we swam a lot last year in June. Or take a ferry to Elba for a few days. Not busy at that time of year, no need to book - just enjoy. I'd advise the less busy towns of Pienza and Montepulciano, but also San Gimignano and Lucca in the North. Or just drive there - you'll be in Lucca in a day - or do what we do, stop for a night in Etroubles/Aosta area - again no need to book.

			HOw active are you? your friends? A novel way to see Basel is to do a guided running tour ( speed adjusted  for individual groups) through the centre.     
They are fun, with lots of quirky Basel information throughout the tour. ( you jog, stop, all the way. )   
OR: The weather is great at the moment, so how about a round the bridges walk, to see Basel from both side s of the river. Go between the MIttelbrucke and Westeinbrucke, or even up one more bridge. Take in the Tuingley museum and any of the numerous outdoor cafes along the way.   
OR: use bikes and go on a ""3 country tour"" between Basel, France and Germany. If it is a Saturday, include the St Louis vegetable market and a look at the whitewater kayaking in HUningue. there is a relaxing cafe just over the walking bridge, on the german side.    
HOt day? go for a swim down the Rhine.

			I asked some work colleagues this week where was best to go for cherry blossom near Basel and they told me between Kandern and Niedereggenen in the Schwarzwald (Germany) or Schönenbuch (near Allschwil).  I haven't been, so it's a bit of a drive from Zurich for an untested recommendation, but just thought I'd chuck that in there.

			All my favourite places have been mentioned already, but here are some more votes for them    
I agree that Beaune is very nice, however you can quickly run out of things to do as you can see everything in a day quite easily. Just south of Beaune is Chalon-sur-Saône, which is a bit bigger and is on the river. (it has a great street festival in July). Careful where you stay in Beaune as the main TGV line runs through the town.   
Lyon is fabulous, plenty of cheap eateries and plenty of cheap accommodation. You'll never get tired of Lyon if you like to eat  . Also consider getting the train there, for an even more relaxing weekend.   
Alsace is wonderful also, and another vote goes to Riquewihr although all the little villages west of Colmar are treasures.   
The French do love to eat out, much more than the Swiss, so the one thing I always do is book restaurants before I go. Rocking up to a lovely restaurant (not necessarily an expensive one) and sitting down at a reserved table sure beats the ""walk of shame"" when you're turned away because the place is full   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2011	Groaned at 48 Times in 23 Posts	'Budget' weekend getaway from Suisse romande: any ideas!?

in these valleys, the most interesting trails are the ones that usually are better condition, so that's a first good point. Scenic features are what will make your trip memorable IMHO (unless you are just planning to waste time?).

			My friend told me there is a ABC design factory shop in ALBBRUCK Germany. It is about 45km from ETH Honggberg Zurich. The problem is my husband and I can't drive and if we take the public transport we need to walk 5km distance, which is a little bit far for a pregnant woman . If anyone need to buy kinderwagen in reasonable price, I think it is a good chance to have a look there. So If someone can drive and want to go there, would you please take us? We can share the cost of car fee. By the way, the shop is open on the first Saturday every month, so it will be open 7th of April. Thanks!

Eitherway, check out this site for information about local hikes in your area:     
It'll have everything you need to get started.

			I would rent a car. You can go and come when you please, get to places faster and go to less accessible destinations. Never really understood people's passion for the train/ bus options. Doesn't save money and certainly doesn't save time. You will get to more places in less time by car.

			Thanks for all your help. We looked at the wanderland site, and are probably going to follow one of the trails on there. While it doesn't follow the lake exactly the whole way, and we'd only go halfway around, it would probably be a nicer hike than just blindly walking along the edge haha.    
Another question, though: anyone know any good (cheap) places to rent camping/backpacking gear in Geneva? Just things like sleeping bags, maybe tents.

They tend to leave about 8.15am, back about 6.30 - 1hr to 1hr30 each way depending on resort. I was in Avoriaz last Saturday, and Flaine on Sunday, lots of snow still in both, great skiing!    
They are popular though, so get your tickets a couple of days in advance if you want any choice.    
Details and timetable here:   - choose ""Ski Pass and Transportation"" from the drop down box in the bottom right corner.    
They don't go to all resorts everyday that they list in this though, being French, they seem to randomly pick where they will run buses to any particular weekend :P Buses are scheduled to keep running for another few weeks though, so time yet to get your skiing fix in!

			The Canary Islands almost guarantee warmth and sunshine. (But not always). I was on Tenerife in November.

			We always liked the Hotel Alpenruh in Mürren - one of the highest car free villiages.   
You can take the lift up to Schilthorn, where they filmed the James Bond movie and the views of the Alps are magnificent.   
The next day, you can take the bus (or long walk) to Trümmelbachfälle - glacier waterfalls from the Mönch, Eiger and Jungfrau, part of the UNESCO World Heritage sites.   
Enjoy!

			The price difference is certainly down to economies of scale, American are one of the biggest operators of aluminum birds, but their international reputation is very average. Swiss is better in every aspect except price. It's a no brainer if price is your only criteria, but if you want efficient service, better food and more modern IFE (In Flight Entertainment), Swiss's modern Airbus fleet will beat AA's aging B767s every time.

I've walked from the station once. You have got to cross to the opposite side of the road, there is a underground pass that will lead you there. Once there, you have to climb up a very steep hill right to the top.   
After the seemingly endless climb, you will see some residences & from there, you'll be able to find your way to the farm. (may need to ask for the direction cos I can't remember the turns but it is fairly easy after the steep climb.)   
Have lots fun...with the slope. :P

			We visited that area a few weeks ago with our kids and a group of friends. We rented a chalet about 5-10 minutes drive from Morzine (15-20 to Les Gets). My preference would be for Les Gets (less crowded than Morzine) and good for younger children if you want to stay in a town.  
We travelled to a different area each day either by car or bus and skiied from one resort to another. Depends what you want from your holiday.

			September is usually pretty good...  the only problem is that after about the middle of the month, the huts start closing.  Last week of August/first week of September, or the first two weeks of September, would be an excellent choice in my opinion.   
I have probably jinxed the weather by saying this of course... must now remember not to book my holidays for that time  .

			Hi   
We have just had a friend cancel joining us for our ski holiday before Easter. Apparently school is not out in Zurich. We are hence looking to fill two rooms one twin and one double in Verbier (3 mins walk to Savolyres) and driver available for pick ups at our fully catered chalet.   
Our ideal (but not essential) would be to have a couple join us who have children of an age around 10-15 yrs old which will be roughly the same as the two boys we have (both are educated in Germany but speak good English and Italian).   
The chalet details are listed here:    
As a last min deal can offer both rooms for £1,250 for the week , as i say this includes meals-dinner, breakfast and tea and wine except chalet person day off.    
Please PM me if you are interested and we can go from there.

			I popped in at the Kunsthaus yesterday evening to see the current ""Wintermärchen"" exhibition on images of winter from the middle ages to modernism. I wasn't expecting anything breathtaking, just a lot of snowy landscapes by minor genre painters... besides I find the timing completely wrong, by now we are all more in the mood for spring than for winter I would say. but as a convinced holder of a membership card and living in the vicinity, I do go there quite often, just to relax and be reminded of beauty.   
I must say was pleasantly surprised, so I wanted to share. There are quite a few major artists including Brueghel, Monet, Goya and even the super famous heroic Napoleon portrait by David from the Belvedere in Vienna 
But guess what? in the end I found myself stopping even longer in front of the minor genre paintings admiring the beauy of detail in rendering the particular light and changes of nature in winter. 
There are not only paintings but also tapestries and luxurious baroque sleds from the austrian empire (one even in leopard skin - possibly fake, anyway impressive ).    
All in all a great exhibition to take the kids, too! they will love the skating and sledding scenes, the fires and children playing in the snow. even a perplexed little boy dringking from a freshly slaughtered pig's bladder (don't worry, no gruesome scene involved ). or an angry woman fetching her drunken hubby home from the pub... 
the explanations are as usual very clear and really help put the whole theme into context. all in all a very pleasant evening even if you're a not an art freak!

The museum is listed at being open Wed-Sun between 1630 and 1800hrs this time of year. I guess the marketing of mass tourism has not reached the area yet.  :-)

			If you are travelling round at the weekends it pays to know which places are hosting their carnivals. Its pure bedlam on the transport front.

This weekend the weather is perfect for snowshoeing and winter hiking in the south east.

I suppose some weeks are much more crowded than others- we would always go off-peak. My comment though was mainly about the amazing view- and the mix of ski and spa. Going there again in a few weeks, so will report back. The apartment we had was huge and very well appointed, with huge balcony and views- and as said above, you can access the baths all 'in house' in your dressing gown and slippers.   
Skiing in Leukerbad is actually very good- we had a brilliant week of powder there 2 years ago. Leukerbad has several different pools and spas- the most famous being the municipal one, not attached to any Hotels- and the Alpentherme, which has a Hotel but is very expensive.

			we've done 5 flights with our 5 month old already, with another international trip coming up next week, and the one thing I can definitely tell you is each one is a little bit different    For all the flights, I have had my hubby with me, so this is what I have found works when there are two of you. If there is only one, then travel light - get as much on the other side as you can from friends if you can!   
- get to the airport early so you can go to the counter to check in and deal with an actual human who can tell you all kinds of wonderful things like if the plane is not full and there is an empty seat that they will happily give you for the little one, or if the airport that you are changing flights at will bring the stroller to you or if it will go straight through to the next flight - all are different. Most airports have family areas - ask when you check in where it is and you can have a place to go where there is at least a clean change table and usually some other little ones for yours to watch or, as they get older, play with to pass the time saving those precious few items you could fit into the bag with you for the actual plane ride.    
- we have a car seat that attaches to a quinny stroller, so it is very light weight and compact when broken down. We have been able to take the car seat onto the plane with us 2 of the 5 flights - once as there was an empty seat so we could plunk the little guy into his very own seat without being charged for it, the other time we could just put it up in the overhead bin as it folded down and the bins were big enough. The other times, the planes were a bit smaller so the bins couldn't fit the seat, so it was checked at the gate with our stroller - and as it is put in a special place in checked bags, it seems to be a bit safer as no scratches have appeared. We also have always needed a car seat on the other end, so it was a must to bring.    
- pillow - I have a boppy breast feeding pillow so it's small enough to wrap around my sides and still fit in an airplane seat, but I know most people over here have the super long pillows that won't quite work. However, if you bring a stroller, you can easily slide a normal pillow under it so you aren't carrying it and it has proved to be a life saver on the flights when we didn't have the car seat or bassinet. No one bats an eye at it as an extra piece of carry on luggage, so don't worry about that. The little guy ate on the way up, fell asleep and just slept there for most of the trip. made it a bit awkward to eat, but hubby and I took turns eating so I could just use his tray to keep things on and for once it helped that airlines serve all food items in a number of little dishes    
- security - have one of you deal with the stroller and baby and the other deal with the actual carry on bags - especially so you don't forget to tell them that you have formula or even breast milk in bottles! As long as you tell them, they let you bring whatever is reasonable for the length of the flight and 1-2 extra feeds for the other side. If you forget, then they might ask you a million extra questions.    
And don't feel like you have to rush!!  It is the nature of the event that you feel sorry for everything, but reality is, you ARE going to take a bit longer but you absolutely need to stay calm and not get flustered otherwise little one will start to wonder what the problem is and really make it a problem. Just relax, you are not the first person to fly with a baby. If they cry, they cry - do what you normally do to calm them down. For some, the airplane noise is a wonderful sleep inducer, for others, they have no idea what is going on and need to be reassured that much more - you stressing about them crying will only make things worse as they will wonder what really is wrong since you are all worked up too!

			Perfect, just get the Tracouet local pass. Lots of small easy runs at the top, and then by the end of the week you can go down the back to the lovely wooden chalet restaurant- or do the nice wide piste down towards the resort, and up the ski lift half way- or all the way down and up again on the bubble. Enjoy.

Excellent advice! Also my favourite place (we spend each summer at Rigi Kaltbad). Just a clarification.   
The cable car from Weggis only goes as far as Kaltbad. Here you have to get off and transfer to train. If you take the cable car at 20 mins past the hour, it connects with the train going on up to Kulm. The cable cars run at 20 past and 50 past.   
An excellent (and very Swiss) place for something to eat is Hotel Edelweiss at Staffelhohe. The food is locally sourced (ie Mount Rigi and surrounding lower level villages) where possible and the young couple who run it are charming.   
There are a lot of sledge runs and you can rent sledges from Kulm or Kaltbad so only need to make up your mind about sledging when you get there. Otherwise there are a lot of prepared winter walking routes .. all very accessible without special snow shoes. You will get a leaflet when you buy your cable car tickets, it shows all the trails.   
And why not get to Weggis by boat from Luzern? 40 mins. Check the timetables as the winter season is not very generous.   
And even better .. go when Weggis is shrouded in low cloud and experience the amazing moment in the cable car when it breaks through the cloud cover and out into brilliant sunshine.  Look at the webcams and weather forecasts on   and it is quite easy to work out days like this.

			Well it's personal preference of course, but personally I think there are so many better places to go than Interlaken.. lol   
Though lake thun is close by, and I think it is sooo beautiful. They also have a castle there with an exceptionally beautiful forest with all kinds of trees.. it's like a fairy tail! I definitely recommend you going there. If you're interested I can find out where it was exactly.

			That's interesting, they refused sell us tickets when they saw the pram and asked how old our baby was. I know it's because of the higher risk of altitude sickness and lower oxygen.

			We were there last year and I was rather embarassed in the beginning 
but I got over it when I noticed that the men and women there were 
so mature about being naked and it all seemed so natural.The part that 
did freak me out was going to the 'sleeping room' at the end where a young 
guy wrapped us up in a sheet and blanket on a bed so we could relax..the young bloke was very professional though as though he was used to seeing  
every age,shape and size in their birthday suits.  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Friedrichsbad - Baden Baden	ZurichSwissMiss	Posts: 96

			Kandersteg is a very good place to start - we went there 2 years ago in March as a beginner (I'm 60) and were very impressed - visit the Ski Schule in the town and you should end up at Oeschinensee...there is a webcam you could look at meantime

			I went hiking up in Muerren (in the Berner oberland) a few weeks ago in the snow - I didn't have snowshoes, just some nice waterproofed hiking boots.  Those along with some snowpants, a winter jacket, and a good hat kept me toasty    It was actively snowing, so my husband bought one of those face masks as well to keep his face warm.  Have fun!

			Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I had to share about a wonderful place we spent Christmas holiday.        
It was about 60 km outside of Geneva. Caroline the hostess was simply wonderful - we went for the catered chalet option - there were 13 of us - a bunch of my family converged from the US and Scotland. Caroline is an amazing chef and the Chalet was delightful and in a beautiful town called Samoens in France. There were 6 kids under the age of 12 and she catered to the kids tasted for dinner and the adults had wonderful cuisine for dinner. I can't recommend it more highly as a vacation spot      
We went for a ski holiday - I'm not a skier so it was a great place to learn b/c there were green beginner slopes I don't think they have here in CH. The expert skiers amongst also had a blast. There was something for everyone! Got great private ski lessons from Zig Zag Ecole at Caroline's recommendation.

			Many (?) - some? - Swiss have a real passion for the US ""Wild West"" and Americana-style stuff.   
It is nothing new and was well documented in the books I read when I moved here a while back. One example is in the silly cars they import (i.e. not suitable to European roads).

I come from Portugal and my girlfriend is living in London so I would like to take her on a more rural/heidilike trip as she enjoys the nature a lot and misses it in London.   She came once in Autumn and we visited the Leman area, including Gruyeres and the vineyards, and she loved it. Now I wanted to go somewhere special and different and was thinking of the Alps and to go somewhere where we can enjoy the views of the swiss panorama.    I have seen that the forecast for this weekend is not good L so I believe that I will need to focus more on the weather than on the place I have heard that sometimes, even if it is cloudy, on the top of the mountains it is good weather and you can still enjoy a nice view. Where can I find out about this to choose the destination?

			The trip was excellent.  
The view from the top of the mountain, with only snow around, clouds in-front of you and mountain peaks beyond them. Amazing !! 
It was like the view which you seen from outside the window of an airplane while passing over the Alps. But in this case, it was like someone put you in one of those mountains and you can stay there soaking in the beauty around. 
Would recommend people to go there..  
Also, the trip from Lucerne involves a boat ride and a mountain train and both of them are included in the 'day pass' area so you needn't pay anything extra. Total value for money !

			Evolène in the Val d'Hérens above Sion would be lovely for a romantic Christmas. A very old village, real Heidi style, with lots of excellent value restaurants. We like the Restaurant Central - lovely fireplace, oldie worldie chalet style dining room and excellent steak + excellent value. Have some vin chaud, they make it with white wine in Evolène, surprisingly good. Train to Sion and bus up (buses wait right next to station). Wonderful.   
And for an extra 60 CHF for 2 with breakfast,  stay in a lovely old-fashioned traditional hotel, built 1901 - all wood inside- simple but sooo cute and really friendly owners. Evolène is Switzerland as it used to be - enjoy it because it won't last (sadly).

			Yeah it sounds like too  much, why not just head out east - you can go out through munich, prague, krakow,, then back through budapest, vienna, croatia, slovenia  ... would give you more like 3-4 days in each. Otherwise you only get a day or two in each, so with travelling time you hardly get to see anything. also everything is so cheap out around poland, so you can do a bit more, and you get a mix of scenery, beach and mountains.

			I agree with previous comments regarding Sorenberg. Great place and easy to get to on public transport from Luzern.   
Lots of picturesque, forested run and the good think is that they all run relatively parallel so there is no hiking about to get on another run.

			My wife and I took the Bernina Express last weekend and enjoyed it very much. We stayed overnight in the Bernina Hotel, just opposite the train station in Tirano. I'm not sure if it's possible to take the journey there and back on the same day, though I would imagine it's possible. Having said that, 8 hours on a train with kids in tow doesn't sound like much fun to me.   
There is no buffet car, but on the outward journey someone came around quite early in the journey with a basic refreshments cart. Just around the corner from Chur HB is a Migro zentrum which is open early in the morning (at least on the Saturday morning when we travelled), so you could stock up there before boarding. On the return journey, there were no refreshments, but we took a slightly different train which was still part of the Bernina Express service, but it went to St. Moritz and we had to change train in Pontressina and Samedan to get back to Chur.   
One word of advice, don't forget your sun glasses because the sun is very bright up on the pass.

			Alas this year we will be having a very quiet family day. But I can recommend Salzburg as a Christmas destination. 
We spent a week there last year and it was truly fabulous. The Christmas markets and lights were incredible and the kids loved the horse and carriage ride around the altstadt. For me though, the highlight was visiting the Silent Night Chapel on Christmas Eve. It had a real magical feel.   
Enjoy the time together whatever you do.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Jul 2009	Groaned at 3 Times in 3 Posts	What are you doing for Christmas?	nic80	Posts: 803

Could anyone suggest any good places to visit in the winter season ?

			Right,   
Newbie on the forums, but I'll chime in nevertheless. Zermatt, Glacier Express and Lugano you can connect seamlessly, if you take Glacier Express from Zermatt to St. Moritz, and Bernina Express to Lugano (or other direction, of course). Zermatt you either love or hate, and the only way to find out is to go there.  
I am doing pretty much the same itinerary in February with the PiLs, but both me and them are train fans, so the transportation is not an issue but rather a reward itself.   
If you're into train travel across postcard sceneries then you can't go better than that, although traditionally Lugano is mostly recommended to visit during the seasons more compatible with Italy, at least for the first time. (Although I would love to get some feedback from fellow Luganesi about the area during winter time).    
I'm not a Paris enthusiast at all, however, if I remember correctly there used to be a direct TGV connection from Brig to Paris, although I am not immediately succeeding in finding it. Even if it was not direct, you shouldn't have problems reach Gare de Lyon in about 7 hours from Zermatt, perhaps one more hour from St Moritz.   
Hope that helps somewhat.....

			Took my 4, 7, and 10 year olds last year.  Start early, as it's a big event.  Santa was a class act and it's true what they say - he's good at languages.  He really took his time to connect with each child.  Don't get stranded at the train station at Caux, I think it was, like we did though.  The bar scene that evening was, well, interesting.  My daughter rightfully noted that if that scene had been in a movie, she wouldn't have been allowed to watch it until she was grown and moved out of the house!

			You don't give us any details of the type of things you like to do, so that would help. Agree 100% with Salzburg, which is def. reachable for a weekend and would make a great place to spend one or two nights. If you get away early enough on Friday you can reach Salzburg (assuming no snow and using the Arlberg tunnel) in five hours, which would allow you to get in for a late dinner and then an evening wandering the streets of the Altstadt.    
If you had a long weekend, Vienna is the obvious destination, but more of a flight than a drive. The stretch from Salzburg to Wien is long, straight and boring. That said, if you are wine lovers &/or foodies, the Wachau and the other wine regions around Vienna offer some of the best of those wine/food thingies in all of Europe.    
If you are skiers / hikers, then Arlberg is a great place to spend a weekend and offers something for almost every budget (Montafon is pretty easy on the wallet, St. Anton a great mid-range place if you are into both ski and apres ski, and Lech/Zuers can break most people's monthly budgets over a champagne-filled weekend).    
There's a lot more on the list: St. Johann in Tirol for family skiing, Kitzbuhel for a taste of the Munich ""schikeria"", Burgenland, Neusiedlersee, the Donau, etc. etc. Personally, I'd give Innsbruck a miss.

			We had my parents visit and had a fixed day that we could travel on so we got the Day tickets 'Tageskarte-gemeinde' in Basel for 38 Chf each and then looked at the weather on the day to decide where to go.     
Our main options were Interlaken (for jungfraujoch), Pilatus or Zermatt/Gornergrat.  The weather on the day was rain for Interlaken and Pilatus and glorious sunshine for Zermatt/Gornergrat so that's where we went - and they loved it.     
With this ticket the day is fixed but not the destination and you can use the trains, trams, buses and some boats.  It also gives you half-price on the mountain railways.  If the weather is bad all over you can pick a destination with indoor appeal - like a city with shops/museums or just ride the trains all day!!

			The time between late October until middle of December is not considered as a great tourist or hiking time. Fewer guests mean that running it will make even more of a deficit than usual so it is a great chance for the yearly check-up for safety and replacements.

1903	09.11.2011, 20:35	Member	Thanked 87 Times in 52 Posts	Location: Zürich, Zumikon	"    Correct. I live in Basel and fly often from Zürich, using the ""Air Train"". SWISS has no way of knowing whether you've used the train segment or not -- and the best bit is, you get Miles & More points for the train journey (whether you use it or not, since SWISS doesn't know) if the flight ticket as a whole is eligible for Miles & More points.   
Baggage check-in and collection is done at Zürich Airport. As snoopy1664 said, if you do want to use the train segment, be sure to check in online BEFORE you travel from Basel and print your boarding passes or get them delivered to your phone -- otherwise you will have no train ticket and will be liable to a fine (I've seen it happen). There is almost always a ticket inspection on the Basel-Zürich HB or Basel-Zürich Flughafen trains.   
And finally, as planetali commented, if you want to use the train, you don't have to use the Basel-Zürich Airport direct service. In fact, it's never the fastest option -- the non-stop train to Zürich HB, then appropriate connection to Zürich Flughafen, is always faster but involves a change.

Eventually, for us it was the best solution. We bought a tent, two sleeping bags, hiking shoes, and lots of oder outdoors stuff... and YES, it was WORTH the trip.     
In Zürich you have an option... get a tent for above 1K chf, which I don't neglect might be high quality but ... 1K

			Neusweinstein Castel 2 hours north-east of Zurich, in Bavaria, is nice. Easy drive and yo can stay for the night. If you plan to go let me know because I have a recommendation for a great little hotel, near the castle... hard to find on websites, though.

			I lived in Lyon for 5 years, and I went to the Fete des Lumières twice. You have to know that it is really crowded, especially around place des Terreaux, Bellecour and Hotel de ville. Last time I went, we couldn't even walk, we were stuck in the crowd and force to go wherever the crowd would go. Never again.   
Initially, the Fete des Lumieres was december the 8th. It is now 4 days long, but most of the Lyonnais still light up their candle on the 8th. That is really beautiful. Every windows has lot of small candles, it is magic.   
Last year, I went  to see the Parc de la tete d'or installations, and it was really nice. There was fire everywhere, and don't how they manage not to burn the parc down !   
Anyway, if you don't like crowded places, don't go, it will ruin the magical. But if you don't mind, then go ! And Lyon is indeed a nice city !   
But remember, Lyon isn't switzerland ! Watch your belongings !

			We are driving from Basel to the Dolomiti on Friday (21 Oct) and are looking at 2 routes - the motorway through Austria or the scenic route via Klosters/Davos towards Bolzano, IT.   
The weather reports and webcams show that the sceninc route had snow last night.   
It would be great if someone in the area could let us know the conditions of the roads around the Davos area.  We have our Austrian Vignette so can take the motorway but we'd prefer the mountain views.  We are leaving Basel about 7:30am and have plenty of time so the only concern with the scenic route is safety and making sure the roads are open.

			the area where I live that is. Born and bred here in the Neuchatel Jura, back now with my British OH after 40+ years in the UK. It's lovely to be back and we would like to discover the rest of Switzerland, but money is a bit tight now on UK pensions due to exchange rate. And anyway, visiting an area with locals, even if adopted, is so much more interesting. I know all the best places around here, be they walks, restaus, Museums or other attractions - and would love to share them with others. We are in our 60s, but young at heart, so age unimportant, families welcome.   
So how about swaps. Not swapping houses in the 'traditional' sense, but co-hosting. If somebody would like to get to know another area- and woud be prepared to show us where they live- that could be fun. For us it can be week-end or week days. All is required is a simple but comfortable spare room. We can offer a very large double en-suite- and another if somebody has children. No dogs as our own elderly dog is jealous as hell of other dogs. On a 1, 2, 3 basis- we cook the first night, we go to a local restau (all budgets and style avalaible) and if you stay longer, you cook the next meal (btw we live a few minutes from France for shopping) and so on.   
Anybody interested?   
Cross-country and downhill skiing in winter available (equipment hire nearby), a whole array of interesting Museums, fab walks, absinthe tours, nearby France, etc.

			Hello,   
I have checked both AirBnB and VRBO for holiday homes that are in the German speaking region and not a ski chalet in the mountains, but have only found maybe one suitable one for a family of 5 to rent to get an idea of what life MIGHT be like if we moved to Switzerland. We will go first in April for 1 week then again for 5 weeks in June/July. That will be our second and third dates. We have to go on more dates before we get engaged, but this is a start.   
Just found also homeaway.com . Not too bad.    
Are there any German language ones or others that Swiss use or any other way like an agency?    
Thank-you so much for your help.

			Of course it is normal for a double being more extensive than a double> It's not just breakfast, it is an extra bathrobe (those thick ones will need a wash on their own) and extra towels. At least they give a fair discount on a double - most hotels around here are much cheaper than this B@B, but a double is twice the price of a single.

Anyway, at this one you can watch the cheesemaking progress as it happens, done on a very small scale, so no 'tour' and no cost involved, unless you want to buy cheese or anything else from the shop.    
I'd not think it worth a trip in itself, but together with the rest of the town and the monastery itself it makes a good day out.

Scenery was fantastic and we have the videos to prove it :-) Sheltenpass was als o a good day out at the begining of the season, our biggest group this year with 17 bikes :-)

			It is basic but a real personal favourite - I've found the staff to be genuinally (spelling?) warm: the Glattbrugg Bahnhof or Bahnhof Glattbrugg.  They have space for car parking round the back i.e. out in the open but if you check, you can put it in the area covered by the cameras (although I parked my car there when I bought it over from England with 40"" lcd in the back etc. without any issue at all.  Also, it is a 7 minute tram ride from the hairport...   
It backs on to the Glattbrug railway station and you have trains every 1/2 hour into Zurich HB.:

			The fliegermuseum in Dübendorf is always worth a visit, but only if it does not take too much of an effort to get there. The dinosaurmuseeum in Aatal near Wetzikon is very well visited by families an the kids will be flabbergasted, but it does not explain scientific findings. You could visit both because they are not far away from each other.       
Another very popular Museum, well visited by Families. It is crowded on bad weather weekends.     
Definetely worth a visit is the Transportmuseum, but it is in Luzern    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Dec 2009	Groaned at 572 Times in 370 Posts	Museums	lost_inbroad	Posts: 10,240

			We travel with our son, who has type 1 diabetes, and I can't say it takes any longer to get through security - we have a letter from our doctor explaining the medication and equipment, and that we are carrying additional supplies plus it must be carried as hand luggage.   
I guess the USA is tough (I haven't been there but have heard plenty of stories) but we didn't find it raised any eyebrows in Heathrow, Singapore, Paris, Barcelona or Birmingham airports.   
The only one where we had to unpack everything was singapore, and it was a senior staff instruction a new staff member, and by their manner (the singaporean was formal but polite) it really was for the new staff training purposes (he was talking her through the procedure) rather than because they were querying the gear.   
Hope that helps. The main thing in my opinion is to stay calm, precise, and have a 'can you help me' attitude. I always go to the first staff member on the security counter and say ""oh, we have diabetes gear in here - do you need to see it?"" - usually they just wave me through and everything goes through the scanner.   
I have heard of kids with pumps being asked to unplug them and put them through the scanner - I'm not sure if that's a problem for the pump, but I'm sure by now there are enough insulin pumps around that the security team should be able to recognise one if they saw it...

			Sure I posted about this last year too!   
But I'm a big fan so anyway the Mathis Hof (in Bottmingen just outside Basel) Pumpkin Festival is on this weekend (24th and 25th September) if you fancy popping along for some Kurbis-everything. There are hundreds of varieties of pumpkin for sale as well as other farm produce including schnaps and preserves. There's lots of fun activities for kids as well - a Maize maze, straw castle, kids can carve or draw on a pumpkin and hit each other with pillowcases of feathers....! It's worth it if the weather is nice. Highly recommend the pumpkin soup.    
Check their website for location, timing etc.     
We are going on the Sunday with a bunch of people from the BCT so if you feel like joining us, the more the merrier. We're meeting at 3pm at the maze entrance (although we'll probably be there a bit earlier than that for some pumpkin-related lunch - or just sausages!)   
Maybe see you there?

There's also a band, drinks, and a place for kids to jump to their hearts content (Gumpiburg), open 2:30 - 8pm.

1988	13.09.2011, 17:29	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: basel	"    Well as Kinhorngreen rightly stated, letting speedy boarders on first is more of a commercial issue however unfair it may seem. 
Let`s not forget that almost ALL passengers HATE this free seating policy. It has recently been scientifically proven NOT to be the most efficient way of boarding passengers. It just winds everyone up - I hate it personally. 
Yes, people do rush to the gate `like sheep` and it`s pretty s**t when a lot of them refuse to budge for parents with small children. There are always people like that unfortunately. However you do have to consider how `shit`it really is now on those flights. 
I hate having to join the `sheep` and often sit back thinking `let them get on with it` . . but then when you get on . . the lockers are full. 
Why? because everyone takes hand luggage to the limit and beyond (if they can get away with it) obviously because of the claw-back charges from the airlines. Even though it is not allowed, people still take 2 bags on. 
The result is that the lockers are always full before the passengers are boarded. `Put bags under the seat in front` they announce but with minimal leg room anyway . . that can be bloody uncomfortable. 
There are the `rush rush rush` people who want a quick getaway at the other end (they always want front seats). Then there are the big/double bag brigade (they want locker space). Then finally you get the `one person from a group pays for SB and saves seat for the others` . . good if you can get away with it . . but one woman said to me`those 2 seats are taken`. . . and those 3 behind as well` . . after I had paid for SB I thought that was a bit rich! 
I do have a preference but its quite simple and for a good reason. I like to have an aisle seat because since I broke my collar bone several years ago and it never healed properly - I cant sit with my shoulders `scrunched`up. 
I dont give a hoot which row it is on . . . as long as the girl on the next seat is a (good) looker . . .oops . 
Bottom line is, as LOADDDDDS of people on the EF will tell us . . what do you expect from a cheap airline? True . . but it could be SO much better.

			Hi there folks, just wanting to know if anyone is interested in accompanying me on my drive to Austria in a couple weeks or so. I'll be heading off to Weiz near Graz and would be nice to have someone to chat with and share fuel costs. Car is an older Saab, 2 litre, plenty of room for 1 or 2 more persons. Dates are not specific at this stage, it's flexible. Cheers, Laszlo

Passing through a sluice, its apparently one of Switzerlands most scenic rides.   
Good for kids (who like boats). Possibly better for those that are at least 2 or 3.     
Arriving in Solothurn, you can also wander the streets and see  , built between 1762 and 1773.     
And a most beautiful Jesuit Church.          
There is not a lot of walking involved, so good for those whose legs are not  so able.

			Looks like the right engine failed. If you take a look at nozzles you'll see that the left hand nozzle is wide open, but the right hand nozzle is closed.       
At such a slow speed the difference in thrust would have produced the sudden yaw that you can see in the video, causing the the right hand wind to drop below the stall speed, and ultimately causing the aircraft to enter a spin   
Given the low altitude the situation would have been totally unrecoverable, and the only chance for the pilot would be to punch out - as he did.   
I'm sure Assassin, or Wolli, will be along soon to correct me.   
Good photos.

			Norwegian Air Shuttle   resumes this route early next year. I flew with them recently and was impressed by their free wifi onboard, a couple of drinks on a low fare flight within Denmark. Their B737-800 looked really nice with comfy seats.          I observed that most Scandinavians do not check in luggage, hence avoiding the baggage fees. Carry on luggage restrictions in terms of weight and size are not enforced as well, at least on the B737-800 which is spacious.      The only minor issue is that there is no web check-in.

The Lindt factory is closed on Sundays. Other people have already told you how to get there from Zurich and what the opening times are on other days.   
A lot of restaurants and bars in Zurich are open on Sundays.  So is the Zurich Zoo.  You can also take a train to go somewhere and see mountains, or hike up the local mountain (Uetliberg).  What sort of activity did you have in mind?

			i am planning to go on a two week euro trip this summer with a few friends and was looking for the cheapest way of transportation.    
we want to rent a car, either a minivan or a camper, where 4 people can sleep to save some on accommodation. i've read a few threads about motor homes here, and some were suggesting places in germany, and most links in CH gave results where two weeks' rental would cost over 2000 CHF. Is this the best price one could get; does anyone have any recommendations for car rental for such a trip?   
thanks,

			Ok,    
This is an old post but I thought I add my 2 cents, been europark and disney in paris now, took the car with the kids to both. Biggest difference, most of the rides in europark are outside, most of the rides in disney inside (warehouse size buildings). Other big difference the queues, in europark rarely queued for more then 10 minutes, in disney paris I recall one ride we queued for 1 hour (the ride lasted 5 minutes, if that). The shows however in disney paris where beyond comparison, truly excellent.   
Took us about 7 hours drive, about 1 hour south of Lausanne to get to Paris, not a difficult journey, no traffic (went a few weeks back). Cost of the train or plane if your a family prohibitive. Parking in disney if your staying in the park free (europark parking free too).

			Confirming what Odile and Nicolaschulz said... definitely not for the very young.   I have been there and, although there are handrails to hold on to all the way along, some of the stairways are steep and above a big drop. Even adults with vertigo would not like it.    
I went with my daughter who was 10 at the time, and she loved it - all depends what you mean by young i suppose.

			great, not too much driving, weather was a bit iffy but managable.   
Legoland was better and bigger than i expected.. however couldnt get on many of the rides with a 1 year old. I think between 4 and 5 is the perfect age to go so will certainly go back! Monkey park was good too , perfect distance from Geneva. Made our way back via Metzingen outlet and then through zurich and home, no more than 3 hours drive per day so perfect.   
cheers

			Hi everyone, I am currently living in Cham, near Zug and I can no longer bear the fact that I don't play in a band anymore since when I left Italy some years ago. Is anyone in the area interested in a couple of experimental jam sessions? I'd love to play and develop some of the stuff I composed for bass and guitar, and I'm eager to appreciate other musicians!!!   
Feel free to contact me via PM

			If you like a good day hike, I strongly recommend the Sentir des Fromagarie in Gruyere.  See  .  It's a respectable climb but not too difficult and the path is very well marked (it's also a snowshoe trial in the winter).  The beauty is, you can hike to different fromagaries and get some cheese and a glass (or more!) of beer.  The trail head (and parking lot) is near to the big cheese factory / touring place in Gruyere.  So while you might get some big tourist busses, if you end there at the finish if your hike, it is a very nice place to sit and relax in the sun with a suitable beverage.  Also, there's so much to do around Gruyere that it's hard to beat -- even on a Swiss holiday.

			How about the  . You can drive up to the car park P1 and then there's a walking loop (probably 3-4 hours) with some beautiful views. It feels quite remote and desolate. At the See, there's a very   where you can have a drink and something to eat. You'll certainly be able to find somewhere to spend some time alone, either beside one of the lakes, or on the Murgseefurggel (or Wiedersteinerfurggel if you wanted to walk a bit further). The walk back down from the See is on a wider path and so would be OK in fading light.   
Cheers

Switzerland is a surprisingly big country, and I only know a few corners of it, but the view from the Gornergrat is hard to beat.  There are many other great views, including some much closer to Zurich (Rigi, Pilatus, Titlis .. .).  If going up high on a sunny summer day (assuming we get any this summer  ) remember that the temperature drops dramatically with elevation, bring lots of warm clothes.   
Mürren is hard to beat as a village when the weather cooperates, but then we all have our favorites.

			The path from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen is very pretty, with good views of the valley. Allow 90 minutes to 2 hours to do the hike, depending on how fit you are (as said above, there is a height gain of 600 metres/almost 2,000 feet).   
Using the distance in kilometres to estimate time/effort is not a good idea in the mountains...   what really counts is how much height you have to gain or lose.

			Yes the tickets are valid for 3 days, but obviously you can only travel each section of your trip once (+ return).   
But for example if you buy a railaway from Zürich to the olympic museum in Lausanne you can do the following:   
Friday: Zurich - Bern, stay overnight 
Saturday: Bern - Lausanne 
Sunday: Lausanne - Zurich   
Or    
Friday: Zurich - Lausanne, stay 2 nights 
Sunday: Lausanne - Zurich    
Hope this helps. I often travelled like this, especially in winter with the snow & rail deals. Staying over with friends en-route on day 1, continue travel to the skiresort the next day, and go home on day 3.

			As part of our week long stay in switzerland, we will be driving by a few car accessible glaciers. 
Another interest for us is water bodies. 
Not the big interlaken or lucerne type lakes, but alpine lakes in meadows with views of alps around. 
Kind of like what you see from grimsel, but with greenery(slightly lower altitude maybe) and alpine views.   
The plan is simple, drive, and hike not more than 10-15 minutes to get to such a lake.   
Avoiding gondola etc., as the CHF is going through the roof. every 10-15CHF is going to pinch!.   
Its a multi country trip, so we already have a car rented for many days, and would like to use it!

			Dear sewsu,   
Hi, Thanks a lot!    
I don't have Swiss residency I will be here for a week of traveling and visiting friends.   
The question is, that normally, before registration for the flight you can ask a customs officer to stamp your tax free letter and inspect purchased things.   
In Zurich airport, you have registration on flight much before customs zone where customs officers are working. So either you: 
1. register for a flight together with baggage registration and they taking your baggage together with purchased things. 
2. go on border and stamp a paper together with providing of bought goods.   
in 1st case, on a border you can not show anything from your baggage (I am planing to pack everything to the baggage)   
in 2nd case you can not came back for a registration (as for my understanding)     
that is what mostly not clear for me.   
For example in Barcelona's airport, you have special customs officer's window before registration, you show him your good, he stamps papers. It is always crowdly there as well... but after that you can go for a registration and check-in..

			Our final booking is done. 
We will be in Lauterbrennen area.   
We will have full 5 days, some days I planned 
1. Take good morning ticket to Jungfrau. 
While coming back, do we have to be back to lauterbrunnen by noon, or we can just take the train back till some intermedite station from Jungfrau, so some hike, and then catch the train to lauterbrennen? 
2. Take the car to tasch, take train to zermatt, go hiking to see matterhorn, walk back to tasch, and drive back to lauterbrunnen 
3. Trip to a lake area with some high alpine lakes (some hiking)  
4. Trip to southern valais and see the st. bernard hospice. Do they still have the dogs there? While coming back do the simplon pass, and then take the old gotthard road to get back to lauterbrennen. If possible see the glacier at the dam in Val-de herence etc.,? 
5. Buffer day 
6. Drive to salzburg after seeing Rhine falls. Starting early from Lauterbrunnen, we should be at the falls by 10am, and by noon we intend to finish our boat ride, and then drive to salzburg through german autobahn.

			I have stayed here (twice!) and really liked it. The rooms are on the side facing away from the train station, so you don't suffer from the noise. The bathrooms are opposite the bedrooms facing the train station. There is a large well equipped kitchen there too and lots of restaurants in the neighbourhood. The staff are very friendly and willing to help. It is more like a hotel than a traditional hostel. I think there were lockers you could padlock too for storing your things.

			Hello,   
I was looking for a rental car. We are two people of 24yo. The point is that at the beginning I found out prices in France where cheaper than in CH (not surprise yet).   
Then, I found out that there is a additional per-day charge for being under 25 in France, Italy and other EU countries. At the end, if I concluded that it is cheaper to rent in France if you are above 25, but if you are under 25 seems to be the same prince in CH.    
My question is, do you know any cheap company for car rental in Geneva or south France?   
We would like to spend no more than 40 eur/day in the rent.

You can buy the Swiss Transfer Ticket, the Swiss Pass, and most other ""tourist""-type tickets at *some* SBB counters (NOT ticket machines), and you can definitely do it at the airport SBB counter.  They always speak English and you can even ask them for advice.  They are usually very friendly, but it is good to at least go in with an idea of what you want.     
With your other scenario, you would be just fine booking city tickets too.  But it may be cheaper to buy the transfer ticket, especially because going back and forth to airports usually costs more, which is built into the price of the transfer ticket and not usually into the city tickets.  This is something you should research and/or just ask the ticketing agent when you arrive.

			With a 13 month old I would buy an annual pass for the zoo and the museums.   
The beauty is you can then pop in to these places for an hour or so in the middle of the day without thinking you've spent a fortune for a day pass.

			There is also the Ice Flyer across the glacier.  Make sure that you are wrapped up warm if got go on this.   
If you have time, make a stop on the way down to walk around the Trubsee lake and see the wildflower trail

However, there is a TRN ticket machine at Place Pury - not sure exactly where, but it's wherever the red bus to Fontainemelon/Cernier/Villiers leaves from.

			We got there early, around 10.30am and stayed till it became very busy (after 2 pm). Hardly any wait and the kids had a lot of fun, we all loved that blitz thing where you can make funny pictures of your shadow! Also with a big family like ours it's better to take a 6 months pass, so we didn't have to go to all the attractions, have 6 months to go again..and again...and again!

			If you go to the Zoo which I think is supposed to be one of the best in Europe, afterwards you could go to the restaurant nextdoor called Outpost. It has the best steak I've had in Zurich. Canadian Black Angus Tenderloin. Mmmmmm.   
If you go to the Landesmuseum and get the watertaxi (which is included in your Zurich travel ticket) you can get the boat down to Casino at Zurihorn. The boat takes you down the river Limmat going under the bridges and then zig zagging over the lake. It's really bustling round the Casino-Bellevue boulevard. Lots of people having fun on the lawns, going for a swim, playing frisbee, street entertainers. There's pedallos there for hire. There's a really cool water fountain there which is a rotating one tonne granite sphere. Take a bbq maybe. Then you can walk up to Bellevue via the Chinagarten.   
All in all I think Zurich's a nice place to live but not really that interesting tourist destination.   
I think there's a free outdoor music fest 20 mins down the lake at Wadenswil.

2118	null	null	null	null	"    Most dog owners escape this weekend with their canine friends to other parts of Europe due to the fireworks. Personally, I dont. My dog still barks when he hears the fireworks but its more alert and excited than anxious barking now.   
I am glad we decided to bite the bullet and stay - never celebrate 4th of July so dont know what its like but from what I've observed: alot of families tend to gather together and bbq or laze by the lake. Its absolutely heaving and people start setting off their fireworks before the official ones.    
Your individual gemeindes will also have celebrations. Ours this year is organised by the Womens Gymnastics Club - a breakfast buffet after mass in the morning and performances by the local choral choirs later in the afternoon before the fireworks and bonfire. Not the most exciting activities, but its a great opportunity to meet and greet those living in your commune besides your immediate neighbours.

			The shops will probably be closed - but check their doors, most put up opening hours posters.  There are always little shops around that are open for bread and milk etc.   
The Fetes de Genève will be on, so there will be lots to do.   
The buses and trains will probably be ok too.  Probably running on a ""public holiday"" schedule.  Which just means that they are not every 10 or fifteen minutes.  It depends where you live.  Just check the timetable at the bus stop or online at tpg.ch.

			I've been on the sleeper to Arnhem from Basel a few times. You don't really sleep on those things but they're comfy enough.   
Plenty of things to do in Amsterdam - but I recommend the first thing you do is take a boat tour of the canals as it does help you to get the lay of the land.   
The red light district is actually quite amusing to visit - even if you are female - just for the novelty of it. Personally I liked wandering around the winding streets - and there are plenty of them. For museums, I think the Rijksmuseum (the Van Gogh was not my favourite) - or if you can handle it the Anne Frank.   
There are loads of great little bars and cafes around - my personal favourite is the Beijaard (   ) on Spui - if you like Belgian beers.

			If it's anything like a village off the beaten track which we once lived in, the drivers of the buses knew us - we lived there,  we paid our taxes there and were thus 'Einheimische' (local) and got a deduction in the fares on the local bus. The driver once joked that with our half-price cards, our children's cards (which were, at that time, free) and our 'Einheimische' deduction, he would soon have to be paying US to do the journey!

Here are a couple examples off the top of my head, but perhaps someone has something useful that I haven't thought about :   
Cooking stove 
Lantern 
Sleeping bag/s   
Please feel free to ask questions or make any comments. Thanks in advance!!

			Corsica is great, but expensive. By far the best beaches, mountains, and pigs in the middle of one-lane roads.   
Comogli is very nice, and then head from there down through 5-Terre.   
In France (other than Corsica), I've always liked Antibes.   
Tuscany great for motorcycling.   
All are great for eating/drinking.

			Hi All   
I need some help and advice.  I want to have a long weekend for myself, wife and 2 kids starting from Thursday 8th - Tuesday 13th September.  My childrens ages are 22months and 3 months so I would like some recommendations on where to go and stay.  What is around for kids under 2?  My eldest son loves the play parks and the merry go round.     
I have thought about Bettmeralp but was wondering if there is anywhere else to consider?  I can also travel to Nice in France or to North Italy if you have any good suggestions.   
Thanks   
Chris

			I must have missed this. Must be one hell of party in the works for the weekend of 24 to 25 Sept. 
Saturday is the Patrouille Suisse display   
Sunday is the fireworks spectacle.      
All that and there's a wine fair thrown in.

			We've sometime had members asking about things for their children to do in the summer and autumn holidays. About a week ago I saw an Ad for these in our local newspaper, the Zürichsee-Zeitung.   
I wrote and asked if the leaders speak English and had a friendly answer back saying 'yes' and that the idea was to enable children to make new friends etc. The lady also sent the link to the flyer for camps in this area. See below   
I've no idea how good the thing is but the text speaks of sport teachers and specialised sports students so it looks pretty professional.    
Check it out if you are interested.

			We went a couple of weeks ago with a 3 yr old and a 20 month old -  both loved the sea life centre (although it was very busy) and there is a nice playground on the lake side and nice wide pavements for little kids to enjoy a good run around. Cafes seemed child friendly too. To be honest it's hard to fit in much more in just an afternoon.

There are other pleasant places to stay and eat on the way. We have stayed here at the  . The food's rather good.   
Arras is really nice as well. Both Laon and St.Quentin are nice too for an evening stroll to stretch your legs.      Be careful parking up too close to Calais if you have a lorry or van. I've been told that people have had problems with stowaways and break-ins.

			Travel to Biel / Bienne. Take the train to Twann, Ligerz or Cressier (towards Neuchatel), hike up to Chasseral which is at 1609 meters. 
The Twann Schlucht is a very beautiful gorge.    
Stay in chalet style hotel,   at Chasseral mountain top. They   take credit cards!    
Next day hike down the other side to St Imier. Take train back to Biel.   
Total hike is only 30 Km, but rather hilly! There is a sporadic Post Bus on the south side.

			Hello,   
Need suggestions on a place for family visit where we can find snow at this part of year. We are from Zurich and have already done Titlis, Jungfrau looks too far. As we are not into skiing etc, just need place for family visit.    
Heard Pilatus has no snow now. Is Flumsenberg good for family visit? how much will it cost for day trip pls?    
Thanks in advance !

			I would first find out if there are any others of around your age visiting with other family members.  There could be others thinking the same as you.   
I know what you mean with family events like this.  You want to meet them for a short while but it can get a bit much if it is a long event.   
I don't know the Zug area very well.  I know that Cham has been mentioned as a nice place.  You could take a lake trip and maybe up Rigi.

			Steam traction engines were used on farms to thresh corn.   
Steam railway engines are conserved in many places in Switzerland.   
The nearest one to you is at St Sulpice Ne, between Pontarlier (France) and Neuchâtel CH,  
""Vapeur Val de Travers""   The site has a limited English section, the French  
pages are the best.    
Normally the club is very active, but this summer the SBB are renovating the tracks between  
their engine shed and Neuchâtel, so there is a limited service.

I noticed that the day card was much cheaper than the quouted price 
on th COOP coupon ..Bodensee : 72 CHF reduced to 25 CHF. The day ticket 
price on the website for two towns Rohrschach or Romanshorn was 38CHF. 
As far as I can tell it is only valid for one person ..Am I missing something ? 
Has anyone yet used this coupon yet and understand where they get the 72chf 
price. Any insight would be welcome.

			Andilly is a small village just after the Mont-de-Sion and each year they organize this big event : The Great Medivals.   
From 4-5 and 11-12-13 june 2011, in the forests of the Andilly's mills, it's a trip in the History.   
Every days, more than 30 shows, 400 artists, 1000 supernumeraries (?)     
They have several videos, quite funny to watch

Sorry for late reply: busy enjoying life to the full back in Geneva! Thanks for teh Albinen ladders: saw them... I've got height fear, definitely not for me... I was already shaking in the cable cars, so imagine on those ladders!   
The  Maison des Elfes B&B in Albinen was absolutely fabulous, though, cosy and tastefully decorated, something I seem to find in short supply here.

Spectators welcome and some lovely bikes on display.

			I've done this particular journey a few times, and it's quite a civilised way to travel, though it's slower and more expensive than flights (booked on the same date).  That said, you can always arrange to have a couple of hours in Paris for lunch if you fancy, which the airlines will never allow.   
I usually book through    
It's not very good at figuring out the connection in Paris, though.  The trick is to put in Zürich - Paris, select your trains, and when it gets to the ""confirmation"" screen, then go to the ""add another ticket"" bit at the bottom right, then sort out your Paris - London bit.  Once you've selected your trains, you can sort out payment and ticket delivery.  I don't think you can do the ""collect from a machine"" option at Zürich, but I have collected the Eurostar tickets at Paris Nord without trouble.   
For the uninitiated, you will need to get from Gare de l'Est to Gare du Nord in Paris.  They're quite close to each other, and if you are taking it easy, allow 20 minutes to get between them (but if you know the way and are a fast walker, you can do it in less).  Eurostar also requires you to check in 30 minutes before your train, but coming back, the Paris-Zürich train is just like any regular train, so I'd recommend allowing about an hour on the London bound direction for the connection, and about half an hour in the reverse direction to be on the safe side.   
I've it in both 1st and 2nd class, and would say that, unless you are a larger person who wants the extra seat room, there is no benefit going 1st.  Eurostar used to give you a nice meal and free booze in the cheap 1st class fares, but ticket changes last December changed that to some rubbish airline-style snack.   
If you get the 07.00 of Zürich HB, you can be in London at about 14.30 (UK time).  If you leave London at about 10.30, you can be back in Zürich by at about 19.30.  Luggage is usually not a problem (provided you can cary/wheel it between the stations in Paris), though I think bicycles require additional booking of limited spaces, but I've never tried that option myself.

			The Vevey is not the first of this type of boat to be retired recently. When we took a CGN boat on Lake Geneva in late 2005 (maybe 2006), we learned that it was the boat's last voyage, it was called the Italia. There was a party atmosphere on board, with lots of people coming out for the trip, some of them dressed in Belle Epoque clothing.    
Many people had been on the boat all day and had already had quite a bit to drink. The captain even let a couple of people get on the microphone and they started singing some folk songs over the ship's loudspeakers. When we crossed paths with the regular boat to Evian, we stopped in the middle of the lake for a couple of minutes while the two captains honked at each other and everyone waved back and forth. At most ports that we stopped in, there were people (mainly fathers and sons) who had come out just to wave to the boat one last time.   
We were very lucky to have been on that voyage accidentally. If any of you get a chance to do so for the Vevey's last voyage then I certainly encourage you to do so.

			Stayed here Friday night on a 'Tete a Tete' deal. 400chuffs, which included a 5 course evening meal, Lifestyle double room with city view and Sauna room + breakfast.    
First of all, no clear detail on their website about the fact you have to take a train to the top(i stand to be corrected) there is a carpark, but no details or signs/instructions on how you actually then get to Uto Kolm hotel from the carpark, luckily a helpful receptionist guided us up there.    
Basically take the train to (last stop) Uetliberg, on leaving the carriage in the middle of the platform follow the steps in front of you up the hill, keep going to the top!   
On arrival our checkin was swift and we were directed to our room. Room size was small, very clean and modern but minimal, barely enough to fit our beds in, we had a flat screen Sony TV which was positioned such that when the window was open it obscured the view of the TV.      
Popped to the restaurant for our meal to find no actual tables available in the front outside restaurant area, they had reserved us a table right at the back with a rather limited view and inside the building not outside, with a hanful of people seated, no atmosphere, which was a bit dissapointing. We of course requested we sit somewhere else, we managed to get a table just inside the building area, not outside still, but with a slighty better view and cooler.    
The meal itself was ok, i have to say it was pretty much hotel standard and not a good restaurant. Even though it was 5 courses the portions were just about ok, certainly not generous. So we asked for a few bread rolls on the way just to pack it out a bit! Service was good though, and friendly. (i rarely eat 3 course meal at home or we share a desert if we have starters!)   
Back to our room, to find it was still very hot, so looked for the air conditioning. None there, bearing in mind my 100chuff a night room in the holiday inn express had aircon i wasn't impressed! So we had the window wide open all night, which invited all the mosquitos in.   
Breakfast was very good, well presented and a very good range, including bacon and eggs. Couldn't fault breakfast v good.        
What i feel you're really paying for here is the view, i staggered up  the steel tower after a few more beers to watch the fireworks in the  town, an absolutely stunning view.    
All in all, nice but i wouldn't do that again. Id rather pop up for a normal meal in the restaurant, prebooked out the front. And enjoy the view then head home.    
Pros: Fabulous view from room and restaurant if you're seated in the right place, nice lively atmosphere in the evening(only outside though).   
Cons: Small rooms, No airconditioning, no shuttle service to the hotel. And no clear directions. Restaurant set course forgettable. Cost seemed high for what it was, although im quite fresh from the UK ferry still (6weeks) so im still sensitive to prices here!      Having 2 nippers of our own we noticed a few  gaps around the perimeter where an 'untethered' 2year old could easily  slip through and then fall a long way down. Keep nippers close to hand.

			From Delemont to Herisau, I completed my own personal 26 canton challenge on Monday when I hiked over the Surenenpass and visited Stans, the capital of Niwalden, on my way home which was the last piece of the puzzle. It took me one month and I saw every cantonal capital, plus did tons of hiking and visited other towns that I was interested in.   
In the end, my favorite canton was probably Uri.   
I learned a lot about this nation and its history along the way. It's amazing how diverse Switzerland is for such a small territory. In the end, I think that's what surprised me the most. Even though I have traveled here before moving, seeing each canton really makes you appreciate the differences a lot more.

			Hi Andy,     
I land in Geneva and mostly I stay in Bern.   
I am thinking about an one month ""Swiss Pass"" ticket, then I can use trains and other transport systems during my stay, but the prices are relatively high.   
By the way I love biking  .   
I will be there at June by great chances.   
Cheers,

But having a Chinese wife I know the ""Paris syndrom"" pretty well (that's btw not a joke, there really is a Paris syndrom, the hospitals there have to take care of several hundred mainly Asian females a year that have something like a nervuous breakdown because the city does not match the idealized imagination of the most romantic place on earth...). So if you have to, why don't you do this on Easter: If you spend half the day on Friday and Sunday when shops are closed anyway on the journey, you do not miss that much...

We're gonna stay at the ""Agriturismo Villanova"" because our friends recommended it (and they went with a small kid too).  . 
There's a nice beach nearby (that's what i'm after), and it's just outside of cinque terre so there are lots of old towns to explore (that's what the wife is after)... plus it is in a nice green area.

Although Indian painters were celebrated as “wonders of their age” by  their contemporaries, for a long time very little was known about their  lives. There are no Indian equivalents of sources such as Vasari’s  biographies of European Renaissance artists. The fact that artistic  traditions were shaped within a family, a workshop, or a court, adds to  the difficulty of attributing works to individual artists.   
Thanks to many years of painstaking research, the deciphering of  microscopically small signatures, analyses of pilgrim registers, and,  especially, stylistic comparisons, more is now known. For example, about  Farrukh Beg, who painted in Iran, in Kabul, Lahore, Bijapur, and Agra,  or the brothers Manaku and Nainsukh who, despite their joint training in  their father‘s workshop, differ significantly in style.

Normal connection, every second hour: 
Coming from Basel. train in Zürich, 
then Zürich - Chur 
over to Rhätische Bahn Chur - Samedan (direction is Skt Moritz) 
Samedan change train to Pontresina, go to track 1 
In Pontresina, the train to Tirano is waiting onthe opposite track.   
It takes more time to go to Skt Moritz and then wait there for the train to Tirano, but you may enjoy a little walk by the lake.    
It's perfectly organized, just follow the flow... the line is touristy, announcements are made in English too. Enjoy also the ones in Romansh :-)

			Ahhh Springtime! Everything is green and lush and flowery, the air is fresh and the world is reborn, the thoughts of young men turn to the willowy freshness of young women, mine however were trying to ignore a sore back. 
I had spent Saturday on the banks of the Rhine in Basel with my feet in the water doing the dirty old man thing watching the bikini-clad chicks flout their stuff. 
Laying on the hard ground had done my back in. 
Time to grab the bike go for a ride and get some other thoughts in my head, by now the beemer has 230.000 Klicks on the clock and after last winter she is has accumulated quite a bit of patina, the gaskets in the front fork are banjaxed and she is leaking oil allover the front brakes, the good thing is that they no longer squeak, the exhaust has a hole somewhere, the brake-pads are down and I think she needs a new cable on the clutch. 
Spares have been ordered from BMW but delivery is not for another three weeks. 
Oh poop! 
Silly me, I always thought I lived in Europe and not Outer Mongolia.   
But I have never been one to waste a perfectly good riding day, so come eight we bubbled (rather loudly) onto the motorway heading north. 
I did not have any plan and just followed the front wheel, it asked me if I wanted a coffee, I said ""yes"" and we set course for Colmar just over the border in France. 
In my minds eye I saw myself sitting at an outside table in the main square with a coffee a basket of Croissants whilst reading the International herald tribune to the sound of a motorbike leaning at a jaunty angle on it´s side stand, ticking gently as it cooled down. 
Just how bohemian is that?       
Nice pictures indeed, and on the side of the cathedral is a top-notch medieval WTF   
And we think today´s priests are weird   
Colmar is a wonderful medieval town but there is the worm in this otherwise quaint half timbered apple. The first thing that I saw was a tourist carrier in the shape of a choo-choo train, a fat Germany guy wearing shorts and a (very) loud unbuttoned shirt, he was trying to talk to the driver, ""Parleez voo Deutsch?"" at the same time complaining to his wife that nobody speaks the Deutsch. 
I cringed into my coffee wishing the bugger would go away and stop ruining my morning. 
Too late. 
Finishing my coffee I grabbed the bike and bubbled off following a sign that proclaimed Touts directions, or ""that a way"" 
A bit later I saw a sign for the Wine road, I turned right and went to the Vogese mountains.     
On the way up, following the wine road.   
Getting there   
Yeh! At the top   
Looking over the rhine valley, bad tongues will say that the fault-line is France´s way of getting away from Germany.   
Everybody knows the black forest, the cuckoo clocks and the Dirndl local clothing with the three red pompoms on the hat, Grimm´s fairytales and all that guff. 
If you think that the Rhine valley is actually a fault line in the earths crust, to the east is the black forrest and over the plane of the valley to the west is the mirror image of the Vogese mountains. 
A mirror image but without the tacky tourist tat, empty open long winding roads, through leafy forrest, this is BMW LT country.   
I love to drive slowly down roads like this, so slow in fact that the bugs get time to veer out of my path. I killed the engine and coasted down in silence, the closest to flying that you will ever get. 
I headed to the Ballon d´ Alsace, a 1171 meters or 3.842 ft high mountain, the highest in the area. 
Up until now I have lived in the eastern part of CH, with all the pointy bits just a half hours ride away there, people have a somewhat robust idea of hight, so I tend to regard anything under 1000 meters as a speedbump. 
Slammer´s alpine motto: ""I get my kicks above the tree-line sunshine!"" 
The Vogese are different I must admit, but every bit as enjoyable to ride as the switchbacks and hairbends of the high passes. 
The ballon d´ Alsace offers a 360° view of central Europe, the air was clear and I could see the Alps  in the distance and the valleys and fields below. Every meter traveled was enjoyable. 
I flashed past a stone. 
Something had caught the corner of my eye, a few hundred meters on I stopped and turned back. 
It was a memorial stone.. 
..On the 2nd of December 1944 a Halifax bomber took off from Skipton, she dropped her load south of Essen, most likely the aircraft was hit by FLAK, unable to keep hight she crashed killing all but one of the crew, who later died of his injuries. 
Things like this stele make me realize that people like the owners of the names on the stone created a world where my wonderful children, British-German, maybe the best of both worlds, can exist in peace. 
Somebody cares enough to put fresh flowers down by the stone, it faces the Rhine valley over one thousand meters below.     
No words.   
I rode on, somehow I must have gotten a draft around my visor because my eyes had gotten moist, the sky seemed more intensive blue, the grass greener, the air clearer. 
Surely there where giants in them days.

			I've been to Rome over Easter too. Very crowed, but waited less than an hour for the Vatican, and for the museum we turned up 1.5 hours before closing and walked straight in.    
Watch out for the pickpockets - especially on the busses (Bus #64 in particular - Google it.). They scr*wed up my dad's visit to Rome. Keep some spare money back at the hotel or in another pocket.

Basically for those of you who like cycling, blading, walking, running, etc... (no motor vehicles) the SlowUp (Swiss translated from SlowDown) is a circuit on the mainroads when once per year these roads are closed to cars and open to pedestrians with non-motorized means of traveling. The link above provides details, dates and areas. (Fr,Ge,It).   
Our SlowUp (down), is the 26th of April which circles the lake of Murten. No entry fee, lots of train/tram stops, loads of people, and many snack / drink bars along the way, distance is 32 kms if you go all the way around. Bikes can be rented locally.   
Maybe see you there since our house/office is just off the main road field, look for the Canadian/British/Swiss flags..

			Scanning a few pages onto a laptop would be preferable to carrying several books.  I have also photographed occasional things for reference.  I recall one particular occasion when this came in useful.  I took a picture of a route map of the paths around Mount Pelerin that was very handy.   
There are quite a few guides available for iPhone/iPod/iPad.  I have over 30 Swiss Apps. on my iPod and several generic ones that I may also refer to.     
If you have a laptop, then keeping a list of relevant websites in 'Favourites' would be useful.   
I have several guide books and use them for ideas in advance at home.  Once I am in Switzerland, I think I would find them a distraction.  There is no shortage of information available locally.

			I currently have one adult fare direct ticket for Zurich HB to Paris Est and back. Its a train ticket -  .   
The person should also hold a Swiss Half Fare card. The Half fare card info is not printed on the ticket but the lady at the counter asked if I had one. 
I think she must have calculated the price based on this information.     
From Zurich HB - 16:27 on 8th April (Friday) 
Return from Paris - 18:24 on 11th April (Monday)   
Total price of the travel is  . 
To price - 135 CHF 
Return Price - 101 CHF   
Ticket from Zurich to Paris   cancelled but the return ticket   be. Hence I am also willing to just   too.

What are you interested in seeing? There is so much to see and do in Basel during the day, it is really tough to simply pick and choose for someone else.    
If you like enjoying ""nature"", I like the Basel Zoo, also, Lange Erlen is / has sort of a mini-zoo with mostly local wildlife, both provide some nice stroll with interesting view. If you prefer fewer caged animals, Grün 80 is also a nice stroll, more of a garden / green area with walking paths.   
There are many many museums in Basel, so it should be pretty easy to ""get your culture on""     
Ueli and Unser are both local beers, one (or perhaps both?) of the brewing companies have a brewhouse with bar / restaurant attached. I'd say for someone visiting Basel particularly, this is something of a ""must"" - although as my hubby is a Basler (and non-drinker), I've not been. I HAVE been to Lolle König (literally, the tongue king) restaurant, there is a story behind the name and the placement of the restaurant I believe, so also definitely worth a visit.   
If you're not adverse to going slightly further afield, rather than in Basel ""proper"", I was taken to Augusta Raurica when I visited prior to my move. I was quite impressed by the ""living history"" there.     
Anyhow, just a few ideas to get you started, hopefully some of the others who get out and about more locally will have some other ideas. (My hubby and m-i-l tend to want to go away from Basel  )

			Thank you for your suggestion, Mr Jrspet, but that hotel is still a tad pricey, considering its rates for 2 persons in a double-room. As for camping, the prospect of paying good money to mingle with bevies of blue-collar families with their boisterous kids and pets is not very enchanting, even for one night.

			Hi. I'm new on here. We've just moved and we stayed in Basel for about two weeks while DH was doing orientation. We stayed in fully furnished apartments complete with kitchen. They had one, two and four bedroom ones which would be more than big enough for your family. It was on Barenfelsterstrasse. Here's a link if you want to have a look:    
It wasn't too expensive either. Happy holidays!

We have holidayed there for years,  both as a couple and then latterly  with small children. There are good walks, all interspersed with mountain huttes with lots of play areas, and a ""tractor train"" which takes you out into the more inaccessible areas (for small legs walking at any rate) leaving you to walk back downhill if you so choose (the preferred direction of our two).  They have a good website but am still a bit worried it might be a little far for your 2 hour stipulation.

And it is only about means of transport and cutting the cost of travaling - nothing personal :-) It will cost approx 250 euros both ways for whole car ( it means 50 eur for every person), the hotel should be 30-60 euro per night -depends on if you stay in a single\double etc ( we will spend 3 nights there), also it will take 8-10 hours travaling by car in night one way.

			I've lived in basel for 3 months and love it.  Met lots of nice people (and very few not-nice people).  You can find bars, clubs, salsa dancing, cinema, up-market, down-market, red light etc etc. and all within a 5 min tram ride.   
Maybe I've just been lucky but I don't recognise the comments about being difficult to make friends or Basel being boring (and I come from London so its not as if I am dazzled by the bright lights.... )

Take an early train, but spread your activities out once you arrive.  If you go straight from Zermatt station to the cable car, to the gondola, up to the top of Klein Matterhorn (for the view and/or the glacier cave) expect to get some altitude problems.  So ... late breakfast in Zermatt first.

			Hertz has cars from the airport (French side) on a Sunday.  Prices start from about EUR100- for the day.     
In this case, cheaper to rent from the Swiss side.  Same dates, cars start at CHF109- for a prepaid rental, 120- for a pay-on-return rental.   
Cars rented from the Swiss side have the added advantage of having a vignette.  French cars won't have one, as a rule.

			Hey, yeah everything closes at around 6, anyway, if you wanna do some night shopping, you should try the Piccadily in Viganello(gas station mini-market), right next to Coop in Viganello.   
Then you have the Piccadily in Molino Nuovo, at the gas station, nearby the cementery.   
Then there's the Aperto(changed names a couple years ago, I dont know the new name), but it's the mini market at the train station.   
All of these close at 10 o'clock and all of these are more expensive then regular markets and some charge more for alcohol after 6 o'clock...   
You're better off doing your grocery shopping before 6 and if you didn't know already, on thursdays, shops close a bit later, 7-9, depending which one and where.

			Finally made it to Lenzerheide yesterday, and can only endorse what Eire and others say about price and crowds. We had a twofer ticket from Coop, so two days passes only cost 75 francs (including 5 francs chip fee).    
The main draw I think is how large, spread out and varied it is, and we only skied a tiny part of it. No crowds whatsoever on the Rothorn side despite beautiful sunny weather, though we set out a bit later in the morning. We were told the slopes would fill up during the afternoon as skiers came over from the west side, where apparently it doesn't stay sunny as long. They did, but still not what you could call crowded.   
If you're on a budget, the half-off of food with a Halbtax or GA at self-service restaurants is very nice too. All in all, thumbs up--I really wish I were there today as well.

			You can't go wrong with Murren or Wengen. Both are up in the mountains and absolutely beautiful. We went to Murren with an elderly lady and did a short hike and she had no problem at all. 
If money is no object you should definitely see the Jungfrau Joch. 
Be prepared to spend quite a lot of time in cable cars and trains if you want to stay in Interlaken and get up in the mountains.

			Finding very little about the Fondation Bayeler on EF, I wanted to tell you about my enjoyable visit there. I was in the Basel area last week (dropping off relatives at the Basel Mulhouse Freiburg Euroairport) and decided to visit the Segantini exhibition at the Fondation Bayeler. There is an underground car park right opposite the museum, which is in a small town/suburb just outside Basel. The exhibition was great and we saw some of the permanent collection (part was closed for rearranging). I very much liked the building with the rooms full of natural light from above and some rooms looking out on to the small lake with lovely grounds outside. After viewing the collection we had a cup of tea in the cafe and found the staff helpful.   
Not a destination for small children but a great place for art lovers.   
The Segantini exhibition continues until April 25th.        "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2009	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Fondation Bayeler Art Museum Basel	CribGoch	Posts: 10

			I recently interviewed a candidate from the States, and he came over with his wife to look around.  I was surprised at her itinerary, because it looked a lot like yours.     
If I had a short visit to Basel, my list of things to see would be very different.  I wouldn't bother with most of the tourist sites (they'll still be here when you move back).  Instead, I'd spend my time visiting things that would help me understand whether I would be happy living here.   
It's a somewhat unusual itinerary, but I would spend some time browsing a grocery store, getting an idea for what's available and what I'll miss from home.  I'd go to the local tourist office and ask about things to do on the weekend.  I'd visit the community park, swimming pool, ice rink, etc to see what's available for leisure time.  I'd ride the trams to get a sense of the city and its scale.   
If you're coming to Basel, you might even rent a car and drive across the border.  There's a lot available just over the border in St. Louis (France) and Lorrache & Weil-am-Rhein (Germany) that won't be on your relocation tour.  Cross-border shopping can make a significant impact on your cost-of-living, so it's worth getting a feel for.   
Finally, if you have any question about how the tax system, health insurance, retirement plans, etc work, now is the time to ask them -- you and your husband could schedule time with the interviewing company's HR department to answer just such questions.   
If, after all this, you've still got time on your hands, then wander the town and hit the tourist sights!

			Dear reader,   
It's my birthday this Sunday and I was wondering where would be a good place to go for a weekend from Zurich, staying over on Saturday night.   
I had looked at Interlaken and the Night Sledding, but unfortunately, sledding in the sleet would be memorable for the wrong reasons (So, my 30th, do you remember how cold it was? Yup, I still have chillblain scars on my face...!)   
Any tips and suggestions gratefully received.   
Budget is about 500 chuffs.    
Merci, danke, ta v much    
Vik

			Genoa is very interesting for an adult. Cinque Terre has stony beaches.    
Go a bit further south and you will find sandy beaches. Massa is cheaper than Forte dei Marmi          
It is well worth avoiding the Gotthard at Easter!!!  Go via the Grand Saint Bernhard, near Martigny,  
a tunnel with a Toll,

			Go to Bern. Head immediately into travel/info office in the train station. Tell them you'd like to take the ipod walking tour of Bern in English. (Bring your own headphones/earbuds). Take as much time as needed and discover the whole town including tidbits of history and lore. If I recall, it's incredibly cheap, though there's a deposit on the ipods. Finish tour. Return ipod, get deposit back. Go home. One day done and enjoyed, from the bears to the rose garden, various fountains, evidence of the only shot fired on the city, the reasons for the two bridges, etc. You can pause at any time to explore more or take a meal or coffee. I did this with my sister when she was in town and it was her favorite part as we explored areas I'd never seen in the couple years living near Bern. There's also one in Zurich. Lather. Rinse.

			I heard on the news today that Eurostar bookings to the UK for the end of April are up 28% on last year.  Other routes are also expected to be busier than normal.  This is due to the Royal wedding and Bank holidays.     
The UK will have two long weekend holidays in a row: Easter from 22nd to 25th April followed by the Royal Wedding & May Day 29th April to 2nd May.   
If you are planning to go over to the UK at that time it would be worth booking soon.

Saturday is a normal Saturday - shops etc. are open 
Easter Sunday - well, speaks for itself 
Easter Monday - everything will be closed   
Like Runnigdeer said, touristy things will be open, because it does mark the beginning of the tourist season.

			Thanks for all the tips.  I think we will try Verbier as many people have mentioned that both on EF and in person.   
We did plan a multi-day mid-week trip to Zermatt and then take the Glacier express to St. Moritz (might as well, I have the GA and he the swiss pass so its almost free).  Will be doing 2 days of skiing (me) and boarding (my friend) in Zermatt.  We were hoping to do some in St. Moritz as well but hotels are CRAZY expensive there even mid-week.  For example our 3 nights in Zermatt were only about the same as one night in St. Moritz.   
After that we are going to try one of the local recommendations ... I'm hoping for snow, forecasters are saying snow local on Tues and Wed, but then I have already seen in just a couple weeks of being here how off the forecasts are here    
Oh for skill.. I don't know how it equates in switzerland.  I usually ski single black diamonds or more interesting blue runs in the US but stay away from chutes and I'll do moguls only once in a while cause I'm ""old"" now and not so good at them so I get tired (use them more of an excuse to justify fondue AND dessert).  My friend is hard to judge, he has 4 yrs or so experience but he is very fearful of getting hurt so no matter the terrain he goes very slow.  He prefers off-piste but defined runs or days when the piste runs have powder on top (I know, a rare combo and probably not going to find good stuff like that this year).   
See you on the slopes!

			Thanks for the suggestions everyone. We spent 2 nights in Colmar this week. We stayed at the Mercure Colmar Champ de Mars which was good as it enabled us to get connecting rooms. Nothing special about the hotel, typical Mercure, but it is located within easy walking distance to the old town of Colmar and is situated on a large park with playground for the kids and an old-school Carrousel. Colmar is a nice little city for walking around.   
Second day we drove from Colmar to Freiburg and then up into the Black Forest. We drove by Titisee and Schluchsee and then had lunch at the Rothaus Brewery. Good food and good beer. Walking around the brewery grounds was nice. We drove back to Colmar via some winding forest roads to Mullheim and then back on the main roads. Countless hiking trails in the area: mainly just forest strolls but a nice contrast to the alps.   
On the way home, we drove through some beautiful little towns in the 
Colmar area: Ingersheim, Niedermorschwihr, Turckheim, Zimmerbach, Wintzenheim and Eguisheim. Walked around and had lunch in Eguisheim which was very cool.    
A few photos:   
Colmar                   
Rothaus Brewery           
Eguisheim             
Overall, a good trip. Easy to do with 3 young kids and dogs. Could easily spend several days in the area. This time of the year was nice as there was nobody around. When the kids get older, we'll have to head back with bikes as well. Reminds me of the Napa/Sonoma region of California only with much nicer towns.

			Agree, cinque terra and the area around Genoa is a beautiful place, sadly I also found it a tourist trap and was disappointed by the shameless way you get ripped off, I think the amount you get stung for is governed by the numberplate on your car, only rich people who can afford it live in CH, so do not be surprised if your wallet is a lot lighter when you return

			Hello again --   
Definitely not a teacher, just looking for likeminded people. But I have taken classes in stained glass, both Tiffany and leaded, and I make wire jewellery for fun sometimes, so I probably would not want to revisit those.   
I've been looking at the smithing courses at Migros, and wow, a 22 or 33 day course! I suppose I could fit that in somehow since work hours are flexible, but I would have to work much longer to compensate and I am not sure I want to be that tired. Also, my poor German might be a problem.    
On the whole, I would be more into a weekend workshop or something.   
I found an interesting search engine here:     
Some of the upcoming glass-themed classes look interesting.

			It is pretty certain that there will still be a considerable amount of snow around, especially along the northern sections.   
This is the Bernina road pass last April       
As well as the Bernina Express trains, there are the scheduled trains that you could transfer to. These don't have the Panorama coaches though and you wouldn't have a reserved seat.   
If you break your journey, it would almost certainly mean that you would not be able to undertake the whole Bernina Express route. Chur-Tirano is over four hours each way.   
Your realistic options would be to either just travel part of the route, or get an overnight stop on the way.    
If you haven't done the Bernina route before, I would opt for the full route without a stop, or find overnight accommodation

			I just spent the afternoon here   in the sculpture park, beautiful layout and complete peace, 10k from the motorway (about 80k from ZRH). We had lunch in Langenbruck, traditional village. There are lots and lots of wanderwegs with beautiful winter landscape, must be nice in summer too.    
Anyway, the attraction was the sculpture park, for those who know Storm King or Pepsico Sculpture Garden, we like those. Something different, and the old Kloster buildings are interesting too.

The problem, though, is all the hotels I have contacted are either already booked, do not take weekend bookings, or do not allow weekend bookings too far in advance. Does anyone have any suggestions besides lengthen the trip, wait to book, or just make it a day trip :-)?   
Thanks!

			Some of your suggestions seem exhausting!  Berne and Geneve in one day is just way too much.   
Some things our guests have loved that are not too far from Olten:   
1.  Gruyere, including the H.R. Geiger Alien bar and the chateau, short bus trip up to Moleson for fondue and picture taking, tour (very short, yet very interesting) of the Gruyere cheese factory.   
2.  Train to Gstaad, walk around village, ogle at rich people, fondue at one of the fabulous restaurants.  Other nearby villages to see, Chateau D'Oex, Rougemont.   
3.  Walk along the lakefront in Lausanne, visit the Olympic Museum, take the Metro to Lausanne Flon, eat at Le Nomade or Kai Zen in the city center.  Take the Metro one stop further to Bessiere, walk across the bridge (multiple photo ops) and up to the ""Old Town"" around the cathedral.

			That's just the cost of the seat reservation. It comes on top of the price of the ordinary ticket. I think you can get both ticket and reservation at any rail station. Any time of year is good. When I did the trip in the summer, the trains were pretty empty. Could be full of skiiers at weekends till March.

			Your father has the contract with the CC company and thus the travel insurance claim should only be done by him.   
Be prepared for two things: 
1. You're not covered as he was not travelling 
2. The insurance will not cover the DSLR   
Check, however, on the terms of your home contents insurance - you might have some coverage for losses (up to a point) 50km or further from your home address.

Airlines can't just refuse to accept responsibility for damage if it was caused negligently. But, is there something you are not telling us? Just how loyal a flyer are you by the way? What colour FF card do you have?   
This passage comes from the Swiss website:         
The air carrier is liable for destruction, loss or damage to baggage up to 1'131 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency). In the case of checked baggage, it is liable even if not at fault, unless the baggage was defective. In the case of unchecked baggage, the carrier is liable only if at fault.

			You may have trouble finding an   place up by the lifts for one Saturday night, but near us is the Bergheim Hotel. I know they have rooms that sleep up to 4 or 5 people and I seem to remember that they are very cheap. Unfortunately you would have to get the bus from the hotel to the lifts and the last one down is at about 8pm.... the hotel is located at the Bergheim hairpin at about 1100m.   
Otherwise, think about staying at Untertezen and getting the long cable car up from Wallensee in the morning.

			There are several options and it depends a little on what you want to do and on your budget.    
One option would be exploring Switzerland. As you life close to Zurich that could easily be done from home which means you could spend the nights at home and spend the money safed (meaning not spent for hotels) on other things. Depending on what you've already done you could go to see Lucerne ( ?), the Zoo in Zurich ( ), the Technorama in Winterthur ( ), the children museum in Baden ( ), the Alpamare in Pfäffikon ( ). You could go ice-skating in Zurich or Zug or you could ""to the mountains"" for some walking or to go sledging. There are many option within easy access (even by train). For children I would suggest Braunwald or Elm maybe Hoch-Ybrig or Flumserberg (but check if there is enough snow for sledging). Braunwald has a nice Kinderhotel more info  . But note: all these places might get crowded as everyone is on vacation...   
Another option would be to go outside of Switzerland. Just walk into one of the Hotelplan (should also offer Migros-Reisen or M-Budget Ferien) or Kuoni or TUI travel agencies they might be able to provide you with ideas. Also Aldi and Coop have flyers with offers.    
Enjoy the first holiday here!

There is a separate private operator which operaters the Interlaken--Jungfraujoch line. The link here shows all the destinations covered with half-fare card & addon cards from SBB    
Your best bet will be to check at Interlaken tourism office/website if they have some current offers/discounts for the Jungfrau trip.      Well it can be done from Basel in a day trip but you need to start early. I will recommend a overnight stay at Interlaken as you can also cover other places viz. Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen, etc. If you have no plans of skiing, you can do the trip on a nice summer day wherein good views are almost guranteed.

			Fun, just like any Züri event. Book online a hotel  (that is what I did) through any of the hotel booking  sites. Google ""Zurich Hotels"" . Those in Oerlikon (easy to get to on the s-bahn) and the airport are less expensive. Buy your tickets ahead for any of the parties you are interested in:

			In the larger lower level cities, the weather is similar to your home country so just bring warm jackets, gloves and shawls. There is a very good site in Dutch, at   and then select your language I think.   If you go to Bern definitely check out the restaurants. If you want cheap (well for the Swiss) Asian food, go the markethall restaurants at Bubenbergplatz opposite the railway station. Anyone in Bern would know these if you cannot find the entrance; they are all located in a large hall.

			Yes, it is do-able and not too difficult with careful planning.   
A few tips: 
--get one of these to help in travel, a very useful investment  www.lillygold.com     --a lot will depend on the age&amp;temperment of your children.  We tried to avoid such long airtravel when child(ren) were between 1.5 and 3 years, the worst age to travel in our experence.  Younger and older were better ages to fly.   
--search and get direct routes when at all possible, even extending a terminal drive in car by a few hours to avoid another shorthaul flight.  Connections are always problematic and high risk of missing connecting flight, avoid at all costs.   
--search airport play areas or places to let off steam in advance.  Plan to go there during stop-overs, delays, etc. and make them run around during that time, they will then sleep more during travel.  Ditto for getting out to play before leaving for airport.   
--preparation and plan ahead, ie. read books to young children about flying to get them used to the idea, pack activities and comfort objects, bring snacks and non-messy finger foods.

			I would suggest going to the Jura area, it is not too far from Basel and has quite a lot to offer.  Depending on the weather, if snow, there is a fair amount of snow activities.  Alternatively, there is the buffalo park, caves, etc.

			The train will run every Saturday between 29th January and 19th  March, leaving Geneva at 1.40pm. It will travel direct only to stations  connected to ski resorts, so will be stopping at Aigle, Martigny, Sion,  Sierre, Leuk, Visp and Brig. Resorts easily accessed from these  stations include Saas Fee, Verbier, Crans Montana, Nendaz and Leukerbad.

			You could look at the Hotel Aspen which is just above Grindelwald. I know they have children of their own and the hotel has a small childrens area.   
Otherwise the Belvedere has a lot of families out during the season so they could be an option, but I think they could be quite pricey.

			The best, where we take our grandchildren and out-of-town beginner friends is La Tour, near Chamonix.  Stay in Chamonix for the nightlife/apres-ski, but ski at La Tour on the beginner slopes.     
They have completely flat runs for absolute nubies, and then two or three easy slopes for people who want to branch out from their snow-plow stances to a more parallel stance.   
Highly recommend.

			Hello All,   
I was thinking of going to Milan the weekend before Xmas to go shopping. I want to get my husband a nice leather (messenger type) bag for Christmas and can't find a nice, reasonable one here. I was thinking Milan might be a good place to go?! I was thinking about leaving on December 17th on a 7pm train from Zurich after work. The total trip is 3 hours 41 minutes  and only 38 CHF roundtrip if you have a GA pass! There are some cheap private room hostels to stay in too. Any other ladies want to go? (sorry men, its for room sharing). I thought to come back Sunday sometime during the day. Also, have some good Italian food/wine  Let me know, or if anyone knows about buying leather there or here too, that would be appreciated.

			I think the tourism website   offers exactly what you're looking for. They have access to a MASSIVE database of holiday homes and apartments throughout the country; it includes all the listings from Reka, Interhome and e-Domizil, and private listings too. Their search function is also highly useful: not only can you refine your search based on the obvious things (region of the country, rental location [in a village, on a lake, in the countryside, etc.]), you can also discriminate based on more specific needs you may have, such as wheelchair accessibility, acceptability of pets, swimming pool... etc.   
This is the largest database for holiday accommodation in Switzerland I've found so far. Hopefully you can find what you need for a great holiday.

			Hi all 
I saw in a post on here awhile ago someone mention helicopter sightseeing flights out of Zermatt from these      
Basically 210CHF per person for a 20min flight out of Zermatt up around the matterhorn etc.   
I would absolutely love to do this! 
Problem is I'm here by myself and they need a minimum of 4 people to go... 
So just wondering if anyone out there in EF land was interested in going???    
I'm only in CH till the 22nd of December so it would need to be before then, and preferable on a weekend but other wise I'm flexible.   
I was planing on just training up there for the day and back (I'm in Bern).    
Just to throw another spanner in the works because of weather constraints it can only be booked the day before as they won't know any earlier than that if they are going to fly or not.   
If anyone is keen please please please let me know and we'll organise something!

Also arrives at Paris Gare de Lyon though, so you still have to make the way through the city to Gare du Nord.  And coming to Gare de Lyon at 13:03, you are going to just miss by a short while the Eurostar leaving Gare du Nord at 13:04.   
Still not bad.  Taking this service, you can then continue with the Eurostar departing Paris at 15:13 to arrive in London at 16:36.  That's a total of 8h26m, including plenty of time for changing over in Paris and getting even a proper meal there.  Great if you have acquaintances there you can arrange to meet for an hour and a half.        Do you know of any other operator taking passengers through the tunnel? 
Of course others operate cargo trains, and Eurotunnel itself operates the shuttle for car transport.  But as far as I know Eurostar is the only passenger service.   
According to   last year, it will be opened up for competition though, and the competitor might be Deutsche Bahn.

			So I`ll be leaving soon and need some suggestions as to what I could do for my last free day in Switzerland here. I really wanted to try paragliding but the weather doesn`t seem to be cooperating so I don`t know if it`ll work tomorrow.   
Been to most of the touristy places, haven`t been to south eastern part of Switzerland - like Chur.    
What might I do tomorrow? Thun, Basel? St. Catherines Festival and Market in Sierre? St. Martin's Fair and Market in Porrentruy? Luzern's transportation museum (been to Luzern twice but haven't visited). Or even  a xmas marktet?   
Is it worth it to try to go see the Onion Market in Bern for like an hour or two in the morning?

			In the next 2 - 3 weeks which would be the best outing for a family with 2 kids (3 yrs, 8 months)? It could be a day trip or if required with a night stay.   
Some thoughts have been - Montreux / Vevey, Interlaken / Thun, Geneva, Zermatt / Matterhorn.   
Skiing is not an option but sledging might be... or just soak in the nature...

			Check the other recent skiing threads -many resorts for easy Geneva access. 
French side: La Clusaz nearest I think, Morzine, Les Gets, Avoriaz= Portes du Soleil. Or Portes du Soleil resorts from Swiss side : Torgon nearest with access to Chatel, super Chatel, then Morgins, Champery/Les Crozets (from there ski down to Avoriaz), Villars, Leysin, Verbier 4 Vallées (cheaper to access from Veysonnaz, Thyon 2000, or Haute Nendaz. All great resorts with their own character. Geneva-La Clusaz 56 mins according to tcs.ch. I like La Clusaz because it is a real small town, rather than just a resort.   
You've also got the Jura- much cheaper and great for day trips. But check the snow levels, as they are much lower altitude. StCroix/Les Rasses, Metabief/Jougne, ans so many others.

The artist too is a lovely chap, straight down the line, down to earth and no bullshit. Should you meet him he'll be much obliged to tell you how he managed to X-Ray the fine filigree of Kylie's knickers, a mini and even an airplane. It really is a fascinating process.

			Why go so far? From Geneva you can get to so many ski/alpine resorts going either way around Lake Leman (Geneva)? Nearest being Leysin, Villars, Gstaad, Les Diablerets, Morgins, Chatel - or by the other side La Clusaz, Morzine and so many others (sorry but Avoriaz is an ugly concrete jungle). If you don't want to ski, how about a spa resort, with lots of hot water pools as well as snow, walking, skating, sledging, etc. Charmey is lovely, near Gruyères, but Ovronnaz even better (to the right of the Rhone Valley, above Saillon (near Sion).

Thanks for any help.      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Oekotel Zurich's first Apart hotel?	spec	Posts: 32

			My favourite for a not completely skiing oriented stay would be Gstaad - great town with a car free main street, great walking and hiking besides skiing and a great balance between relaxing and ""not boring"". Not cheap through.

			We stopped this weekend at the Kambly cookie factory outlet in Trubschachen and it was cheap and fabulous!  They have bulk cookies of every kind but they also have great gift basket assortments and lots of nice gift-packed cookies.   
We bought a beautiful basket with six different kinds of cookies for 25 CHF for our landlord for Xmas, but they have gifts for even less than that.  A real find, that outlet.

			we got to locarno in the afternoon  
it is so much warmer here than zurich  hurray 
it is about 20 degrees celcius 
we took a great walk by the lake and enjoyed pizza at a local place 
tomorrow i am going to try to convince the teenager to hike  
wish me luck  
so great to be here  
only two hours from zurich and what a difference 
only complaint is the coffee i got  
a lukewarm tasteless coffee which is supposed to be lato macchiato  
is a smaller tasteless brother of the drink you usually get  in zurich  
 i hope this is just because it was a pizza pasta place  
but the service was so nice, the italian waiter treats his job as holy  
i love that 
it is a family place, not too exciting but it is nontheless pretty and the full moon is an added attraction  
dog is relaxed too but because of her we can not attend  a classic concert and i have seen some banned dogs signs outside tally weil  
for exemple which makes me wonder and teenager upset 
at the moment i am forced to watch ""south park"" in exchange for i promise to hike tomorrow by teenager.. we shall see..  "	considered unworthy	Join Date: Oct 2010	Groaned at 20 Times in 15 Posts	[Going] loco in locarno [searching entertainment tips]	starshine	Posts: 83

Everyone and their dog want to deal in real estate, especially in a ""hot"" area such as Lake Como (and yeah - it's all George and Giorgio's fault, LOL). 
Ideally the best thing would be to go through the for sale adverts in the newspapers and look for anything with ""No intermediari"" (i.e. no middlemen) or ""No Agenzie"" (i.e. no real estate firms), which implies that the owner prefers a direct P-2-P sale.

We turned up around 2.15 and there were more stallholders than punters.

			Hello from southern Ticino :-)   
The Biasca region...hmmm. 
You will definitely like Val di Blenio, there's plenty of hikes up to the dams (Diga del Luzzone), and up to the Lucomagno (Lukmanier) pass. 
In Olivone you may have some chance of finding cozy accomodation (and good food!) at the Osteria Centrale ( ).   
In the Airolo region, you will want to hike/walk up the Val Bedretto and the Nufenen pass. An amazing variety of cheeses are produced up there by the way. I have never slept in Airolo / Bedretto so I cannot recommend any hostels firsthand, sorry.   
Do not miss the Ritom lake - a panoramic cablecar will take you up, and then it's up to your legs ;-)   
You might be able to find bike rent in Airolo @ the sports shops.   
If you need anything else pls feel free to drop me a line!   
Paul

			I've only done one, which was in Northern California, and I'm afraid I found it kind of boring, too...  But then I was a teenager at the time and practicing the art of boredom, as one does.  But it was mostly very far up, so I could not see much detail of the landscape below me (would probably be more interesting here with all the mountains) and all you could really hear was the whooshing of the gas being heated up into the balloon.  Probably the most exciting part was the landing and trying not to tip the basket over.   
Now the tandem thing sounds awesome!

			Thank you Snowbear   
I  was curious on what the laws are out there for going up places like the  Lavaux vineyards in Vaud, or up the hills in Bettingen by Basel. In  California many mountain areas, forests and hills are considered  trespassing on private property and are not accessible. They'll call the  police or shoot at me for walking on there property. So  in Switzerland can I walk freely and explore all that there is to  offer? Do I need some type of pass to walk through there? Or will I get  fined or face other types on consequences?    
Thank you!

			Having travelled across most of Switzerland, the only places that I wouldn't be in a hurry to visit again have been the 'up-market' resorts of Davos, St. Moritz and Verbier.     
As towns they have little to offer in themselves in the way of Swiss individuality.  I would only consider them as stopping points for other attractions in the area.  I am sure that they have their fans here, particularly among the winter sports enthusiasts.   
Switzerland is such a diverse country that you are likely to find something of interest wherever you go.

NY is really not expensive in international terms, tourist experience is probably different, aren't they always.   
The reason for ZH being expensive has little to do with this guy says, imo. Of course, the NY Times loves stereotypes about other countries. I gave up reading their travel section after living in Europe and figuring out how clueless they are about things.   
Though, this is probably one of the better write ups I have seen (other than obligatory chocolate and banking references).

			I went to the one in Charmey about 4 years ago. However I arrived a tad late and was queueing in traffic up to the village just when a load of cows were running down the road, and one managed to drag its cow bell over my bonnet, leaving a lovely scratch and a dent.   
When I rang the insurance company (Zurich) and explained, they said no problem, they get dozens of claims for cow damage this time every year. 
At the end of the cow running day, there were an awful lot of cars parked along the main road out of Charmey with dents, scratches and mirrors hanging off.   
It's a great event, well worth seeing.  
For Charmey, arrive early and don't park on the main road though. 
It's also very, very busy.

			I would agree with the more recent posters. The lake route is not really by the lake. There are some charming villages to negotiate (Coppet, Nyon, Rolle) but there's not much of a view and you can't see the lake. Nearly all the way the strip of land between the road and the lake is wooded private property with villas and chateaux. And there are some rather miserable bits as well: the charm of la cote shopping warehouse area anyone?    
The autoroute out of Geneva is quite scenic (so long as the traffic is moving) and you get good views of the French Alps and the Jura. Then take the route vignoble and you get superb views across the lake.

			Actually, In MADRISA in DAVOS. You will find a very nice daycare falicity. They have a very large play area  including private sleeping facilites.  The rates are very reasonable compared to hotels eg: 25 chf vs. 7.-10 chf per hour.  Its next to the restaurant and madrisa has a great kiddy play club with ski facilities for older children and they DO speak ENGLISH!!  Distance wise about 2.5 hours from Zurich

			If i'm flying back to London on a Friday night, i take the cheapest option - usually EasyJet - because whatever time i arrive, and whoever I fly with, the day will be finished when i get to London. So i usually put up with the slog coming in from Gatwick to Central London.    
But the flight back to Zurich on Sunday evenings, i usually take from City Airport, whose location is so convenient. And like i said, works out to £56 if you book about 8 weeks in advance.   
Kash.

			From what I understand Mystery park closed down some time ago. You can still see the tacky completely foreign looking buildings there. Yes the cheap commercialism really irritated me as well. I guess money is king.    
My original roots are in the Himalayas and I personally feel at home in Switzerland as far as nature is concerned. What I find most amazing is that mountains back home were in the 7000-8000+ meters region compared to Jungfrau which is only 3500-4158 meters high   Jungfrau does not even feature in the top 100 highest mountain peaks of the world    
As far as access is concerned Jungfrau probably wins hands down. Definitely an amazing engineering feat! Once we got on the actual glacier the typical tourist crowd disappeared. We walked for hours on the ice away from all the Bollywood and Japanese/Chinese/Korean crowd. Bless them all but we wanted peace and quiet with mother nature.    
I am still very ill and stuck to bed. Fever is not in the 40°C region anymore but still constantly around 38.5°C. Feel like a wreck and dizzy all the time   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2008	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	2-3 day trip to Interlaken?	cheese hole	Posts: 19

With a few places to stop and get a drink. If it’s a weekend or evening you get to see a lot of the locals and sample a bit of Zurich atmosphere.     For culture, head town to the Kuntshaus  , its has all the big names, Picasso, Monet, Van Gough. Plus its free with a Zuri Card and about 10mins walk from Belleview     Of course the old town and Utilberg are worth looking up too.     Things in my view to avoid:   1)  The landesmuseum (or Swiss National Musem) you can go and walk around the court yard for free, which is good. But inside I found it rather sterile and noting of significance (especially compared to the British Museum etc al)   2)  Langstrasse (RLD) a lot of tourist books give the impression that’s it’s the edgy/ bohemian part of town and, but in reality if you are looking for that then you are in the wrong town and it just a bit dirty and grim. Useful place for a large pub crawl.   3)  Buy gifts from the shiny shops in Bahnhofstrasse, most things are way cheaper in Migro/Coop and of the same quality, actually my family prefer the chocolates from Coop rather then the swanky stuff I used to get from spungli!  	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Jan 2010	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Top things to do - One day in Zurich?	33foxglove	Posts: 215

			If you want to get up into the mountains fairly cheaply I'd recommend heading to Villars, because the lifts are free for those under 6 and then only 10SF a day for a pass for adults and over 6s.  Our usual walk up there (done with a 4 yr old) is to park at the cable car Roc d'Orsay and take that up to the top, where there are great views of Mt Blanc and Dents du Midi, then walk down to the station (a streep but wide path) and carry on to first the Lac de Bretaye, then the Lac de Chavonnes (good spot for a picnic)  Then it's around the lake for a bit of a steep climb towards Perche, and traverse back to the station, where you can take the mountain train down again.  The whole walk is about 5 - 6km long and should take 3 hours of walking time at slow child pace, but the scenary is great and the kids love the cable car and the train.  If you have time (and energy) left after that, your pass also covers the swimming pool in Villars and mini golf and the ride-on train in Gryon.   
Alternatively in the other direction, Moleson is great too, as Ittigen suggested - take the funi up for 10SF and come down via les cles.  It's a 2 hour walk at child pace, and our daughter loves the toboggan at the end.  It's 6SF a go for adults, but if you can find the ""idees-loisirs"" vouchers they give away at tourist offices and other attractions, you can get 2 tickets for the price of one.

			So I'll be here another 2.5 months and am considering an Eurail select pass but I am not sure which countries to select and what weekend trips might be feasible? I know I'll like to visit Genoa, Rome, Venice, maybe somewhere in Germany, France but am unsure if it is cheaper by train or by flight?    
10 day pass starts at $420 and goes up by ~$30 for each additional country. What might be reasonable weekend trips?    
Travel around switzerland with it might not be worth it since I already have  the half price card.   
Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Sweden..... where to go?

You could stay with us for a few days in Valais. We have a B&B chalet near Crans Montana.

We can supply maps and suggestions to ensure you get the most from a few days here. We have lots of guests touring Switzerland or using us as a stop over from Italy or France.

			My personal favorite will always be Fribourg/Freiburg: beautiful little Uni town smack on the Roestigraben, but with much more of a French influence than a Swiss-German one. Wander through old-town and the cute shops on rue de Lausanne, eat at   or  , stay overnight at the   (mostly for the fantastic Sunday brunch). Recently discovered  , run by a friend of a friend, for late-night drinks and snacks. Fall's a perfect time of year to go, as I believe   will be putting something up again soon.   
If you're into music, it might be worth planning your trip to coincide with a gig at  , is a good venue which has attracted some great acts in the past.   
Hope you have a great time, whether you end up going on your own or with someone else!

It's a good idea...I recently split up from a relationship and decided that I needed to give myself things to look forward to.

			Thanks guys for the suggestion. I guess I'll go to museums in Lausanne this Saturday and then Geneva on Sunday. Now what is there to do in Geneva.    
Ended up going to Roche des Nayes on Sunday since that was the last day for the 18:46 train to run. Didn't get the chance to go see the castle but might head back one day to see the vineyards and the castle. Is the coming down of the cows something worth seeing? Has anyone been up to the castle for Oct 15's scary evening? Is it in English? Or should I wait for the ""Lights on the Lake"" exhibit.   
I wouldn't mind actually traveling 2hrs one way to other places - Lucern and Interlaken seems like worth the try and maybe I could stay the weekend but finding a place to stay would be expensive that day trips might be better.   
Will you be able to ski in Nov?

			Where are you planning on spending the night?  In Rigi Kaltbad?  Then the best alternative is to take either the Rigi Bahn from Vitznau or the Cable Car from Weggis.   
The cheapest variation (besides hiking) is to park at the Rigi Scheidegg parking lot and take the small cable car up.  It's a nice walk to Rigi Kaltbad (about 1.5).  Take the same route back or take the Rigibahn back down to the Scheidegg station.

I guess that could affect the Swiss trains as well (?), at least we have sometimes French trains going from Basel to Zurich.   
My company seams to take this pretty seriously and advices us to stay alert and keep low profile around the rallies.

			Everywhere Dude, anywhere.   
Pick a place, grab a train if within 8 hours, otherwise fly.  No need for bookers, etc.   
After the non-existen summer we've had, you might take this last chance to grab some sun in southern France, Spain, or Italy.  All easy to get to from here.  Cheap always, very cheap with the current exchange rate.  For cities: Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, Nice, Milan, Florence, ...

			Did anyone go to the Rote Fabrik, Zurich last night?    
I went and at about midnight they had a Swiss spoken word artist on who everyone was finding incredibly funny...I know in one bit he re-did Iggy and the Stooges 'I wanna be your dog' I THINK with different Swiss lyrics and putting in 'Zurich' where normally it would say some other place....   
I just wondered if anyone with a better command of Swiss German had seen it and could shed some light on what he was doing...? I understood about 10 words of it, but everyone else was practically rolling on the floor   Looked good.

			Hi All,   
I've been searching around trying to find a thread about where everyone goes for a Sunny Beach Holiday and where people share their little gems of a holiday which they're willing recommend however have not been able to find anything so i thought i'd start one off as one of the problems I've found since being here is that the places i used to go are now double my budget given the crazy flights prices to somewhere like portugal or Spain whereas from the UK they were peanuts.   
anyway, here's my one:   
Fly From / To : Zurich / Faro 
Resort/Town: Aldea du Golf 
Acomodation:  
Budget : Circa 2000 CHF for 1 week  
When : Oct 2009   
Verdict: Fantastic place to stay and ideal for Families with children of all ages.  the Villa is spacious and on a lovely little complex and the owner (privately owned) charges very reasonable rates.  The local beaches are clean and there's a little fishing marina with restaurants all the way along. There lots to do here for all the family. If you want to go clubbing every night this is not the place to go.  If you are a Golf fan though this place is ideal as its in the middle of about 5 Golf courses.   
And no, this is not my villa, and please dont advertise your own properties.   
Thanks.

			The waldenburg hike was great! We just got back. We saw llamas, cows, sheep, goats, waterfalls, etc. The restaurant at the top of the mountain was good too. Their sausage was homemade and well worth the trip. On the way down you have 3 choices: the cable cars, renting mountain scooters (basically just scooters fitted with sturdier wheels and hand breaks) or walking. We walked and were so glad we did. We would have never seen the waterfalls if we had taken the cable cars. We then walked through a town before we picked up the bus. A few of the houses sell homemade jams, cider, and syrups. All in all a very fun day.

			Thank you all very much for posting suggestions. I believe Loorenkopf is the right place. I travelled there from Oslo on Sunday 8th August with my mother, brother and son. We found the tower and climbed it. As you mentioned, we could see both Zurichsee and Greifensee from the top. It was raining most of Sunday, but just as we parked the car, the rain stopped and we were able to walk up without getting too wet.   
Unfortunately, we were not able to find Heiliger weg, although as one person we spoke to at the top of the tower commented, ""you are bound to find it... you just have to see the light!""   
Thanks again, 
Michael

			Does anyone know if after the match in Bern, which is Tuesday the 17th whether extra/later trains will be put on to get back to Geneva or Lausanne?    
I've searched alot of sites and found nothing, the last train from Bern is around 23.10 and with the match finishing at the earlist 22.30 and chances of away fans being held behind until the home fans exit it could be very tight. Someone has mentioned buses are sometimes provided but again I can't find and info.   
Any help will be greatly received!

			This is about that lovely leisure period between work and home.   Looking for the best genuine route home i.e. no going from Zurich to Wallisellen via Sank Gottard  .   
I think the best route is mine but looking for challengers.   
Oerlikon - Pfaffikon (ZH) - Hitnau - Bauma - Steg - Huftegg Pass - Butschwil - Lichtensteig - Wasserfluh Pass - Neckertal   
2 (count them) passes - only lickle ones but they count  .   
61 km - best time 65 mins worst time 75 mins   
This is 10 km shorter than using the highway and about 10 to 20 mins longer in time.   
Time doesn't count stopping for a quick panache at the top of Huftegg  .

			I'm with Swissbob on this one.  My redneck roots wouldn't be satisfied by the Swiss version of the sport, which is basically watching someone plow a field with a regular old tractor.   
Maybe instead, you can come down to our place to watch the motor racing.  I'll be driving my normal car, starting from my house and finishing at my office.  There will be other cars too, of course, starting from their homes and finishing at their offices.  The racecourse is clearly marked 'autobahn', and the race is held daily Monday-Friday.    
It may look like commuting to you but rest assured -- this is Switzerland and we're professionals.  It's racing.

			Firstly, enjoy as it is a great and wonderful place in both summer and winter. Depending on how much time you have and how inclined you ar to enjoy the outdoors you can squeeze it in to one day, or enjoy several days.     
I have stayed in the Hoheneck (cheap & cheerful), Sonnwendhof (good with access to the Ramada pool and facilities, so value for money) and the Ski Lodge (fun and occasionally offering deals). So the best bet is to scout the internet for some deals.        
Loads of people go just for the day and head up to the Titlis. However you miss some of the beauty of the place and a lot more that there is on offer.     
Great beginner Via Ferrata for those inclined to easy and fun climbs. From the Brunnihutte and you can hire kit from Intersport in town for 25CHF for the day.       Markers with easy-to-understand information on the flora found at the foot of the Titlis, on a variety of flower species and on how they thrive.  
Details: easy, 1260/1760 m, ¾ h. My top tip here though is to walk down from the lake to the untertrubsee and then you can hire Trotti bikes (like a robust scooter) for ~5-7chfs. Then instead of walking the last bit to the village you can free-wheel back to the bottom. Great fun and I have seen ages 8-62 enjoy!      The tickle trail by the top station of the Brunni chairlift offers a special kind of thrill. The barefoot path round the idyllic “Härzlisee”, at 1860 metres above sea level, is unique in the mountains. Over a 220 m route nature can be experienced at close hand and your general well-being enhanced. It only take 30 min to walk the last bit and the going is easy so you can skip the chairlift if you are feeling fit & healthy. A walk up to the Brunnhutte from the village is probably 2-3hrs depending on fitness and you can always take the lift down again!     
Still plenty of nice places to eat during the evening, so not totally closed like some smaller resorts during the summer.   
Go for it and enjot!

			This   14th-15th August isn't really folklore in its original sense, but given the venue and the background, the bells and the flags, it isn't an ordinary 'day out' either.   
Great fun to watch and be part of. Take something to sit on (on the grass slope); if the weather is sunny, take sun-cream, plenty to drink and a sun-shade.   
If you walk to the hill from the station along the Alp Stream at the back of the houses and someone says something about 'private'. Don't jump to the conclusion that he is complaining. It might be the same guy who talked to us last year. We thought for a moment that he was moaning about us going using his private path - actually he was apologising that this was his private path and he should have swept it better!    
Have fun.

			Hi,    
we are having visitors for this weekend, with a toddler.   We don't have extra car seat available, so if anyone in forum is having one child seat available to lend or to rent, I'd be grateful.   
I need it from today until Sunday evening.   I can pick it up and return anywhere in or around Basel.   
Thanks in advance!

			Thanks all!   
I know that is worth it to pay!! I have been to Zermatt (Matterhorn) to Jungfrau (expensive but amazing) to Pilatus...all fantastic. But not everyone can pay this. I did it when I was in a great situation but now is not the case. My brother and his wife are coming from Spain, If you are not aware, the salaries in Spain are pretty low. My brother earns 700 Euros a month and his wife doesn't work. For them, just the flight here is a huge thing. And of course, the only reason they are coming is because I am here and the accomodation is gratis. But I want them to experience the best of switzerland. In other moment of my life I would pay for their train tickets, but now I am not in my best moment as I said. I hope some of you understand that is not a matter of people doesnt want to pay it...maybe they can not.   
I appreciate all your tips, and now is completely decide the Rigi!!!   
Thank you

			There is a place called Sport hotel or Hotel Sporting or something like that.... it's a few years since I stayed there so it probably costs more now but I would imagine it's 65 CHFs or so now. It's a no-star - so no frills, but being Swiss that's perfectly OK - clean, tidy, fine.

			If you're flying out of Zurich airport, you could try seeing if the airline can upsell your flight out of Geneva - might make it a little cheaper than the 500 CHF plus a roundtrip flight costs.  
However, flying with liitle 'uns on such short distances is almost more of a nuisance than it's worth. 
Final point in favor of the train is that flying only saves you about 1/2 hour versus the train once you've factored in checking in and getting out of hte airport...

			Possibly the beach and islands that have been built on the shore of Urnersee from the basistunnel excavations just at the mouth of the Reuss. You can get there by parking behind Fluelen station then follow the footpath signs for the swiss way. There is a wide rocky beach for a few hundred metres, childrens play area, several bbq spots and a further 20 minutes walk to the restaurant at Seedorf. Great place to take the kids for a day.    
Or just get the train to Fluelen its an easy flat walk with kids that would take about 40 minutes.   
see link and associated PDF for details, I can't think of anywhere else from your description but it seems a long way to travel to Fluelen from Hunenberg for a kindergarten trip.. Good Luck!

			A few of my friends and I are thinking about booking a chalet for a weekend in the Lauterbrunnen area for a group of 10-12 people. The idea is to go hiking/cycling/rafting in the mountains and be surrounded by scenic views. Based on some initial research, it seems that Lauterbrunnen/Interlaken would be a good place to go. We are planning on going either over July 23rdor July 31st weekend, or will end up postponing the trip until first week of September. I have a few questions and would appreciate help from you guys on the same!   
1) Renting the Chalet - Is there a website that lists rentals for such a large group? I tried googling it but most of the cabins/apartments I find cater to a group of 4-6 people. Is it too ambitious to expect to find something for 10-12 of us?   
2) Weather: It's about 80F in Zurich, so I'm expecting Lauterbrunnen to be around 65F (I believe that's around 20C?), would this be correct? If we do push the trip back to September, what kind of weather should we be expecting?    
Thanks in advance - may come back with a couple of other questions as we get closer to picking a date and figuring out all the different things we want to do there   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Booking a Chalet for 12 in Lauterbrunnen area	jigz	Posts: 63

			It depends on 1) your driving skills and 2) where you go.    
Some of the Autovia's I've been on are literally ""whiteknuckle"" experiences. I remember driving to Genova and then Livorno and overtaking hundreds of trucks whilst weaving up/down a mountain is not for the faint hearted. I'm a good driver and it was a small challenge for me.   
Parking in Rome and Milan etc is a nightmare. City car parks are not as expensive as you think though and if you find hotels with FREE (or relatively cheap 10-20Euro/night) parking then I'd drive as long as ur confident with your ability.    
The main reason to drive is the cost compared to the train/plane option. But its horses for courses...... take care and enjoy   
PS hire a scooter in Rome, its an amazing experience - when in Rome blah blah. I take no responsibility for ur safety though as its a personal risk thingy.

			You can pick up a train to get to the bottom of the Glacier 3000 lift from either Aigle or Montreux. I don't know the journey via Gstaad, you need to catch the post bus, but they are similar times. You could go up one way and back the other. The Postbus runs from Gstaad to Diablerets via the pass Col-du-Pillon.       
Set the departure as Montreux or Aigle, and destination Glacier 3000   
At Diablerets there is a Postbus which stops next to the station, and takes  11 minutes to the cable car.     "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2005	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Travel to Glacier 3000	meenakshi	Posts: 66
2634	06.07.2010, 18:12	Junior Member	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Yverdon	"    Agreed, the Niesen has an awesome Panoramma.   
If you have a car you can make the Jungfrau cheaper by driving to Grindelwald.   
If you're up for a hike do First then walk to the Faulhorn then down to Busalp then down to Grindi, that would be a pretty cheap day I think.   
But for me the Jungfrau is awesome and a once in a life time thing. If you can walk from there to the Munch hutte - extends the day and they do great soup!

			This morning I passed an RVBW (local bus in the Baden/Wettingen region) with the words ""BARBUS"" on it. Now with a name like that, I just had to research.    
Basically it is a bus you can rent if you are organizing an event in the Baden/Wettingen region.    
Here are the details of what it includes.     
So maybe it's time us Badeners had a get together! Some of the best places are a bit remote so the bus might be just the solution.

			Make sure you check the weather before you go and take enough warm/winter clothing to make it comfortable - it was a beautiful sunny 1 degree when we went with friends in Spring...   
Really, you go just for the view, and the snow. Make sure you have snow boots or else you won't be comfortable making snowmen or throwing too many snowballs...   
Otherwise, there's just a restaurant and a terrace at the top...and lots of skiers...and the glacier at the very top...

			Hello all,   
Just to give you an update.  I did my first trip from mitteland CH - Paris - mitteland CH - safe and sound.  It was almost 7.5 hours including toilet/coffee and sandwich stops.  toll fee paid cost around EUR 37.  It was indeed cheaper than using the TGV (at least for 3 people).   
thanks so much for those suggestions.

			Depends who I'm flying with. EJ, I have to drop bag, so not much difference. Swiss, the machines in deps are easy and simple, so often use them, or check-in at the office as I work for em. 
Miss Lizzy, I'll happily take your window seat, much prefer them. Also prefer them facing forward, but can't always manage that :-)

			I will be travelling to London a couple of times in the next year and am looking for a cheap place to stay near Piccadilly. Online I found for instance Curzon Plaza Mayfair Hotel, does anyone know that? I would like a room to myself, so backpackers probably not the ideal thing. But for the rest I am not too picky, should just be clean and in close distance to Piccadilly. 
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

			Hi All,   
Leaving Switzerland in a couple of months   .  One of the things I will miss most of all will be the snowboard freeriding (spent a lot of time around Andermatt and Engelberg last season).    
As part of my departure coping strategy I am promising myself a few return visits next season for weekends off piste.   
So:  who is willing to recommend their favorite swiss freeriding guide / tour outfits to me so I can already plan for some serious - but hopefully safe powder weekends for next season?     
Thanks!   
Alex

			Here some tips for travelling in Switzerland. Something that I had liked to read when I arrived here.   
If you want to travel around Switzerland during your stay here, it's good that you think 2 thinks, when are you gonna travel and how often. If you are thinking on travelling to all the famous and nice cities of the country (recommended) it's worth that you buy the halbtax card. It can be also interesting that you buy the Gleis 7. However as I said, all depends on where are you gonna travel. those cards seem to be very useful, nevertheless if you have no fixed dates for your trips you could just wait for the offer. In that case it's good to know that during some periods, sbb puts the Supersaver tickets where the price different between have or not to have halbtax is pretty small.  Also the daypass tickets which price changes in time are really good. With them you can travel wherever you want and as many times as you wish during 24 h. Some weeks ago I went with my friends to Interlaken and we decided once over there to go also up to the mountains. the ones without halbtax nor Gleis 7 bought the daypass and the could go around the mountain and the city for 45 ch (daypass price on that date) however in my case, having halbtax and gleis 7 I had to pay 48 ch without going even to the very top of the mountain and having the limitation of coming back only after 7.   
So summarizing get to know about every option before you buy your tickets. Personally I didn't take profit of them.

			Hi,   
I came across this information in one of the stands at the Expat Expo in Basel, but forgot to take the newsletter with me.  
I went to the SBB[Basel] office this afternoon and asked them for 'PAss Evasion'. They say that one cannot buy it here but maybe in the Alsace region or at the SNCF ticket machine. I did go there but the machine has everything in French and I could not understand anything.    
Does anyone know of this weekend tickets?. I asked for the normal fare to Starsbourg and its about CHf50 with half tax.   
Any information is appreciated.   
Thanks.

I shall be happy to meet up with people at the Kunstmuseum who wish to see the new exhibition for free!   
By attending tomorrow at 12:00 not only do you see a great exhibition but you also avoid the entrance fee of 10 CHF and get a free coffee in the coffee shop afterwards.   
So email me at   to let me know you'll be along to see the show.   
I look forward to meeting up with you

			We have been to Dubai 3 times and I think you should definitely get out of the airport. Anyone staying in the Dubai airport for 19 hrs is crazy -- there is nothing to do. You have to go through customs anyways.   
Yes it's hot, but so what. Stay inside. The cabs are cheap and will take you anywhere you want to go. Want to check out Palm Island and see The Atlantis Hotel, the cabs will take you there. Want to check out the largest mall in the world, the cabs will take you there. The malls are amazing, more decor and thought put into the design than anything I have ever seen in my life. Want to eat amazing food for cheap, this is the place. Go to Jumeriah Mosque for a tour -- one of the only mosques open to the public. Check out the spice market, gold market, in old Dubai (outside) or the diamond market, which is inside and also sells lots of gold for cheap. Go skiing in the mall, pay for 2 hrs and they rent everything to you.    
Oh and you can negotiate with the cabbies if you want to hire one for the entire day -- they are in need of $$ and will negotiate.   
Good luck, explore and have fun!

			I presume that your son actually registered here as a member.    
If he had given us a little more information it would be easier to give advice. The Student Card should enable him to have reduced entrance to Museums - but I don't know by how much. At the Landesmuseum in Zürich the difference is only Fr. 8.- to Fr.10.-    
A  would give him free entrance to many Museums but there doesn't seem to be a cheaper Pass for a student. Some Swiss Travel System cards are also valid for free entrance but not the 1/2 Price Card and there are special arrangements for Raiffeisen Bank clients holding certain cards.    
Whether your son would save money by buying a Museum Pass depends completely on how many Museums he intends to visit. Pure maths.

			Colmar is not just a great little spot. It is a must-see destination. I  could give it a pass only at Christmas, when the Christmas market comes  unto the town and obliterates it with people and people and people and  things.   
There are many lovely spots in Alsace, but what makes Colmar a must is  the Isenheim altarpiece at the Museum  . It doesn't matter if you like art or not, these works are worth crossing Europe to visit. A trip to Colmar without seeing these paintings would be woefully incomplete.

			You can look for the train schedules at   that will give you a flavor of what you can achieve. The trip to Paris takes about 5 hours, so if you go there from Lausanne you may have about 3-4 hours for visiting the city and catch a train back. I believe the trip to Milan is shorter but I've never made it by train, so again, have a look at the CFF page so you can plan your trip. 
Hope this helps.

			Hey everyone!     
My boyfriend and I are heading down to Valais this weekend to get in some wine tasting and hiking.  Our original plan was to go wine tasting on Saturday (possibly on bikes), find a place to camp that night and then do some hiking on Sunday.  Now that there is rain once again in the forecast, that freewheeled plan may not be the best idea anymore.     Do any of you have any suggestions on the following for us?:   
1. Any wineries you recommend that we could pop into to do some tasting this Saturday 
2.  Suggestions for getting around to the different wineries in the area in the rain. 
3.  Lodging recommendations (we are open to villa-style, farms or anything fun like that) that are relatively affordable (less than 100CHF).  We really like this farm we found in Greyere so something similar near the Valais wineries would be great:  
4.  Some hikes that would be great on Sunday in the area considering the rain and current snow line.

			A quick day-trip if you enjoy sun, steep hikes, history and castles is the gorgeous town of Bellinzona in Ticino. I was there last weekend and it is amazing. A quick 2.5 hour train ride from Zurich makes it easy to do in a day trip. You can do a variety of hikes from cardiac-arrest to easy sightseeing ones that include access to the main castle by elevator. Plus you get to practice your Italian...

			Many camping sites do not allow dogs because the idea of sleeping on a nice piece of grass where a dog has been isn't very popular. But some camp sites do allow them, and some do so only in low season.    
The German motoring club ADAC is in my opinion the best for searching for good sites,   (over 5,000 sites in Europe) You need to enter the country names in German language and click on ""Hunde erlaubt""

			What a silly day eh? It is just soo frustrating not having rain raining down on you, lovely watery wet water and cold to boot, two days of sunshine and I am pining for the rain.. 
Ha! Ha! Ha! got you there didn´t I? 
For today´s run I had planned on taking y´all over the Silvreta pass in Austria´s Montafon area. 
The pass has been open for a week now but  nature is quite a bugger and the three weeks rain that had been urinating off us valley-dwellers lay crystalline and frozen above 1.2 KM´s over sea-level. 
A avalanche had closed the road on Saturday so this trip is just over eight Clicks and ends at the Silvretta road toll booth.

			I tried posting this in the Pet corner but it didn't get much response. In any case, if anybody is interested in spending 6 weeks (June 24 - August 6) in Engelberg this summer rent-free you should read further. The house is a private chalet with the following view:       
and here is a view of town from the Hahnen:       
Here is some information about the deal copied from the previous post:   
                          Anybody interested in house/pet sitting for 6 weeks from late June to  early August in Engelberg? We have two friendly Australian Shepherds  (age 11 and 15). The younger one likes to go on hikes but the older one  can only handle short, level walks. The house has a small lawn that  needs to be mowed once every couple of weeks (20 minutes max).   
The house is located on the edge of the main town (5 minute walk to the  Dorfstrasse). Engelberg is very nice in the summer with endless hiking  possibilities, decent mountain biking, tennis, golf, swimming, ice rink,  etc.,...   
Ideally this would be for a retired/unemployed individual/couple who  would be around town most of the time and not leaving the dogs  unattended for hours on end. Daytrips are not an issue as there is a  fenced in yard but we would prefer that they not be left alone on a  daily basis. It would also be good for a family with some young kids who  want to enjoy the mountains for a few weeks (we have 3 young kids (2, 4  and 6) and the dogs are great with them).    
We would be willing to pay a nominal fee for this service but we don't  want somebody who is just looking for a job. We want someone that likes  dogs and likes to be in the mountains primarily and has some spare time  to enjoy them.   
Send me a pm if you are interested or want some more details. Thanks.             "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Jan 2008	Groaned at 76 Times in 42 Posts	Free Chalet Rental in Engelberg this Summer	Patxi	Posts: 1,323

			The only events I could see listed in May are :   
  Grand Prix Dijon Côte d'Or     ... 8 & 9 mai   
  Coupes Moto Légende          ........ 29 & 30 mai     
  So it looks like there is nothing going on this coming weekend.   
   I could not find any indication on their site about letting people in  with their own car. 
  But give them a call [+33 (0)3.80.35.32.22]. You are likely to find somebody speaking English.   
  Have fun.

			Thanks for all the suggestions.  Here's the books I've looked at so far and some feedback as I was able to borrow a couple:   
Eyewitness Switzerland - glossy & heavy, though nice photos to get you motivated & inspired but lacking details   
Rick Steve's Switzerland - geared for visitors coming through Switzerland for a week or so, with good itenary and basic recommendations, not too much detail   
Lonely Planet Switzerland - best of the lot so far, fairly detailed & with good recommendations, the hiking section is integrated in the book.  Some of the info or accomodation listings were dated.   
Rough Guide....next on my list, sounds very positive from the comments mentioned!

			What a day, It was fantastic to see y`all in the Verkehrshaus and I really enjoyed your company, just a pity that our timing was a tad out of synch, but we really must do that again. 
I had to run along as I feared that I would not be able to dodge god´s wet bullet, I did not. 
60 Kilometers short of home the sky´s opened and I got ""wet"" wet is in this case a understatement I could not have gotten wetter if I had stood under a ice cold shower wearing jeans on a mo´bike at 100 km/h in watered down wet water, ice cold watered down wet, very wet water, even the bike started to splutter, poor thing had gotten water in the air intake and we lost a cylinder just a few clicks beyond Zürich and then on the creepy stretch of A1 between Zürich and St. Gollum also known as Swiss-Congo where there is no fuel station the red light came on. 
Iron pig wanted gas ASAP. 
Running on fumes, quite literally, I turned of the motorway filled up and dripped my way to pay, as I opened my wallet, poured the water out to find notes that had turned to pap-mache. 
Anyway life is a adventure and as soon as I thaw out I will look back to today with fond memories.

The Honda Asimo robot will be there too, doing shows; he's the little white guy that looks like an astronaut that was in their TV ad a while ago.   
There are some small charges for materials for the workshops, but it's otherwise all free!

			Do you have any home country tradition for Ascension?   
I would like to share with you an almost vanishing tradition that we have in Florence (Italy) for this particular day. On Ascension day (and more recently, as this bank holiday was abolished in Italy, on the following Sunday) there is the ""Cricket Festival"". I know you might think about long lasting plays, etc. This has nothing to do with sports, but with cricket insects. In fact families used to gather in ""Parco delle Cascine"", the biggest park in Florence, and buy crickets in small coloured cages for the kids. Once at home kids were supposed to take care of the cricket and I remember giving lettuce to mine. The festival is still taking place, but as animal activists have forbidden the sale of crickets, you can still buy the coloured cage, but only with a fake cricket inside. 
This tradition goes back to several years, and there were people that lived out of selling crickets and building the small cages. No one knows the origins of this tradition. One idea is that the singing of the crickets announced the arrival of the nice weather (not this year!!!). Another theory is that crickets were damaging the agriculture, so capturing and selling them was a good way of getting rid of the problem!

It is great for skiing in sommer

1. Exactly where you are planning to go? Is it the area between Lac Leman and Sion? 
2. What are you interested in doing? Sightseeing? Hiking? Biking? Do you want to go up into the mountains?  
3. Will you have your own transport or will you be relying on trains?

			As long as you keep a low profile and act like a sensible tourist, I don't see the problem. Dving in the red sea is beautiful also go up to Mount Sinai and do the climb during the night to see the sunrise from the top it is so beautiful. I have lived and worked in quite a few Muslim country at the time of the second Iraq war and I've never had a problem... but I always kept a low profile, respected the country I lived in and avoided  some places like during protestations..

Your idea was great, Bertrand, but the link you give, (in the sub-title Winter Hikes), together with many, many other links, is already on the  Sticky Thread. If you want to add more Info, I'd be grateful if you could put it there.   
I'll think I'd prefer to leave this Thread here though, in case someone looks in this part of the Forum for a day hike, but close it, so that we keep all the Sites, Links and up-to-date information together.

			It took a total of 70 minutes and I'm rebooked! The earliest flight that they could offer me out of Geneva is on Sunday, the 25th of April. I decided to postpone my trip until May in the hopes that the unpronounceable volcano stops erupting by then.   
Some advice for those of you who will be rebooking your flights -   
Go to the bathroom before you call! 
Use your speaker phone and try to ignore the sounds of whatever music comes out of the speaker. I was rebooking with Orbitz, so maybe others will have a better experience.   
I swear that the CIA could use the Orbitz tape for the advanced interrogation of suspected terrorists. I was ready to crack and tell them everything they wanted to know! Fortunately, the guy only wanted my reservation number, name, etc.    
Once again, I wish anyone else in the same position good luck and a healthy dose of patience.

2750	01.09.2008, 21:28	Forum Legend	Thanked 3,030 Times in 1,494 Posts	Location: Wallis	"    All of these places can be done very cheaply. They nearly all have hostels and lower price hotels too. Also for St. Moritz stay in Celerina or Pontrasina. They are much more traditional towns and much less pretentious then St. Moritz. You can still take a stroll through St. Moritz to window shop at the designer stores if you so wish.    
Remember that at that time of year it will be starting to get quite cold in many of those places.    
Try to get a night in Muotas Muragl in Pontrasina. Its at 2300m overlooking the Engadin Valley and apparently has a very good restaurant. I haven't made it up there yet myself but its been on my to do list for quite a few years.    
At that time of year the best thing about Arosa will be the train ride up, but if you like hiking you could use it as a way of getting to Lenzerheide if the lift at Hornli is still open (or if its closed if you don't mind a bit of a slog).    
Again Davos itself is a bit of a let down, the town is much prettier in Klosters, but there is also some great hiking from Davos to Arosa should you so desire.    
Scuol is well worth visiting if you want to look at some nice traditional towns.    
It really depends on what you want to do.

			We've done most of the lake on the CGN boats. In the Spring schedule, which starts this Sunday, they will add even more routes than there are currently. The nicest section is certainly at the east end of the lake - from Lausanne to the Chateau du Chillon (just past Montreux). You'll have vineyards to see on the north side and 2,000m high mountains to the south. The part around Geneva is still very nice, but not AS good. After you get off the boat, you can go visit the Chateau, then maybe head back to Montreux (by bus, train, or boat) for a stroll along the lake and an ice cream or drink.

			I second the Red Roof Inn. Fantastic location almost next to Empire State building and very reasonable price.   
Friend of mine mentioned something about renting private flats right in the middle of manhattan. Apparently found this on the internet - try googling this?   
The Staten Island Ferry is the best thing in New York, and almost free! 
If I would like to look at the Statue of Liberty without having to be on the Ellis Island itself, then I would take the Staten Island Ferry. It passes right next to the Statue of liberty and will cost you only about US1.50. If you are lucky enough not to be asked to leave the ferry and reboard at staten Island, then it is free (you only have to pay if you come on board from the staten Island side). In contrast, the Ellis Island ferry costs about USD12 !!

			heres a recommendation of where NOT to go:   
Mercure Bristol Leukerbad in Leukerbad, Wallis   
I'm SUPER dissapointed in the place. They made us make our treatment reservations well in advance, but didn't comply to our wants in any way. We couldn't have our massages together, we had to have them at 2 and 3 pm, rigt after our check in. That, she claimed, was the only available slots during our stay. My Pedicure could be arranged the next day at noon. we dropped all other special treatments because it was just to complicated to reserve and then scheduel around.  
As the room would nly be available at 2pm, and our first massage was aso at 2, she assured us on the phone we would be aloud into the room earlier so as to get adjusted and not miss the massage. we showed up at 1:20, the room was not ready until exactly 2 pm (having worked in a Hotel many moons ago, I know that preparing an arrivé room can be done in 20 minutes, after seeing our room I figured it cold have been done in 15....there were no other people checking in during the 40 minutes we waited for our room.)  
The ""wellness area"" was kept at about 20 degrees celcius, cool if you're not wet and in a bathing suit. the water was abrely warmer, in any of the tubs. The sauna was mysteriously locked for the most part, without explanation, an no one around to ask.  
The pedicure was brutal. I could go into step by step descriptin and even someone who has no clue as to what a pedicure should entail would be appalled. She barely treated my feet, the filing is aweful, she used the cheapest nail polish ever, which had gone goopy with age and did not apply nicely at all. it was very frusterating to watch and know that I was paying 75 CHF for a service I could do MUCH better on my own. my 11 year old cousin could do better. To add to this I got the entire treatment from the comfort of a folding chair. yes, a cheap, uncomfortable folding chair. 
my feet have never had a worse polish job. seriously. not even when i was 5 and painted them with magic markers did they look so bad. 
But really, the pedicure was just the crowning point. the whole hotel is ****, and costs way too much.    
I also didnt mention that the esthetician kept speaking to me in Portugese, despite my CONSTANTLY telling her I did not understand portuguese. and, no word of a lie, she  !!!!!   
NEVER GO TO THAT HOTEL! YOU WILL RUE THE DAY!

			You're in for a nice week. Try and arrange your around the jazz festival in Ascona: a very pleasant time to be there. The Maggia valley is indeed a hikers paradise, if you don't mind sharing. It gets kinda popular - especially with Germans - but there are many routes which, with the right weather, afford magnificent views over Lago Maggiore and the Alps.    
A very easy starter would be to base yourself either in Locarno or Ascona so you have some civilisation to hand and do day trips from there. Monte Bre (Locarno, not the other one in Lugano) has a fab cable car that takes you beyond the village of Bre - one hotel, also an option - to the Madonna and you can head up the Trosa. From there you can head where ever your legs can take you. Happy trails.

I was looking for a way such that my family can go up by train/cablecar and I could hike up and meet them at the top. I know the cog-wheel train from Alpnahcstad isn't opening until mid-May, so that route (Let's call it Assassin Route) isn't an option, but do you think we could your suggested approach?   
First time to Pilatus, so would appreciate any tips for this trail. Is it well-marked, is it longer or shorter than the Assassin Route (by how much approximately)? I can't afford to lose my way and keep them waiting without an estimate   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2007	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	mount pilatus - best way	dimli	Posts: 87

I suspect you are a guy.      
Women can't help to have an innate aversion to being refered to as ""Whoring Themselves"", whatever the context.      
I would think english speaking women could provide terrific posts for EF.      
Often they have the information other expats are looking for.   Often they are the trailing spouse that has to get things done in Switzerland and learn how things work from the expat perspective while the husbands are emersed in stressful work.   
It'd be nicer for women to be corrected without being told they ""whored themselves"".

Is there a reasonably priced wellness/spa (sauna) in Laax/Flims ?
I found the Waldhaus-flims hotel's spa, but their prices are somewhat expensive (to non-hotel guests), and I was wandering if a more reasonably priced alternative exists.
Thanks,

			I spend quite a lot of time in Liechtenstein and I can see what people are saying here. It's quiet and sleepy, but a lovely place. However, if you are not in a rush, FL has plenty to offer.   
Malbun is a nice ski resort (of course nearing its closure for the season), while the Fürstenfest on August 15th is a   party.  For a day trip, I'd  recommend taking the train to Sargans, hopping on one of their ugly fluorescent buses, and taking in the surrounds (Feldkirch +1 vote) and take the chance to tell people you've visited 3 countries within a few minutes! When you hit Vaduz, be sure to take in the Kunstmuseum and bask in the awe of the public art (I have never seen so many sculptures on one street!)   
Incidentally, you can have your passport stamped in the tourist office in Vaduz. Much as this sounds like a nice idea, beware that it unfortunately says ""tourist office"" on the stamp - while it's legal, it could end up looking a bit odd in your passport for the next ten years...   
p.s. my post has been audited by a Liechtensteiner who is in approval of my ramblings

			My thread about the Bernina Express ( ) got me thinking about the other World Heritage sites in Switzerland.   
There are currently 10 sites listed in Switzerland:   
Benedictine Convent of Saint John (Claustra Son Jon) at Müstair 
Abbey of St. Gall 
Old City of Berne 
Tre Castelli with defensive wall and ramparts in Bellinzona 
Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area 
Monte San Giorgio 
Wine-growing area of Lavaux 
Sardona Tectonic Area 
Rhaetian Railway (shared with Italy) 
La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle, architectural heritage of a watchmaking area.   
There are another two tentative sites: Prehistoric sites around Swiss lakes and the architecture of Le Corbusier.   
Would you rate these as the 10 most important sites in Switzerland? 
If you had the opportunity, what sites would you add to the list?

			From what I understand Mystery park closed down some time ago. You can still see the tacky completely foreign looking buildings there. Yes the cheap commercialism really irritated me as well. I guess money is king.    
My original roots are in the Himalayas and I personally feel at home in Switzerland as far as nature is concerned. What I find most amazing is that mountains back home were in the 7000-8000+ meters region compared to Jungfrau which is only 3500-4158 meters high   Jungfrau does not even feature in the top 100 highest mountain peaks of the world    
As far as access is concerned Jungfrau probably wins hands down. Definitely an amazing engineering feat! Once we got on the actual glacier the typical tourist crowd disappeared. We walked for hours on the ice away from all the Bollywood and Japanese/Chinese/Korean crowd. Bless them all but we wanted peace and quiet with mother nature.    
I am still very ill and stuck to bed. Fever is not in the 40°C region anymore but still constantly around 38.5°C. Feel like a wreck and dizzy all the time   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2008	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Places to visit around Interlaken	cheese hole	Posts: 19

If so, I would say TGV followed by connections to St Moritz (usually can be done in two changes) if your friend has a day to spare.   
If not, then flying to Zurich and train onwards.

			Check out this thread:      
Be prepared for official campgrounds in Europe to be very different from those in Canada, with the main difference being the reduced amount of space.    
Try Athelticum for cheaper camping supplies than Oschner. For a range of high quality camping supplies then check out  ; it's a store aimed at bike-tourers, but the camping supplies are suitable for all campers. Unfortunately, their website is all in German, but they have physical stores near Basel, Bern, Luzern, and Zurich, in which the staff nearly all speak good English and are very knowledgeable. Otherwise, order online from the UK.

			We had a friend staying with us in Lausanne 2 years ago who had the same problem when he left. He researched sleeping in the airport, and found several reports of people who had done so and advice on where the best spots were. I don't remember if it was officially banned but he certainly didn't have any problems sleeping there - maybe they've changed the rules since, or maybe in practice it is tolerated if you are there to catch a flight.

			Update: weekend cancelled (sort of). 20 mins shy of Annecy and wife discovered she had a missed call. Our youngest had been vomiting the entire morning at the choir camp, so we arranged for a neighbour to pick her. Had a quick scoot around the town, a bite to eat in Bistro Contresens, which was very busy and great food (if a little stingy on the portions) and headed back. Got stuck in the Auto Salon traffic in both directions, so 6 hrs motorway driving and 3 hrs in Annecy itself  . Cute little town though (what we saw of it).

Mate from Uk came over.  Got him visitor halbtax. Got train to Geneva from Zurich, saw the car show (great by the way), went to interlaken did the mountain thing, came back.   
It was a great trip, very comfortable on the train.  The halbtax really paid for itself.

			Consider a hotel in or around Wembley, NW London. Its not a particularly scenic part of town, but there are plenty of hotels in the area and if there are no major events around your dates you can get some amazing off peak rates. However what makes Wembley so attractive is the fact that there is a fast Metropolitain line train that gets you into The West End in 10 mins.

I think he should pick up 1 or 2 places that he really wants to visit in Europe and keep the others for next time.   
It also depends on the place he'll stay in Switzerland (i.e. from Bern / Fribourg, he can go anywhere in Switzerland within 1h / 1h30).    
IMO, you should plan something like this:   
1st of April - 4th of April : Switzerland. Let him recover from the flight and the jet lag. Take him to some places in Switzerland.   
5th of April - 8th April: Paris. There are trains from / to Geneva (as he needs to be there on the 9th of April  ). The journey takes 3h something as far as I remember.   
9th April to 11th of April: Switzerland. Visit Geneva and enjoy your concert the same day. Then take him to other places in Switzerland.

			Excellent roads to the Vereina tunnel.  Good roads to Zernez.  Good roads through National Park to Livigno tunnel.  The Livigno tunnel is one lane so you might have to wait a bit.   
The Vereina tunnel costs about SFr. 75 return and the Livigno tunnel costs about Euro 30 return.   
We took the Julier pass on the way home (driving past St. Moritz) but it was a long drive.  I'd highly recommend the Vereina tunnel over the Julier pass any day unless you want to have some different views.

			Has anybody visited the thermal baths in Breiten?  I am looking to branch out further from my usual hour-and-a-half-long train ride Lausanne with an upcoming visitor.  This looked like a good place to go to expand my Valais experience and see something new.        
I am also considering the baths in Saillon.  Any reviews?       
Any other recommendations?  (In the past I have visited  Lavey, Leukerbad, Charmey, Yverdon, and Ovronnaz -ordered by preference).    
Thanks!

			Hi all,   
I'm looking for somewhere to stay in the Chironico area over a weekend. I searched the threads but couldn't find anything.    
It doesn't have to be much - as long as it's clean and a good place to sleep I'm happy. Sure, a good place to eat doesn't hurt either.    
Any specific tips or just general on where to start looking will do fine for me.     
Thanks,

2835	23.02.2010, 12:06	Member	Thanked 55 Times in 32 Posts	Location: Thalwil, ZH	"    That stamp and return boarding card was the visa. There is no charge but one of the conditions is that you have a exit details which is a pain if you plan to leave via road or rail.     
I don't want to get in how many time and all that but last year I was there at least 4 times and this year once.  In 2009 I was in danger of being there too long with the rules actually being that you can only stay 90 days out of 180.  I notched up something like 180 days in the whole year!!! This law IMO is never enforced but can cause trouble at the departing airport as immigration authorities now fine airlines if passengers don't have the correct visas on departure.

			Gosshh I love this forum. 
So many places I want to visit myself now! 
I dont know how anybody managed without EF, sbb.com and Navigation in their car!   
I personally would be interested in people's advice on the traffic. Are there certain times and roads that are particularly bad? Is there a way to avoid the traffic - leaving at 3am or anything!? 
We got stuck in traffic in Italy for SO LONG last summer, and even though it was completely worth it once we got there I always wonder if it would have been different if we had left sometime before sunrise or on a different date..

			What lengths do you want to go to if you don't find the said font?   
Do a high quality scan of the ticket. Vectorize or trace all the required fonts and use as required. You could also use fontforge or hundreds of similar font creation software to make the vectorized alphabets work properly for your future ticket forging business.

			Besides the events you've mentioned, I know there's a kiddie parade on Saturday - starts in Neumarkt at 13:33.  For more information try searching for ""Fasnacht"" or ""Fastnacht"" instead of ""ZüriCarneval"" which no one calls it.        Well, it's not   exactly, just a bit... oh, okay, who am I kidding? Yes, it's rubbish.  Compared to Basel and Luzern anyway.    
Most people without strong local ties opt for one of those two: Luzern was last week, Basel is this week, both of them less than an hour away from Zürich.

			that may be a good idea, to try it out locally first to see if we like it.    
we'd love to do a full course in Montreux, but we are very keen to get away. Switzerland already offers so many of the outdoor activities we enjoy that it seems only right to get away for a bit! but we can't decide where to go or what to do and a sailing holiday the only thing we both agreed on!    
i will check out the links mentioned.    
thanks.

			Dear All, 
I have a friend that will visit us in Zurich at the end of March. During  her 
visit she wants to meet also with her boyfriend (long distance  relationship). 
They want to spend couple of romantic days somewhere around Zurichsee or 
Bodensee (means closer to Zurich). Do you know some nice place, but not  so expensive to recommend? They would prefer more nature than city, but  city is also OK. Thanks a lot!

My wife and daughter are coming over next week. Would you please help me find some (outdoor) activities for an 8-year-old girl? I  found the playground & swimming pool in Baar, and we can go 'schlitten' on the Zugerberg and ice skating in Herti. But I would appreciate any other suggestions.

I am working as the Kunstmuseum Thun's kulturattaché for the whole of 2010. Unfortunately it does not include the Thun Panorama. 
Living here does not always help us see the town from a visitor's point of view. 
Obviously the boat trips (early summer to october)over and across the Thunersee are marvellous, bringing travellers to various locations (Spiez,Oberhofen,Merligen,Beatenbucht(for the bergbahn up to the Niederhorn and others). Thun old town is well worth a wander around and Schloss Schadau that you mentioned having had a good lunch on their terrace. 
The Galerie Rosengarten is always worth a visit in the town centre, as is my studio :-)   
Perhaps we'll meet if you visit again.

			Hi 
I have a tageskarte card for any day travel valid upto 06-09-2012. 
The original price for full day travel in entire Switzerland on weekday is chf 64 and we took a card valid for 6 full day travels worth  
chf 320.I have 4 travels remaining in this card which I would like to sell for 40 chf per  ticket.SO the cost for 4 full day travels comes to 160 CHF,you save 94 chf on individual full day travels. We live in Lausanne. Kindly mail me on   or call me on 0783085534  
The user needs to have half tax card to utilize this.   
Thanks

			In the Bernese Oberland, we've been sledging at Niederhorn, Kleine Scheidegg - Grindlewald and First - Grindelwald.   
Niederhorn had fantastic views but the initial section was a bit steep and icy with small kids. Although later in the day it got softer and easier.   
Kleine Scheidegg (the Eiger run) was quite gentle and gave fantastic views of the Eiger north face.   
Our favourite was First. There's a lot of sledging here and you can combine a good walk (snowshoeless!) with a sledge.

Flew Swiss last Thursday and after around 20 trouble free flights with them they had real problems in Zurich with 2 planes faulty and 3 hours wait (2 hours on the runway) and you are right, well worth taking a sandwich. The food is free but the choice is either a very dry salami or very dry cheese roll. Just meant I had to have a second bottle of rather nice swiss wine.

			Indeed, one can only agree with Zeirtz above, it's an easy area for independent travel either by bus or rental car, whichever you prefer.    
I was merely referring to an operator because of the original question - otherwise, simply go for a do-it-yourself tour, all services are easily bookable online or by e-mail.   
Enjoy your trip!

			You can certainly go ski touring on the glacier though I think that it would be better in March-April for the weather, length of daylight and the crevasses should be more filled in. I haven't been there but I hear there are routes that would be suitable for a strong-intermediate skier with enough stamina to last a long day out. Plenty of more difficult routes to take as well.

HA HA!! This is sooooooo true. The price of one of my tickets actually increased during the booking process with Easyjet. I was ordering whilst on the phone to a friend who was also booking. She entered her card details faster than me and hit buy and then when i hit buy i was informed the cost of the seat had gone up £5. What a joke!

			Wow, there are a lot of advice and comments.  I'm a middle-class Thai lady and I have a decent job in Bangkok.  I love travelling domestic and abroad.  I would like to touch a little bit about Pataya, it's only 1-1.5 hrs from Bangkok.  Pataya is not all bad, there are also some areas for normal tourists who do not aim for such entertainment such as Jomtien beach.  You can also visit Koh Lan which is about 30 mins by boat from Pataya, there is a white sand beach there. There are a lot of fun activities to do in Pataya too such as Paragliding, water scooter, sailing, paintball, Go-kart and so on.  Cabaret shows by lady boys (queers) are quite interesting, just think about it as 'performance'.   
I myself like to go to Samet Island, it's about 3 hrs by bus from Bangkok to Ban Phe, and about 30 mins from mainland (Ban Phe).  I like to stay in Ao Phai (Phai Bay), there are a lot of wooden bungalows there such Jeab's, Ao Phai Hut and some others.  Silver Sand and Samet Villa is a bit more luxury with concrete single huts.  You can spend a few days there, the beaches are nice and you can go around the island by Song-thaew (pick-up truck) or rental motorbike.   
I will write more later.  I have to work now.   
Take care.....Mushroom   
You can buy prepaid sim card (AIS, DTAC or True).

			Engelberg is not a particularly good place for on-piste skiing. Its great for freeriding and off piste but it has a lot of steep, narrow and icy pistes. It also has huge lift bottlenecks on busy days so certainly not what I would consider a good area to get back into it.

			Arosa is good - lots of walks up in the hills that are marked off for walking alone (i.e. no dodging skiers). Although in March, don't know how good the skiing will be - it is in a South-facing bowl, as I recall, and snow can be slushy.   
Betmeralp/Reideralp also has several non-ski activities.   
Rather than Saas-Fee consider Zermatt.   
Flims-Laax also has stuff, but you need to make sure you are in one of the larger villages that makes up the resort.   
Further South, in France, Chamonix has excellent skiing for advanced skiers, but has the advantage of being a large village/small town so more non-ski activities.

I guess that the journey down from Trockener Steg must have been quite concerning for some of those as well.

			Hey, I thought I would get notifications of replies, so didn't know anyone had replied! Thanks for the info. I went to the box office and they said I could come 90 mins before the performance and get tickets for a max of 45 CHF. But I forgot to ask about the age limit! A Swiss friend of mine is pretty convinced it's under-25s only. But for all other *young* students out there, it seems like a bargain!   
Thank you,

			Good advice from MarkJ.   
If they do get a car another option is Chatel/Pre Le Joux (basically drive from Geneva to Thonon turn right then its all uphill from there. Great for varied pistes and you can ski over into CH and back. Also links to Avoriaz and the entire portes du Soleil domain.

			DB is correct - shuttle bus to Luton airport parkway train station (5 -10 minutes?). You can get some trains direct to Leicester from there but you will probably have to change at Luton main station. Trains from Luton main station to Leicester run about every half hour (it's on the main Sheffield/Derby/Nottingham to London line.)    
Easy - even my mother can manage it  .

If I were you I would go for somewhere in the centre of Lausanne itself.  At least there you will have a variety of shops, restaurants and cafes open and a bit of a buzz going on.   
Alternatively, if you want to be near the lake.  I would look for a hotel in Lutry, Vevey or Montreaux.  All these towns are right on the lake so you will get the best of both worlds.  And it would probably be more fun for the kids too.

			Hi Samanthas, all 
it sounds to me like you're going to be sliding around on snow   I have *no* clue about all these rail passes for Visitors, Flexipasses etc (I've lived here for 20-odd years) but you might want to have a look here:   
In the past I usually drove my trusty 4WD Golf to the hills but doing a quick weekend day out at e.g. Flumisberg was just getting too painful (traffic, parking...). Depending on how you look at it, they're almost giving away either the lift ticket or the train fare. 
Either way it's much greener and very relaxing (ok it can get crowded..). A friend & I even did a day in Arosa once (from ZH), we figured the lift ticket was CHF 10.- But as I say I don't know if these deals would work for you. Maybe the first one..

			Have loads of fun but please make sure that you can stop the sleds if need be. I have never forgotten when my young son was on his sledge and it changed direction and went zooming down towards the road. I could not catch him and was screaming in panic, luckily, someone else saw what was happening and stopped him in time 
I have read over the years of the same thing happening again & again

			Bear in mind that the time of year you are looking at is the end of ski season and that a lot of the usual passes that I would recommend for great summer hiking will still be covered in snow. Some of the passes and wanderwegs will be open albeit they will be covered in snow   If you have the correct equipment and are interested in snow shoeing or hiking/climbing with crampons then this can be fun   However, I would say if you are not experienced with this sort of hiking then please use a guide as you will be hiking over snow and ice and accidents can and do happen.   
If you are looking for something at a lower altitude with less snow then I can highly recommend the   though there is a chance that even parts of this route will be unpassable and still have snow as from what I remember there was still snow in some of the higher parts of this route in early May this year.   leg of the route 5 is a nice hike but even I wouldn't normally do this until end of April beginning of May.   
Some sites you may find useful in planning your walks....              of which I'm an organizer but to be honest most of the hiking doesn't start until mid/late April depending on snow/weather   
edit - as an afterthought and going along with what Swisspea said, there is a nice hike along the river from Schaffhausen down to the Rhine Falls (approx 5-6km) and there are also a couple of valley walks in the Sargans area which should be fine and free of snow.

			We've never had much fun on New Year's Eve in Zurich town with the children. It's simply too cold outside for them and the stands cater for adults, with champagne and cocktails and such. Taking children into restaurants on New Year's Eve would have to be planned i.m.o., choosing your location well.    
Perhaps the Conelli circus would be an alternative? Though a 3 year old is perhaps a little young for that too. We went to the Christmas Eve show with our 3, it was fun for all.   
We're staying in, having a party with some friends around, indoor fireworks (= Tischbombe) - and if the older kids are still awake at midnight, then we'll find a volunteer to take them to see the fireworks.

			I am also looking for ideas where to go for New Year's. At this point it means at a very short notice!    
So, if anyone knows a place somewhere in the mountains where there could still be availability in a hotel or B&B (without paying a fortune) - I would be glad to hear! I only know the obvious choices of main resorts where everything affordable seems to be fully booked... There must be some hidden gems somewhere.   
Thanks!

2931	28.11.2007, 23:49	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: geneva	"    Hi, there.  We just got back from a week of skiing in Sion/Nendaz.  On our last day, we attempted to get to Leukerbad and spend a day at the thermal bath in Burgerbad and perhaps get a massage.  Our attempt never materialized because on our drive up to Leukerbad, we faced a road that was closed (the sign said danger of avalanche.  According to the map we had (we also followed the GPS) there was only one road up to Leukerbad, and this being closed, we assumed there was no way to get up to our destination.  We turned around and left with 4 +/- more kilometers to our final destination.     
Just for future reference, did we assume wrong in believing that was the only route up to Leukerbad?  Are there any other road we could have taken to get up to there?  We reached as far as Imden.   
Thanks.

			I don't recommend to park in Italy.   
Based on my experience, I just dropped somewhere in Italy when I went to France, then someone pulled out small item of my car such a short time.    
You should park your car in secure place in Italy. 
or 
don't bring your car in there.

			In case anyone is interested, it was great.  The Valbella Inn was fantastic for kids - a newly renovated kids playground with child minding.  A pool (that was to cold) with a spa (warm).  A massage area (extra).  The restaurant has a kids menu.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  And there were lots of families staying there.  It's not cheap but everything is well done.  And if you get a suite then there is also a tiny kitchen - fridge, sink, basic cutlery, crockery and some utensils, and a little stove (no oven, no dishwasher!!).  But enough to be able to get lunch and/or a very simple dinner.   
And best of all, the kids ski school area is maybe 50-100m walk from the hotel.  The only issue is that the kids lifts can only be used by those in the ski school.  Our kids went into the ski school, so that was fine with us.  But if you've got young kids who've never skiied and don't want them in ski school, then you'd need to catch a free bus to Fadail.   
As to our (adult) skiing - compared to Aus it's great, although you either need to catch a bus or traverse uphill in places to get to a lift to take you higher up the mountain.   
There is also apparently a great toboggan run.  We didn't do that as our kids were enjoying the skiing too much.  But quite a few people recommended we do it.   
So we liked it so much we're thinking of booking for next year.  "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Nov 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Vallbella Inn/Lenzerheide	OZHK	Posts: 163

			2 liters is allowed and it is cheaper to buy at the airport on arrival, however some shops do not take credit cards so make sure you have either ruppees or US$.   
Also not all airports have shops but if you are flying in Bombay or Delhi you will be fine. Also note that in some states they still have prohibition so if you are going there be careful. As a foreigner you can get a license to drink.   
The other comment is that the selection in the Indian airports is far more limted than places such as Dubai, so if you are planning on something special don't buy in India.

			We are a couple planning on visiting friends in central-east Paris for New Year's weekend.  Would like to leave Wednesday evening (30th) and return Sunday during the day (3rd).   
Expected cost is CHF150 per person round trip (see below).   
We are a married couple, looking for preferably another couple or two individuals to share costs.  I can make the rental and drive entire route.  Some flexibility in timing is allowed.   
Comparison per person: 
* Flights are CHF330 and up;  
* With half-fare card, TGV is CHF330 
* With half-fare card, non-TGV train is CHF240.   
Expect ~CHF630 cost to be split equally among passengers and driver. We are two, so if you are one, its about 210, and if two, about 160 per person, so definitely a significant savings.   
(A compact rental can be made for about CHF300 and seat 4 with little luggage (a backpack per person + what you hold). 1500km @ 7L/100km  ~= 105L fuel @ conservative 2.00CHF/L =  210CHF.  Parking in the city would need to be included. Not certain what to expect.  As much as 30CHF per night wed, thur, fri, sat, so 120CHF.  So, would work out to 300 rental + 210 fuel + 120 parking = 630CHF to be split four ways, or about 160 per person.)   
Please PM if you are interested.  As I said above, there is some timing flexibility, for instance to leave on thursday, instead.  If you are along the way, we might be able to swing something, too.

Milan is not a picturesque city or a place to chill out and enjoy  . There are some nice places nearby, like Lugano and Lake Como but not easy to fit into a city break with small kids in tow.

			really bizarre is the cyankali bar     
also wacky was a bar next to the entrance of the ""hackesche höfe"", you see a red light strip in the air..follow that! I forgot the name. Anopther one is the ""lee harvey oswald"" bar next to Boxhagener platz...I am not sure if its still there...   
a fantastic little place is the bebop bar, willibald alexis strasse, ""insider kreuzberg"", with great jazz jamsession on sunday, and maybe even better, the ""Arcanoa"" (also X-Berg) or even ACUD in mitte (near Rosenthaler Platz) for colourful people and music.    
illegal: try to get into a meeting of Mastul, a ""cultural society"" in Wedding    
also illegal, there used to be ""Kino durch's fenster"" (cinema through the window) in Friedrichshain, where you had to enter the cinema room (aka living room) through a window.   
Nice food: go to ""Lei und Lui"" in the wilsnacker strasse...somewhere between italy/middle east/.... wild combinations but fantastic and cheap.   
buy yourself a ""Zitty"" magazine and check out what's going on!

			That is a reasonable budget. It depends on your flexibility of dates, type of accomodation and location.   
Air fares can vary substantially on different days of the week.   
The main ski resorts should be avoided if you want to keep the prices down.   
Accommodation can be found from under CHF40 each per night if you are happy with very basic hotels/hostels.   
Self-catering can also be a great cost saver. Eating out can quickly use up the budget.    
The following sites are worth a look to get some ideas.              for Swiss Rail Pass

			There are no direct flights to dortmund airport, so you have to fly to düsseldorf or cologne/bonn(if you want to) , grab your bags and take the train to dortmund mainstation, there you have to take the coach to the airport(you will loose a lot of time ). 
On the other hand you can travel from zurich to dortmund by train(sometimes  
for 49 euros one way if you travel via stuttgart)

			You will be stopped as you come off the motorway and directed towards a car park which has a connecting shuttle bus. If you continue into Montreux, they do block some streets off for parking but they are generally full by 2pm, including the forum car park! It is also a nightmare to get in and out of Montreux when the market is on. If you can take the train, it's easier!

			You have the following options: Whether a larger vehicle uses more fuel depends upon many things.  Full, empty, how you drive, etc.   
And the comments about driving in Paris are correct.  Would the driver be fearless and bold - or a wuss?  You're not going to drive around Paris sightseeing are you?   
Also factor in the weather, holiday season, etc.  You may travel less rapidly than expected, have an accident, bad weather, queue....

			Exactly the same thing happened to me, the Basel to LGW flight gets in at 21:30 but once you added delays, baggage collection and queues at immigration its already past 22:00 once you're ready to collect your car.    
Since I wasn't that familiar with Gatwick I spent a good 10 minutes walking around in the freezing cold rain trying to find out which bus takes you to the South Terminal.

			Hi to all. Thanks, I'll add it to the commercial events section, but are there other places I could make them public? The course cost 85 francs, it's for one afternoon, four hours of teaching and practice. Poker it's fun and there are a lot of people that want to play but doesn't know how to do it. The first poker course is one for beginner, we also have advanced strategies, but not in English, at this moment. If there are enough people we surely will offer also strategical courses. The course will not take place, if there are less than four entries, so we hope to find some more people to play. I'd be happy if you have any ideas

			Hi all,   
i'm looking for a company (local) that organizes trips/safary and so on for like 10 days in Tanzania in Feb... The idea is to get a group of 4 and get a nice package so if anyone is interested in joining (we are getting together on lonelyplanet), is very welcome.    
So if you have any recommendations for travel agents/local agents etc, will be greatly appreciated.   
i hope this is the right forum

			You should go to Galeries lafayette, montmartre, st michel & le Marais and of course St Germain.   
Theses advices on how to dress up are quite strange imo and really ""cliché"". 
In fact, the only real one is: dress up when you want to go out in a selective place (which is quite normal) and bring some pullover, scarves as it's quite cold in Paris!!

			I wouldn't bother with the Glacier Express as a first priority.  It is a very long trip with spells that are not particularly special.   
Try one of the others here     
My favourite is the Bernina Expess, second choice William Tell Express.  They have a much greater variety of scenery.

You're right.. its very late.     
But I found a Chalet in Flumserberg for 600CHF for a week.  Not sure how big it is, its says 2.5rooms...  I suppose the price is okay as it is close to the lifts etc.  Anyone else got any ideas on prices?

			We've done rome for 3-4 days with a toddler. By the fourth day everyone needs a day off..   
There are cobblestones and uneven paths everywhere in rome - pushing a pram/stroller/buggy is hard going.   
I've only done Rome, I haven't done any other italian cities. We did the same stuff in Rome twice (once without kids two years ago, this time with three kids and grandma) - and enjoyed repeating our adventures.    
I can recommend the Rome B&B association for a private apartment rental within the city - check the exact locations. We stayed near the colosseum both times.       
The advantage of a private rental is you can eat/drink and be merry and if the child wants to run around they can...more room than in a hotel or motel...   
We can also recommend in some ways the hop-on-hop-off bus, however, be warned that they have an unreliable timetable and waiting on the side of a narrow busy street in the cold/shade/wind for 45 minutes for the bus is not fun.   
I would not expect taxis to have appropriate baby seats, or bother using them...   
I would not recommend taking the public trains with a baby/stroller - you are an absolute target for pickpockets and beggars.   
I would probably recommend the public buses with a toddler, but not with a pram.   
So, my recommendation -    
Fly to Rome or take the train.  
Take the express train from Rome airport to Rome main train station.  
Get accommodation between the main train station and the Colosseum.  
Plan to do the colosseum and roman forum one day. 
Vatican and St Paul's Basilica one day. 
Trevi fountain/spanish steps/etc third day. 
Use the hop-on-hop off bus for the two days (vatican/trevi fountain etc).   
Take it easy.   
There is so much to see in Rome.   
As they say...Rome was not built in a day.   
oh, and watch out for pickpockets/beggars...   
Final tip - the people who offer tours in English outside the colosseum, may actually be legitimate tour guides- ask them for their ID - we did an excellent walking tour of Colosseum and the Roman Forum - you jump the queue, avoid the traffic, and you are free to leave the tour whenever you've had enough. They went slow enough for our children, and we managed it with a pram...it was I think 20 Euro for adults including entry and the toddler was free...

			Hi opps, 
After reading your comment and then reading my post again it does come across pretty depressing sorry  
i had alook at what might be going on on christmas day but most things are closed so after major googling i've come up with an idea of doing a craft day on christmas day as my daughter being so young we havnt got into the whole finger painting or sticking mess yet. 
So on christmas day she will be 15 months and i've started putting together a big craft box for her odd stickers,crete paper and empty toilet roll tubes   ( i just ran round the house quick looking for things i had) I'm gonna go out with her over the next few weeks and pick up a few nature things before the snow gets them and find a few pots of finger paint then on christmas day clear the kitchen floor and put a big bit of paper down and let her have fun and then give it to daddy as a surprise Christmas pressie her first art work  
Sharky, Unfortunatly my husband will be working so much over the whole christmas period and new year and my family are all in uk and his in germany and its very hard for anyone to get to saas fee in the snow :S i'm quite use to being alone for celebrations but it is the first time ive experianced it with a baby and i got a bit freaked out silly me  
so hopefully i can make this a christmas with good memorys and hopefully my hubby will get a few hours on the 24th or 27th to do the christmas family thing. 
 Merry Christmas to all

			Just got back from Lugano. We didn't get much time to do any relaxing but had a really good time all in all.   
We stayed at a decent 3 star place called Walter au Lac bang in the center right at the lake. Great location and great views from our room.       
The hotel was typical for a 3 star; basic but also clean and comfortable. Thanks god for the airconditioner, it was really hot down there.   
We also ate some great food. Unortunately didn't manage to eat at a Grotto, but add some great Italian at small intimate restaurants.   
We also went to Fox Town when the weather was bad and found some really great deals at the outlets. There are more than just designer stores, lots of sports outlets there as well; Adidas being my favourite sports brand.   
Finally we went to Monte Bré and had a great time walking through the hilly forests. They served some decent Ticinese food at the restaurant by the funicolare.   
All in all, a superb time.   
Next time up, Ascona!

			Hmmm I am pretty sure only the stores at corso Vittorio Emmanuelle and Via Torino will be open and also the stores at the station. I think Duomo and Castello Sforzesco are the most well known must-sees. The Duomo is very beautifula nd free, unless you want to take the elevator to go upstairs, you won't see much though and if you are not an architechure lover, not worth paying for really.   
Have fun!   
Angela   
PS: food is great everywhere and if you can get to a napolitan pizzeria (cant think of the name now sorry) near the station it will also be cheap...

As two friends have recommended it, I'm considering booking a 4 star secret hotel and going for a bargain rather than a well researched 3 star hotel.   
So has anyone used secret hotels and been significantly disappointed ?   
Answers eitehr way would be most appreciated.

			Ok, there is not only the passport check: In Germany, you always need to have some sort of ID with you, any cop has the right to check it when he wants and where he wants - nothing to do with border or Schengen. So if the passport is invalid, I would expect the Ausländerausweis to be sufficient as an ID - if it is the card format already since this is the same all over the EU. (I usually just show a driver´s license and never had any issue as long as it is an official document with a photo).

I would generally agree, but I live by the airport and have not noticed a significant difference between the amount of East/West flights. My suspicion is confirmed by this, albeit oldish (first half of 2005), graphic from Geneva airport's website        
(Green - Landing, Blue - Take off)    
So, if you're landing at Geneva it's a lottery, but personally I would plump for the left: should you land to the east, depending where you've come from, you might still have good views of the alps and you get the thrill of skimming the Jura as the plane comes through the col by the Fort de l'Écluse.  
If you're taking off and you've not got a seat booked: if they are taking off to the east sit on the right. But if you are flying to somewhere generally to the east of Geneva still sit on the right which ever way they're taking off.   
All too often Geneva is stuck in low cloud/fog, and climbing through this, the sudden spectacle of bright sunshine on the mountains tops can be magnificient.

			Hi,   
I'm celebrating my 30th birthday by hiring a chalet in La Tzouma, Valais the 24th-28th April. I will be having friends from the UK, Switzerland and maybe Canada. We will have infants and toddlers with us so a good mixture of people to entertain.    
I'm looking for activities to do with my guests and something special on my 30th. So far I've found this for my actual birthday:     and i'll probably treat myself and husband to a massage too. Has anyone been?   
I was also thinking about a roadtrip one day to the Matterhorn, it would be a shame to be so close and not see it. Any recommendations of short walks to do once there or things to do in the area or on the way?   
I was also thinking a wine and cheese tour would be great but I can't find much in the area except a walking wine tour which won't be possible with infants and toddlers unless we leave them with someone.   
Any other suggestions like villages, town, glaciers, places to eat etc would be appreciated. Also, would will the weather be like?   
Thanks in advance 
Julie

			We always go to France or Italy, never went anywhere beyond Lausanne in Switzerland (I know, we should, but somehow never happens).   
Anywhere in Provence is usually great but we like to stay in St Rémy de Provence and make daytrips to different lovely villages (Gordes, Roussillon) or Marseilles (for bouillabaisse) or famous towns (Avignon, Arles, Nimes).    
I am also very much in love with Burgundy (Cote-d'or) and, a bit closer to home, Jura is also very attractive, depending on what you like to do. If you like cities, you can also do a day trip to Lyon. Annecy, already mentioned, is a very charming little town for a relaxing day by a lake that is not Lac Leman.

			Hey all, 
I've been liviing in Bern for the past few months now. And for the coming weekend I've got a rather special some one who's coming over from the UK. The idea is to spend some the weekend in some place that has snow, is a bit isolated and has as few people as possible. (We are from 35°C Mumbai, so the snow requirement is a must)   
I've narrowed down (after a lot of googling) on Bernina Ospizio as per a friend's suggestion, who had been there last week - at 2000+ metres its high enough, has a decent snow cover (we are no skii-ers , would just want to hike a bit if possible) and seems out of the way of most things.   
Any suggestions regarding this would be appreciated - what to do, any specific hiking route, any recommended places to stay (think student budget for a pvt room). Im dreading that most places nearby would already be full. Any other tips are welcome.   
Thanks a tonne, and have a great day ahead.

There is also the tourist office that might has some person to person ads of things still available.

The shock part of my post was to say that XMAS is high season AND they will try to get you to take TWO weeks when you really only want one.   
Good luck.

If you want to be pulled along for an easy ride then you'll find various options.

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

			I think Flumsberg is a good option- it's great for skiing but it's nice to go just to relax or spend time with your girlfriend. As for a 'real' swiss chalet experience, check out this site for a variety of chalets:       
Some of them are apartments, but you can still get a 'chalet' feel from these in my view. You can also look at:       
Or you could try the area of Engelberg, here are some more sites for chalets in that area:       
Engelberg and Flumsberg are pretty near to Zurich, and there must be other mountain areas nearby but this is all I know of!

			Hi All   
Haven't seen any posts on bookclubs in or around Zurich yet. So here goes...I'm a total bookworm and was wondering if there would be ladies (and guys - lets not discriminate) who would be interested in starting a bookclub - preferably during the day - like a lunch or tea time - and maybe meet once a month in Zurich somewhere central???I guess this would apply to those trailing spouses like myself... I have bought loads of books from the English Bookshop, in fact I'm pretty sure I should be on their VIP lists by now..but how long can you do that before you run out of library space given the size of apartments here! In terms of type of books - I guess maybe something for everyone except Mills & Boons and Danielle Steele...seriously...

Probably best for you to pop into your local travel agent and ask them -- they'd have a far greater range of tours available than an Aussie travel agent.   
Is your friend looking for people to travel with, or does he just want an itinerary?  If the latter, why not make up a travel plan and he can go by train (or of course by car if he's confident to drive in winter on the wrong side of the road)?

- Flims/Laax?     
- Engelberg (kind of hip with the English crowd these days i have heard)    
budget and skiing and Switzlerland don't tend to mix so well (there are exceptions but that usually involves renting a vacation house for a week).

			Hi,  I just booked a trip to Marseille Provence, France for December.  Does anyone have any recomendations for winter activities in Marseille?  Suggestions for places to stay on a budget?  Thanks!    
P.S. Ryanair is having a sale right now, only 4CFH each way!

Students already have a discount and they pay 195 CHF.

			I guess that you are looking for somewhere en route from Basel to Lugano.   
Lucerne is one option.  Try the museum of transport with planetarium and iMax.     
Nearer Lugano you could stop off in  for the castles

The Grand St-Bernard is the only one whose closure is ""independent of the weather"".   
But yes, anyone wanting to cross the cols had better hurry, most have historically closed in early to mid-November.

But there will be some animation, especially for kids. And a few ""Freiburger"" horses too.

			Next week, the English Film Club will start showing their 2009/10  offerings throughout Ticino. The films will be in English with subtitles, not bad for Ticino!! 
They do start early (around 6.00pm) but then, that leaves more time for drinks, food, etc. afterwards...   
Just remember that single tickets may NOT be purchased.

			Web checkin is pretty good. Note that for eg USA flights, the web-produced pass will have ""This is not a boarding pass"" printed on it, and you will have to front up in person at the desk.    
Also, if you are travelling longhaul then you will need to allow yourself enough time to go through the schengen border passport check, get to the midfield terminal, and go through security.

There will be the Long Museum Night, i.e. that museums are open 6pm till 1 am and for just 13 euro visit as many as you like.    
Same will happen in Munchen on 17th October.    
If anyone goes there by car from Basel/Zurich I would gladly join and share traveling costs.    
All the best,

Fortunately he's a pretty calm baby most of the time and generally sleeps well.   
Appenzell is quite a tempting idea - we could take the cable car up Santis too and maybe do a bit of a walk up there.

I think that a winter trip would be a totally different experience with so much hidden.

Their basic clientele consists of climbers or hikers who hike in, eat, sleep, and resume hiking or climbing the next day.  There is not much to do in the hut during the day.   
Accommodation is dormitory style, and I am not sure that dogs are allowed.   
Here are a few links I have accumulated over time; I did not reread them for relevancy: 
I suspect that a small hotel in a mountain village might be closer to what I believe you want.   
I have written the above on the assumption that you are not familiar with the Swiss hut system; my sincere apologies if my assumption is incorrect.

			Hi All,   
I just got back from a great couple of days in Zernez. Went with a couple of friends who went hiking. I couldn't hike because I've got a couple of injuries awaiting operation.    
But I had a great time eating Hirsch, Reh sipping the local booze and enjoying the fresh mountain air. It was also nice to finally get to meet Raetians and hear Romansh. Very warm and welcoming people.   
I stayed at   and really liked it. A small family run hotel/inn with a great restaurant serving seasonal game. The owner was always around and I had a good time chatting to her.   
If you're looking for a short getaway away from noisy tourists, this has to be one of the places.   
I also stopped by St. Moritz on the way back to Zürich and enjoyed walking around the town. Lots of desginer stores and expensive hotels.   
Happy Holidaying.

			This is a wonderful two day stroll (moderate hike) across the mountains. I did it last weekend and it comes highly recommended.   
First Day: 
- take the Madrisa cablecar in Klosters 
- hike over the 'Schlappiner Joch' to Gargellen in Austria 
- stay over night at Haus Wulfenia (I paid 51 Euro for half board accomodation including a beer, a glass of wine and packed lunch for the next day), cash only in Euro, no credit cards   
Second Day 
- take the cablecar up to the Schafberg 
- hike up to the St. Antönier Joch 
- cross the border to Switzerland 
- hike down to St. Antönien 
- take the bus to Küblis 
- take the bus back to Klosters   
...nothing tastes like a ham sandwich on a sunny mountain meadow.   
Last day the cablecars operate in Gargellen is October 4.

If you are only on a 3 day trip forget about Zurich ,etc, these places are too far away. Visit either Jungfaujoch or Schilthorn not both in only 3 days. Lakes Thun and Brienz have nice steamer trips. Places to visit will depend on the time of year you are there, for this reason I suggest using the tourist office for advice. We have stayed many times at the Metropole hotel in Interlaken, this has lovely views of Jungfraujoch and is very comfortable if the weather is cold. 
Hope this helps.

			We went last weekend. Thought we ought to go before it closed down and it sounded interesting:  
My daughter of 7 years loved it ... it had a great play area (Cost Sfr12), camel ride and bungy (cost extra).  
My husband and I were not so happy.....the 7 theme areas were a great disappointment. It was all show with almost no content, and even that was rather one sided.    
So next time I wish to take my daughter to a play area I'll choose Trampolinos. It's closer and cheaper!

			If the other ""passenger"" does not have a ""halb tax"" card then they, or you, will  need to pay the full price of the journey. That means you buy your ticket, and then start again and buy a full ticket for the other person. As far as I know anyway.

The suggestions above are perfect. The beauty of Bern is that the centralized old town has most of the tourists sites and everything is within walking distance.    
The Altes Tram Depot is a great lunch stop and they make their own beer but it also really touristy. There are a lot of restaraunts in town with more local flavor if that's your thing. I'd recommend the Schwellenmätteli Restaraunt under the Kirkenfeld Bridge for a nice lunchtime experience.   
Also, the Bern Historical Museum is worthwhile if you have time. It's the big castle-looking building across the Aare from the Casino Platz.   
Enjoy your day in Bern!

I've been here just over a year but havent done many day trips and would love to see more before its time to go back home. Not mad about museums but quaint villages, old towns, old buildings, beautiful countryside that type of thing.

			Hi there,   
Its a shame you didn't plan on doing this earlier in the year. I started doing the Route 5 in May/June this year as part of my hiking training for Kili.   
We hiked from Dielsdorf to Sainte Croix..... and I am meaning to finish off the rest of the route over September/October at the weekends.   
You are more than welcome to join the remainder of the hike, there is usually a group of us and more info on when the hikes will take place will be posted   you will also find information on the past hikes and some useful links to maps.   
If you need any further info, please feel free to PM me as I have pdf files of all the maps to stage 10 and additional notes such as restaurant locations/good places to stop for lunch etc.   
It really is a beautiful area of the country (then again which part of CH isn't beautiful!) and if it hadn't of been for the fact I couldn't hike the higher trails earlier in the year due to the passes still being covered in snow I would never have discovered it.

			Just to update for future seekers of info on Sankt Gallen, Lucy's tips were spot on.  Also for those of you who enjoy design and mid-century modern furnishings, there is a great shop directly across the street from the Atrium Ristorante called Mobler Muller as well as The Finn Shop (everything Finnish) in the pedestrian district for you Marimekko and Alvar Aalto fans.

			Not exactly Zurich but there is a lovely Hotel in Immensee, ( a very picturesque village between Zug and Luzern) great connections to most places if they would like to try somewhere they might not have heard of otherwise.   
The Hotel sits right on the lake, you can sit in their outdoor restaurant and the views out to the lake are beautiful. It really is a fabulous spot, we stayed there during our re-location here. The people are lovely too.   
The Hotel is called the Rigi Royal, Immensee. You may like to check it out. Hope they have a great time here.   
ps. My 18 year old Son is here with his Girlfriend at the moment, they both love the village and have swam in the lake EVERY day ALL day. They have travelled easily to both Zurich and Luzern.

			The Nurburgring is a bit more than a few hours from Zurich (nearly 5 hours from Basel, and its quite frankly in the middle of nowhere). However, they have recently opened a massive new village with new hotels, and those hotels may include a spa or spa services.    
The ring is an easy place to have a day at the track, because it is a public road. So he does not need to tag on with a specific group to get some track time. You can pay per lap or pay for a bunch of laps. But I would check their website to make sure it is open to the public on a weekend that you want to go.    
On the downside, it is a public toll road. So anyone and anything can go on the track. I mean, you can even see buses. There are no corner workers for safety, and the track is narrow so there is not a lot of margin for error.    
You can find info on the Nordschleife here:    
There are lots of tracks in France that may be closer than the ring. But you would have to check calenders and see what groups are attending, then try and sign up with those groups (for example, there is a track at Dijon that gets rented out all the time by Suisse car clubs). But unfortunately, most tracks are conventiently located in the countryside, so finding a spa facility nearby could proove difficult.   
I'm just getting to know some of the European tracks myself, so unfortunately I can't offer you much more info than that.

			Do you mean a cabin as in the mountain huts where you share with other people? or a private cabin for just 2 nights for a family size of?   
You might struggle to get a cabin for just 2 nights and you might struggle to find the 'typical log cabin' experience - places you tend to find are apartments in chalets and most require being booked for a week   
But i may be wrong and would be interested to hear of others suggestions

As a kid i preferred the Basel Zoo and even started a tradition with my numerous nephews and nieces to go there  with them as a 5th birthday pressie,thus i happened ot be there frequently in my tweens, and this was the time when they started to alter the zoo,it was just one big building site at times and some of te animals they choose to exhibit were no the ons we were interested in and then it lost the appeal for me.   
I now much rather go to the Zurich Zoo wit my lassies,where a visit to the MASOALA hall is a MUST, but its not to be recommended with very small kids (IMHO) since you need to be able to be still and observant to spot the various animals running freely around in there and the hotness and humidity might make a toddler cranky too.   
i also think the voluntary service is ACE,where volunteers manage a kind of small stall in front of  few choosen animals, where the kids can ask questions to their hearts content as well as touch and feel various things ( lions tooth & claw,Fur,bones etc) and thus learn much more about the animal too.   
ZH gets now big thumbs up for me!!!!   
Also inteersting, just as a tip to those interested is the PAPILLIORAMA/NOCTURAMA/JUNGLe trek             in Kerzers ( yes i am biased       
Admittedly,the entrance fee is a bit steep,tho i think you get oyur moneys worth, there is also a big well maintained playground outside as well as a hut close to a biotope where you can try to spot animals ( take looking glasses with you),a tiny petting zoo is also on the premises....see link  "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Nov 2007	Groaned at 22 Times in 8 Posts	Which is the better Zoo	Bobby.Buchi	Posts: 402

			actually I'd make one slight change with the greatest of respect for Mathnut: take the gondola down to weggis instead of the train to weggis's neighboring village of vitnau.  it's more scenic, quicker and you can take the boat straight to lucerne.  In the end though, it's a great day out either way.

3158	13.08.2009, 04:29	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Australia	   I knew a couple (and it wasnt us!) who used to take both the pram and the huck-a-pack on some of their wilder walks. They used the pram till the going got too steep or two rough, then either left the pram till they came back down to collect it (Grîndelwald to Faulhorn in winter) or used the pram like a wheelbarrow, if necessary with a rope to pull up the slope or brake coming down and the other person pushing while the baby was safely in the huck-a-pack!. Seems to have worked quite successfully  they are all still alive and well.    In Grindelwald they did Männlichen to the Kleine Scheidegg and First to Faulhorn too. I believe they used a bus to get to the starting for a walk to First. Mind you, they did say something about getting some funny looks from other walkers and some folk wanted to take photos!   .    This came up when I looked for Grindelwald First and Kinderwagen. (pram)     This Link has Kinderwagen walks for many place in Switzerland but I cannot see any in Grindelwald.    Perhaps looking for Rollstuhl (wheelchair) might give more Information     Hope you find suitable walks.

			Either way the tickets are checked, you can ask a member of ryanair staff onboard, or at either of your airports. If you're paranoid about the bus leaving with passengers from another plane, it would probably be reassuring to check how many flights arrive at the same time as yours on the airport website: most likely not many.   
Many people like to complain that Ryanair are trying to trick them into paying charges, but it's just a matter of getting out of the mindset of flying with a conventional airline and reading the smallprint concerning online check in, luggage, onflight snacks, airport location etc. Sounds like you're getting prepared, i'm sure your flight will be fine!

			Hello Nicky,   
I am not sure if also Lake Garda is what you are looking for, but we were   for several times and it is really nice place.   
The house is located in Riva del Garda. We were driving (with car) to the lake and it took us 10 minute to reach ""our"" place beside the lake.   
Apartments are clean and the owner is friendly.   
There are some very nice trekking and hiking trails around with breathtaking view down to the lake.   
We go there usually at the and of April or in the middle of May as they offer some special offers at that time. We payed 250 eur for an apartment (about 40m2), for 2 people for one week. There is also kitchen in each apartment.   
We have been there with our dog, so I think dogs are allowed

			Seems to be typically French - doing a tri-national event on Swiss national holiday... I don't think there had been a similar show at the same place - they're just celebrating their 100th birthday this year. And don't expect the French to have food stalls like in Switzerland or Germany at such shows, they usually only have a restaurant where you can get a simple but overpriced menu. I wouldn't consider this a family day out event. Sorry...

			Hire a bike and cycle along the lakeshore. I'd suggest getting up early, taking the bikes on the train Villeneuve (change at Montreux to local train) at the other end of the lake then cycling back past Chateau Chillon to Montreux, Vevey, then take the corniche road through the vineyards to Lutry /Ouchy/Lausanne. You can get the train back from Lausanne or depending on your stamina continue on to Morges and get it from there. This is my view the very best stretch of the Geneva lakeshore and the views are magnificent. 
If you're not into bikes and have a car then spend a day driving round the lake or if no car take the train to Villeneuve and then walk back along the lake to Montreux (stop at Chateau Chillon), fromm Montreux, take the bus to Vevey, then the bus from Vevey to Vevey funicular (up to Mont Pélerin) then train back from Vevey to Geneva stopping off maybe at Lausanne/Ouchy, Morges and/or Nyon. 
All of above easily done in a day. I'd have to say three days would be difficult to fill in Geneva itself.

3191	10.03.2009, 12:33	Senior Member	Thanked 14 Times in 13 Posts	Location: Luzern (This is where we will live!)	"    Just back from a weekend at the Delta camp site. We were two people and survived the storm on Friday night/Satur-day...... all day... mad, we really thought the tent would have flown, but luckily it didn't... others were not so lucky.   
We paid Fr.353 for 2 people for 3 nights.... wow wow wow... 
the invoice was divided into Fr57/prime location tenting (most expensive category) After that they wanted more money for each person staying... turned out to be over Fr100 for the 3 nights... wow, and I thought it cost 57/night for the space... well yes it did, but only if you weren't staying in it!!! 
we paid a flat-rate of Fr.5/night for electricity and here's the mad thing, Fr50 Buchungsgebühr... eh what? Well, for what??    
Anyway, there was no entertainment, nothing to speak of anyway.. a few slots for the kids - for money of course - no band, nothing else either...   
Also, it is considered 5* well, I have to say the toilets didn't smell like toilets and seemingly that's what 5* is considered... constant hot water, working showers, not exactly clean all the time, some people are basically pigs when it comes to public amenities, but I expected a constant cleaning service, especially for that price.     Positives : Great location, great weather, if not a little adventurous, no driving in after 10pm which is good. Huge place, one can eat, there is a restaurant on site... lake was beautiful, we even got close to a mother duck and her 10 ducklings... very cute. great swimming. Friendly service...   
All in all a great weekend, BUT expensive... Katie Melhua was also super, very good live singer... any suggestions for a camp site in Italy? somewhere not quite as expensive?

			All,  
I am very new in Zurich and don't know many people or have friends yet, but I saw there is this Latin festival Caliente coming up this weekend, and I was wondering if anyone is going, or interested to join me... ?   
I have no tickets to any of the concerts, but definitely would love to go to the Mercado Mundial, and maybe there're other things to do there as well?  
Anyway, please let me know! 
cheers

There may be some of the other cinemas that are running Transformers as well. You can look in the ""Tribune de Genève"" for times and cinemas.

			Hi,   
I live in Morzine and I can assure you there is plenty to do here from biking, hiking and paragliding, to summer luge, golf and adventure parks!   
Accommodation is also cheaper than in bigger resorts such as Verbier.   
After living here for 5 years I have been known to be very biased about the place but for very good reason!!! It's fantastic!   
Give me a shout if you decide to come here and want help planning your visit!

			Go clockwise (far less cross-traffic to worry about at intersections).   
In France, take the road that goes via Yvoire - it is a very nice medieval village that you can spend some time looking at plus the road is far nicer than the main Thonon-Geneva road.   
If you don't mind a bit of extra climbing, then between Cully and Vevey, take the ""Corniche"" road that climbs up through the vineyards (via Chexbres and Chardonne).    
Likewise, there is a great road between Aubonne and Gland through the vineyards and with great views.    
In Geneva, have an ice cream while admiring the big fountain (Jet d'eau), but you can skip the rest of the city.    
In Lausanne, the Olympic museum is right by the lake and is worth a couple of hours if you are interested in sporting history.   
Montreux is a nice place to stroll around.    
The Chateaux de Chillon (just south of Montreux) always impresses non-Europeans and even some Europeans, it is a particularly nice castle. Even if you don't go inside, you can cruise by on the cobbled road outside for a quick look.   
The section of road in France from St Gingolgh to the turn-off to Yvoire is the worst part of the ride. It is difficult to avoid the main road which is very busy. Doing this on a Sunday is the only way to avoid some of the traffic. If you're taking your time to do the ride and like a good, long climb, then some people have been known to incorporate a ride down to Monthey and over the Pas de Morgins mountain pass (1,000 vertical metres of climbing) and then descend all the way down to Thonon as part of their lake tour.

			Three of the best (views, restaurants etc) are the National, the Schweizerhof and the Palace but they are chf 450 plus. Wherever you go, do call them and see what offers they can make you. I read an article Le Matin or 24 Heures a few weeks ago that said luxury 5 star hotels in Switzerland are suffering because international tourism is down this year and many are offering substantial discounts off listed rates to attract Swiss residents and steal business 3 from 4 star places.

			Take the train from Bern to Murten, stroll through this ancient village, have lunch, take the boat across two lakes for 18 chf per person if you check the web site, or with a coop supercard, to Neuchatel or St-Blaise, and visit the vinyards in that region.  
St-Blaise is a wonderful village to walk through (take the path beside the stream, past the old watermill, and turn left after the railway bridge where you find three vinyards). But check the web for their names and tasting times!

			I haven't been yet but plan to go.    
A couple of suggestions from my in-laws who have already gone.    
As others have mentioned, if you book via SBB/CFF you have a sort of combo price and you can  , i.e. from 12:00 to 13:00. So when you arrive, you go right on in. They were a few minutes early and they were allowed in as there were not too many people ahead of them.   
Secondly,  . They said it made all the difference. It is a type of iPod where you can input the number of the painting and get the details. Not sure if English is available but I would imagine so.   
When in Basel, if you are really in a museum mood, there is also the   at the Fondation Beyeler (Riehen/Basel).          "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2006	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Van Gogh in Basel - Has anyone been / does anyone want to go?	Idgie	Posts: 573

He did it for exactly this reason - there was no train leaving Lausanne early enough to get him to the airport in time that morning. Since then, they have added one more train 30 minutes earlier that makes things a bit better.   
Anyway, he got tips on where to sleep in Geneva airport by looking at  . I've given the link to their Europe section - scroll down that page to find info on Switzerland, which includes sleeping in Geneva, Zurich, and Basel airports, plus some stories about sleeping in the train stations in Basel, Bern, Geneva, and Zurich.

			I expect that the marmottes are out of hibernation by now, but whether they'll be active while you're there is another matter. Another thing to do up there is a 5-10 minute walk from the train station there is an alpine garden. It is very well cared for and contains lots of special species of Swiss Alpine plants and flowers. If you're lucky then one of the people who help to care for the garden will be up there and will be very eager to point out a few of the more special flowers to you. But even if not, everything has labels; keep an eye open for the Edelweiss! The snow has probably only recently gone from the garden, but that is when many Alpine flowers come into bloom, so it should be a good time to go.   
The hike up from Caux is via the Col de Jaman. My rough estimate as to length would be 2-3 hours, but this is very rough. From the Col to the top is not an easy hike, but it is certainly doable. The more challenging part is going across the face of a scree slope and then up a pretty steep and narrow cleft in the rock. The path is well marked, and when we were there, we saw a family with children about 10 years old on the trail who weren't having much difficulty. Even so, take it easy and safely, and take lots of breaks, and you should be fine. You could then ride the train back down in comfort.   
As for the time to go, during the middle of summer, haze tends to build up during the day, so the morning can be better than the afternoon for visibility. At the moment, I don't think there is too much heat haze, so I would base the decision on the weather forecast for that day.   is currently predicting better weather for this morning than this afternoon.

			Hi there,   
I just wanted to add/subtract to the Gruyere suggestion started by the OP ( which by the way was a great resource). I am coming from a family perspective.   
We just came back from a great weekend there - 4 adults and 5 kids ( ranging from 1-7 years).   
We did the hike from Moleson to Gruyere with kids ( it is about 5-7 km) and going this way you go down the hill instead of up. For us this was an advantage. The kids made it but were pretty tired at the end. You can then take the bus back to Moleson which leaves every 40 minutes or so - after visiting Gruyere and having an ice-cream!   
The Maison de Gruyere tour was a complete waste of money and time. It is for the mass tourist market , has no heart, no smell ( of the cheese) and no interest. I really would  suggest   to do this. There is however an artisanal cheese making place in Moleson which is more  interesting     
If you stay the night, I would suggest the farm house 'Praz July'. It is simple and great for  kids. The beds are not very comfortable but you manage to sleep.  It has an amazing view and close to everything. With breakfast it costs CHF 45 for adults and CHF 25 for kids over 2 years.     
The chocolate tour was fun but the only thing missing was actually seeing the machines working - stopped now for hygenic purposes.   
The Gruyere Chateux was suprisingly well done. They have a film ( which all our kids sat and watched - amazingly) and there are some beautiful views from the top.   
Lastly, if you want a simple meal ( again with kids) the aerodrome at Broc is fantastic. There is an amazing park for kids ( with goats, flying fox, swings etc), plus they can watch the small planes take off and land. Menu is simple, steak and chips, steak tartare, fondue etc but it was perfect for us!.   
Hope this helps with any families visiting this beautiful region of Switzerland.

			Anyone know of any good cycle tracks around the Luzern area that are suitable for young kids (ie not too hilly and not on roads)?  We've been around the Rotsee, that was perfect, but it could get boring every weekend....

			If you really want to blow his socks off this place looked pretty stunning and the cocktails were also very good though we didn't actually stay here.       
The town of Melide is very quiet but very appealing for that fact.   
Another option is Gandria which is the epitome of romance, we have stayed at this hotel   several times and every time has been as good as the first 15 years ago.   
Have a beautiful time wherever you choose to stay.   
PS other options would be Stresa on Maggiore or Bellagio on Coma, further afield Sirmione on Garda   
edit: Apologies no idea regarding the golf though!!

			Hahahaha. 'Little' was an adjective; it's not in the town's name. Some EF members have said that little Cham was way too quiet for them swinging singles,   but it's wonderful for young families.   
No trams here.

			This Sunday, 17.05.2009, is the international museums day. 
Many Swiss Museums will participate and will offer a wide range of activities - mostly free. 
As the weather forecast is rainy - this is a good opportunity to see and do something new.

			Just wanted to let everyone know that Chillon Castle is doing a buffet brunch for Mother's Day this Sunday, May 10, from 10:30-13:30. It might be a fun idea for any fathers/children who are wondering how to celebrate this special day. If the weather is nice, you could even take one of the boats to the castle.      for more information.

			ohh and I am free after 5 workdays except thurdays and fridays, and usually on the weekend. With the days getting so long after work rides become feasible. When I did the gurnigel it was a wednesday evening after work, beautiful weather, but there was not a soul up there!! Weekends would be a different story on the well known nice rides! I rode around the Thunersee a few sundays ago and I felt like I was in a funeral procession!! Everyone plodding along 20 under the limit....

			Sorry, but I forgot to mention that transport on the VMCV buses is free during this event as long as you have an envelope of participation.  You can pick one of these up at the first museum that you visit.   
There will also be 30 bicycles at the train station in Vevey that are free to use during the evening from 17.00-24.00.   
And finally, there is a shuttle bus to transport people from the Swiss Photography Museum at the market place to the train museum in Blonay/Chamby.  There is also a steam train going from the Vevey train station to Blonay/Chamby, but I'm not sure if it is free.

			Hi,   
it is a public holiday so they will all be closed. The only ones which you will find open are the ones that are normally open on a Sunday, in and around the railway station.   
I believe that the shops will be open in canton Aargau as it is not a holiday in that canton.   
Sorry to disappoint you.   
Have fun

Very pleasant.  (there is about 2km between the two towns that you must go on the main road.

			I thought perhaps we were being a bit ambitious with hoping the snow would disappear by then!     
Thanks for all the suggestions though - we've walked around les Pleiades quite a lot so that's certainly an option.  I do like the sound of Les Avants though, esp with the Funi there.  The Auberge sounds great!  I think, weather permitting, we'll be heading up there.

3286	07.04.2009, 21:38	Junior Member	Thanked 9 Times in 9 Posts	Location: Morges	"    I presume you are using touring or road bikes.    
You could do something like Chur-Lenzerheide-Tiefencastle-Bergun-Albulapass-Engadine-Berninapass-St, Moritz-Silvaplana-Julierpass-Tiefencastle. Or some variation of this. The Bernina part is an out and back from Celerina/Pontrasina so could be added in or left out depending on how you feel. You could also head down as far as Livigno if the fancy took you.    
If you are using MTB's there are other possibilities available depending on snow melt rates.    
The one part on the route I suggested that may cause problems is Albula pass. At the moment it's still closed and I don't know when they plan on opening it.    
Be aware that in May its still going to be quite cold up there. Camping should be with equipment that can cope with temperatures below 0deg C.

			I was at Titlis yesterday for the first time.  Stunning views.  And the skiing wasn't bad either.  Loads of snow. ( 4m (13 feet) at the top ).   
I suggest that you wait until the day before, and check the forecast.  Go to whichever is sunniest.

			First thought. Do you really need to travel by car? Travelling by train will give you the opportunity to all relax and take in the scenery without any traffic jams. Admittedly, it will work out more expensive and can be less convenient on timings.   
I mention travelling by train as there are some really spectacular journeys. For me, the best is the Bernina Express: Chur - St Moritz - Tirano.   
For a good mixture of scenery, mountains and lakes, the Lauterbrunnen area is as good a starting point as any. This gives easy access to Schilthorn, Jungfrau/Eiger, Lakes Thun & Brienz, Trummelbach, Staubbach and Reichenbach Falls, Brienz Rothorn Railway, Schynige Platte, Wengen/Murren, Grindelwald and Interlaken. Plus much more.   
If you go to the Zermatt area you will have to leave the car at Tasch. There is certainly plenty there. My favourites include include Mountain walks to Z'mutt area, Klein Matterhorn, Gornergrat, Sunnegga/Rothorn. You could consisider basing yourself around Brig so that you also had reasonable access to other places nearby such as Saas Fe, Bettmeralp/Aletch Glacier etc.   
Another option in 'The Swiss Riviera'. Lake cruises, Montreux, Vevey, Chillon Castle, Rochers-de-Naye and Gruyere just for starters.

			And if you don't want to fork out for parking in Annecy, there are a few free car parks including down by the casino/plage (ten minute walk into the centre of town, along the North-West end of the lake), or le Place des Romains (well sign-posted), which is only about five minutes from the Courier Centre (H&M, Monoprix, various other clothes/perfume/accessory shops), and a further five or ten minutes to the centre/old town.   
Alternatively, there's Grand Epagny on the outskirts of Annecy - all free parking and lots of huge shops including Decathalon, Auchan (supermarket), Mr Bricolage (DIY shop), Espace Montagne (huge outdoors shop), Darty (electricals/gadgets/cameras etc.), Casa (homewares), Intersport (outdoors shop), loads of shoe shops, clothes shops, fancy dress shop, pet shop, bio shop, car accessory shops, bike shops, skate shops, material shop, craft shop, furniture shops, homewares shops, garden centre, and lots of other bits'n'bobs. Just forty minutes from Geneva according to their  .

			We had guests from London last weekend and it was quite busy I must admit. Early on Saturday we went to Engelberg and admired a beautiful scenery of the mountains close to Luzern. It was a whole day trip fulfilled with spectacular train ride and cable car ride up to the top of Titlis. Next day we went to the ruins of old Roman castle in Baden which is quite a walk, especially climbing up a few flights of stairs takes a lot of stamina from  person. Later we took a boat ride across the Zürich lake (about 2 hours) and visited few places in the city. This kept us busy for entire two days.

			Im driving back to the UK on the 6th April from Basel & i dont fancy driving all that way on my own so if anyone wants to come along send me a pm. I drive a vauxhall corsa and will have room for a largeish suitcase as ill put the back seats down. Ill pay for the ferry but was thinking we could split the fuel? Im heading to Wiltshire but could drop off somewhere along the way. Ill be leaving very early on the 6th, probably about 4.30am!

			Here is a good link for hotels in Paris, you can search by district (arrondissement), price, various criteria, etc, read other travelers' opinions and locate the hotels on a map of Paris. Very useful: you can search the hotels near a place of interest (ex: art galleries, museums) and/or public transportation. I personally find this site very rich in information.       
Good luck !

			Recently went from Basel to Hamburg on the CNL (or the German version). The advantages were that we could take a lot of luggage and the car. The only real annoyance was that they made us wait for about an hour in a hot, airless carriage while they did some shunting / rearrangement of the train. 
On the plus side, in Hamburg you get to drive your car through a shopping centre to get to the streets, which is a strange but rather fun arrangement.   
Cheers

			Hi all, just to make people aware that early March Swiss introduced a service fee of 30 CHF on most economy saver tickets which were previously exempt !   
You dont get charged this fee if the flight starts in the UK which may help some find a workaround

			I don't think there is much to add.  I would also recommend Schilthorn and Trummelbach Falls.  When you go up to Jungfraujoch, travel as early as possible in the day.  Take things steady, be prepared for the altitude, cold and sun.   
I reckon whevever you visit in that area you will find something spectacular.  The helicopter flight is one of the things on my 'to do' list.

For people who do not have a Halbtax, the 'ZVV-9-Uhr-Tagespass'  is a reasonably priced ticket to travel not only in, but also around Zuerich. Also valid on ferries.    
Apart from visiting the city, my parents liked going to Rapperswil (by train, then return by a 2,5 hr ferry trip), rhine falls, cycling around the Greifensee, walking on Forch etc.    
They also love Lucerne. We usually go to some mountain resort during the day (Pilatus, Stoos, Titlis) and then to Luzern at around 16:00 - walk around, have dinner, some shopping etc. before returning to Zuerich.

			How much do you want to do, as without a car some of the tips given would have you spending most of your time on draughty railway platforms. Driving from Edindurgh to Inverness is dead simple, way quicker, and the A9 scenery is as pretty bloody good.    
I would fly to Edinburgh and hire a car there, as between 4 of you it would work out cheaper than taxi's and trains, and way more convienient if you time restrained, have dinner at the Cavalry Club for a nice Indian, and a stroll down Princess Street for a few beers, and a good nights kip. Then day 1 do the Edinburgh castle, Leith and the ex Royal yacht Britannia, and the Whiskey Society vaults, finishing up with supper and a beer around the Grassmarket or Golden Mile, that's pretty packed day. Then drive up the A9 on day 2 and base yourself in Inverness, if you can get in at the Heathmount or Corriegarth, that would give you a great place to explore from during the day but at night they are both have good restaurants and bars and are only a 5 minute walk to Inverness city centre, they are small and probably not on the typical Holiday inn/Ibis type search engines, visist Culloden Battlefield and Fort George at Ardersier, or take the tour out into the Moray Firth for some dolphin watching so that's, so after your 2.5 hour drive north thats a relaxing day ender as those places are all 15 mins from Inverness. Day 2 drive down Great Glen past Loch Ness (which no one mentioned , but I'd guess most never went that far north or are from the central belt), you must stop and get a photo with Nessie at Drumnadrochit, onto Fort William and take in Neptunes Staircase and Ben Nevis, then back via Glen Coe (not possible to do by train, as it would take to long and would involve sight seeing in the dark), finnishing with dinner at either hotel which both have good restaurants, or head into town to the Mustard Seed which was Mama G's fav', all serve traditional (ish) food. Day 3 Head off to the Glen Morangie distilery (at Tain), then up to Dunrobbin Castle the Drive is up the A9 and follows the coast, then to the falls of shin and Mohomad Al Fyad Harrods of the North, back to Inverness for a good Chinese at Dickens, Indian at the Shapla with great views over the River Ness or a fantastic Thai on Union st (the name escapes me). You's probably find live music at either Johnny Foxes or Hootananny's, and there was a place opening as a live venue called the Ironworks but I never wentDay 4 for then drop the car at Inverness and fly back from their Inv-Gat, Gat-Zurich.   
I should be a travel agent as I quite fancy it myself now, and Mama G's there just now. If you want more detail you can PM me .

They fly the north route over the North pole and so are faster than other airlines.

You can visit this place, but the problem is you cant commute to any place after you come here. But that really is a block as the place holds a couple of good cycling (which we get on rent) and walking trips. Plus is so close to nature that you will adore it.   
PM me if you need more details of the place.

			The Thermevals in Vals is absolutely amazing. Imagine a labariynth of different rooms and pools, all designed with classical roman ruins in mind. The echo room, the aroma room,damfbade, hot pool, cold pool not to mention the outdoor pool, ahhh, lying in the outdoor pool with a light rain looking at the snow capped mountains... can not recommend it enough. And after all that bathing try the local nusstorte.

It might also be worth it for you to get a ""Halbtax Abonnement"" or 50% Train Card 
from the Swiss Train.  It costs 150CHF for a year and gets you 50% off on all  
train and boat tickets.

			Bit off-topic on this thread, nevertheless worth sharing:     American Airlines  offers tickets to New York starting from CHF 562 (non-stop from Zurich).  
KLM/AirFrance and Swiss have also lowered their fares to New York, but as far as I know this fare is still the best at the moment!

			Castro -- I've flown AA for years and am a million miler with them but I gave up on them last year for their lack of cabin service - dirty planes and cramped seating. Although none of the US airlines are terrific these days so I use British Airways as much as possible. I've flown almost 100,000 miles with them this past year going back and forth to the states and each trip has been wonderful. Domestically Southwest is good for getting from point A to B -- Continental still seems to be the best as far as in cabin service as they even still serve hot meals on the longer domestic flights.

3341	11.02.2009, 17:18	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Basel	"    As I have been going to St Moritz for ski holidays for the last 25 years (though not this year) I'll try and give you a quick resumé:   
St Moritz has a great image. The reality is usually a disappointment - it is on a high plateau, rather than a valley, thus the views, like the local architecture which seems to favour flat-roofed blocks, are not particularly attractive. The town is high at 1800m, but this does not always guarantee plentiful snowfall.    
The Engadin has a special climate that means high amounts of sunshine, but often a lack of snow - and about every 10 years too much snow. This is a too much year.   
There are of course ski schools and I would not attempt to ski without lessons. St Moritz is not ideal for beginners and the run down to the valley, whichever area you are on can be a challenge, but you can always come down by lift. There are beginners' slopes, but the area is generally for more advanced skiers. You cannot ski to your hotel door and a car woudl be useful to access some areas. Tip: best place to stay - Club Med...

We have flown with KLM (via Amsterdam), Easyjet (from Geneva) and BA (Via LHR Terminal 5) in the last 6mths to Newcastle.   
KLM are generally slightly more expensive than BA I have found, however there often isn't much in it.  Easyjet are obviously cheaper, and if you have a halbtax card you can get a return Zurich - Geneve Airport for 80CHF, so factor that in too.   
Easyjet might be cheaper - but Geneva airport is horrendous (in my opinion) and the boarding the easyjet flight turned into an undignified scrum last time we were there.

			Actually, if you really look at a specific case, the rates are higher (often promotion or empty seats when the flight is announced). In addition, you have to add for the following: 
- Flight to London Stansted (for example not possible from Zurich, so you need to add train or parking in/to Basel) 
- Airport taxes 
- Booking fee from Air Asia 
- Meals to be paid in the flight 
- Luggage allowance to be added 
- etc   
I have professional experience (as private and travel agent) with good fares to Asia, especially Malaysia where my wife comes from.   
If you have any plans to travel to that region, send me a PM with you specific travel plans, and I can give you some recommandations.

			Also Emirates is offering a scheme wherein they offer you 50% off on a 2nd ticket to a destination and back...effectively you are halving your ticket cost .. altho the scheme is targeted more towards couples and people flying in pairs, as the same flights (and days) have to be used on the onward and return journeys

Anyway as I said in my initial post, I'd be grateful to anyone who has an ideas how to get us moving.

			If you want to bring your bike on the train then   explains the bicycle regulations for long-distance trains in Germany, which suggests that you can get an international ticket for your bicycle for 10 euros. Taking bikes on trains in Switzerland is covered in   in the Cycling in Switzerland thread.   
If you're moving to Switzerland then if the bike is less than 6 months old then you should officially pay Swiss sales tax on it (7.6%), but probably no-one will ask you about it. If you're just visiting as a tourist then you certainly don't need to worry about this. If you are moving here, then after you arrive you must buy an insurance vignette to stick on the bike for about 7 CHF, see the info in  .

			I have to say I would think twice about doing such a long train journey when there won't be much to do at the end of it. It's not as if the train ride itself will supply much in the way of stunning scenery. It's a long way to come and the city centre will be pretty dead at this time of year, especially if the weather is as forecasted. There won't be much atmosphere - it's much better to come in Spring/Summer when there's more life out and about in the streets and you can lunch/ have a drink outside. I like Geneva but the town centre is a pretty small place and you need it open and the weather on your side to see the town and it's lake at their best.

			The train and bus connections between Switzerland and France are not the best, but you can catch a train to Moutiers train station, then a bus ( ).   
One of my friends in Zurich did a trip to Meribel, the neighbouring ski resort, a few weeks back. The route involved a number of train changes:  Zurich-Bern-Geneva-Chambery-Moutiers. The way back only consisted of three train changes, but he didn't mention the route.   
I don't know how much it cost him I'm afraid, but hopefully that's some help.

Two minutes that you have to give up on your life, without any clear benefit for yourself. Yes I know is not big deal two minutes, but what about if the next addition could be for you to attach a scanned copy of your passport, your fingerprints and why not, perhaps charging you for costs derived from their new bureaucracy. That's excluding the risk (albeit minimal, I recon) of someone stealing/loosing the data base with all your data on it.

			What you all have to say about the Weihnachtsmarkts is true - in a way ...... I have a regular stall at our village Christmas Night Market, and have learned to not expect to ""make money"" .. its all about Atmosphere and community spirit.   Most stall holders are happy to just cover their stall hire costs.      
If there were no stall holders - there would be no atmosphere worth talking about!   
I have noticed that its mostly the oldies who will buy a few items from various stalls ... they know we wish to recoup our costs, that its all mostly about the service we provide to the community anyway.   
Talking about bargaining ..... people should try it......Otherwise we gotta hang onto the stuff for another year!... better to convert it to cash.  Thats just MY opinion anyway.  I guess that those stall-holders who do regular ""flea-markets"" wont want to bargain as they need their goods for the next weeks market?   But there`s nothing lost in the asking!

			Indeed the Lockers at Flumserberg are part of the base station / restaurant / rental block at Tannenboden, down the stairs on the downhill side.    
To get a key, go into the information center (to the right of the ticket windows). They will require some sort of id as deposit (Driving License / Credit Card etc), and pay 2fr? 5fr? Check what time the info closes as you will have to give your key back before then.

Got fab deal check their website   the stunning penthouse as they describe is 400 francs per night if booking over the phone but only 200 francs by internet, it looks great and includes breakfast, checked out tripadvisor and no bad reports.   
Will respond after our stay to let all know if worthwhile recommending.

Schiff in a garage, and for Schützen outdoors parking.   
Also, if they like something in Basel I can recommend Hotel Spalentor, just next to Spalentor.... which is quite easy to get to from the airport (usually takes me about 15 minutes)... They also have a few parking spots reserved for the guests, so if they say they come with a car the hotel can probably ensure that they have parking on arrival.   or book on   for decent prices.

			It will depend on the weather - check the traffic info regularly as most scenic routes will be closed if there's a dump of snow.   
My advice would be take the train - almost never late, scenic routes, etc.

			Just a little warning to anyone that wants to book ryan air, it seems really cheap but there are loads of hidden charges for example 48sfr per suitcase and 16sfr per person credit card charges, I booked 5 tickets  recently I was aware that i would have to pay extra per case but I was really surprised to see that after i confirmed, my bill jumped up an extra 80sfr for credit card charges, saying that if you manage to get one of the really cheap tickets with free tax it still works out very cheap.

			On these two Sundays, vintage trams will circulate in the city from 12:00-18:30. The course is Bellevue-Bahnhofstrasse-Main Station-Central-Limmatquai (both directions). Of course the normal lines will be operating, with normal trams, too.

I have done this several times when I changed my plans and booking a different flight turned out to be cheaper than changing a booking.

In July and August, we are open every day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.    
The rest of the year, we are open from Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. (except over the Christmas period).

			Thanks for the answers. Anywhere in the world would probably a bit far yet not a bad idea. I did write though, going to a bordering country of CH. I guess I should have been more specific by asking if there is some kind of ""package"" you know of for a party train. As I am asking for a friend of mine I'm actually not sure where from in Belgium she would want to start, guessing somewhere close to Bruxelles but then she might be back in Basel and leave from here. She was hoping that something like that exists i.e. a ""party train"" or something but maybe not. Again, thanks for your feedback.

			It is only a small exhibition but we found it really interesting, my son loves Geology and he was suitably impressed. As mentioned it would be worth visiting as part of a group of activities in the area. Hiking up Eggberg is good, Tell museum in Burglen is very interesting as is the Tell Trail from Burglen to Altdorf (30 min stroll telling the story on info boards at regular intervals). Rounded off by a nice meal in one of the many restaurants, I would recommend Pizzaria Da Sergio in Moosbad, Pouletburg in Attinghausen or Schutzenstube in Fluelen dorf.

			Frederik:   
The thing to do in Switzerland is to pick a ski area - I'd go for the Hasliberg 
if I were you - and then contact the local  , the tourist office (they will certainly speak English!), and ask what they have in chalets or other accommodation for your dates (for example in Reuti or Wasserwendi where the gondolas take you up to the ski area).  Many locals rent out their own places during the season, and list them at the  .  Still, you may have some difficulty with the number of people; most winter apartments I've heard of are for 4-6 people.  Maybe you can stay in two houses next to one another?   
Good luck!

It's in German only, but with a dictionary, a map and a bit of imagination I think it is possible to use for anybody.

			It is generally best to go up early in the morning. The weather tends to be clearer then. It can change very quickly though. If you are there early and have good warm clothing, the walk across the glacier is recommended. Stick to the marked trail.

			Hi,   
Well, despite the nasty windy cloudy weather we went and had a fine time...   
The weather cleared after lunch so we could see the lakes from the top, and the trip back down and across the lake to Luzern was lovely.   
We now have an 'idea' of how far it is to Zug, and to Luzern from Zurich - I think Luzern will be our next trip out of town...   
It was ok to go up Rigi in the nasty weather - you really don't have to be outside - there are heated waiting areas with food and toilets at each train stop...and the trains etc are all heated.   
They also gave us a 10chf voucher x 5 for all of us - the kids included - which paid for half our lunch at the Rigi Kulm Hotel cafeteria, and that made the whole day feel great...   
The kids are keen to go back when the snow comes...  "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2008	Groaned at 33 Times in 22 Posts	Suggestions for day out for family from Zurich	swisspea	Posts: 5,505

can't be as bad as the grandparents not taking a child's medical card (or any other ID) and also discovering after the four hour car trip that they also didn't take his injection needles - for diabetes.   
It was a good experience for them in asking for help - from the 'likely' places (hospital, pharmacy etc)...driving around in the middle of the night... then discovering that if they'd just mentioned it at their hotel, the hotel manager's sister had diabetes and could have given them what they needed !

			Hi!   
I hope it's not too late for an answer!   
Well, the Vivarium in Lausanne is great: they have snakes, spiders, crocodiles, etc. If you have a car, the zoo in Servion is very nice as well. Just google 'Lausanne' and 'Vivarium'/'Servion' and you'll get all the directions you need.   
Otherwise, the playgrouds at Ouchy and Pully are very nice (both at the 'débarcadère' where you take the boats). If it rains, there are a few nice museums as well (Musée de la Main, for instance). The gardens of the Olympic museums are also beautiful.   
Still with a car, a day or an afternoon at the Signal de Bougy (above Aubonne) is wonderful: huge playgrounds for every age, walking in trees ways, farm animals...    
Hope this helps!

			Same loophole works with the ferries. 
When I left UK, I took the Ferry Hull-Zeebrugge. That would have cost ca. £250 pound oneway with car. a bit expensive, when they advertise with weekend trips from  £150(?) return. 
So I booked my return ticket as one of the short channel ferries like Calais Dover, and ended up paying around £140-160. When I had the ticket, it was printed on it, that If I only used the ticket out, they would bill me the difference up to a one way ticket, but they did not do it.   
Doc.

			easy answer is that you just go to the local train station and ask them about it. I find that they are usually extremely helpful (I smile sweetly!)...and can speak English.   
My strategy is to print off the deal in german and say ""ein mal bitte, danke"" - 'One of these please, thank you!'.   
Actually, I usually just say ""Good Morning/Good Afternoon"" and from my accent and manner they can tell immediately that I am not German, or English, or American..'cause I'm Australian...

When people are looking for information on the Forum they often do a search.

It would be very helpful if you, or a Mod, could add 'Fribourg' as a Tag to it.

			Hi there. 
In Riazzino-Cugnasco there shouldn't be any ""safety"" problems whatsoever. 
Locarno has had a recent history of juvenile misbehaviour in the wee times of the night, especially around the train station, but really nothing much during the day.   
Try looking for accomodation in Tenero as well, as it hosts a national sporting center.   
The Locarno - Ascona area is a favourite holiday place for many coming from norther Europe - especially germany and the german part of Switzerland, so don't be surprised if you'll be greeted in German at stores, restos and hotels. 
The strong touristic attraction also means that prices in the region tend to be higher than average :-/   
Best,   
Paul

There's an excellent restaurant ( ) called Paznauner Stube that has a great Christmas dinner and there's also a very late mess in the local Church in case you're into that. It's a roughly 2.5h drive from Zurich. Most hotels might require that you stay for 5 or 6 nights at least as they are always fully booked around that time. Its definitely nicer than any skiing resort in the East of Switzerland and still quite close.

I'd recommend:  
Zoological museum in Zurich (free, part of University) 
Zurich Zoo (there are lots of indoor exhibits to keep you out of the rain) 
Starbies or Trampolino in Dietikon/Spreitenbach 
KinderCity in Volketswil 
Technorama in Winterthur 
Transportation Museum in Luzern 
Dinosaur Museum in Aathal   
There are links to all these off the blog. Good luck!

I was there.  Thanks for posting it to the board.  I loved it.  I wanted to buy one of the costumes in the building where they had the woman in the corner doing ""sticken"" (that braiding they do with the white thread).  We had some great lunch - buerli, guggeli and a rot wy from Weinland and got to listen to the music and see the dancing.   
Oddly - one of the women who was doing the announcing said they were from Germany    
We were in Wadenswil yeserday as well (where I discovered Don Camillo).

Thanks, once again, for a wonderful morning.  I hope to meet Chris next time!!      It is a wonderful route, and fully deserves its reputation.   
Have you ever done any vineyard hikes in other regions?  I found the hike above Sion less interesting, as the ""urbanized"" (OK, I exagerate a bit) Rhône valley is too visible, but I very much enjoyed the  , the first part of which runs through the lateral valley of  .  Lots of other bisse hikes described   and  .

I very much prefer the full version, starting at Icogne, with its descent to the gorge in which   flows at that level.

			Dear Partha,   
let me suggest to you to visit   or other travel/tourist information websites to find answers to your question.   
This forum is not really here to act as a tourist information centre...   
Enjoy your weekend breaks!

			From Interlaken to Montreaux via Gstaad could be interesting.  I'm sure there's a set of routes to do it.  You could also take the train, which is really interesting, to connect parts where the walking isn't so great.

Another really good trip is the steam train to the Brienz Rothorn. Snow is unlikely at the top but it is a great trip nevertheless. Stunning views across the lake to the Alps.

			You shouldn't encounter any altitude problems below 3000m. The danger zone starts above that. Besides that, it would take around 12 hours at that level for any serious consequences and you'd have to engage in strenuous activities too.

We did some lovely scenic walks and after a great fondue meal we went to sleep in a Tibetan tent (Yourtes)...it was just wonderful. The kids enjoyed the walks and the marmotte park...such adorable little creatures! I have a soft spot for Rochers de Naye as I took part in the Montreux-Rochers de Naye walk last month (a fantastic experiance and highly recommended for any motivated walkers/runners out there).

			I'm not sure how long you'd like to spend there, but it seems like you could spend as long or as short of time as you would like. My husband, child, and I went there just the other weekend, and we saw lots of different options for hiking trails from 20 minutes to 5 hours. We still need to get an off-road stroller, so we only were able to take one of the well trodden paths. And unfortunately, we couldn't take the cable car, because our child is too young. But we hung out at the restaurant at the base of the mountain and enjoyed the weather, so that was nice.

			It really depends on your pattern and distance of travel. Based in Basel doesn't help as you only really have East and South to go. Some of the best bits are a 3 hour journey from Basel by train, 5 to venture on to Ticino or Wallis. Luzern/Pilatus would be an easy day out from Basel, as would going East towards Lake Constanz and a visit to a vinyard or 2 around Schaffhausen plus the Rheinfalls (I recommend Fam Strasser  )   
I wouldn't go the whole hog on a 4 day pass unless you intend to travel 8 hours a day on the train and/or try the paddlesteamers on the lakes.   
Either way enjoy.

			We stayed in interlaken last week. Just turned up on the Wednesday and found a hotel. Stayed at the Bernerhof - by the station. Its a best western. With hindsight we would have looked for a bit longer but we wanted to make sure we had somewhere.   
It was ok, clean, comfortable and not too noisy considering we were on the front.   
I also picked up details for the following hotel. Not stayed there but looks lovely. A couple of minutes walk back from the station but close to everything.

Grasse is very interesting as you can visit the Fragonard perfume house and the museum although closed until Sept is well worth a visit. 
There are many local restaurants to sample and some beautiful walks.

			I'd recommend the Clock and Watch Museum Beyer on the Bahnhofstrasse as highlighted in the Hidden Gems posting. The curator is interesting, enthusiastic, friendly and a happy soul. They have water and sand clocks from pre-watches/clocks.   
Also in August is the Rundfunk month where you can go to the Landesmuseum courtyard (afternoon till 11 pm) where DJs play live music which is broadcast on the 1 month only radio station. It's a nice a relaxed place to go for a drink or bite to eat.  
Starts 2nd August

			Greeting to everyone on this Forum. When I was in Architecture school, I spent 1 semester in Vico Morcote, Lugano. I had the time of my life! It was such an amazing setting and wonderful people.    
I will be going to visit a recently married couple in Basel. My wife, little brother and I will then drive down to Rome. We will stop in a few places inbetween, one of which is Lugano.   
I'm looking for a room or apartment that will let me rent for 2 night, September 28th to the 30th. If anyone knows of someone who is renting, I would very much apprieciate that information.   
We are so excited to come and visit your wonderful country again.   
Ciao!

			Hi,   
We went to visit the Car Museum at the Geneva Palexpo but it appears it no longer exists. The signage is still in place and nothing indicated it was closed permanently or temporarily. People I spoke to say it was removed to make more exhibition space for the 2008 motor show.   
Does anyone know if it will be back either at the Palexpo or elsewhere?

I have walked around Z'mutt, Rothorn, Stellisee, Gornergrat, Klein Matterhorn, Schwarzsee, and St. Niklaus. All of these were good in very different ways. Further afield there is Brig, and also the Aletsch Glacier is within easy reach. There is easily enough to keep you busy for several weeks. Zermatt is great for strolling around if you want a more leisurely time.

			I went on Saturday afternoon.  It was very nice but crowded.  Our favourite features of the day were:   
1.  Listening to a Jodel group singing ""Barbara Ann"" from the Beach Boys.  They even moved like a boygroup.  They got a huge applause.   
2.  Watching ""Hopp dä Base"" being filmed and being pushed back by a Jodler group.  I realized they were speaking English to each other and asked them where they came from.  They replied, ""New Glarus, Wisconsin"" and it turns out they know people who my husband knows.  It was a very special moment and we had a huge laugh together, just right before they had to go on TV.   
The later the evening, the worse the crowd got and so we left.   
My biggest disappointment was the high prices of drinks.  They made a mint in food and beverage in the tents around the KKL.

			Lake Orta is a bit cheaper than Como, though a little more touristy and a bit nicer.   
I was just in Domodossola this weekend for a day trip (from Brig, where we were staying).  It's a pretty funky place, but pretty cool.  If you stay in this region, a trip up the Simplon  would get you near Zermatt, and would be a possible if long day trip.     
Basically stay in Orta/Domodossola.  Drive north to Iselle, where you can get the drive-on rail car ferry North to Brig.  It'll save you about an hour of driving.  Go to Zermatt then drive up to Goppenstein and take the Loetschberg auto ferry train across to Kandsteg.  Drive back to Zurich via Luzern - Zug (depending where you're going in Zurich you might be better off driving back via Bern.   
Another option would be to drive all the way to Brig, which should be possible, but it might be a really long day on the Autostrada.

			As Nev says, you've missed the early summer events. What you could do, instead of going to an individual winery, would be to visit one of the caveaux where you get the chance to taste wines from different winegrower in the area. Those in Riex, Rivay, Epesses, Chexbres, St Saphorin etc are all open in the early evening. 
More info here:

			I was just visiting a friend in Romanel-sur-Lausanne today and she was telling me about a hotel near her that all her relatives stay in when they visit.  It is 100CHf a night and there is a metro train line nearby that will take you into St Francois (about 10-15 minute walk from Bailleau or a short bus ride).  If this sounds interesting to you I can get the details.  You may be looking for something in between 100 and 6000 a night though!

during the summer, there are a lot of festivals.   
food festival , music festival ....                 
some areas may be crowded.  thus depending on your interests, you may either want to be in a particular city during the festival or avoid it all together.

			Just wanted to say a big thank you for all the suggestions.    
In the end we managed to find, by chance, ideal snow (for a 4 years old and several big kids!)    
We planned a trip up Mt Rigi (not for snow) on Mother's day (all mums went up for free) warning the kids that there would be snow visible but it all looked in dangerous, hard to reach places on the web-cam so we would be unable to play in it. Anyway ""lo and behold"" when we got to the top there were large patches of soft snow on the grass, easily in reach and perfect for snowballs - we had great fun playing in the sun and snow; it felt a little bizarre to be plenty warm enough in jeans and teeshirts! We were careful not to hit anybody not from our group but got plenty of amused glances and some joiners!    
Thanks again.

Travelled in the 'Belle Epoque' Pullman Coach. See pics below. Chocolate croissants, hot chocolate to start with. We included a stop at Le Gruyere Dairy, then into Gruyere itself for the Castle. There is also the H R Giger Museum there (see my photo gallery).   
Final stop was the Cailler Chocolate Works including unlimited free samples as long as you stay in the tasting room.    
On the return journey there was wine and a selection of Gruyere Cheeses of different ages. In all I consider it to be a well put together trip. It is much more than just the journey, or the attractions.  It was planned in great detail.  On the optional tour at Cailler the group was split into separate nationalities to get information in their own language.  I think there were about 4 or more groups.

lovely! i mean...the envy grows by the hour because you'll see so many speedboats n yachts...massive! the countryside is amazing! further we walked the city a bit and had lunch in one of those nice lil restaurants up the hill towards st.pauls cathedral. we have climbed the church stairs and had a nice view over the city...and that was it. for other things to explore it was simply too hot, but check it out...

			Also to add to the list of things to do...   
I have had my parents here this week and we have visited      - took a boat over the lake to Vitznau (1 hour) then took the mountain railway right up to the top of Rigi, amazing views going up on the train and amazing views from the top, we then took the cable car back down to the village of Weggis and took the boat back to Luzern - a great day out.      - went there today - Drove to Engleberg and took the cable cars up to the top - it was stunning, it was a perfect clear day so we could see for miles and there was so much snow!! Definitely recommend going here....      - Take boat from top of lake (burkliplatz) - takes an hour and a half - beautiful old town      - I didn't go here but my parents said the monastry there was amazing      - Again didn't go here but my parents recommended it      - A good joint trip, we drove to both in a day but you can take a train from Zurich to both - Stein am Rhein is a must see place!      - Not been but its next on my list of things to do!   
Thats about it

3571	13.05.2008, 13:42	Forum Veteran	Thanked 174 Times in 108 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Definitely nothing on the scale of Stonehenge or Avebury. Can second the Clendy Stones at Yverdon. In Suisse Romande more to be seen at Lutry (just outside Lausanne) and Sion (Valais). Haven't come across more in my neck of the woods and haven't heard of any in the north but there must be some. As an addict of the the History Channel, Time Team, Discovery Channel and all similar stuff I thought you only tended to find these things in more fertile areas of Europe. They took manpower to erect and depended on a very stable, settled agrarian society. You don't find many in mountainous regions even though stone is obviously plentiful there, probably because folks there were nomadic hunter gatherers and didn't stick in one place long enough to justify building anything permanent. The people who built Stonehenge lugged stone all the way from Wales to the more fertile south of England. In neolithic period people tended not to settle in mountain regions and preferred lowlands, lakes and coasts. Probably explains why two of three I mention are based on lake shores and why the major Scottish ones are near the coast. To head off any experts out there I only know what I've picked up watching repeat after repeat programmes on the above TV channels.  I'm sure there's exception to every rule and there's sure to be a standing stone somewhere which says otherwise. They could be astronomical calendars or navigational aids for alien spaceships for all I know.

			Last year we bought quite a lot of our kit from Oschener and also Carrefour, baechli Sports has a good selection but its very very expensive.   
Or try and get to a Decathalon, on our recent trip back to the UK we bought lots of stuff from Decathalon, very good value - luckily we had the car to transport it all back with us!

			It was a long drive, but well worth it.   
Plenty of trike and recumbent manufacturers, including Greenspeed, Challenge, Trice, etc.  Even Santana with a few of their tandems, in particular a beautiful titanium triplet-tandem.   
Outside the main hall, there were lots of velo-cars with their smoothly polished cocoon-like shells, still shiny despite loads of admirers. The test-track was zooming with trikes and 2-wheel recumbents.  Not many places actually sold stuff - we took all that cash for nothing  .  I waited for ages to ask the guys from Challenge about a Jester recumbent, but they were too busy, and with all the lights and people the hall was a bit of a sauna.   
Hall 3 had even-less-conventional bikes, including rowing-power, and feet + arm drives, in-seatpost electric helper motors, all sorts of weird and wonderful things.   
Outside hall 3 was a bicycle powered chainsaw, it was a stationary (ordinary) mountain bike that took the chain-drive forward, then through a second set of gears and onto the bar of a chain saw.  People were welcome to have a go, but I was too chicken because of the language barrier.  Other guys drove it, taking 15 seconds or so to saw through a 12cm square pine beam.   
Unfortunately I forgot my camera.  Seriously considered turning around 140km up the highway.  Anyway, you'll have to search flicker in the coming days for some photos.         
cheers, 
(Mr)Wibble

			I also had a great day out around Schaffhausen. Get hold of a bike at either Schaffhausen or Kreuzlingen and follow bike path 2 between these towns. It is about 50kms of flat bike path and quiet roads. You basically follow the shore of the Untersee until you get to the Rhine, passing Stein-am-Rhein which is worth a stop and look and finishing in Schaffhausen ( or vice versa depending where you start) with the many beautiful buildings to be found there and just to finish in style the Rheinfalls at Neuhausen.Last wekend was perfect. I just have a townbike so speed wasn't important and it is dead flat and really relaxing ride.

I don't know many 19 year olds, so not sure which are the best places for them but they might find out through this or other similar sites. Generally, clubs in Zurich can be a bit picky at the door - so warn them to better dress up slightly (no white sneakers, etc.). For bars in general, they can go Seefeld, Niederdorf, Escher-Wiess Platz or Langstrasse (the ""red light district"" - but there are many normal bars and its absolutely safe).

			I know exactly what it's like... 
here are some of our tried and tested rainy day ideas: 
- IKEA in Aubonne, if the kids are old enough to stay in the playland on their own (from the age of 3) 
- Signal de Bougy, they have a very nice indoor play area. 
- La vallee de la jeunesse in Lausanne. There are other indoor places provided by the 'espace prevention de la cote', e.g. in Morges or Nyon, but the one in Lausanne is the most exiting. 
- different activities at 'Edukids' in St-Sulpice 
- 'children's palace' in Lausanne, on the expensive side, though 
- 'Yatouland' in Geneva, can get a bit scary and loud for very little ones (and parents) 
Have fun!

			Luzern very pretty and the transport museum is good fun. If you are up that way, the glassworks are well worth a visit. You go through a little museum thing that the lady on the ticket desk (free entry ) puts on to your language and 10 minutes or so later one the show has finishesd the doors slide back and you are in the glassworks themselves. You can blow a glass ball for 15chf - a worker starts you off and collect it to take home 15 minutes later.

			It's a bit more of a hike, but there's always   (in The Netherlands).  We've been a few times, lots of parklands and open space.  If you can pull if off, go for a weekend and hire a bicycle.  Cycling around the bulb fields is fantastic, Lisse and Leiden(sp?) are nice towns too.  The tulips should be at their best for the next few weeks (or so).  If you want a guarantee, ring the gardens or Lisse VVV (tourist info) to ensure the bulbs are out, because if the winter has been cold, they can be a week or so late.   
Make sure you take a raincoat/umbrella though.

My husband had a great time in his short visit, I think he really feel in love with the place.  Of course, I knew once he had access to good beer he'd be done for.    
Thanks MarkJ- I know talking to you really eased his mind about a lot of questions he had. He ended up going to that pub you recommended and had a blast talking with some diplomats from all over the world.   
5AVeci- He toured old town like you recommended and was quite impressed with it all.   
LausanneBrit- He said the chocolate Easter eggs were amazing! He didn't think they'd survive the plane trip though.    
Now we just have to wait for the fast moving Swiss to get everything moved through all the panels and committes. We are supposed to hear the end of April or early May.

Koper peninsula in   is nice as is Krk etc on the upper  coast. Also a very scenic drive down, or you can take an overnight sleeper from Zürich.

			Hmmm.... 
Looks like thebest idea would be to travel (by train) Nice -> Milano -> Como -> Lugano. 
Rent a car there and spend some time around Lugano, into Italy through Porlezza (back to lake Como) and/or Luino (Lago Maggiore).   
Around Lugano itself you might want to check out the following locations: 
Monte Brè / Castagnola / Cassarate /Gandria 
Sorengo / Gentilino 
Carona / Morcote / Bissone 
Gola di Lago / Tesserete / Bigorio 
Or else even: 
(Malcantone) Novaggio / Miglieglia / Banco / Bedigliora 
(Mendrisio) Arzo / Tremona / Serpiano and/or Morbio Superiore / Muggio   
An embarassement of riches, I'd say    
Drop me a line if you need any addt'l info.   
Best,   
Paul

			Hi everyone!  I have been trying to figure out on the web how I might be able to pull something off and just can't seem to figure it out.  I am looking for something similar to the Golden Round Ticket for Lake Lucerne and Pilatus which is only available in the summer.   
Has anyone out there tried a boat tour on lake lucerne coupled with a trip up to Mt. Pilatus in March?  Any suggestions on how to put this together?  My mom and Aunt are coming for a week in March and I thought this would be something they may like.   
Thanks in advance for any help!

			Review of Flumserberg Friday night skiing.    
Free on the first Friday of each month and open every Friday from 7.00pm until 10.00pm.    
Only the one lift is open from the Tannenbodenalp car park, it is the 4 seat chair lift that only goes roughly half way up, the longer one from the that same car park is not operating.    
Crowds were pretty heavy from 7.00pm with about a 10 minute wait for the lift later in the evening there was only a 1 minute or so wait time.    
Because only one lift was open the ski area was not so busy. Many people were of an expert level, although the course was only an easy run, I could see from the form they were mostly very good.    
Getting there, take the bus from Flums or go by car to the Tannenbodenalp car park as none of the other lifts are open there is no other option.    
Lighting was good to excellent. White light, no need for goggles so long as it is not currently snowing.    
Overall good to go once or twice in a season. Problem is the run is limited so you will get bored, almost guaranteed. There was even some entertainment on the slopes in the form of clowns with painted faces skiing and some faschtnacht instrument players walking around. Last good point is there are a number of bars along this particular run and these are all open.

			We've taken advantage of the Hotelplan deals a couple times now. One place we highly recommend is Hotel San Gian in St. Moritz (think the Swiss counterpart of Aspen or Whistler). The service is friendly and the food is EXCELLENT (4-course dinner every night).    
For 5 days of skiing (covering 3 mountains), room and breakfast & dinner, the high-season cost is just about CHF 1,000 p.p. (low season is around CHF 700+) My husband and I are heading there again next week.   
A comment on the halbpension - from my understanding Swiss hotel rooms typically already include breakfast, so the ""halbpension"" is really cost for the dinner during your stay at the hotel.

			My two rappen:   
As you are traveling with a little one it might be easiest to fly to Rome and then take the trains (or even rent a car) from there. Florence is only 170 km from Rome and Venice is only 190 from Florence. With a car rental you could stop along where ever your hearts desired as there is lots to see between the cities. (I did it a couple of months ago and really enjoyed the freedom of a car). The train ride from Zurich to Rome is pretty long (over 8 hours I believe) and a flight is generally not that expensive and much quicker. If you're on a limited time frame it would make more sense to not waste a bunch of time in transit.

I thought the price was reasonable, considering food is included, and that we booked last minute.

			Just do a Google search. Go to Google Switzerland, check the pages from Switzerland radial button. and enter ""hotel Samedan"" or ""hotel Andermatt"", you will come up with piles. If one you want is full, call them up and ask for their recommendations, they always have their fallbacks.

I'm Richard, a balloonist since 1981, and also a BBAC (British Balloon & Airship Club) instructor. I live in Altendorf, ca. 20Km east of Zürich and have 4 balloons here in Switzerland, 3 of which are airworthy. I'm the Lindstrand agent in Switzerland. Unfortunately I can't instruct towards a Swiss license because of Swiss rules, but can of course instruct people towards an English license. Since I really enjoy teaching folks to fly balloons, this is very frustrating, so let's see if we can work something out.

			I knew you would come through with a few suggestions. The Grieder store has an elegant range though its clientele are not preferred company...there must be quiet a few rooftop terraces with undiscovered bars in the area though...   
Ill certainly check out the bar near the Zoo for more suitable company. I was up at the Dolder last week. Its still a mess. God know what they are doing adding such monstrosities to an elegant building.   
Oh, on a slightly different topic there is a book out called Cool Restaurants Zürich or something, which is a pretty book but contains little hardcore facts...

			If you want cheap and cheerful, try the Hotel Capricorn in Laax.  If you want reasonable price and you're as much into partying as you are into getting on-piste, then check out Riders Palace which is also in Laax.   
The Best Western in Flims Waldhaus isn't cheap but it's not bad and this year even has a new chinese restaurant across the road.     
In Flims you could have a look at the Hotel Arena Ski & Golf.   
In my experience it's hard to find decent accommodation for decent money so if anyone else has any suggestions I'd be most pleased.

			Looks like we may be hitting the road tomorrow night, is there a list of motorway hotels anywhere. Just want to drive 200-300 KM and put my head down in a hotel somewhere, preferably at a service station, rather than going into a town.

			NYE in Barcelona (to me) = BORING!!!!   All bars and clubs close. Only thing open is restaurants as the tradition is to go eating at a restaurant late evening. Some people will receive the NY at the restaurant, other will eat and then head to Plaza Cataluña where there is a big clock a top one of the buildings. They will all wait for the clock to strike twelve and then proceed to eat 12 grapes before the last stroke of the bell / clock. Then most people either hang out on the streets and wait until the bars re-open at 2am or go home and then go out around 4am to celebrate. Of course, if you are a tourist and it is your first time spending NY in Barcelona or for that matter Spain, no one bothers to tell you that the bars will re-open just a few hours after midnight. I was with friends there and we all had the impression that that was it... eat your grapes, get drunk, go home.

			Indeed, you have already been advised that Edf means spoken English, with deutsch and french subtitles. If the movie just states D, then it's spoken German only. It's not just kids movies you have to watch out for, but also some of the bigger blockbusters.    
Finally, if a movie wasn't originally in English, then you're out of luck, as there'll be no English subtitles. In other words, be careful with Mel Gibson movies.

			here are a bit more than a few lines about the customs background         
Events like this will take place in Appenzell and Wallis as well, they are remainders of our celtic ancestry and  roughly all of these events,have to do with chasing out the bad spirits and welcoming / or make place for the good new spirits ( e.g. new year)     
I think it would be interesting to go and see ift, especially if you update yourself with the history of the custom,then you'll know who's who in the cortege etc   
Have fun!

A really nice trip with great scenery is the train journey to Interlaken (Change in Montreaux) this would make a good day trip though the journey may be a tad long for a 2 year old.   
Thermal spas in the area as well for some relaxation.............stunning mountain backdrop, snow falling and you are outdoors in lovely warm thermal spring water. - Enjoy""!

			Hi,   
Im wondering if there are any women out there who have The Artists Way by Julia Cameron and would like to follow the twelve-week course with someone else. I started it with a friend in Milan but moved before actually finishing it. It was better doing it with another because we shared our experience and encouraged one another.   
If anyone is interested to meeting up say once every two three weeks please send me a message.

			I will be visiting my partner for the first time in Neuchatel over the Christmas and New Year's holidays.  Since our dogs will board at the kennel in Virginia, can anyone suggest a location within Neuchatel or its environs (trail, lakefront, residential area) where dogs and their people go for recreation?  We'll be craving to spy some frolicking terriers about January.  Is there anything comparable to US off-lead dog parks?     
Also, what vendors sell hot chestnuts we can munch while strolling? Thanks for any holiday advice.  It's my first trip, and I'm looking forward.

			I take it that you need your ticket to show a US carrier's flight number? Do you work for the US government, I know that Federal workers have to fly US carriers because of this Fly America act.    
The United flight to Washington Dulles (UA 937) continues on to San Fransico. You clear customs etc in Washington.   
Additionally, probably better for you,  United and Swiss code share on the LAX flight so if you book on UA 8600/ UA 8601 you will be on the direct Swiss flight to LAX with a UA number. US don't seem to codeshare though.   
Hope this helps.

			Suppose it depends on what you mean by close, an hour and 10 mins by train and you can be on Vierwaldstattersee where you can easily spend a day visiting various towns around the south end of the lake. Can be a bit touristy but my kids loved the William Tell Museum in Burglen and the trip on the lake to Rutli and Tell's Kepelle.   
Schaffhausen as mentioned is a pleasant town and a walk by the river and on to the Rheinfalls is lovely as long as the weather is kind. Some of the local vinyards are worth a visit (I would recommend Fam Strasser at Uhwiesen, and only 10 mins from Rheinfalls followed by a nice meal at Gasthaus Hirschen).

			As a starter it would take about 4 to 5 hours drive, some lovely towns on the shores of Como e.g. Bellagio.   
I would take things a bit slower and go over St Gotthard pass if driving. Take time to see Lugano, Gandria, Bellinzona en route.

			Definitely good offers although I must add that I have found similar good offers with SWISS just by logging directly into their website. For example, on Dec 4th I need to fly to Hannover. I bought the ticket two months ago at 19 francs each way. With taxes and all it came to 150 francs round trip. Naturally, to take advantage of the good rates, one has to know way in advance when they are flying. I tried looking at the same flight with a one month advance purchase and it was up to 900 francs!

			From what I remember, the chocolate factory near the train station in Versoix is open only once a year for tours - during Versoix's chocolate festival, which was earlier this summer.   
The trip to Broc to see the Callier chocolate factory, if done in conjunction with a trip to Gruyere (where you can visit cheese factories as well), is worth it. They've recently re-done the chocolate factory, and the tour (now self-guided) is not as good as it used to be, but you can still eat all the free samples you want.

			I've done this one three times with boy scouts and I like it:      - Monte Lema - Monte Magno  - Monte Pola - Monte Gradiccioli - Arosio - Mugena - Breno - Miglieglia.   
Horizontal distance: 21 km 
Total altitude difference (upward): 1300m 
Highest point: 1935m above sea level   
The route starts with the climb to Monte Lema, which also can be done in a cablecar. There's a restaurant and a small hostel on the top. Then you follow the ridge which is over the tree line, the sight is nice and sunscreen a must. The descent isn't marked as well as the other parts of the route but once you're on the road there are some possibilities to take the bus instead of walking back to Miglieglia.

			Hi   
I'd say that Klosters is prettier than Davos - especially when there is no snow but it is very easy to get from on to the other - the guest card gets you on the free bus between the 2   
The outdoor pool in Klosters is heated (also free with guest card) which given the mountain water is something to think about if you do want to go swimming!      will have info on the klosters side of the mountain   
Have fun

Also, not too late to buy some fireworks. There's a stall outside Migros selling them like hotcakes.

			I agree with ISE, most of the summer ski areas have stopped operating. Titlis and Laax I know don't do summer anymore (or at least didn't last year). We went to Zermatt to do some summer boarding and it fairly good. The pistes are good and wide, but it is only pull lifts that operate, and just like Saas Fee you have to get the lift back up to the top to get the cable car back down to the town.   
Also you need to get up at the crack of dawn to get the cable car, it takes nearly an hour to get up to the ski area, and you can only board/ski until 1pm.  Its a morning only activity.   
Having said that, it is kinda cool to go snowboarding in a t-shirt, and the conditions were surprisingly good.

There's a surprisingly big church in Re that's really interesting.  Apparently it took a couple of centuries to build and was finished in the 1950s.   
There's a bakery in the middle of Domodossola that makes the best amareto cookies.  It's worth the trip there just for the cookies alone.

I am looking for Advertising for 2008, so if any one knows of a company who would be interested in purchasing a balloon and  having it flown all over Switzerland then please send me a pm. I am trying to make ballooning accessible to the Group.      
If you are interested in helping or may be learning to fly (British license) then please get in touch.   
The next balloon event will be in Bad Duerrheim (Germany) just north of Schaffhausen at the end of August. In the meantime if the weather is good, we will be flying in the Zurich  area most weekends.

			Hello, 
I am US born and my huband is Swiss (Basel) born and raised, we have a 17 year old daughter. We visit there on holiday several times a year. We are looking for a teenager, preferably a girl or a group of kids mixed, that our daughter can hang out with while we are there next month. Do you know anyone with good teenage kids or any teenage clubs that you can refer me to there in Basel? 
Thank you

			I will have lived in Zurich for 1 complete year on July 1st but I never had time to travel further from Basel. So, my wife and I decided to spend the coming weekend in a beautiful spa called Le Mirador in Mont-Pèlerin  Montreux.    
On our way from Zurich, we will pass through kanton Aargau, than Bern, Fribourg and finally arrive at Montreux. I am trying my best to make this short trip as efficient as possible in terms of sight seeing too. I think its a good opportunity to discover across Switzerland.  So I was wondering if anyone could help me make this route from Zurich, more attractive and fun? any advices? route suggestions?    
Thanks

			If you live in Basel, you might try starting your journey across the border in France so they won't look for that stamp.  You might be able to claim it's an old one.  Of course, they might ask to see your flight info, but you never know.

			I second Fraser and the others - take the train and avoid Satan. Less hassle than flying and reasonably priced if you have a Halbtax or GA in Switzerland. I used to travel Zurich-Frankfurt occasionally for work and it was really convenient. I flew once and vowed never again after getting stuck in traffic on the way in and showing up late for an important meeting.

			I've just come back from a long weekend camping in Lake Garda (not literally  ) anyway can highly recomend it, it was a beautiful place and not too busy being June. We stayed in a small town called Limone sur Garda which was beautiful and not busy with tourists, we also visited Verona which was about an hours drive away which was as to be expected, stunning then drove back through the Alto Adige region into austria and then back in to Switzerland.   
Anyway I can highly recommed visiting this area along with the other lakes and as someone else mentioned its not too far from Switzerland

			I thought so, about Terravision. The service I use is by Arriva North (bus company) and is slightly more expensive, I'll try the Terravision one next time. National Express is also a private company btw but I think their service goes through Liverpool coach station so it's a bit longuer timewise.

			The sub-title ""Free Time"" in this topic and the ""Entertainment"" name in the Entertainment and Dining topic are often confused. Indeed, what one man does in his free time may well be entertainment for another.

			Lausanne, what a wonderfull city, if you know where to look !   
I'm here since 1998 well I had time to see some  wonderfull places, and sometimes, I find new great places I never saw before.   
Well, first one of my favourite place is the Roman Ruines, near Vidy, it's so beatifull, with trees and grass, and a calm place to be with your Wife/husband or lover. There's a little pond with frogs and cute mice.   
How to find ? With the bus 2, ""bois de vaux"" stations take the first street which bring you to the lake.     
The Main graveyard: 
Ok basicly graveyard isn't a fun place, but his one is just amazing, not so for from the Ruines. It's a big one, with lovely tombstones, and there is a ""happy air"" I mean, it dosen't look like a sad/dead place, it looks like a place for people to rest, but still be loved by the familie. There's amazing building all over, with artificial ponds, some places looks like video game ""alone in the dark"". It's also a good place to watchanimals. There is Foxes, loads of birds and squirells ! very quiet and good for a walk.   
How to find: With the bus 4 or 2, ""montoie station"" the grave door is in front of you     
Mont-repos: 
My favourite aera ! It's an enormous parc, with old castles and bird cage in the middle. Place to walk, and an Ice Cream kiosk. Really lovely, I love to read here, or think, stay alone for  hours and watch trees and sky. The castle is now an olympic official building.     
Just some feet away there is the ""tribunal federal"" (in the UK it's the Old Baileys of London)   
The Building looks american, but behind the building there's something amazing. 
A wonderfull medieval Tower, with a micro forest all around. Under the tower there is a cave, with a river inside, and from the tower ther's a waterfall. Not known even from people who live here !     
Well that's it for tonight, next time I'll give you tips for places to eat/drink   
Tell us if you know good places in your aeras, also tell me if you visited this places, what do you think of them !   
Have fun !

			We were there just a couple of weekends ago, Bellinzona and the castles are very nice.   
Instead of taking the bus up to Castello di Montebello, you can take a pleasant 15 minute walk from the train station. Turn left outside the station and walk until you get to a square called Piazza Collegiata, with a large church that has a grand staircase called Collegiata dei SS Pietro e Stefano. Turn left up the small street on the far side of the church (the right-hand side when facing the front of the church), where you should find the yellow diamonds that signal all Swiss walking trails. Follow the yellow diamonds up to Castello Montebello (there are quite a few steps, but not too many - my wife had no problem even with a bad knee). You can walk around the grounds for free, or pay 4 CHF to look at their museum.    
As Lob said, you can also get into the grounds of Castelgrande for free, just take the free lift/elevator up there from Piazza del Sole in the middle of town.   
Apparently, the top castle, Castello di Sasso Corbaro, doesn't really have any grounds, but still has a museum that you can pay to visit. However, we never made it up there so you'll have to let us know how it is if you get there.

3789	11.05.2007, 16:46	Forum Veteran	Thanked 145 Times in 91 Posts	Location: Uk now	"      I always felt uneasy about flight times when going from Luton - it's not exactly easy to get to compared to Heathrow, Gatwick or Stanstead which all have express and/or fast train services direct to the terminals.  Plus there's even less to do there than Stansted when you are waiting.   
   Would hate to be stuck there on New Year's Eve - definitely something that'd make me think twice about using the airline/airport again.   
  The time I was late there, there would have been no other choice than to wait at a hotel overnight and fly out the next morning at 7am. Even though I got on the plane, I decided to fly from other more accessible airports in the future.  It's just not worth the hassle/nerves factor these days, especially since security now takes so long to clear as well.

			I can very much recommend the hotel  , opposite the bahnhof in Davos-Platz. Although part of the Best Western chain, this hotel has an authentic feel. It offers good value for money, has 2 local restaurants under its roof; one with Graubundner specialities and one for cheesefondue and raclette in particular. And the hotel has a nice bar and a good Finnish sauna.   
It's very close, about a 3 min walk, to the gondola of the Jakobshorn, so ideally located to go skiing/boarding in the Jakobshorn area. And at the end of the day, perfectly located for apres-ski at the Bolgen.   
I also know one place where you'd better not stay -- hotel   in Davos. It was our only option, as the rest of Dvaos was fully booked (2 weeks ago). First of all, it's far from any lift, so you1d have to take the skibus in the morning to Parsenn or Jakobshorn. The interior dates back to the seventees. So expect furniture from the seventees, a completely brown bathroom, a 10"" first generation colour TV and a small room in general. The breakfast buffet is far from complete -- if you'll ask for a cappuccino they look at you as if you come from Mars. No bacon and eggs for breakfast either. Moreover, the skiroom has no heated pins to dry the skiboots. This was much more expensive than Terminus. The website itself is probably the best part of this hotel..that's what lures people in (and sheer lack of availability of any other place to stay in high-season).

			migros klubschule in oerlikon. When we went (2 hrs on 2 saturdays) there was an English guy taking the lessons. Very understandable (to me - probably not to anyone who couldn't speak english though!) ""steppen sie to the rechts, then to the links.....""highly hilarious though. We learnt enough to get through our first dance.   
They also do other (more sophisticated) courses during the week, but if you just want an introduction do the wedding course. BUT they do slow down the songs, so if you then go and try it at home to the same tune you'll end up in a heap on the floor!

3807	24.03.2007, 14:49	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: USA - East Coast	"    Hello,   
Along with the other advice you've received, I'd like to add a few things that might be of interest, especially to your children.  My husband is from Switzerland, but we're living in the US at the present time.  We've traveled there several times with our children.  They really enjoyed visiting the St. Bernard Museum in Martigny on our last trip--there were lots of puppies there, and they were a big hit!  I'm not sure I would drive all the way there from Geneva, but if you're going past it anyway, it's worth a stop.  We've also visited the hospice on the Grand St Bernard pass, but May may be too early for that.  Our older daughter is 13, and she enjoyed the Chateau de Chillon in Montreux and also our trip to Gruyere castle and watching the process of cheese making. You can also visit the Cailler chocolate factory which is near there, but we've never done that.  I think a drive along the lake from Geneva around to Lausanne, then on to Montreux, and Martigny would be nice.  You can't beat the view of the lake with the mountains behind...it's breathtaking.  We also like going high up in the area of Crans-Montana on the cable cars.  I'm sure there are closer places to Geneva, but my husband's family is near that area, so that's where we usually go.  Sometimes we drive through the Grand St. Bernard tunnel over into the Val d'Aosta area of Italy.  Going through such a long tunnel is fun for the kids and for weird adults like me!  Plus it's fun to have an Italian pizza!  We've taken the train from Sion to Zermatt and on up to Gornergrat to view the Matterhorn (Le Cervin in French)..it's a fun train ride and spectacular views of the mountains. I guess that would be a really long day trip from Geneva though...there are probably other train rides to be had that are closer.  We visited the Grand Dixence Dam one summer--it's enormous. There were also some really unusual rock formations in that general area...les pyramides d'Euseignes.  Both of those are above Sion, which is about a 2 hour drive from Geneva.  Those are just a few ideas....I'll post if I think of others.  Have a wonderful trip!!   
--Sophie

			Dont forget Ryanair to Friedrichshafen (I just booked two flights for £56 all in).  Its a 45minute ferry ride (beautiful) across to Romanshorn and then an hour on the train up to Zurich.  Not the quickest of routes and you have to get up at the crack of dawn for the flight but if price is your main consideration...   
There is also a fast cat ferry from Friedrichshafen to Konstanz/Kreuzlingen.

			I wasn't expecting to find much in the way of good beer when I moved to Basel from Munich. I like the Ueli Spezial (but only from bottles, filtered) and their Weizen beer is good in hot weather. Hopfenperle is an acceptable Feldschlossen beer. Warteck is OK if I can get a clean pint. I can't say I am a fan of Unser beer which seems like an Ueli poorer cousin. Some of the beers here I find detestable, like Cardinal. I am wondering if there are some worthwhile beer trips I can make from Basel, if need be going over the border. Can anyone make any recommendations?

Do you have any information on dealerships in Germany that will sell a vehicle VAT free (and ideally can negotiate in English)?   
Otherwise I will probably purchase or lease on arrival.

Three Plays have been chosen by the Play Selection Committee for next years spring production in May 2007 at the Schönes Haus, Nadelberg, Basel. 
Auditions will by held at the Restaurant Löwenzorn, Gemsberg 2/4   Date: Monday, November 20th, 2006 Time: 19:00  
The plays are as follows:  Shop for Charity by Charles Mander - director Diana Zuger Expert in Flowers by Krista Jaquet - director Krista Jaquet The Celebration by Anton Chekhov  director by Jamie Sievert  Synopses  Shop for Charity 
This amusing play is about the value of charity shops: do they really help the Third World or are they just a sop to the consciences of middleclass people who run them? Brenda needs the shop as a refuge from her imaginary attackers, and her fellow workers need it to give them a sense of importance. Mr Galbraith visits it because no-one else will tolerate him, and his biblical ranting provokes Doris to consider the true nature of charity. If it begins at home, where does it end?   The cast: Hilda - The manageress. Middle-aged. Brenda - Extravagant-looking woman gone to seed because of alcohol. Doris - Middle-aged, kind hearted woman. Mrs. Pike - Frail elderly woman, very deaf. Mr Galbraith - Elderly scruffy, tramp-like person.   The Expert in Flowers 
This is a play (with musical parts) of four mid-lifers encountered by a sudden, violent death of a wife / close friend / lover called Vivi. They are shaken; the shock pushes them off their familiar behavior, routines and roles. A part of them is gone. Vivi  their relationship with her  brought something out of them, in good and bad, that no-one else ever will. The dynamics of the group is altered  nothing is the same as before. Their lives change direction.   The cast: Pascal  cynical war reporter surprised by his own vulnerability Larry  cool and collected lawyer in emotional turmoil Tammy  former stewardess who tries to act like an artistic intellectual  Sonya  motherly career woman at the end phase of her mid-life crisis Vivi  recently dead whose message is expressed through music and songs. Vivis part will be performed by Helen Super, who has also composed the music for the play.  The Celebration by Anton Chekhov 
Anton Chekhov is one of the greatest playwrights to have ever lived. Along with Henrik Ibsen, he helped usher in modern theatre. The difference between Ibsen and Chekhov, however, has been summed up nicely in this way: Ibsen would write a play about a man who commits suicide because he lost a million dollars. Chekhov would write a play about a man who commits suicide because he won a million dollars. 
Chekhov wrote a number of one-act plays. They are generally farces, and ""The Celebration"" is no exception. In this play, a bank president is derailed in his attempt to celebrate the bank's anniversary by an insolent employee, a frivolous wife and a demanding client. The play ends in a riot of confusion and frustration as the banks directors attempt and fail to go ahead with the celebration.   The cast: Kuzma Nikolayevitch Hirin - cashier of the bank. An irritable old man. Andrey Andreyevitch Shipuchin - president of the bank. A vain, middle-aged man. Tatian Alexeyevna - Shipuchins wife. Nastasia Fiodorovna Merchutkin - A client of the bank.
Three members of the Board of Directors (one of whom makes a speech).

			Good one George. I've been a few of those places, but it really reminded me about how Zurich desperately needs some more ""nice"" places, especially by the side of the lake. Such a shame to have such a beautiful coastline and not have more nice cafes by the water!   
I did hear that there is a new one opened up by the Piramide (spelling) clinic (you know that big glass pyramid). Has anyone been there yet?   
I occassionally go to Bagno Paradiso in Herrliberg which is by the lake. If you can put up with the fact that it's just a place to be seen and get ripped off then it's nice. Mind you, I usually turn up just after a dive looking like a total scruff but I don't care.   
I go to the Sonne sometimes, but have had some bad experiences there with respect to service. I know there isn't any, so you can imagine it must be quite an achievement to mess it up! But since there isn't much choice I go sometimes.   
Side note: I heard Hotel Ermitage is closing. Never been there though.
