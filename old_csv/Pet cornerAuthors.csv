Great rates especially for long stays. Two (or three?) brothers run the business. A little slow on getting back to you, but they always pick her up on time. They are in the Zurich/Uster area andspeak great English! 
The only downside... my dog smells like cigarette smoke when she comes home.

Our user Meloncollie and others regularly and readily post very helpful info on pet care and especially the SKN course on the EF, and I'm certain they will help you if the need should arise.  
To help us keep the number of new threads and posts regarding the SKN issue low,    
Thank you.   
----------------------------------------------       
Please refer new pet owners with SKN queries and general questions regarding dog courses to this thread as a first step, so that they can read up on the requirements and see if they have questions which haven't yet been covered in this helpful thread.    
Thank you for your help.

FYI, it is not a federal requirement that a dog   be vaccinated against rabies, only that a dog entering (or re-entering) Switzerland has a valid vaccination, checkable at the border.   
I have had to let Hooligan's  and the Belltie's vacs lapse due to contraindicated illnesses. They obviously cannot cross most borders (one of the reason I am still here    ) or re-enter Switzerland once having left (which is why I haven't been on holiday in years), but are perfectly legal to stay as is throughout Switzerland. See:    )   
Of course private parties such as training schools, shelters or kennels, sports clubs may require vaccination for many different diseases (rabies, KC, etc.) in order for one to participate.     
Hopping on my soap box:   
Federal requirement notwithstanding, healthy dogs should be vaccinated against all diseases that you and your veterinarian deem appropriate. And as the owner of compromised dogs who can no longer be vaccinated, I am grateful to all of you who do vaccinate, promoting herd immunity.

			This post has made me think for a while. I am a total cat lover, but truly I cannot imagine a cat on a flight for 8 hrs (East Coast) or 12 or more... in a soft carrier on a plane. Not for the cat- and certainly not for other passengers either... I know mine would scream blue murder all the way- and the thought of an animla not being able to pee, poop or eat for such a long time is just a total NO.   
When we moved here from UK,  12 hours by car- we bought a very large wire dog crate, so our cat had a litter tray and water- and we stopped regularly to open boot (trunk) for fresh air- and stopped overnight in a HÃ´tel that allowed us to have our cat and dog with. I would personally much prefer my cat to travel in pressurised hold in a large crate where it can move around and have access to above. All airlines specify that animals must NOT be sedated as it is just too dangerous.   
And I wouldn't want to impose a howling cat on others, especially long haul- what about people who are highly allergic to cats?

			I do the opposite of free feeding, food only comes from me, I decided when and how much. But nonetheless the dogs do not get meals in a bowl, they eat throughout the day.   
Every piece of kibble is a reward.    
Each morning the dog's ration for the day is measured out and goes into my training treat bag. A pocket will do if you don't want to go for the 'doggie bag lady' look.    
Then as we go about our day, frequent short training sessions, inside and out, as well as on our walks and during our play and quiet times together - because every single interaction with you is a training event - the dog is rewared with a piece of kibble every time he does what I ask.   
This form of feeding works well for us as:   
1. The dogs learn quickly that I am the source of good things. This builds that oh-so-important bond, and quickly.   
2. The more they do as I ask, the more good things come their way. Paying attention to mum = good things happen. Light bulb moment!   
3. A young pup has a lot o' learnin' to do. Rewarding the small steps towards the larger goal (in training speak, shaping) repeated the umpteen thousand times necessary for a puppy to cotton on to the concept, means lots of little rewards. A puppy would soon balloon into a beach ball if she got both meals and training rewards. So why not dispense with the bowl altogether and make all food a reward?    
4. I know exactly how much as been eaten, I am in control of portions and timing. But as we eat small amounts throughout the day I have minimized the risk of gobbling that might lead to bloat*. Because I am in control of when my dog eats I time eating and exercise accordingly. (With free feeding you might miss that your pup has just eaten as he takes off for high speed Zoomies around the garden.)     
This has worked well for mine over the years, balancing the amount of food given while keeping training motivation high via rewards.        
* Be aware that there are other causes of bloat as well. Owners of deep chested dogs are most likely to be affected. But bloat can happen to any dog of any size or breed, all dog owners should be aware of the condition, symptoms, and prevention.     
ETA:   
There are many different ways to approach feeding, not really advocating one over another. (Other than feed nutritionally sound food, in appropriate amounts, keep your dog a healthy weight.) One should choose an approach that is right for the individual dog, but above all, as with every thing one does with one's dog, one should understand  one is doing what one is doing, understand the positives and negatives, and make informed choices.   
Thus endeth the sermon.   "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: May 2010	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Dog agility or Saluki / Greyhound running tracks	Fidgety	Posts: 506

			Updating my own thread.....   
I never went to the open house.   
Sadly we have been to the pet crematorium in Seon twice in the past 3 months, most recently on Saturday.   
The staff are really caring and helpful. The website is not in English and even in the German version and in the brochure there is information missing which I thought I should share.   
If you bring your deceased pet yourself, you can have a paw print set in clay made to take with you. We thought this was a lovely gesture and it was free of charge.   
The particular urn we chose can be hand painted with a photo of your pet. Friends of ours had this done and that is how we learned of it. This service is fee based and it also requires extra time so the urn will not be ready for pickup as early as if it was not painted.   
Lastly, we requested and were given a letter, in both German and English, to present at airport security should we wish to transport the urn in our hand luggage.

			So, on Sunday I came with my dog to Switzerland. on Monday I have registered the dog at the tax office (since in Bern canton you have to pay 100 CHF annually) and today we went to veterinary office.  
and it was 106 CHF - they have charged me consultation, check up, entrance of the information into swiss system and two pills since they think that in Croatia we have some kind of a heart worm and my dog has to take the pill now due to it. of course, I have called back home, and they have said that we do not have that disease in Croatia but nothing I can do now. 
the good thing is that here vaccination against rabies is once every three years (back home in Croatia is every year) and there are no ticks here until april so less chemicals on my dog

			A big question- as although Switzerland is small- it has a great variety of different ecosystems, geology, altitude, lake regions, peat bogs, different type of mountains at diff. altitude, with the Jura being lower and mainly limestone, and the Alps with a lot above tree level and granit, and other rocks-  and very distinct flora and fauna depending on that.

			Open plan kitchen/living area I assume.  Otherwise, simply shut the connecting door when you're not in the kitchen.    
What other cat climbing/lounging items do you have in the house?  One of those cat trees or something similar?  Some cats do like to be up above observing those below them so if you don't have anything like that then get one.  That may solve the problem.

I have visited a lot of kennels over the years and would be happy to offer any input or suggestions if you are looking for any. I also have a ton of dog beds and related items for sale, all washable, which I think is mandatory for a kennel. You can always send me a PM for details. I see no problem in saving some money and buying used items and of course I can provide a receipt. Best of luck with your project.

			Well he is still hanging in there. He has continued to lose weight and now losing muscle as well which is not good. He is down to 8.7 kg   The steroids for the autoimmune haemolytic anaemia seem to be working as his red blood cells are creeping slowly towards normal but his white blood cells are as high as ever. His liver function is good but he is incredibly thin so he's on a special diet now. There was talk of him going to the animal Hospital at Bern this weekend but I don't see the point. The vet is being really really good but the dog is very distressed everytime he goes as he needs to have blood taken every time injections of vitamins and yesterday he had his back passage examined and two enormous long swabs up his nose. He was hysterical and subsequently I wasn't much far behind him.  But the red blood cells improving did give as a glimmer of hope and the vet agreed that there was no point in sending him to the hospital when I pointed out that the only thing left was to x-ray and scan him to see if something going on in his chest and if there is this nothing that they can do so all the while that he is happy we are going to keep him at home.

			I was going to put the name and contact number for the person that runs the adoptions in Switzerland but I wasn't sure it was permitted in the forum.    
This is a non profit organisation, based in France which aim is to build a net between France, Switzerland and Belgium to find homes for Border Collies in need of a new start. All dogs are adoptable in Switzerland and Belgium and BLC will organise carpools to get the dog to you if you are unable to travel to pick it up. The organisation doesn't have premises but a network of foster families that look after the animal while giving them the basis on education and socialisation till they find a forever home.    
All the information is on their facebook page (in french) and their website (also in French) 
The person that runs the Swiss adoptions speaks very good English.            
I have just taken on one of their dogs, Instead of adopting her I have opted for fostering with the intention of adopting. She has been with us for a month and is about to be officially adopted.

			How are the fish doing ?   
Very cool project and great idea.   
Feeding wise, what goes in comes out so to speak so little is generally better.    
The temp will anyway be room temp so probably 22Âº or there about, not really cold but less than is considered as tropical at least.   
Must admit that pellets man be better for goldfish as they'll more likely eat the fallen pieces on the substrate vs flake as it looses it's flavour and attractiveness very quickly but goldfish are hardly fussy so they'll probably eat anything.

			There is an excellent 'pension familial' - a boarding kennel run by a charming lady Marie-Claude Liechti who speaks English fluently, she lives in a pretty farmhouse with heated kennels dotted around the garden, I think she can have 6or 7 dogs (not sure) I have left my terrier, Bobby, with her 4or 5 times a year over the last 9 years. He is really happy there and frankly, a lot healthier when I collect him (they will collect dogs from your home) Mme M-C Liechti, Chemin du Saugy 22, 1806 Saint Legier 0219431512   0794133971 she also offershealthy dog foods, health therapies and education/training. I feel that she has a great knowledge and years of experience with dogs, when Bobby is with her, I know he is in good hands.

			None of ours are that friendly around here.  In fact in all the years we've been here I remember only one that was friendly and that was a very young cat, just a few months past kittenhood.  He didn't mind coming to say hello, but he disappeared after about a year.  Don't know if the owner moved, the cat got run over or what.     
The immediate neighbours have been in and out a few times since the cat turned up so if it belonged to them I'd hope they'd have let him back in by now.  Then again, maybe he crossed their yellow lines once too often and they've thrown him out.    Just kidding.  If he is theirs I'm sure I would have seen it before now.

I really appreciate your taking the time and trouble - even going so far as translating the Tierdatenbank search boxes! After hearing your experiences, on the one hand I'm feeling much more optimistic that I will find my pet soon, and on the other I'm daunted at the thought of the application, interview and vetting process - what if I don't measure up?! Suddenly applying for a job seems a cakewalk in comparison. Your advice has certainly prepared me for what lies ahead and I will try a multi-pronged strategy to minimize the chances of rejection. I hope to get back with good news soon - thank you so much for your support.

			I think the first question to answer is if a 3 legged cat can use a cat door. Perhaps a temporary test installation just made with a sheet of hard styro with a cat door fitted to it would help answer the question.

			My cat lived to 19. She was rather incontinent in the end which was a bit frustrating, but she did have a lot of love still to give - we lived 2 years with the constant drip surprise (perhaps the reason I have a trauma with shoes lying around instead of being inside a wardrobe).

			Just wondered if there are any reef aquarium keepers lurking around the forum. Admittedly reef aquariums are particularly mobile so perhaps with so many mobile people it's not such a popular hobby. There's 7 English speaking reef keepers around GE & VD that share knowledge and experiences together, all are expats except 1 so it's a very eclectic mix.   
Always happy to meet up and share experiences and knowledge with anyone out there, or happy to advise any beginners looking to start in the hobby.   
All the best

53	08.10.2016, 14:25	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Just to emphasize:   
Although the federal SKN will no longer be required, please keep abreast of changes to cantonal dog law. Now that the federal government has said it no longer has any interest in promoting canine education abd safety, there seems to be much talk of the various cantons putting stronger measures into place.    
We tended to emphasize the federal law in discussions here on EF as that was one constant - but now we need to keep cantonal law in the forefront.    
And if I could add a plea:   
I would urge all dog owners to keep taking classes voluntarily - especially foreigners, both long term residents and newcomers to Switzerland.  I fear that having abandoned the SKN, the next serious incident involving a dog will result in more draconian measures - and you know if a foreigner is involved it will be worse for us all.   
As outsiders to Swiss culture, many of us are taken by surprise by 'Swiss canine norms'. Expectations are indeed different here, not knowing or following those norms will hurt your dog. Fines for allowing your dog to piddle on common grassy areas, barking at noon, restrictions on leaving your dog alone in your flat, to name a few differences - and of course there is a difference in the level of training expected.   
Once you settle in, please take a dog class if only to learn what your neighbors will expect of you. Starting on the right foot (and paw) will make it much easier on you and your dog.   
There are many good Hundeschule and many different types of classes offered, from basic training to Familienhund to a wide variety of dog sports to special interest courses.  Classes are offered in many different languages, use this hobby as a way to augment your German/French/Italian classes. Or if you prefer, take classes in English -  for instance, EF member Cherrry Tree offers these.    
I am saddened that the SKN is no longer required, and having lived through the witch hunt that followed the Oberglatt tragedy, I fear that backsliding on the part of Swiss dog owners will see those dark days return.   
Not to mention - taking classes is IME the easiest way to find your feet and make friends in your new home. A good Hundeschule can be a 'soft landing' for newcomers to Switzerland.

			A heads-up for those who are interested in learning more about wolves, and about issues surrounding the return of wolf populations in our society:   
Monty Sloan from Wolf Park (a renown wolf refuge and research park in Battle Ground IN, USA) will give a seminar sponsored by CHWolf ( ) at the Schweizer Jugend und Bildungszentrum in Einsiedeln on Saturday 5 November and Sunday 6 November. The seminar will be in English, with German translation.    
More information here:         
 (ETA: Replaced link, the other document linked to an earlier lecture)   
Mr Sloan is also giving a lecture at the Uni-Zurich-Irchel on Thursday 3 November at 19:30. More info here:       
---   
I've been to Wolf Park - an amazing experience. If you ever find yourself in Hoosierland put a visit on your list.    
I'm looking forward to hearing Mr Sloan.

There are people who need it, thats true, but to be honest, 4 measly lessons are not enough to make somebody a responsible dog owner if they dont want to be

			I take our cat to the Katzenhotel Ermitage. It's classed as KÃ¼snacht but is actually about a 15min walk from the S18 stop at Forch. Our cat is on his second holiday there at the moment, and when I dropped him off, he couldn't wait to get to his favourite bed on the lower level.     
The owners and staff at the Katzenhotel are lovely people, and the place is spotlessly clean. I pay CHF 27 per night, and our cat came away last time full of life, and climbing every tree in the garden.   He appears to like it there.

			My main reason for walking off the lead is because I want to be able to throw ball, or a Frisbee  and watch it run with my kids have fun with the freedom. 
As I said I would love a Beagle I quite like the naughtiness! but I want to be able to have my dog run free when its allowed.    
I have romantic notions of walking in the middle of nowhere having a picnic, the kids playing and running with the dog, me relaxing and eating good food..... 
(yeah I realise that is probably not going to happen but its what im aiming for )   
There is some great advice here, thankyou all. Im now really excited about finding our new family member. I think ill try and contact a few breeders and ask to meet their dogs, (hopefully they will be keen on this) once i have chosen Im happy to wait if they dont have any pups, I get this is a major decision and I m not going to rush into it.

			I am biased as I am registered on petsitting24 but I do agree with meloncollie (actually I agree with you a lot  ). You can find true animal lovers and people with a lot of animal knowledge on the platform.   
I started doing catsitting for moms that I met on my group of mothers and then someone told me to put up my profile on that website. The pet owners come, meet my family, see the apartment and decide in good conscience and peace of mind.    
If I may say also pay attention to what questions the potential petsitter asks about your dog. That is sometimes more important than what he/she may reply to your own questions. Curiosity about your dog and what he likes/dislikes are crucial. Maybe that's something you could do for your Hercules but yes it does take time. Good luck in your search!

owner's declaration is a formular where you have to state that you are the owner of the cat and that you are not bringing it for sale. In my case, I had to shorthair european cats, no breed ones so it sounded ridiculous to me, but I get why is necesary.

			I'm delighted to hear this news. I vividly remember an emotional lecture in my first year veterinary science class where the professor was almost in tears as he described the horrific effects of selective breeding to suit fashions and trends. It's not a new thing, mankind has been doing it for millennia, but that doesn't make it any more acceptable.   
Shih tzus bred with their eyeballs perched almost completely out of their eye sockets, at high risk of proptosis, because those enormous eyes look endearing; dachshunds suffering excruciating spinal pain to give their owners the pleasure of owning an abnormally long, low-slung pet; pugs and Pekingese, Himalayans and Persians with brachycephalic heads resulting in severe respiratory distress, dental problems and shallow eye sockets Â these pets aren't cute, they're pitiful, and humans created them that way. To me, this sort of selective breeding is on a similar level to tail-docking and ear-clipping Â cruel, pointless and completely unnecessary, and like tail-docking and ear-clipping, it should be illegal.

			Yup. What they're saying is that the Regulations are different here, and as a result they (United) can't handle the dog directly. Swiss and Lufthansa have gone through whatever steps required to do so, but they don't operate direct flights to Dulles. She came with us on united from Chicago and we used pet safe, and picked her up with ace pet moving. But, on the way back we have no choice but to use ace and pay the $1800. The best alternative (which isn't), is to go to Munich and fly Lufthansa direct to Dulles from there and pay the standard dog fee.

			This came through my feed a day with police type stuff, police dog shows too.       
""Die Kantonspolizei St.Gallen prÃ¤sentiert sich mit unzÃ¤hligen Abteilungen in Schmerikon. Es erwarten Sie interessante VorfÃ¼hrungen, Informationen, Unterhaltung, Spass fÃ¼r die Kinder und vieles mehr. Wir freuen uns auf Ihren Besuch!""   
Looks like the police dog show is at    
""PolizeihundevorfÃ¼hrung in Schmerikon SG am 03.09.2016 10:30 Uhr/13:45 Uhr:""       
I like watching them in action. respect!   
They seem to do similar things in the states too. Here is      
Looks like you can be a perp   and the dogs will track and attack.

If you really want to get rid of the beep you can disconnect the beeper if it is separate from the circuit board. If it isn't you can at the very least muffle it by filling it with something like 5 min epoxy. The ""click, thump, Meow, thud"" will remain.

			We have beardies, too. Living in Basel it's easy to slip over the border and buy grasshoppers (they like these best) at KÃ¶lle Zoo, where they're about half the price of hoppers at Qualipet. However, the quality isn't great as they seem to die quite quickly (they only last 3-4 days, even with fresh lettuce and carrots), so buying in bulk is not worth it. I've returned to buying at Qualipet, where I'm happy with the quality.    
Having insects delivered within CH seems ludicrously expensive (I just checked LiB's first link, above â grasshoppers there are slightly more expensive than at Qualipet and they charge an additional CHF 9.80 for delivery, which would work out to at least an extra CHF 250 per year for me). Ordering in from Germany could result in VAT issues and the exorbitant inspection fees, plus it takes time for the delivery and I wouldn't expect to receive the insects in any fit condition.   
Breeding your own insects is not going to work. You won't be able to load them nutritionally,  like store-bought grasshoppers, unless you really invest a lot of time and energy into the process. And it's a total PITA, trying to keep microscopic hopping insects in their containers (and separating the adults from them, so their offspring don't get consumed, without losing a handful of baby insects all over the floor).    
In conclusion, just buy from Qualipet. Take advantage of their 10-50% discounts the day before stock is replenished (usually a fixed day every week) â there will be some dead insects in the box, but not enough to make the discount not worthwhile (and in any case, I can usually tempt my dragons to eat not-too-long-dead grasshoppers) â and get their customer loyalty card for some extra savings.

			Corbets, I'm so sorry about your dog!  That is awful!  I'm a bit shocked that in rule abiding Switzerland someone would allow their uncontrolled dog off-lead.    
I'm a bit concerned for my own dog.  We've lived in Bern for a year.  We just decided to import our dog, who was being looked after a family friend since we though we would only be here for a year.  I run near the Aare and often see dogs off lead and not always within sight of their owner.  This makes me uncomfortable as a runner, but even more so as a dog owner.   
Does anyone know what your rights are in such a situation?  What are the potential repercussions and obligations for the owner of the unrestrained animal?  What are my rights if my dog ends up injured like poor Rusty?   
Thanks for any information.  We're new to dog ownership in Switzerland.

			Why would you need to be willing up on your job? Why can't you have both? Both my grandmother and my mother wanted to pursue their professional career and have kids at the same time. They just had to get someone to be there for the children while they were at work, and at the end of their working days they spent lots of quality time with the kids. And we are talking about kids here. Of course it is possible with dogs.

			Name - Panino  
Animal species - Cat  
Gender - male   
We are going on holiday from the 2nd to the 19th of september 2016 and we would need somebody to take care of our friendly, big, soft cat, named Panino (half maine coon, half ragdoll, sterilized). 
Panino loves to be around people and he is very social. Therefore we would prefer to leave it to somebody rather than having somebody coming in our place daily. 
We live in seebach-Zurich. Please contact me via email at  
Thanks!

			Does your puppy (probably a large dog now) has a lot iof fur and are his eyes difficult to see, then i was told it is hard for other dogs to ""read"" your dog. If he has a good haircut it may get a lot better.   
I have an almost 2 years old Kooiker dog who is very sweet but gets aggressive if he sees another male dog. We went to a special ""dog meets dog"" training and it worked really well for our dog. (Fair train in Ottenbach is the dog school i went, no conncection)   
Another point was that the dog teacher suggested that my dog got chemically castrated, this means it is reversible after 6 months (a chip is being put in his behind) but you can see how he reacts when he would be castrated. For my dog it worked also fine, he is much more reliable when it comes to listening and he is not so nervous around other dogs anymore...   
hope this helps!

			Per my experience with separation and a cat, it was not an issue for the courts per my lawyer, and she said it should be worked out amicably between the parties.  I paid and took cat to vet, provided his habitiual home, and mostly paid the pension costs.  Day to day interaction was equal.  I proposed to share ownership and expenses.  Originally adopted from an SPA the cat was registered in the database in ex's name.  I haven't seen adoption papers but think the same situation there.  One day I find out the name in the database has been changed to my name, thus it seems I now have custody or ownership, as much as SPA gives, and continue to take on full care of cat.

			aww poor Dirk   
Not sure I want to invest further into an automatic one.. My cat recently lost the second tracker fitted collar which cost more than I want to remember. And this morning -in the middle of the rain- he neowed from across the street and I had to walk out and get him before the neighbord started throwing their slippers at him. He may really be getting forgetful. Ive had cats who slowly lost teir little minds (cat alzheimer?) and they would forget where to pee or eat.. I hope this isnt the case with him and he is just being a jerk.     
Urs Max, I dont mind neighbors cats.. they let me pet them unlike mine who only deamnds food and bites my ankles when it doesnt get served fast enough   He likes being brushed but he prefers having his space

			Yes, the Tierspital does indeed offer care for tortoises.    
Typically you'd want to look for a vet specializing in reptiles. At the Tierspital, that would fall under 'Zoo-, Heim- und Wildtiere' :       
The clinics and practices I go to all have vets specializing in reptiles as well - but as mine are in SZ and ZG, unless you are farther down on the left side of the lake likely too far for you.    
As I am not a tortoise person, I'll leave it to others who are to give personal recommendations.   
But should those not be forthcoming, you could also contact the SchildkrÃ¶ten Interessengemeinschaft Schweiz for a recommendation for a turtle vet near you:       
By the way, SIGS offers an advice hotline:       
And browsing the SIGS site further, here is their list of recommended veterinarians:       
All the best...

			From the 20Minuten:       
and        
A woman in Schaffhausen was found to have made at least 15 trips to smuggle around 50 puppies in, crossing at various Swiss borders. The puppies were mostly Chihuahuas and Prager Rattlers.   
Apparently she was selling the dogs online. And apparently, a good number of naive folks were taken in.   
----   
I know I sound like a broken record warning puppy buyers of the rampant battery farming and illegal puppy trafficking that goes on in Switzerland - yet people keep falling for this evil activity.    
So once more with feeling:   
Only buy from a responsible, ethical breeder, after having done due diligence on the breeder.    
A responsible ethical breeder is one who requires you to undergo an assessment as to your suitability to take on a dog, one who requires you to meet him/her several times - and one who invites you to his/her place to meet the dogs, opens up health records and is happy to discuss health issues referring you to the vet as well, encourages you to see the socialization program in action, and   all your questions and due diligence efforts.    
The same goes for those looking to adopt from a rescue, as sadly the battery farmers and puppy traffickers now pose as rescuers.    
Again, do your due diligence on the rescue, look for the same things as you would in a breeder  and check the  if applicable. Above all, do not fall for a sob story, as this is what the puppy traffickers play on.  They themselves cause the misery that they use to 'hook' naive would-be adopters in - and responding to that only perpetuates the cycle of abuse.     
---   
Be aware that if a dog is brought into Switzerland illegally it can be seized. And if not vaccinated it can be, and in many sad cases has been, ordered euthanized.   
So..... Augen Auf Beim Hundekauf. And eyes open when adopting, too.

			Thanks Mrs.Doolittle . Our contract states that the pet ownership agreement is not transferable to a new tenant. So, any new tenants would have to set up a new agreement anyway.   
Good point, though, about being able to have doggie visitors. I've seen neighbors have their friends come over with dogs, and so I've never given thought to the idea that you couldn't have visitors with pets or take care of someone's pet without a pet agreement.    
So, maybe it's best to just leave things as is.   
Kind regards,

			I've recently come across a website that I think could benefit many EF dog owners:        
The program, developed by behaviorist Jennifter Titus, is aimed at owners who need to help their dogs with reactivity issues, but IMO all dog owners might benefit from reading through the site. There is a wealth of information here.    
Many of the points discussed are what I would consider to be Training Fundamentals, the basis of pretty much all we do with our dogs. I wanted to highlight this site, though, because Ms Titus presents these fundamentals nicely bundled and in an easily accessible way.    
The concept and exercises could be applied to all sorts of training goals.   
For those of you with reactive dogs, the CARE protocol might be a valuable addition to your training tool box.

			There are two threads covering this topic. Maybe a mod can merge them?       
It seems opened food is difficult to donate. We had to switch our eldest dog (15 1/2 years old) to a special food and she disliked what we bought even though we had started with a 2kg trial size and mixed it with her old food. So we had an almost full 12 kg bag of a Hills prescription food.

Maybe someone can explain where the  ""arrived in Switzerland after that date""  part for the SKN course comes from?   
And No, I don`t have to do the course...

Just as I was thinking that the baby fox was gone, I just witnessed history!  The fox chased and caught a hen from the garden it lives in. The fox is no longer a baby; it is still pretty, just not as orange as I imagined it would; and it looks healthy, what with the supply of fresh chicken right there sharing together the same abode.     
Unfortunately, the wildlife ""rehabilitation"" will come out and shoot it very soon, per my neighbor's info.

Actually this varies from Kanton to Kanton, you must be very careful to cross the road exactly at the border when your dog walk goes from a ""Left"" Kanton to a ""Right"" Kanton.     
Dornach, Is that one of the Gemeinde where you have to put your left shoe on before the right, or is it the other way around?     
Are you sure this didn't get messed up in translation? The SKN courses say you should have the dog to your left when on a leash. (At least they used to.)

			I'm sorry to hear that Lizzie has hurt herself.   
I usually try to do anything to avoid the Cone Of Shame, but there are times when there really isn't an alternative.   
Recently the Belltie needed a catheter kept in so I could give him meds, and Hooligan had to have a drain left in after surgery. Neither was too impressed, to say the least. It's a full time job keeping them from chewing, isn't it?   
My general practice with leg or paw wounds:   
While inside, a cotton child's sock loosely put on over the paw, best if you have one with those anti-slip thingies on the sole. Velcro around the ankle, and if long enough around the upper bit of the sock as well. This generally is only enough to stop them chewing while under your supervision, but at least that's something.   
When you go outside, wrap the paw loosely in gauze and then cover with VetWrap, the self-adhesive stuff. Take off when you get inside, as the VetWrap, while not fully water tight, would still prevent necessary air from circulating and hinder healing.    
So while you are supervising:   
More interactive dog play than usual, the idea is that games will distract the dog from wanting to nibble at his paw. A game of search, rounds of (gentle!) fetch, a puzzle game, or simply time on your lap or by your side - anything your dog likes to do with you. A filled kong, or challenging treat ball can be a good distractor when you can't supervise.   
I've successfully used distraction/redirection with Hooligan against chewing. (Standard interrupt, then click-and treat for acceptable behavior offered. In this case, she is rewarded for choosing to chew a toy instead of the wound. The goal is that she learns that on chew impulse she should pick up a squeeky toy instead.) But she was already highly trained and responds very well to this protocol; I've not had the same success with the Belltie or with Heffalump. (Well, no success at all with Heffalump yet. He is still very much a work in progress.)    
But if Lizzie already responds to distraction and redirection, you might try.   
Mine can't get out of Sabro shoes... but that is because they are form fitting. Which I would think would hinder the healing process. Most of the hard-to-pull-off shoes would be too close fitting for a paw wound, I would think.   
At night the patient always sleeps in my bed so that I can feel if he/she starts chewing at the wound and can stop it immediately. That's the only way I've found to monitor nightime activity that gives me a chance at sleeping too.   
---   
But if distraction doesn't work and she is worrying the paw to the point of re-injuring herself... I'm afraid the Cone Of Shame it might have to be.   
If management is getting to be a real problem, see the vet sooner rather than later if only for a check. He might decide that healing is going along well enough to give you the OK to relax your routine - and at least then you'd have peace of mind.   
Thumbs pressed for Lizzy's recovery.

			Just coming back to an earlier post I made about using Petmeds.de   
Our eldest dog Hana had started eating a special Hills dog food. She happily polished off the 2 Kg bag so we ordered as 12 Kg bag. At that point she decided that she was going to turn her nose up at it. She just would not eat it.   
Hills have a 100% money back guarantee, but you have to go through the company you buy the food from. We were expecting all kinds of hassle but the response was immediate. They acknowledged our claim, immediately said that the credit card charge would be reversed. And that was it. They didn't even ask for the food back (which would have been the biggest hassle of all).   
Three days later the credit appeared in my account.

			An FYI for cat owners in the greater Schwyz/Leftside ZÃ¼richsee area, as the upcoming summer holidays mean many will be looking for holiday care:   
Marigin Tiermedizinzentrum has expanded it's cat hotel, there are now 25 rooms:       
The cat hotel is located in a quiet wing of the clinic, away from the hustle and bustle. I saw the accomodation while on a tour of the facility, and was impressed.   
Something to keep in mind especially if your cat needs meds, or needs a level of care that a standard sitter cannot provide. At the Katzenhotel the cats are cared for by the clinic staff.    
Now, I am not a cat owner. But thanks to assorted canine emergencies I have spent a lot of time at Marigin of late, have had a chance to get to know the staff, and can certainly speak to the excellent care that animals receive there. These are good people, their dedication to the animals' wellbeing is evident.    
---   
Best to book your cat's stay at the Katzenhotel early, especially during peak holiday times.     
ETA: Forgot the important info; Marigin is in Feusisberg SZ, in the First areal between PfÃ¤ffikon and Schindellegi.

We will take week end and longer trips, sometimes with, sometimes without our dog.    
We were thinking of heading up to Lucerne one of the early weekends while we wait for our stuff to arrive.  Not really sure of sense of bringing the dog if we want to hit Pilates or another mtn.    
Here we have a boarding place where dogs play in groups outside during the day, but have singular pens at night. Our dog loves it and practically jumps out the window when we pull in.  We have done 2-9 nights (last trip to CH).

143	27.03.2016, 18:57	Forum Veteran	Thanked 267 Times in 157 Posts	Location: Vaud	"    As already correctly mentioned, the law in Europe only states that the transported animal must not hinder nor distract the driver. If the animal is tied to the seat, it is transported legally. When using a box, the animal must have enough room to move inside the box.    
Both the testers (Swiss TCS, German ADAC) considered the retraining aspect of transporting the animal. Both tests were acceptable for testing the construction of the boxes, and safety of the humans.     
But only the ADAC German tests were more relevant to the animal safety.  
ADAC reported (As I mentioned above, and for which I received a groan) that in a box the animal will suffer a 25 g force in a 50 Km crash, and will be seriously injured, however the driver will escape injury.    
They tested small plastic boxes placed on the back seat, retrained by the car belt, and as the video shows, the animal burst out of the box and hits the back of the front car seat, and would be seriously injured.    
They tested a harness secured to the car seat belt. The idea was OK, but in practise there was too much slack in the animal belt to be effective. If the animal belt was made tighter the animal belt remained inadequate and stretched.    
They made the tests by using soft toys and & filling them with ballast to achieve animal weights of 5kg for cats and 15Kg for dogs. They didn't have any crash sensors to fit on the dummies, as are used when testing human dummies, but the results showed that in all cases the animals would have serious injuries or be killed.    
The ADAC writes, that the law states the animal must have enough room to move. The laws of physics state the animal will be seriously injured in a crash.    
Conclusion, there is no completely safe method of transporting animals in cars.

			It's difficult to find a qualified dog sitter, so do make finding someone a priority.   
One site you might look through is Petsitting24, a platform for sitters advertising services:       
Be aware, however, that you have to pay a membership fee to contact any of the sitters listed. Also be aware that not all the sitters listed are in compliance with the SKN requirements for paid sitters, the onus falls to you to check for that.   
Also look through Rent-a-Rentner, a platform for retired folks looking to do a bit of work now and again. (The same applies as to SKN qualifications, the onus is on you to check.)       
(For some reason the site isn't loading for me at the moment. If you have problems, try later.) 
---   
If you are looking to hire an EFer - and there have been recent posts of people looking for any work so someone might be interested - it might help if you put in some more details.    
Things like what breed/mix, size, age, sex, can the dog be walked with other dogs, and if so any restrictions, can the dog be around small children, etc. A bit more info could help you find someone interested in taking on the job.   
---   
Best of luck - I hope you find someone. A good dog sitter is worth his or her weight in gold. (Which is close to the going rate, btw.   )

			The groan on your first post was entirely unintended, no doubt a slip of the finger -- these things happen and I have removed the groan.   
However your subsequent comments are unwarranted. Where did I make any mention of Trudeau, or even involve Canada in the Al-Qaeda discussion? I explicitly stated that I didn't know the situation in Canada. The reference to procurement of grasshoppers to commit acts of terrorism was what we in the enlightened states of Europe call a ""joke"".   
Unfortunately your sense of humour bypass and offended reaction fit the stereotype of Canadians to a T -- the little kid who pales into insignificance next to his big brother and is determined to find offence in everything that's said to or about him. I have close family living in Canada and I know many Canadians who manage to buck the stereotype, but sadly, there are always those on whom the stereotype was founded.

The alternatives -- having to ensure you never go to the shop alone, or leaving the dog at home -- must be worse than the small risk of having this experience repeated.   
The perpetrator sounds like he had severe mental problems, so he is just as likely to attack the dog while it's being looked after by someone outside the shop.

			Dtmck,   
Your samoyed is not on any of the cantonal BSL lists, and neither of the Basels imposes restrictions based on size, so you are in the clear.    
The next question is whether you are required to do the SKN Theory course. As above, contact the cantonal Veterinaramt for a ruling, for folks moving to Switzerland with the family dog this is taken case by case. I know people who have been excused and I know people who have required to take it.   
According to the law, you should be required to do the SKN Practical course... But we saw on another thread that a poster was excused even though he and his dog clearly fell into the time frame where the course is mandatory. Go figure.   
One thing you will learn about this Land Of Many Rules is that enforcement of the rules is often selective and left to the interpretation and attitude of the individual bureaucrat. You can never rely on someone else's experience as a guideline, and you often cannot even rely on the text of the law either.    
Now, my advice to newcomers is always the same: whether or not you are required to take the SKN courses, please take it anyway. The SKN courses benefit you and your dog as you learn the peculiarities of the 'Swiss way'.   
The two courses are very easy, only two sessions for the Theory and 4-5 sessions for the Practical. The practical course is simply an overview of the basics, an experienced owner will have no trouble whatsoever with it. The courses are inexpensive, usually less than Chf200 each. And there is no test, all you are expected to do is show up and participate in good faith.   
IMO, the Theory session explaining dog law in your canton and community is extremely valuable to newcomers, this is info you need and might not come across elsewhere.   
You mention your son's relationship with your dog. This would be a perfect opportunity to work on that. You, the legally responsible adult, would be the person who needs to do the course, but your son could attend with you and act as the dog's handler. The SKN course would be a great way to forge a  further bond between the two.    
(You might even find at your son would like to go further; for instance, my trainer does a 'Kind und Hund' course specifically geared to children working with the family dog.)   
Just my 2 cents/pence/5Rappen.   
Good luck with your move.

156	06.11.2012, 10:35	Newbie	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Zurich	"    Luapm, I am happy to hear that your dog is very tolerant of your children's behavior. She sounds exceptionally good natured. But I do want to emphasize the 'exceptional' bit.   
However, wearing my rescue hat I'd like to share a cautionary tale for all reading:   
In the twenty plus years I have been volunteering with rescues I have had many phone calls from vets who have a dog on the table being prepped to be killed for having snapped at a child.  The comment from the owners is always the same:    
""But we've always let Johnny push, pull, sit on him - and he never objected before!""    
Young children should never be allowed to pull, push, sit on, or do anything to a dog that could cause pain. Dogs are animals, not robots - and they all have a pain threshold. A dog who seems very tolerant of rough handling might one day be pushed beyond his personal threshold... and snap.   
Too many dogs are killed because owners put them in situations they cannot - and should not have to - handle. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but one day the dog might be pushed beyond what he can endure.  Again, he is a dog, not a robot.    
Sometimes the vet is able to talk the owner into relinquishing the dog to a rescue (hence why I get those calls) but most of the time the dog must die - consequence of the owner's lack of setting boundaries for the children.    
An unfair and wholly preventable death. And wholly the owner's fault.   
So... while I am happy for you that you have an exceptionally tolerant good natured dog, I could not let your post pass uncommented upon for the sake of others reading it.  And for the sake of all the dogs who didn't get a second chance. I'll say it again (and again and again until the message is loud and clear): no dog should be put into a position where a child is allowed to cause him pain. It is unfair to the dog and unfair to the child.   
So for all out there: In bringing a dog into the family with young children you have double the training to do - train your dog, and train your children how to interact safely with your dog.  And of course, supervise interactions when the children are too young to understand your rules.     
Thus endeth the sermon.

			This is info only, as I do not use groomers for the Muttley Crew so do not have any personal experience. But since no one else has replied...   
IIRC there is a (possibly independent) groomer at the Meiko in Hunenberg, which is in the same building as the Ennetseeklinik. The Meiko shop is open on Saturdays, but you would have to call to verify what the groomer's hours are.        
Again, I have no personal experience, so you will need to do your own due diligence.   
If you find a groomer who comes recommended (always the best way) but generally is not open on Saturdays you might ask if a special appointment is possible. Some groomers will accomodate out of hours appointments, but there might be an additional fee.

162	26.08.2008, 14:37	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Our cockatoo is never noisy during the quiet times as she is sleeping. Adequate sleep is very important for them. When ours is tired she already tells us that she wants to go to sleep. We resorted to moving her to a smaller cage in another room so she is not disturbed though she is not bothered by the usual sounds. But if the doorbell rings when she is sleeping she gets really mad. She sleeps for at least 14 hours a night. During the day she makes noise, but we live in a house so it is not an issue. She is very popular with the neighbours. I take her outside often as sunlight is really important. She is fully flighted so she wears a special harness. She will talk to anyone who walks by and asks them if they are going shopping  . There are tons of kids in our neighbourhood and they are always wanting to come and say hello to her or the dogs. The fact that she talks (a lot) and is quite a character has made her a real hit. She is not any noisier than the parrot living a few doors away in the garden centre and everyone tolerates him. I hear him in the early morning.    
A cockatoo is very loud and that is the reason why so many need new homes. I would count yourself lucky that your landlady has a noisy dog.

			Thank you Meloncollie for the information on the Hundehort.  Our dog does play well with others and it looks like he would have the time of his life there.  He went once a week to a doggy daycare back in AZ and I think he is missing the play dates. With no car though it may be hard to get him there as we are relying only on public transport.  We are hoping for something closer to Retkreuz if possible to leave him when we go on quick weekend trips but we will definitely keep your recommendation in mind when we leave for longer trips.     
Thanks.

			Lucy, a pet relocation company with a good reputation is ACE Pet Moving, based here in Switzerland. They move pets all around the world.   
As you can see from their gallery, they have moved several dogs from Australia.       
Yes, costs are high.   
But given the complexity of this long trip, I would urge your friend to consider a professional pet moving company. Perhaps she could contact ACE for an initial discussion, just  so that she has fully investigated her options.   
This is one area where I would not count the cost. Save elsewhere, pinch every penny possible in all other aspects of this move. But the animal's safety when flying long distance is paramount, especially the very long distance from Australia.

I wholeheartedly agree with CB, Ays - if you are getting a puppy someone must be home 24/7 for the first many months, with some puppies even to a year plus.   
Even when you adopt an older dog you must plan for a settling in period of several weeks/months before you leave the dog. As CB points out, you must establish that bond first, without that time to bond you are facing a steep uphill climb to get even basic training done.   
Perhaps if youtell us a little bit more about your plans, we can then make suggestions based on our experiences...

			Unfortunately Babesiose (also called Piroplasmosis) has been found in Switzerland for some time now, but not as common as the other tick born diseases so some vets still might not think to test for it given the symptoms. If tick born disease is suspected, insist on including Babesiose in the test.

Consider all the bits of your life which having the responsibilty of caring for a young dog and giving it the relevant 'basic education' would mess up.    
I know several folk who have done this and it is a very rewarding field but, like any form of dog ownership,  it is not just a free-time fun occupation to be taken on lightly.

			Although we live very close to the German border, I have never looked for a sitter from Germany to come to our home. However, we have compared the price of kennels and that was quite shocking. I was told the reason the kennels in Germany are much less expensive than Switzerland is due to the lower salaries paid to the kennel staff.   
So I think the salary is not the issue, but rather finding someone. Perhaps inquiring at some veterinary clinics in Germany near to the Swiss border might be a starting point.

Folks whose leases do not allow the dog left alone in the flat might like an evening out, as would folks who with young puppies or elderly, ill, or behaviorally-challenged dogs who shouldn't be left alone.   
Folks who wish to do a day or weekend trip to places where dogs are not welcome or not appropriate for their dogs - think of all the folks who do day or weekend ski trips; having a weekend dogsitter would be a godsend.    
I'd imagine you would find plenty of takers from EF alone.

Your post brings up a good point. There are many different kinds of dog care needed.    
Perhaps we could use this thread as a sort of market research springboard for those contemplating getting into dog care and trying to decide what services to offer.    
So fellow dog owers, what kind of care do you use, what kind of care do you need (not always the same thing...)? And most importantly, what do you see as missing in the current market that perhaps an entrepreneurial EFer might consider providing?

			Many of the provisions in the proposed law are common sense - and things most responsible dog owners already follow. The provision to promote dog safety/handling education among the public is very positive.   
But I am concerned that the notion that dogs are inherently good or bad, and that a 'good' dog must be able to tolerate any stressful situation is widepread here; I have seen a tendency here in Switzerland to expect more of dogs than we do of humans. I fear many dogs will be unnessarily condemned under this law.   
I would welcome a test of my abilities as a dog owner - whether I am able to correctly assess my dog, to train him, to provide an happy life for him that does not infringe on the rights or safely of others. But I worry that the practical test mentioned in the draft would be a test    along the lines of the   (character test) used widely in Germany as was suggested in the press last spring.    
A few Swiss trainers - who seem to have the politicians' ear, if the newspapers can be believed - advocate a test which puts a dog in a variety of stressful situations and judges his/her reaction. A dog showing aggression when put under stress - even fear aggression - fails the test.   
I have some experience rehabilitating dogs who been badly abused. Many come out of their shells, and could sail through such a test. Some could not - this  t mean that these dogs are dangerous. It simply means that an owner must understand the dog's special needs, and structure his environment accordingly.   
(And yes, there are many numpty owners out there who can't or won't recognize this, and should not be in charge of such a dog. But most dogs deserve a chance to live peacefully in the right environment.)   
My first collie is a perfect example. Thanks to horrific abuse in his early years he was very fear aggressive.  I worked with him for nine years to overcome his past, and when handled correctly, he became a wonderful pet.  Even so, to the day he died there were many stresses he simply could not handle - my job was to make sure that he was never put in those situations.     
My sweet old boy would not have been able to pass a  , and might have been order euthanized under this law. As would several of the foster dogs I've taken on since then. (All of whom have found good, responsible homes...)  I can only hope that we'll see some common sense in the application of this law. Test the owner, test the handling, not just the dog's 'character'.   
During the heat of the anti dog hysteria last winter and spring many dog were dumped; pressure from neighbors and landlords was a reason often given. Shelters are full to bursting; the homeless situation here is critical.  I fear it's only going to get worse.

			That is exactly it: they are still in the development phase and will no doubt need to raise funds in order to support the process of bringing this to market. Prospective investors will expect IP to be, well, proprietary.

			Have any of you tried looking for dog care via the SVBT (the umbrella organization for Tierpfleger education)  jobs postings?   
I'm tempted, as my search elsewhere in Switzerland has proved fruitless. I would think that someone doing a Tierpfleger Ausbildung should have the skills and outlook I need.    
However, the fee for a non-member to post a job is rather high, and I know that in Switzerland folks rarely work during their education - I'd like to avoid just tossing that money out the window.    
So before I go that route, have any of you tried listing a job there, and if so, was it a good source of qualified candidates?   
Many thanks.

			Rosrae, there isn't a test prescribed under the law, participation is what is required for the SKN classes.    
I just want to clarify this, as it regularly pops up on EF.  Some folks seem to be afraid of being tested and so refuse to take the required classes, leaving themselves open to all kinds of problems. No test, just participate in the class and you are good to go.   
(Yes, if an owner's behavior in the class is so egregious that the trainer feels the owner poses a danger to society the trainer can refuse to issue the certificate, reporting to the VeterinÃ¤mt for further consideration. But a good trainer will first work with the owner...)     
---     
AustralienGuy, just so you understand what the SKN is, and what you would have to do if you were to work as a (paid) dog carer:   
There are two courses, Theory and Practical.   
The Theory course is required of all first time dog owners. 'First time dog owner'  usually means not having had a dog registered in your own name in the federal database, a 'family dog' does not count.     
Foreigners who have owned a dog in their own name in other countries but not in Switzerland need to contact their cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt with proof of prior ownership for a ruling on whether they are excused from the theory course, or not. Some are, some are not - the decision seems to be individual.   
The SKN Practical course is required of all dog owners with every dog acquired after 1 Sept 2008. Owners of multiple dogs will take the course multiple times.   
A commercial dog carer - that is, one who is paid - must at a minimum take the same courses as an owner is required to take.     
---   
If one is not paid, if one is doing volunteer work, as the previous posts have pointed out one is not required under the law to take the courses. (But individual rescue policies vary, some do ask that you do them.)   
But IMO (and IME) it would be a good idea to take the courses even if not required if one wishes to regularly work with dogs, or if one is a newcomer to Switzerland - especially the theory course which discusses dog law and ownership responsibility.  As the examples in Clarasmum's and EastEnder's posts point out, dog law, dog etiquette, and expectations of owners here might be rather different from what you know in your own country.   
---   
An FYI for all who read the Pets Corner:   
Perhaps the best article on the SKN classes I have found is by Hundeherz, here:     
This not only explains the SKN classes, but goes farther discussing what one should look for in a good trainer and what the course should cover. I urge you all to read the article. (In German only.)   
---   
Wishing you all the best, AustralianGuy - hope you find a volunteer opportunity that suits. Helping homeless doglets is a very rewarding experience.

			I would go even further and say:    
A dog, or any pet, should never be bought or adopted 'for the kids'.   
No, the only reason to bring a dog into your family is because you yourself, the responsible adult, very much want the animal in your life. While children may love their pet, they cannot take on the responsibility, either legally or realistically - that will always fall to the adult.   
---     
I'm glad to see that the BLV is running this campaign. The scams, the abusive battery farming, illegal dog dealing - these are all alarmingly on the rise in Switzerland. The above barstewards pose both as breeders and as rescues, one MUST do one's research, one MUST keep one's eyes open and a healthy dollop of skepticism at the ready... And one MUST be prepared to walk away from this evil trade.   
It is getting worse, as the scammers, battery farmers, Hundemafia target rich gullible Switzerland.    
I almost wish we didn't not allow advertising dogs for sale or adoption on EF.  A gathering place of expats, many of whom are not familiar with the issues, let alone the laws here, is not the place where serious breeders or established rescues want to advertise...but is a natural magnet for the dark side.    
But then I look at a few threads where a legitimate poster helped out in a legitimate situation, and would hate to see that taken away.    
I just wish we could do more to unmask the dodgy folks.   
---   
But back to international purchase or adoption:   
We should be careful of making the leap that importing dogs from outside Switzerland is wrong.   
It shouldn't surprise anyone that half the dogs in Switzerland come from other countries. There are not many breeders in this small country and in many breeds the numbers are dwindling. Rescues are feeling the same pressures. Switzerland is too crowded for many to find the space needed to set up appropriately, getting planning permission is a very high hurdle. So yes, many serious buyers or adopters will not be able to buy or adopt in Switzerland and so will look over the borders, either to buy or adopt.   
There is nothing wrong, and a whole lot right,  with buying or adopting internationally PROVIDED you do it right. That means due diligence, traveling to the breeder or rescue as often as necessary, which could be many times and over long distances to do the necessary assessment on all sides, informing yourself of all import regs, and complying with all aspects of Swiss federal, cantonal, and community dog law. Including (y'all know I'm going to say this) taking the required SKN classes.    
And above all, it means making an absolute  commitment to your pet for it's natural lifetime, no matter what happens in yours.    
Hopefully this campaign will make prospective dog owners stop and think.

			Im quite surprised by the rats' described behaviours to be honest. I had several rats when I was younger, and they were all very tame, clever and adorable little buggers. And all were bought from pet stores.    
Rats need to be petted from a very young age (ideally they must be adopted at about 6 weeks old). This way they get used to human contact, and become wonderful furry friends.    
Hamsters now, these are nasty creatures...

We humans should also keep our diet all the same. Three meals a day instead of two meals a day. In general, smaller portions few times a day are more healthy than a single large sumptuous meal.

Animal  charities have warned the irresponsible gifting of puppies is  unwittingly fuelling an illegal trade in smuggled dogs to be sold  online. 
The Dogs Trust and RSPCA have both raised concerns about  corrupt eastern European breeders exploiting the demand for Âdesigner  dogsÂ by smuggling underage puppies hundreds of miles to be sold in the  UK Â with fears that ports in Suffolk and Essex may be used as entry  points. 
The charities say smuggled puppies often suffer terrible  journeys and are so young that vaccinations are ineffective. Many of  those seized at borders face quarantine in the UK. 
Chief Inspector  Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA Special Operations Unit, said: ÂThe number  of calls weÂve received this year about puppy farms and puppy  trafficking is truly shocking. 
ÂAll UK ports are potential entry  points for traffickers bringing these dogs in Â after they have  travelled hundreds of miles in awful conditions. 
ÂWe have  investigated claims of puppies being bred or kept in poor conditions,  before being sold to generate huge profit, for many years. 
ÂHowever, the percentage rise in the calls we received since January is extremely worrying. 
ÂPeople  are making thousands of pounds off the back of breeding and importing  sick puppies. There are no two ways about it Â it is organised animal  crime.Â         
As posted some time ago- we happened to be at the Channel Tunnel pet check at the same time as 2 vans full of dogs from Lithuania, and the ladies at the Check said they had 3 full vans of dogs from Romania the day before- 2 weeks before Christmas...

			And a bit of pedantry:   
In 2003 the law changed so that animals are no longer considered 'things' in the legal sense. You likely have heard the sound bite 'Tiere sind keine Sache'. But this does not go as far as many might think it does.   
Animals are recognized not as things, but as animals. That distinction offers some more protection than previously, but there are still significant limits.

I would recommend any dog owner to look into using their service. The only downside is that their english is not great....so I use broken german and 'sign english' to communicate with them. So far, no issues, all great experience. They keep me updated (through facebook and sms) about my dog's day and send me pictures. I love happy hundehort and I'm very greatful that they take great care of my pup.

I also want to add that we rescued all of our dogs and not as puppies. There are many advantages in adopting a young dog, particularly a dog you can meet here, take for a walk, and especially if the dog has already attended the courses, as some on the beagle club's website have.

			You get a few posts here about wanting a golden retrievers, the astronomical price etc.   
You could just go on holiday to Turkey and pick up one or three and have a holiday in the price!   
It appears many goldens end up on the streets. They used to be status symbols. With their sweet nature they dont fare so well there or in the woods, which is why rescue groups are stepping in.   
Animal rescue brings Golden Retrievers to U.S. which seems like a long way since we are just round the corner.

			It could be suggested that the doggie pictured in the sign is a Scottie, or Scottie cross.  Thus, if your dog is another breed, theoretically he/she has free access to the park, provided he/she doesn't drink alcohol, smoke or zoom around on a skate-board.  Scottie owners should, of course, complain to the local commune that their doggies are being discriminated against!

			Hi all,   
I just started a dog playgroup in Meilen for dog owners in the area that want to catch up once a week (or once in a while, depending on schedules) for our dogs to play together and socialise. The dates/times are totally flexible. I work from home so I can basically fit in my dog walks when it suits me, but mornings or over lunch time would definitely work the best.   
I haven't seen anything in the area so I thought I'd create my own. This is entirely volunteer-run by myself so it's free etc, but also means everyone is responsible for their own dogs.    
I'd really like to socialise my pup more with other dogs, at the moment the only time he spends with other dogs are on his daily walks and it's usually a quick sniff and that's it. It'd be great for him to have other dogs to properly play with off-the-leash, and I'd love to have a network of other dog owners to talk to and perhaps trade some dog-sitting here and there when appropriate.    
Here's the link to the Facebook group:    
I really hope some of you can join!!

			And it would be horrible if you bought a kitten and it was so ill that it would have to be put to sleep.   
This happened to a friend of mine, the kitten had caught something and after lots of francs spent to get her better, they had to euthanise her.  She was too small and weak to fight the virus or whatever she had.   
I think, then, the vet got in touch of the seller and found out all the kittens had the same virus.  Cat flu, i think.   
Wee cutie too.   
If and when i get another cat.  I would go for one that is around a year old and snipped.  They are still kittenish enough!!!  Even five year old cats do kittenny things!!!   They love cardboard boxes... and scooting across parquet floors in Migros paper bags!!

			The SKN is only the beginning; it really is more about 'What are my responsibilities as a dog owner in Switzerland and in (canton/Gemeinde), what are the basic things I need to know to start my dog on the right road?'. While the course can indeed be tailored to individuals it is based on mandatory content to ensure that all dog owners hear the same message.     
My trainer certainly tailors the class - each of the three times I have taken it there has been a different slant, the mandatory content is incorporated in different ways based on the age, character, and training levels of the dogs and on the experience of owners in the class.    
But each trainer will structure his/her class his/her own way.  This is why it is so important to find a trainer you feel comfortable with, whose methods and philosophy are a good fit with yours, whose teaching style works with your needs.  Always ask for a trial lesson before making a commitment to a course - either the SKN or more advanced courses.   
I would hope that all dog owners go well beyond the SKN. The 2 Theory and 5 Practical sessions can only scratch the surface. An owner needs to put in much, much more time building trust, building confidence, working on the partnership between owner and dog - either in a formal class setting or on one's own.   
I prefer classes (Familienhund, various sports) as in addition to learning, in addition to the fun activities, I feel this is the best opportunity for socialization for my (fruitbat) dogs.  I like the support the class members give one another, and I like the opportunity to discuss current thinking in canine behavioral science.    
One can train to the same level, work to the same depth on one's own if you have the motivation. No   training class trains your dog - rather, a good trainer works with you so that you learn how to train your dog.   
But make no mistake - the SKN is only the beginning. Training is a life long effort - for both you and your dog.   
And remember - if my dog's recall is not reliable and instant... I have work to do.   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Nov 2013	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	SKN in Basel-Stadt	fliege	Posts: 71

			One of the  that have a happy end. Kitten survived and now lives in a home with a relative of the family that performed the lifesaving CPR. Winters are especially rough for strays. Switzerland has relatively few strays, but even so, if you see a stray this winter, please help them by letting them sleep inside your home and feeding them. Another thing is that due to the cold weather some cats seek shelter under the hoods of cars and on top of car tyres, so please be careful and check your car before you drive.

			Another option is simply to have another current account and put a regular monthly amount into it to cover any care necessary.  This is what I do.  Our main account is with UBS, but we also have a PostFinance account that I put a set amount into each month.  Main aim is to pay the monthly tax as we're on C permits, but I put more than the tax amount in so it has gradually built up to cover other things like pet care (when we had our cat), downpayment on the new car, etc.  It gets you out of the problem with any age limit on insuring pets, though they seem to be better at that these days, plus unlike an insurance policy, it earns interest.

			I used to cut the handles of Migros paper shopping bags so the cats could ""body skate"" from the lounge through the hall into the kitchen!!  Every evening around six, it was waking up and eating time.  They would go a bit kittenny, and pretend that they did not weigh 6 kilos and their tummies were dragging along the ground!!!   
Doesn't work if you have carpets.   
When i was a kid we got a kitten who had been born in a wardrobe. She slept for the next 14 years on top of my mum's newly washed and ironed sheets and towels!!   
Odd little bundles of purring fur, aren't they!! They just seem to have a fascination with boxes.  And, like in the video, they stuff themselves into the oddest places!!   
I love the head popping up at the end of the vid....

			My Jimmy just moved in one night.  I even rolled down the shutter to block him out.  Nasty, i know.   
I was getting to love that silly cat that jumped a meter in the air chasing butterflies.  His owners left him all alone with a cat flap over Christmas.   
He moved into mine, and never left.  I have told this story here before - the woman thought he was a she.  And when she found out that his balls had dropped - threw her arms in the air...no more males in my flat.   
So, Savannah became jimbo and gave so much affection... and love.  He even disappeared for eight months and still came home.   
He is not with me now, but the memories of a cat that just arrived in our lives and took over still lives on.

			Glad to hear that the husband is back home after the successful surgery. You can perhaps think about getting another cat and create for him/her new lovely environment to offset the emptiness left after the loss of your other beloved cat. Then the life should come back to normal again and gain some fascinating momentum.

			Hand warmers can reach temperatures of up to 70 degrees Celsius if enclosed which could potentially kill the poor guy, one would have to use a special reptile box with special warmers. They exist. I know how to ship the guy in the cargo hold, but I don't want to put him in a cardboard box and have some guy toss him around. I had a friend put concussion packs around his dog's cage to see what kind of force the dog's cage took and all the 25Kg and one 50Kg pouch broke. These have special crystals in them that break when hit with enough force. The dog survived, but if that's the way they treat a dog, then Zack would die for sure as 1Kg could kill him.

Very quick, reliable service. Had everything shipped to the worldpaketshop.ch. We are just minutes away from there.     
As the products ordered come from different suppliers, there were 3 different boxes so there was a fee for each from the paket shop. Total fee 13 Eur.     
Hills food was in one  box. 
In Switzerland the price for 12 kg. Hills i/d (only available from a vet) -  
Pet meds price:    
Karsivan 100 mg - In Switzerland only available from a vet.  
1 box of 60 pills -  
Pet Meds price:    
Cosequin Double Strength Tablets (only available from a vet in Switzerland)   
120 pills - chf 101 
240 pills - chf 183

Coming late to the discussion, but as an FYI from the Tierdatenbank, one of the official reporting sites for lost and found animals:     
Scroll down to ' ?'    
Found pet animals can be reported here, even dead animals.

A tad off topic but as an FYI for readers, there is a legal requirement to report any stray pet animal found. And if one injurs or kills an animal in an auto accident (wild or pet) the driver is required to report the accident.

It is often said that Switzerland is a land of rule makers, not rule followers. A good number of Swiss I know truly believe that many rules here are largely symbolic, and only those with which they are in agreement apply to them.    
You also see this at official levels. How the authorities charged with implementing a law interpret it, how (or even if) they choose to enforce it may vary widely. What is strictly enforced in village A might be ignored in village B.    
This applies to most rules and regs, not just dog law.   
The federal SKN requirement is one such example. There are no penalties for non-compliance written into the law, compliance is left to the honor system.  
Hence many ignore it, without consequence.    
Some Gemeinden have started to check up on dog owners, though, as it became apparent that there is less honor left in the system than one might wish to believe.   
Talking to my neighbors, and certainly from reading EF, I often feel that I am the only fool here paying my taxes and following the rules.  And maybe I am a fool - certainly I'm much poorer for my rule-following. But after the witch hunt we experienced post Oberglatt, after all the mobbing, I've made it my mission to learn about the various rules and regs that affect my dogs' lives in order to best keep them safe, and to spread the word.  What others choose to do with that information is up to them.  What I post is, my imperfect German notwithstanding, what the law  . How (or if) it is   is likely another matter, one I'll leave it to y'all to figure out in your own areas.    
When it comes to 'dog stuff', though, it is the dog who often suffers most ffrom the owner's irresponsibility. I don't gamble with my dogs' lives and so I follow the rules.

But your landlord might think 2 dogs in an apartment is too much. Unless you live on a farm and dogs have tons of space, a small garden is not different than one that is a little bigger. They still need walks, but a fenced garden is still useful to have.

			I live in Kilchberg and have two dogs, there are plenty of spaces of green where dogs can walk off lead near and slightly further afield.  There is a space by the international middle school ( top of the hill)  There is a spot by the farm ( Stockengut) There is another field near the Schutzenverein. I often walk and interconnect these. I also walk down to the Sihl in Adliswil ( river to walk along). 
There is also a nearby forest in Ruschlikon. You can also park nearby most of these spots if you don't live close.   
If you have any more questions about life in Kilchberg, fell free to PM me.

			Now that we know which canton and breed/size we can point you to the appropriate information.    
The reason this information is necessary is that not only are there the 26 different cantonal laws, but also in some cantons requirements for some breeds/sizes supersede the federal. But this is not the case in Luzern. So...   
First you will have to follow federal law, and then cantonal.   
Importation is a federal issue; what you need to do to import your dog is covered in Carl's post - but an even more user friendly site is the BLV's interactive tool, conveniently available in English:       
One issue is that docked and cropped dogs are banned in Switzerland. Since Danes are among the breeds frequently docked or cropped, is yours? If so, there are two exceptions to the ban on importing docked or cropped dogs:   
If a long-term docked/cropped family pet moves   to Switzerland. The underlined bit is critical. Once you are registered in Switzerland you cannot then later import a docked/cropped pet. So if your dog is docked/cropped in your case, assuming you are registered but your wife is not yet, the dog must move with her, on her first entrance to Switzerland with the intention to settle.     
The second exception is for a medically necessary amputation; in order to import a docked or cropped dog in this case medical proof needs to be furnished.   
There is paperwork to be filled out to import under these exceptions. If your Dane is docked/cropped, the appropriate forms can be found on the BLV website.      
Now you have crossed the border you need to:   
Register with ANIS, the federal database of all dogs and owners within Switzerland, within 10 days of arrival. You will need a vet to do the registration, so make an appointment ASAP.   
Register with your Gemeinde. The form of registration varies from place to place, so contact Einwohnerkontrolle in the first instance. You might need to pay the annual dog tax at this time, or a bill might be sent later.   
As you will not have had a dog registered in your name in ANIS, the next question is whether or not you fall under the 'First time owner' requirements to take the federal SKN   course. For foreigners who move to Switzerland with a dog in tow, this is decided on an individual basis. You need to contact the Luzern VeterinÃ¤ramt for a ruling. They can be contacted here:     
If you are not excused from the federal SKN Theory course you will need to take it as soon as possible. I always recommend newcomers to Switzerland take the Theory course even when excused, as there is so much one needs to know here - and much of that might be quite different from what you have experienced as a dog owner back home.   
In any case you must take the federal SKN   course within 12 months of arrival. The database of certified SKN trainers can be found here, simply contact one in your area and get registered for the course.       
Do you speak German well enough to take the course? If not, post a thread here asking for English speaking trainers in your region.   
Now - those are the federal issues in a nutshell.    
The next set of regulations is at the cantonal level. For Luzern, see the summary from Tier Im Recht, here:         
A rough translation of the essentials:   
 - A dog owner must ensure that your dog  does not pose a danger to the public. A dog owner must ensure that your dog does not sully  streets, paths, sidewalks, park areas, other people's gardens, or agricultural fields. (In other words - you are required to pick up after your dog, and you should not allow him to urinate or mark in these areas.)   
- Dog owners or those who take charge of a dog for more than 3 months must register with ANIS within 10 days.   
 - Annual tax is due on dogs over 6 months of age. If a dog reaches 6 months after the 30. of June, the tax for that year will be half. Working farm dogs will pay a reduced rate. Working guard dogs protecting buildings in isolated areas also pay half rates.   
 - Dogs are generally banned in cemeteries, bathing areas, hospital grounds, children's play areas, and in 'rest areas' by school grounds, playgrounds, and sports fields.     
 - In publicly accessible areas, such as businesses and shops, in conservation areas, in parks, on public transportation, and on heavily trafficked streets dogs must be kept on lead.   
 - Dogs in estrus, dogs who have bitten, dogs who are ill with transmitable diseases must be kept on lead in open spaces and when in areas whereone might come into contact with another person.   
 - Between 1. April to  31. Juli dogs are required to be kept on lead in forests and along forested areas.    
 - Dogs may not be left unattended in forests and along forest areas, on lake front areas, along wooded banks and hedeges, as well as during the night time.   
 - Dogs left unsupervised can be seized by the police.   
 - Dogs who go after wild animals or who pose a danger to wild animals, who cannot be captured, may be shot by persons authorized to do so.    
 - Luzern does not impost a breed ban or restriction.   
 - In individual cases the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt can order measures taken, such as requiring a muzzling, requiring additional education, placing the dog/owner under further observation, requiring liability insurance to be taken out, or taking the dog away from the owner to be rehomed.   
 - Dogs who pose a danger to people or other animals may be ordered killed if other less drastic measures such as veterinary or behavioral treatment is unsuccessful, or if the owner does not follow measures ordered.    
The actual text of the law is linked at the top of the page. If you need the German translated, just let us know.     
Also be aware that you must follow cantonal regs in any canton you visit. It's a good idea to peruse the Tier Im Recht website when you plan to take your dog on an outing in another canton, just to be sure that you don't put a paw wrong.   
For instance Danes are on the restricted list  in TI. As you don't live there you shouldn't have problems, but you should be aware of TI rules when visiting.   
---   
Most of this boils down to common sense. But it is important that you understand dog law and follow it at all times.   
All the best as you and your four footed friend settle into Switzerland.       
By the way, unless your HR person is him/herself a dog owner in Luzern, don't necessarily count on getting reliable information. We have seen all too often that relocation folks who are not dog owners themselves are unaware of even federal regs, let alone cantonal and local. Sadly, in one case  a dog owner was only pointed to the federal law and told there would be no problem - and then moved into a BSL canton with a banned breed. The dog was seized.    
I cannot stress how important it is to get full and correct information. When in doubt, the ultimate source is always the BLV for federal questions (  ) and the cantonal Veterinaramt for cantonal regulations. Your Gemeinde Animalkontrolle (or Einwohnerkontrolle if your Gemeinde does not have an animal control officer) is the place to go for questions about local regs.     
ETA 2:   
The SKN course requirement applies to the owner of record, that is, the person in whose name the dog is registered in ANIS.  So think about that before you register. Most families register the dog in the name of the primary carer, and that person does the SKN courses. If you register the dog in both your names then both of you will be required to do the SKN course(s).

Having had to rely on an almost unknown EFer to help me out recently when my support network suddenly went poof within the space of a few weeks through death and relocation - and having it work out immensely well, I'm delighted to say - any resource is useful, although to be used (or not) at one's discretion and judgement.

Bull Terriers are on the restricted list as potentially dangerous dogs in both Basels. This means you have several hoops to jump through to gain the special permit necessary to be able to keep your dog in BS or BL.   
The regs are here for Basel Stadt:     
And here for Basel Land:         
And now back on topic:   
I would contact Tierschutz Beider Basel to try to book care for your dog. They offer dog care as well as serve as a shelter for homeless dogs. These folks have a good reputation - and are well aware of the issues surrounding listed dogs.         
I also know of one pet sitter working in the Basel area, but I don't know if she takes on listed dogs, or not. Will PM you with the info.       
ETA with my usual sermon-type comment    
When one has a listed dog one must be sure to follow the law at all times. (As should owners of dogs of any breed - but the reality is that owners of listed breeds tend to have a target painted on their backs and so need to be doubly careful...) So please make sure that anyone in Switzerland caring for your dog fulfills the legal requirements for a dog sitter.

			I find ZÃ¼rich very dog friendly, but because it is a crowded city, your canine companion should be used to all that daily nuisances: crowds, noises, public transport, cars / bikes, children, etc. In all such situations I always keep my dog on leash and close; both for her safety and the comfort of the other people. I've seen people who have changed seats because they were afraid of dogs, but nobody has ever asked me to leave.   
Some parks have signs to keep your dogs on lead: if the area is empty (this happens during bad weather or in the evenings) I sometimes let mine run free, otherwise she is on the leash -- especially if there are children playing nearby. 
Some areas have no leash laws, I use common sense there (e.g. I don't let my dog run free in the forest, in case she wants to hunt something).   
The cantonal law prohibits dogs to enter school grounds, cementeries, playgrounds and churches (did I forget something?).   
I am lucky to live in an old building with thick walls. I don't hear my neighbors, they don't complain if I play chase and run with my dog around the table  .

			Pardon the pedantry, but...      In   case only the practical was mandatory.   
As has been said many, many times, in many, many threads on this forum:   
If you have had dogs before moving to Switzerland  - and thus are not registered in the ANIS database, the usual proof of prior ownership - it is up to the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt to decide whether you are required to do the Theory course or not.    
We have seen over and over again that similar cases in the same canton end up with different rulings. The decision is not cantonal, not communal -   Each owner must contact the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt him/her self.   
I appreciate that you are trying to be helpful, but please be careful of generalizing your individual experience into a broader rule.    
Hope you and your pup enjoy your stay in Switzerland.

If you are caring for multiple clients' dogs at the same time, that is a different type of sitting, reflecting different pricing.    
Some dogs cannot live with unknown dogs, hence the need for sitters who limit the dogs they care for to one family group at a time.    
CHF 100 for care in the client's home and CHF 200 for in-home care is common in the greater ZH area.    
It's good that you brought this up, though, as whether or not the sitter is caring for your dog exclusively is a question that dog owners should make sure ask while researching care options.     
ETA:   
Prices are all over the ballpark, those quoted are what is commonly charged, you will find variations everywhere. In addition to the number of dogs cared for at one time, other factors that affect pricing include the individual needs of the dog, what the sitter can offer in the daily routine, how much time the sitter spends with the client's dog vs other commitments, the client's expectations. And, of course, whether the sitter is working legally and is compliant with education requirements. You will find, though, that some of the people working illegally charge very high prices...

			I have one in our garden that works only up to 10 meters. So I have measured it out that the cats can still walk at the end of our garden (where for some unknown reason they donÂ´t want to crap) but avoid the rest. It stops and doesnÂ´t work at concrete fences (at the sides of our garden) so it doesnÂ´t go any further than that. 
The sound cannot be heard by humans, at least if you keep it at the ""cat"" position. There is a different one for wild boars etc (yes, it is in Berlin and they have loads of them) but that can be heard by humans as well.   
I realize that not everyone advocates this and people may find it wrong, but I am at the end of my wit in trying to get the beasties to do their business anywhere else (all the ""regular"" ways didnÂ´t work).   
I love cats but not having them crap in my garden...... And as the neighbours donÂ´t think this a problem.....

			Hello everyone-   
We recently brought in out 6-year old boxer from the States who has been in the loving care of my sister while we have established our place here in Switzerland.  Unfortunately, as a city dog, she had more limited exposure to other dogs and now gets quite anxious and excited when she sees other dogs (leash pulling, whimpering that turns into excited barking).  She's not at all aggressive, but as a boxer she does tend to play rough which pisses other dogs off so generally we try to limit her being able to go up and sniff other dogs.  Given her age, I think we could use the help of a professional to curb this behavior.  Does anyone have any suggestions for an English speaking dog trainer in the Luzern area?   
Thanks so much.

			Since there hasn't been a post about about relocating a dog recently, I thought I'd share my experience from February 2015. It was actually much easier than I expected; I was definitely over prepared. Best part = No quarantine! For paperwork, all you need is a Euro Microchip, new rabies shot, APHIS form, and EU health certificate.    
DETAILS 
Dog: 6.5 year old female boxer dog with docked tail (rescued when she was 1yr) 
Weight: 50 pounds 
Airline: American Airlines 
Kennel: n/a (Rode as Emotional Support Animal in cabin) 
Time: Arrived at the airport 3-4 hours before scheduled flight 
Departure info: February 25th 
Price: None 
Route: Dallas DFW --> New York JFK (had a dog potty area) --> Zurich ZRH    
RABIES & MICROCHIP INFO   
- We opted to insert a Euro Microchip instead of buying a reading device, so our dog had to get a new rabies shot. You can do the rabies shot right after implantation of the microchip the same day if you want; the rabies shot just has to be after the implantation.  
- Additional Notes: 
(1) The microchip our vet used was petlink.net (it met the ISO Standards 11784/11785) and the cost was $50USD 
(2) We had the vet hand sign a couple vaccination records in blue ink, since they normally tended to use stamps for signatures.  
(3) The vet charged $15USD for the rabies shot.  
(4) She got her microchip and rabies shot on Jan 12, and our flight was Feb 25th.   
EU CERTIFICATE INFO   
- The most important note about the EU Certificate is that it must be issued within 10 days of travel (including the time to be mailed to and returned from the USDA office to be officially stamped) and it must be completed by a USDA Accredited Veterinarian. 
- Additional Notes: 
(1) The vet charged $60USD for the visit and completing the form. 
(2) As a precautionary measure, we had this vet fill out an APHIS Form 7001 for traveling on the plane. 
(3) All forms completed in blue ink.  
(4) We mailed the completed EU Health Certificate and APHIS FORM 7001 by the accredited USDA vet and a signed rabies vaccination certificate from our normal vet to the export department at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (for us in Austin). There is was officially stamped and mailed back in a pre-paid envelope we had originally sent. It cost $38USD plus shipping to and back. You will have to use 1-3days shipping via Fedex/UPS to ensure you get everything done within the 10 days of travel. 
(5) Here is the link for the new EU health certificate.     
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL INFO 
If this qualifies, prior to 48 hours before travel, you have to call American Airlines and submit an ESA Authorization Form (completed by a Mental Health Professional). My dog sat and slept right by my legs and partially under the seat in front of me.    
DOCKED TAIL INFO 
A dog with a docked tail is allowed (as relocation goods) if the following conditions are met: 
1) It must be imported by the owner itself 
2) It has been owned for at least six months before moving to Switzerland 
3) The dog has a Microchip (ISO Standard 11784, which only contains digits as identification code), valid rabies vaccination, and a Veterinary certificate 
- We were questioned about the docked tail at the airport customs, but since we had all our paperwork for moving (i.e. work contract) it was no issue to assume she was personal goods. If I were to do it again, I would have had my vet write a letter noting the reason why my dog had a docked tail just to be extra safe.     
AIRPORT & CUSTOMS 
- We had an experience similar to DantesDame. After we landed  we went through customs, declared our dog and other goods (we didn't know if we had to or not, but felt it was prudent to do so). The guy at the counter checked our paperwork and then had us fill out a Declaration/Application for clearance of household effects. At the end, he made copies and date stamped each page with an official airport stamp - this included the Declaration/Application for clearance of household effects, the vet vaccination certificate, the APHIS Form 7001, the EU Health Certificate, and a copy of my passport. No money changed hands.  
- We also carried copies of the work contract and lodging, if possible, to prove we were moving here.    
__________________________________________________  _____________   
UPON ARRIVAL IN ZURICH 
1) You are required to register the animal in your Swiss place of residence. 
- When my husband and I registered at the Kreisburo, they said we needed to register our dog with the Hundekontrolle der Stadt Zurich. This involved printing a form  , filling it out, and mailing it in. The form asks for general information about you and your dog, and I went ahead and included a copy of her ANIS registration (see next step) 
- A few weeks after mailing the form, I received a bill from the Stadt Zurich, essentially the registration and taxes for having a dog. In total the cost was 180.00CHF   
2) A Swiss veterinarian must additionally register the dog in the Swiss dog database (ANIS).  
-We went to a local vet (found through google search) and it took <15 minutes for the front desk assistant to fill out the form. They mailed it in, so it was really easy. This cost 45CHF and was completed March 5 (7 days after arrival). 
- We also got a Swiss Pet Passport for 25CHF.   
- The vet we used was Dr. med. vet. Kleintierpraxis - Norbert Frei. One of the receptionists spoke English, Spanish, and German   Freiestrasse 148a, 8032 ZÃ¼rich Kreis 7 Hirslanden. Tel 044 422 4073    
3) SKN Course 
Luckily, my dog and I are exempt. I believe it is because I had her before this law came into effect. I called both Hundekontrolle +41 44 411 61 92 and the vet office +41 43 259 41 41 to confirm. But here are a couple of options for English-speaking SKN courses that I had investigated before I knew I was exempt.

			Thank you, Mellon Collie.  I really didn't know that much. I know about the list, and there are different courses required for the type of the dog.    
We want to adopt a small doggie. But of course, you never know what you'll experience at the shelter.    
I want to educate my dog as much as possible. So attending at least one year is probably a good idea.   
I understand SG unfortunately very less, HG is good, though not as good as English.    
I guess asking the trainer when i'm lost is what is required.   
Thank you again very very much!   
I will look for courses around then.

			Thinking of this thread again, after I had yet another frustrating conversation out on our walk today where someone was adamant that small or young dogs cannot be found in rescue.    
(This lady stopped to compliment me on my collie and sheltie - and was shocked to hear that both were rescues.)   
So for the OP (and anyone else, of course), as you have indicated you are considering a small young 'fluffy' mixed-breed dog, perhaps take a gander at:    
Mixes from the breeds you mention: 
Snejka, ID 41839 a 2-3 year old female Maltese mix 
Lisa, 42057, a 6-12 month old Havaneser-Pudel mix female   
Or  a couple of small pure breeds: 
Struppi, 42056, a 2-3 year old Coton de Tulear 
Chico, 42010, a 6-12 month male Pappillon   
And the following 'small white fluffy'  mix unknown, puppies from the same litter, all under 6 months old: 
Jowi, ID 42071, male  
Job, 41988 male  
Joy, 41987, female  
Jozua 41986 male   
Two not-white but fluffy puppies from the same litter: 
Bree, 42058, a 4 month old female 
Benjamin 42059, 4 month old male -    
And Natasha, 41946, female white fluffy mix, 1-2 years old   
Among the small dogs there are also a couple of young french bulldogs, chi and JR types. And several older dogs, just as much fun as puppies but a heck of a lot less work.   
---   
So many gorgeous dogs of all sizes, ages, breeds and mixes can be found on the Tierdatenbank. Always worth a look - your 'future best friend' just might be there waiting for you.

			Go to your Vet and ask for all the docs . there is quite a few. You need to have your animal checked by the vet no more than 10  days before departure. You also need to check with your airline that they accept pets on that flight. Kennel etc needs to be right dimensions etc etc    
Thats about it. We did it with our dog (in cabin) to the USA. On the way way back the papers needed to be checked by the USDA.    
Noone has EVER checked any docs (broght back 2 dogs from the USA and 1x to the USA , but better safe than sorry I guess

			When we were living in Germany there was a tramp who used to sit outside the supermarket where we shopped and ask people for small change. If we had time we sometimes stopped to chat to him or buy him a coffee or something to eat.   
He always had a dog with him. The dog was well behaved and well looked after.   
One day the dog wasn't there so we asked him and he told us, with tears in his eyes, that the dog had been run over and was now in the hospital.   
The next week we saw him again and the dog was back, but completely stitched up and bandaged. We told him we were happy to see his dog was back. He broke out in tears again and said yes, the dog was all he had in his life. He told us the vet had stitched everything up and taken good care of the dog in a long and difficult operation. When at the end of it he had come to pick up the dog he had asked how much it would cost, saying he was a poor tramp without much money. The vet had said,for you it's 5 DM.    
So there are still vets out there with their heart in the right place.

			Big Mara- I only buy sunflower seeds, as most seed mixes have far too much corn and maize. Very few blackbirds here, but for them and fieldfares, I scatter seed on the grass and they love it. All sorts of tits and finches here, nuthatches, sparrows, depending on season.   
As said, I boycott any product with palm oil, can't see the point on feeding birds with products that cause massive deforestation and kills organg-utangs and other wildlife    As said, would love to hear about fat mixes and fatballs which do NOT contain palm oil- sadly most do.

However the mutts and I have been working with an outstanding trainer for 9 years now. She does her courses in the usual mix of Swiss and High German that one finds everywhere in Switzerland when the group is a mix of Swiss and Auslanders. That is, she starts in High German for my benefit, but the conversation often goes back and forth between HG and SG.     
As posters have commented on other threads, there are some trainers who are willing to do the course in English - but you will have many more choices if you can work in German. HG or SG.    
If you are concerned about language, some trainers list the languagages they speak on their websites, but as others don't simply write all the trainers convenient to you and ask what language the trainer is willing to work in. Here is the list of certified SKN trainers:         
Just another coment though:   
What sort of dog do you have?   
RÃ¼mlang is canton ZÃ¼rich - where a different set of classes are mandatory for List 1 dogs, any breed or mix whose adult weight and size are expected to be over 15kg or 45cm. If you fall into this category you will need the SKN theory course before acquiring a dog, but then must do the more extensive ZÃ¼rich courses, WelpenfÃ¶rderung, Junghund, Erwachsene. The federal SKN requirements are rolled into the ZÃ¼rich List 1 courses.   
Hope you find a trainer you will enjoy working with...

If you want to commit to your cats, get them chipped just like dogs.

I don't understand why people don't get their cats chipped?     . He mentions that, in November, vet fees are often reduced for the chipping procedure.

			How horrid..  We've had a neighbor putting out poisonous foods around where I live and my cat is an outdoors cat, so I was living in fear of him never coming home basically. Eventually that neighbor was warned and he stopped (as far as I know). Wished there were harsher consequences for animal abusers and killers, but even when you establish causation and actus reus they seem to get away with it too easily.  
Glad that there are also lots of amazing people out there who donate their time toward animals in need.

			Bringing this back up, with a resource I just learned about :   
TierischAnders here in Switzerland rents wheeled carts as well as sells them. Renting a cart might be a good temporary solution for those whose dogs are recovering from surgery, or for those who are considering trying out wheels but first want to see if their dog will accept them before investing in getting a set made:         
I heard about this from the info stand at the Verein fÃ¼r behinderte Hunde open day yesterday.  These good folks had lots of info on resources available in Switzerland and Germany. I am so pleased to have found this group; the work they do advocating for our very special friends is admirable.

			Hello, everyone   
I'm not near Aigle, but am living in Vaud, in a small village about 15 km northwest of Lausanne.  I figured I could just ask here instead of starting a new thread.   
We just moved here about 10 days ago, and the house we've moved into has a pond in the back yard that our German Shepherd cannot resist jumping into every couple of days.  It's relatively filthy, which of course makes him love it even more, but also makes him pretty filthy himself.  We can bathe him ourselves, but sometimes it's nice to have someone else do it.   
Is anyone aware of any groomers (or do-it-yourself places, if they exist in Switzerland) in the area between Lausanne and Vevey?  Thanks for any help.

			I thought I would post this again for our newer members:      From time to time, people tell me, ""lighten up, it's just a dog,"" or  ""that's a lot of money for just a dog."" They don't understand the  distance traveled, the time spent, or the costs involved for ""just a  dog."" 
 Some of my proudest moments have come about with ""just a dog."" Many  hours have passed and my only company was ""just a dog,"" but I did not  once feel slighted. 
 Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by ""just a dog,""  and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch of ""just a dog"" gave me  comfort and reason to overcome the day. 
 If you, too, think it's ""just a dog,"" then you will probably  understand phrases like ""just a friend,"" ""just a sunrise,"" or ""just a  promise."" 
 ""Just a dog"" brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure and unbridled joy. 
 ""Just a dog"" brings out the compassion and patience that makes me a better person. 
 Because of ""just a dog,"" I will rise early, take long walks and look  longingly to the future. So for me and folks like me, it's not ""just a  dog"" but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the  fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment. 
 I hope that someday they can understand that it's not ""just a dog,""  but the thing that gives me humanity and keeps me from being ""just a  woman."" So the next time you hear the phrase ""just a dog,"" just  smile--because they ""just don't understand.""

I am aware of some pet sitting websites, but I thought I'd ask to see if anyone had a personal recommendation. Also, I will be away for a little over 2 weeks so someone who can do that long would be a big plus.

			Unless you have the necessary contacts already, the goto address should be either the local Tierschutzverein or the local animal-type specific association like Kynologischer Verein in case of dogs.    
The Tierschutzverein most always have abandoned animals looking for a place, and if you're looking for a breeder they now from experience who's reputable and who isn't.   
If you can't find a Tierschutzverein ask an animal doctor near you for directions.

Few students are in a position to take on a dog during their studies. A dog is a 24/7/365 commitment - for the next 15+ years, no matter what happens in your life, no matter what your financial situation is, no matter what your future family situation entails, no matter where you end up, you must be able to provide for your dog, your dog's welfare must be a priority.    
If you are a foreign student only here for the duration of your studies you should not get a dog at this time. Please wait until you are have finished your studies and are in a stable living situation - career, housing, family etc. - before you take on this demanding and expensive responsibility.   
If you are missing canine companionship, please consider instead volunteering with an animal shelter, perhaps offering to walk shelter dogs.

Thank you so much for the tips and support. You're extremely helpful and I really appreciate it! Yesterday was a very intensive day for me and the puppy. I studied all the resources you provided and tried out some of the tips.  
This morning I am much more optimistic regarding the situation. After the intensive training of yesterday the puppy slept almost all night long! Although he didn't sleep in the crate yet, he did not wake me up (the cat did   ). When I walked out of my bedroom, he was sitting quietly near the crate.

			Hi Elena,   
I'm afraid I can't give you a personal recommendation for a kennel in ZÃ¼rich, as I do not use kennels for my dogs. I use a sitter who moves into my home when I need to be away. And unfortunatly I can't pass on her details, as she is all but retired, she is not taking on new clients.   
Hopefully someone who has used kennels will pop in with a recommendation.    
---   
But in the meantime, Longbyt has touched on an important point: cantonal dog law, and how you will be affected.   
Be aware that dog control functions at three levels in Switzerland: federal, cantonal, and community.   
At the federal level, animal welfare issues are addressed. These include the federal SKN classes. Control is largely addressed at the cantonal and community level, these include breed bans, leash laws, picking up, fines for infractions - and in some cases additional training beyond the federal requirements.   
ZÃ¼rich is an example of the latter. In canton ZH, due to his size (over 15kg or 45cm) a ridgeback is a List 1 dog. This means that you are required to do additional training courses. This applies to all dogs born after 31 Dec 2010; people moving to ZÃ¼rich after that date with a dog born before that date need to contact the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt for a decision on your individual case.    
The courses are required are puppy training, adolescent trianing, adult training. Which courses, how many hours, etc. that will be required in your case will depend on the age of your dog.   
If you are excused from the cantonal training requirement due to your dog's age, then you will simply need to follow the federal training requirements, the SKN courses.   
There are two of these classes, the SKN Theory and SKN Practical.    
The Theory class is required of all first time dog owners, to be done before one acquires a dog. The definition of first time owner is clear for all Swiss residents: having had a dog registered the ANIS database, in your own name.    
It is less clear for people moving to Switzerland with a dog in tow. Obviously you already have a dog, so are not a first time owner - but you are a first time owner in Switzerland. In this case you need to contact the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt for a ruling on whether you are excused from the federal SKN Theory course, or not. Some people have been, some are required to take it. The decision is made on each individual case.   
All owners of any dog acquired after 1 Sept 2008 are required to do the SKN Practical course. You have a year to get this done.    
If you are required to do the canton ZH List 1 courses, these will take the place of the federal SKN Practical course.   
And now for my usual sermon.    
Even if excused from the courses - SKN or List 1 - please take them. There is information you need to be a responsible dog owner in Switzerland that you would have a hard time finding elsewhere - and not knowing what is expected of you is how you put a foot (paw) wrong here. You don't want your dog to suffer because of your lack of information. The classes are fun, not expensive. Iin fact the SKN classes are quite cheap, but even the ZH classes don't cost all that much in the relative scheme of things.    
More importantly, classes are an opportunity for a 'soft landing' for you. You will likely meet kindred spirits in class, some of whom may become friends. You will have a chance to practice your German, to learn about your community. A good Hundescule is a very valuable resource for a dog owner. Even for those with decades of experience.   
I'll make a special plea for your dog and the List 1 classes:   
The List 1 requirements (and the banning of 8 breeds) came into effect via a public referendum. The good voters of ZÃ¼rich are wary of large dogs - and the sad fact of breed prejudice is that your ridgeback will prompt more wariness among some members of the public than, say, a golden retriever - although they are both List 1 dogs. Taking the classes will better equipe you to handle local attitudes towards our larger canine friends.    
Do you read German? If so, here is a summary of the ZH cantonal law, from the excellent folks at Tier Im Recht      
The text of the actual law is linked at the top. Note that each canton has different dog laws - if you visit another canton you will be expected to know and follow their laws. The Tier Im Recht website is your best friend here - all cantons are summarized.   
(Note that the Thai Ridgeback is banned in GE - not the 'regular' Ridgeback.)   
The final say in all matters governing dogs in canton ZH is the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt. The website, including contact details, is here:     
ZH dog law is detailed here - if you have questions please go to the source, do not rely on unofficial information. Including my post here.    
---   
Another thing you should know while searching for dog care:   
Unlike in most of our home countries, commercial - that is, paid - dog care is regulated in Switzerland. Anyone caring for a dog in return for money must have at a minimum the same training courses as an owner would - that is the federal SKN courses or the cantonal equivalent.  It only makes sense that anyone paid to care for a dog be held to the same standard as an owner is.    
The SKN courses allow a carer to care for up to 5 dogs. Caring for more than 5 dogs requires either the FBA or the Tierpfleger diploma, these are more professional courses.   
The onus is on you, the dog owner, to ensure that the person you hire to care for your dog is compliant with the law - and the liability falls to you if you hire someone who is not.   
Please be aware that there are many folks offering dog care who are not compliant - including most of the people looking for a side job here on EF. No one should flaunt the law, obviously, but given that your dog is a List 1 dog, I would in even stronger terms caution you against employing anyone who is not compliant - for your dog's sake.   
You can read more about what is required of a dog sitter in this thread:

All the best to you and your pooch as you settle in.

			Hi Karin, 
Matter of fact cat flies out tomorrow     My husband is doing a direct flight with him LAX to ZH then driving to Geneva, fingers crossed.  I am going with kids on Sunday.     
I got the Sky Kennel Ultra to give him room.  Yes, you have to send paperwork to Sacramento, I did so on day 10 before the flight.  It took longer to fill out paperwork and get it right than I anticipated.  You Fedex it to Sacremento (email me if you can't find the number/address) and make sure to include a cover letter telling them exactly what you need and by when.  Include a return postage paid FEDEX envelope.  The fee is $38.  I got the vet to do the EU certificate as well as the USDA form to cover the bases.     
Make sure to make sure that your VET's license is valid with the USDA before hand. I sent in the paperwork only to find out our vet's license was expired.  We got it done in time, but more stress.  I bought puppy pee pads yes, plan freeze water in his food bowl, keep it on ice on way to airport and that way it hopefully doesn't spill while he is being moved and then melts during the flight.  have also had him sleeping in it for about a week to get used to it.    
More to say but how about I let you know in a couple of days when all is said and done?  my direct email is [removed, please use PM]   
As for the movers, ugh, paperwork galore and it seems I never have enough or the right paper or the right address in the right space, you definitely have to be on it.  BUT, our stuff is due to arrive in Rotterdam Tuesday, we;ll see.   Our shipper told us to ship in May if possible because starting June there are delays due to the volume of people moving after school is out. So we did that and in theory our stuff has come quickly if it in fact arrives, but there is always customs to deal with.  That said, I had to urgently fedex our papers to Rotterdam and we are still missing one piece from swiss authorities that will hopefully come through tomorrow. I'll let you know how that goes as well, with any luck should be at our house before you leave and I can give you the lowdown and any tips to share.  If I forget to get back in touch with you, please re-contact me, happy to share/help.     
Sorry this is a bit of a ramble but as I type my mother in law is cleaning my kitchen and I am feeling rushed and guilty!  I hope things go as smooth as they can for you and your family. Keep in touch!

			Hello,   
I would love to walk/look after you retriever!   
I am very comfortable with dogs and have had lots of labradors when growing up and also enjoy the exercise of a good walk.   
I live in Pully so it would be easy to come to Lutry.   
Please let me know if you are still looking for someone.

Please, do not contact any other organization until the question of ownership - and thus the legal right to pass ownership on to another party - is clarified.      
(FYI, I just looked at my entry in ANIS.  For my dogs whose legal owner remains the rescue I am listed as Halter/Deteneur. For those who legally belong to me I am listed as Besitzer/ PropriÃ©taire. Have you looked at your online account, Terramundi?)

			I have been soaking a thin towel in cold water and wrapping it around the dog's neck or placing it directly on their back. It really helps in this heat. I have the blinds closed, and the curtains closed. Thick curtains absorb the heat well.     
I have also put the fans which were on tables on the floor.      
The pavement is too hot to walk down to the river so we might get a small kiddie pool and let the dogs cool off in it.     
Weekend is going to get even hotter.      
Our dogs are from Japan so they know all about heat but we have been back home for years and the dogs are much older now which is making tolerating the heat even harder for them.

			Glasgow1, I can heartily recommend the Kennels in Nyon.  I have been a member there for many years.  The animals are very well taken care of.  During the recent Paleo concert, which takes place literally next to the kennels, the staff are present 24/7 to ensure as best they can that their ""guests"" feel secure amongst all the noise.

			First thing: are you asking about medical insurance, household insurance (against damage caused by your cats to your flat)?   
I'll assume the first.   
Yes, there are insurance companies offering animal medical insurance -Animalia and Eponia are two that spring to mind.   
HOWEVER:   
Unlike in the UK, pet medical insurance still isn't so widely used here. One reason is that some plans have rather restrictive qualifications and limits. So if you go this route you will first need to assess the plan   to determine whether or not this policy makes financial sense  , or not.   
Then determine if your preferred veterinarian accepts insurance, or not. Many don't, meaning if you have a policy you will pay out of pocket and then claim from the insurer.     
---   
I took a look at insurance years ago and quickly decided that what was on offer then made no sense at all for us, given that I adopt senior dogs or dogs with medical issues. Only one of my dogs then would even qualify - and when I ran the numbers for her usual expenses found that it didn't really make financial sense.   
But YMMV, your situation and that of your pets might be entirely different from mine. And who knows what plans offer today. So run the numbers for yourself.   
---   
One of the pleasant surprises here is that broadly speaking routine veterinary care in Switzerland tends to be less expensive that in the US and UK. Specialist treatment will be expensive, but again - comparing notes with friends in the US and UK -  still not as expensive.   
(A recent example - Radiation for osteosarcoma here ran under CHF 2500. My friend in the UK, same treatment: GBP 6000.)     
So IME paying out of pocket really doesn't hurt.  Much.      
Anyway, I chose not to insure any of my dogs, and although over the years have spent a lot on their care still feel that for us this is the correct financial decision. But to stress again: YMMV.   
---   
But a word of caution to all pet owners: With or without insurance one should always have several thousands tucked away against an emergency.    
There is nothing so heartbreaking as seeing an animal who could be successfully treated euthanized because the owner can't/won't pay for treatment.

			Dogs and stairs....not a good combination in my experience unless the stairs are carpeted.     
Wood is slippery and on stairs it will scratch. A recessed rubber strip at the edge of the stairs helps make them less slippery for humans and possibly for dogs.     
I have a stair carpets for sale if you need them. They are very useful in a rental property. You must select the right tape so as not to mark the surface you will affix them too.      
Just send me a PM.

			We call our acupuncture appointments 'The Belltie's Spa Day'.    
I, too, worried that he would not tolerate acupuncture - stoicism is not the Belltie's strong suit, not by a long shot.    
But I was surprised - he not only tolerates it, but clearly enjoys the sessions. A few times he has been so relaxed he has fallen asleep.   
I'm generally skeptical about alternative treatments - and was about this, too. Maybe it's the acupuncture, maybe the Belltie simply benefits from the extra care and attention. As my general practice vet said when he suggested it, there is little scientific literature to support it's use - but at this stage, given that the Belltie's options are limited, why not try? It can't hurt, and he has seen cases where it seems to have helped.    
That comment was 2 years ago, and the Belltie is still here, still happily bumbling about.    
But one thing is clear - his 'spa days' do add to his quality of life.   
There are many factors contributing to the Belltie's longevity in spite of the odds. We assess all the things that make sense to try, and we keep trying so long as his quality of life remains good.   
We see Dr Annina Laim at the Ennetseeklinik in HÃ¼nenberg ZG for the acupuncture sessions, she keeps in contact with my regular vet..      "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Nov 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Best product for dog Arthritis	Florida_girl	Posts: 44

			... or as a mother. Anyone can become a mother ... much harder to become a dog owner   
There has been several documentaries recently on both French and Swiss TV- saying that the animal refuges are absolutely full to the brim, and more- and they just do not know what to do. So many dog and cat owners do not have their animals sterilised- 1000s come into refuges weekly, and very very few find a good forever home. Tragic.

			You might want to get in touch with the Hovawart Club Schweiz to ask for a recommendation for a ZH List 1 trainer.       
I see that there is a Hovawart breeder in ZH; that might be a good contact. Since his/her puppies sold to ZH owners will need to do the List 1 courses hopefully he/she knows which ZH trainers have experience with the breed.     
All the best!

Ta, Island Monkey - I know it's not so ideal finding rental accommodation with a pet involved, but we've been keeping an eye on all the main websites, and there are currently quite a few pet-friendly possibilities that have been on for a while, so fingers crossed we'll get something sorted fairly soon if we do take her with us in August.

345	06.10.2013, 17:36	Member	Thanked 571 Times in 142 Posts	Location: Reinach (BL)	"   Schotty Â The Real Story:   PART IVa     As Hidalgo paced up and down his kennel, newly manicured paws clicking on the hard floor, he reflected on the strange week heÂd had...     On Monday, one of the  screws from the feline wing dropped off a small box at the infirmary.  Curious as to who might have sent him something, and what that something  could be, Hidalgo carefully opened the parcel. To his immense surprise, there was a bloody mouseÂs tail and a note, which read: Tanquam ex ungue leonem! Acta est fibula; plaudite.* B.  ÂWhat the hell is that all aboutÂ, thought Hidalgo, certain only that the note came from the top cat in the Feline enclosure: Blofeld.     That Tuesday, was another strange day by HidalgoÂs  reckoning. As he was having breakfast he overheard two warders, Fat  Harry and Scottish Jock, talking as they had a crafty fag under his  window.   ÂYou know that nasty bastard, Albert?Â asked Fat Harry, Âwell he was killed, yesterdayÂ    ÂNo? Really? What happened?Â replied Scottish Jock.   ? Scottish Jock grunted assent.    ÂWell, the cheap rope he was using to lift the car engine he was fixing, well it snapped. And splat, one ex-AlbertÂ Fat Harry laughed.   ÂLooks like an accidentÂ, continued the warder Âthe plod said that the rope had been gnawed badly by mice, so it wasnÂt strong enough to hold the engineÂs weightÂ,    ÂHold on a minuteÂ, ventured Scottish Jock, ÂdidnÂt he get a cat from the cat enclosure here for that mouse infestation in his garageÂ?   ÂYeah, he took Ms Polly, champion mouser she wasÂ. Fat Harry took one last drag on his ciggie and stubbed it out, Âfunny thing though, the plod couldnÂt find her. Just a few tailless miceÂ.   ÂI donÂt blame her for bu99ering offÂ Scottish Jock ground out his fag-end, ÂYou know how he was, the evil sod. IÂd have done the same. Still it couldnÂt have happened to a nicer blokeÂ.   As Fat Harry and Scottish Jock walked off, Hidalgo  wuffed to himself in amazement as the meaning of his strange present  became clear. Blofeld had certainly repaid his debt. What was it Blofeld  once said? Ârevenge is a dish best served coldÂ. Hidalgo shuddered and thanked Anubis he was in BlofeldÂs good books.     Wednesday, Hidalgo reflected, gave him one hell of a big surprise. As Hidalgo was relaxing in his basket, Lucky the LabÂs messenger boy turned up. A large Afghan Hound everyone called ÂPlankÂ.   Hidalgo looked at the Afghan Hound, flanked by two Argentine Dogos. ÂHired muscleÂ, he thought contemptuously and dismissed them from consideration. He turned his attention to the long haired dog.   ÂWhat do you want, Plank?Â Hidalgo asked, warily.   ÂMÂnameÂs TaÂi SpayÂ, the hound placidly replied without rancour, ÂIÂve got a message for you from LuckyÂ.   Hidalgo eyed the Afghan dog, Plank might well be as thick as the proverbial, but he was a reliable messenger.    ÂGo onÂ he wuffed.   The Afghan furrowed his brow, concentrating: ÂLucky would like to say that the business with the saveloys was a de-plor-able mis-app-pre-hension and he...Â The Afghan Hound paused, Âand heÂs giving you this small gift of a kilo of prime sausages to show his boners fidoÂ   Hidalgo smiled inwardly, ÂI think you mean Bona FidesÂ   ÂYeah, I meant Bona FideÂ Plank continued, looking puzzled, ÂWhatÂs a Bona Fide?Â   Hidalgo couldnÂt resist: ÂLike a regular bone, but meatierÂ   ÂOh!Â Plank gave a baffled shrug.     As Plank and the two goons ambled away, Hidalgo whistled inwardly, Lucky cut no-one, but no-one, any slack and for him to back off, well this iL Dottore bloke must be a really  serious player. A sudden wave of panic enveloped him, what if he didnÂt  make the grade? What if he failed the audition? Whining softly to  himself, Hidalgo turned around and around in his basket, trying to get comfortable.     (*We know the lion by his claw! The play has been performed; applaud!)

All newly registered dog owners are required to do the courses. Like Meloncollie said- you learn a lot. For example, the poisonous plants and animals you dog might come into contact with, which might differ from your own country.    
My own dog weighs 5kg and I have witnessed people who are terrified of him. More so than in any other country I have been in. As a dog owner here you need to be very much on the ball, else you can find yourself in a heap of trouble.    
There are many on here who work hard to ensure new pet owners get the best information- to help assimilation to Swiss life. It is not helping when you spread inaccurate information.

			Good for you for wanting to help out. Working with homeless dogs is very rewarding work.   
Just a word about therapy dogs, though:   
An official therapy dog is highly trained - and before that training can begin the dog has been put through an extensive selection program to determine if he/she has the right character for this work. It's a very rigorous program, one only a select few dogs qualify for.   
Not all dogs are fit to take on the role of a therapy dog. In fact, it's likely few of those in shelters will be - honestly one cannot expect a shelter dog to take on that role.  Rather the reverse is usually the case - we need to provide therapy for these poor, sometimes damaged, critters.   
Please keep this in mind - the goal of volunteering with homeless dogs is to help the dogs, full stop. It's all about their needs, nor ours. The benefit we derive from doing good work, from knowing that we have made a difference,  is an 'extra'.    
When volunteering be very clear about your level of expertise. It is important, for both you, for the safety of others around you, and critically for the dog, that you are matched with a dog whose behavior is within the scope of your expertise. Please don't take this wrong - I honestly do applaud you for wanting to do this - but I must stress that taking charge of a dog whose behavior is beyond your experience would be unfair to the dog, and to all.    
Most  shelter staff try to match the walkers and dogs - but don't be afraid to stress your experience level and speak up if you feel you cannot handle any dog you are paired with.    
Many of the dogs in shelters ended up there because their owners couldn't provide (or couldn't be a*sed to provide) basic training. A good dog walking program is an extension of a training or rehab program, as you walk the dog you are continually reinforcing the work the shelter's trainers have started.      
That said, yes dogs land in shelters who do not have 'ishoos' and who would be a good fit for you. But again,  it's important to set realistic expectations with even these 'easy' dogs.     
---   
I would counsel separating your interest in dog therapy programs from your interest in helping shelter dogs.    
There is some cross-over, as I truly do believe - and experience on a daily basis - the theraputic value of living with dogs. My  dogs are the center of my world, and they are the anchor that keeps me centered.    
But I cannot expect my dogs - all adoptees who came with either physical problems or emotional baggage - to provide 'real' therapy to me, as a trained therapy dog would. No, it's my job to do that for them. But in helping them to live happier more fulfilling lives I gain so very, very much. Let's just stay it's a mutually beneficial relationship.   
---   
As for the SKN:   
The BLV's FAQ still says that one is not required to have the SKN to walk shelter dogs, as it is volunteer work. I have noticed, though, while looking for something else, that a couple of shelters in ZH are now requiring the courses, citing the BLV. I've looked for a policy change and couldn't find any reference. Curious. But until something official appears on the BLV site, I'd go with the status quo - volunteer dog care does not require the SKN as far as compliance with federal law goes. Each shelter is of course free to set it's own policies.     
HOWEVER - it's always good to do the courses, for one's own knowledge. Even more so when working with shelter dogs who might not have had the easiest time of it and so need our understanding.   
Several shelters offer the SKN course free to their volunteer dog walkers. This would be a win-win for you, and for the dogs.    
---   
Wishing you all the very best. Nothing so uplifting as the company of a dog. And knowing that you are helping that dog begin a new, happier, chapter brings a warm glow that can't be beat.   
Good luck!

			So, for those who want to know what happened...   
We called IZZ, who told us to feed him and then let him go.  So, we kept the hedgehog one night, during which he ate about 1/3 of his weight in cat food (chicken flavored Hills) escaped from the cozy box I'd provided and scuttled across the bathroom floor to sleep underneath a clothes hamper.  Next evening, we sent him on his merry way.   
Not very eventful, but we hope all's well that ends well!

			Animal charity based in Zurich, CH and doing active work in Romania could use help from its fellow countrymen and womenÂ..If you are thinking of adding a canine to your life this may be a great opportunity to do so.   
Please note I have no affiliation with this rescue group. I came across them shortly after I arrived in CH while doing research into adopting a dog and have followed their work since. Despite some tough obstacles they seem to do some really great work. Thought maybe if more folks knew about them they might be able to help.   
You can check out their website for more information and their facebook page is even more up to date with info.

			You cannot take a dog to a Badi, and Werdinsel has one (and signs that dogs are not allowed). I don't recall how big the Badi's area is but I doubt it's gonna be the whole island. Perhaps the western part will be OK.   
There are many places along the Limmat where you can enter the water. There are even more now, because the water is surprisingly low! For example: 
a) northern / eastern side of the river to the east of EuropabrÃ¼cke (Kloster-Fahr-Weg), 
b) or, moving more towards the city, on the same side of the river, next to Hardturmsteg, there is a small rocky ""beach"", 
c) my favourite spot is Wipkingerpark, there are big, long concrete stairs between the path and the river. Big enough to set a BBQ or lay down on a towel to suntan. Many people come here with dogs too.   
Send me a PM if you need more details. I live in that neighborhood  .

			Has Ebby been tested for a urinary  tract infection?    
Often this is the first step in young females, as UTIs are not uncommon and can result in urine loss.   
Post spay incontinence is not all that common, but it does happen -however other causes are often considered first., such as thyroid disorders, diabetes, Cushings, hormonal imbalance, etc.   
(Have you seen an increase in drinking as well?)   
If it is spay incontinence, there are several possibilities for treatment from meds to surgery.   
So first step,is a discussion with your vet.     
Paws crossed it's easily sorted.

We're in a different neighbourhood so we won't be walking around the same territory. From what my friend said, we just ought to keep off private property and pick up poo. The area where he peed was definitely public property rather than private.    
Good advice about talking to other dog owners. I'm starting to be more aware that there are official regulations and then there are personal expectations, some people seem to mix them up. I guess talking to other owners will at least let me know where the oversensitive people are.

Here is perhaps the best explanation I have seen of what is required, what the course covers, what the goals are, what one should look for in a trainer, from Hundeherz:

			I had 2 FIV+ cats: a mother and one of her 2 kittens. 
The kitten died at 3 1/2 yo. He got infected  most likely during nursing - I saw one of her nipple bleeding, because the first test at 4 weeks was negative.   
He was healthy until his immune system broke down and he died within a couple of weeks.   
His mother who was FIV+ but never showed any symptoms died of breast cancer at 5 yo, the same week.   
The youngest the cat is infected, the shortest is his life expectancy.   
In order to bring a cat over you need a certificate of health. If the cat is healthy, being FIV+ will not be mentioned. Check with your vet to be sure. 
You should be cautious with vaccinations though and only do what is necessary.    
Some people say that one should not mix FIV+ and FIV- cats. 
I know many rescuers who end up keeping FIV+ cats, without transmissions - as far as I know.   
The virus is not easily transmitted. Like in humans, you need a blood to blood or sexual contact. 
Of course, you can not totally exclude the risk, but from my point of view, it is really minim.   
Now FeLV is another story. The FeLV virus can be transmitted through saliva while grooming and to some extend through urine and feces. Infected cats should be separated from non FelV cats.   
There are very useful and knowledgeable yahoo groups for people with FIV+ cats. I recommend you subscribe there.

Hi Rob1, no, the two assigned pet seats were both aisle seats. Both were on the left side of the plane with only one seat next to them (on the left near the window). The two seats were spaced out about 20 rows apart. When the woman next to me switched sweats with my husband, we had no one sitting next to us (he was the aisle and I was the window) so that worked out well since the carriers extended beyond the space and required us to step around and over them when we got up.

Zooplus.ch delivers to Switzerland as well, they use DPD, while zooplus.com delivers to Switzerland using DHL.      I called zooplus. They don't deliver on Saturday and you can't select  a specific day according to them.  But according to the dpd website (German version, I've linked to the English one) you can schedule delivery days (I'm guessing  only Mon-Fri) and ask to place the parcels in the stairwell.    
So it's basically ""hope and wait and see if they deliver to the place they're supposed to"", I guess...?

			meloncollie makes a good point about the heat.    
Hopefully by having night flights you will avoid the hottest part of the day anyway, but as you are flying with your dogs, insist on keeping them with you until the last possible moment.  
The airline will often want to take them through to the cargo area as early as possible, but depending on how this is set up it can be quite hot and noisy. Usually if you ask (and make it clear you won't go wandering off) you can stay with your dogs until quite a short time before they are loaded.   
You should always call the airline a day before to confirm anyway, as most aircraft only have one hold appropriate for dogs, and they will bump your dog if they need to transport a body.

366	17.06.2015, 14:45	Senior Member	Thanked 241 Times in 110 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Much of the newer Swiss legislation is modeled on the laws in Germany (our whole approach to dog control changed after a tragic incident, much as German regs did somewhat earlier) so if you are familiar with the German system you should have no trouble navigating your way around Switzerland's various dog laws.   
One other thing I should point out, as a fellow owner of a canine crew.   
Renting with more than one dog can be difficult. Not impossible, many of us have done it, but it might mean putting permission to keep multiple dogs as a priority and compromising on location, type of dwelling, etc. Here is where your relocation agent really needs to earn his/her keep. A good 'dog friendly' agent can be the key to success.

			From the Tier Im Recht website:       
The Berner Verwaltungsgericht has ruled that the introduction of a leash law along the Limpach canal in Baetterkinden BE is a disproportionate measure, and thus untenable.    
The leash law covered an area that was approximately one-quarter of the Gemeinde land.    
The court argued that because the affected area was open, giving dog owners enough time to bring their dogs under control, a general leash law covering such a large portion of available land was an excessive restriction.   
(One provision of the TSchV is that as far as possible, according to individual needs and level of training and control, dogs should have opportunities for off lead exercise.)   
Gemeinde Baetterkinden still has the option of appealing this ruling  to the Bundesgericht.   
---   
It will be interesting to see if the case goes farther, or if  this decision leads to challenges to similar laws in other communities.   
---   
I would encourage all dog owners (and anyone interested in animal welfare issues) to browse the TIR website now and again. Especially as the laws that affect us can change...

			What the wildlife hospital vets told us, is that this slow and very painful internal destruction is much worse for larger animals (in France this is a real problem with Coypu too) because the amount ingested compared to body weight is much smaller than for a rat. It can take weeks to kill a badger and coypu- a few hours perhaps with a rat, depending on amount ingested (but yes... not a nice way to go, that is for sure). But as said, a total different issue here- whether foxes or dogs are targeted- is not always clear.

			Yes, Jennaasis. I have seen your blog! Very nice. I definitely want to go more into this direction once I get more settled.   
I really want to make sure they eat well. I was shocked to see all the ugliness in most processed cat food. Then I read an article about Royal Canin and other big but top brands and how they are owned by Mars and other enormous companies because there is big money to be made. So yet another thing that is driven by profit rather than quality.   Granted, these top brands are better than Meow Mix but still. It is probably not that hard to do.    
I found two brands on Zooplus, which other people recommended elsewhere:   
Thrive Complete 
Catz Finefood   
So, I have bought some and hopefully it will be okay.   
I will definitely be in touch once my life with my new kitties settles down.   
Thanks!      Thanks so much. I like their site. I will definitely explore their food!   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2013	Groaned at 9 Times in 9 Posts	High quality complete wet cat food in Switzerland?	Konuku	Posts: 341

			Hello,   
I am considering taking a job in Geneva and am interested in finding out about stabling for my horse. We currently live in Brittany and are thinking about living somewhere close to Sciez, France which looks a short commute to Geneva.  
Are there some good stables in that area? I do some dressage and would also like to be able to hack out somewhere once a week. We have a trailer and I'm happy to drive 30 minutes to be able to get to a forest or area with good bridleways. Is this a possibility from Sciez and what kind of rates are charged for stabling?   
Many thanks

FYI, a clarification of the above:   
The Tiermedizinzentrum plans to eventually have someone on site 24/7, but while they are in the start-up phase this is still being organized. For now in an emergency they ask that you call the central number  055 536 44 44. Listen to the recording, you will be connected with one of the vets.   
Several vets live close by, one should be able to meet you at the center within 15 minutes.

			Slinky the dachshund we adopted alst year, is the only bred dog we've had. He was also stolen and later found by the RSPCA in a flat in the Midlands, full of other stolen pure bred dogs stolen for re-sale and stud/puppy farms- and then abandonned. It took a couple of weeks for neighbours to finally complain, and by the time the RSPCA arrived, all the small dogs had been killed and eaten by the larger ones. He is such a fighter and knows how to hide under a blanket and pretend not to be there. Daughter saw him on the news on TV and contacted the RSPCA immediately to adopt him. He was about 3 or 4 at the time and that was 12 years ago.   
All our other pets found us- and are all Heinz 57- and all lived to a ripe old age, without any health problems to the last- 18-19 years old for both cats and dogs. Our current adoptee dog is 16-17. Slinky is also about the same, but won't be with us much longer due to his many health problems. Mind you, 15 for a pure bred dachshund is almost a miracle, says our vet.

			you dont need any courses to own a horse, but I strongly recommend having a bit of experience when getting an own horse or at least have knowledgable trainers at your side from the beginning. there are so many things to think about starting with nutrition, hoove care, illness, what kind of stable etc etc, most things one only realizes when the horse is actually there 
It is an animal and needs to get the care and attention as per Tierschutzgesetz and its personal needs.

			Rates are all over the ballpark, from ca. CHF 20 per hour to CHF 100 per hour.  Group walking is usually at the lower end, walking your dog alone sometimes towards the higher.    
Some dogwalkers will charge mileage on top of that.   
Other things you need to know about :   
Anyone doing commercial (paid) dog care must have completed certain education courses. It is your responsibility to ascertain that your dog walker has the necessary certificates. (For care of up to 5 dogs, the SKN courses - the same course all owners must take* - are sufficient.) You can read more here:       
Make sure you understand insurance liability coverage. Talk to your insurer to understand what falls under your coverage* and/or the walker's. Ask the walker for copies of his/her policy.   
Make sure you have a written contract, covering all expectations and contingencies.    
Get references, and check them out.    
---   
* Since you mention that you are new to Switzerland, a couple of points that you might not have come across yet:   
You are required to take out liability insurance (Privathaftpflicht) of at least 1 mio.   
You are required to take courses yourself. There are two requirements, federal SKN Theory and Practical courses, and the ZH cantonal List 1 courses. (A lab is a List 1 breed.)  Whether you are required to do the more extensive ZH List 1 courses will depend on when your dog was born, before or after 31 Dec 2010.

			Bringing this back up, because after discussion with my vet I decided to have Hooligan vaccinated against Lepto this year, using the Lepto 6 vaccine.   
As per my earlier post Hooligan has epilepsy which puts her in the 'compromised' category - so we had to stop vaccinating her some years ago.    
But that decision shouldn't be static. Each year we review the incidence of the various diseases and weigh the consequences of disease against Hooligan's own 'risk profile' and current health.    
Hooligan is still a very active dog who lives and hikes in areas where there have been Lepto cases reported (this year is expected to be particularly bad), our garden is full of mice (rodent urine is a vector) - and she has been seizure-free for a good long time now (knock wood!).  All in all, this year I felt that the benefit of having her vacc'd against Lepto far outweighs the risk. Lepto is a horrible disease, sadly often fatal.   
So just wanted to say to all whose dogs are 'compromised' as Hooligan is - it's a good idea to have regular discussions with your vet, in light of current lepto incidence in your particular area and in light of your dog's individual health factors.   
By the way,  Hooligan  has shown no signs of adverse reaction.    
---   
Young Heffalump gets vaccinated regularly as a matter of course. With the ancient Belltie we do a similar review as to benefits/risks for his individual situation.

			A few possibilities:   
VI Dogs, in Morgarten ZG:     
Several EFers use VI Dogs. While I don't (because mine need care in my home) I have met Suzanne and was impressed with her, and with her business.  Her service is very popular, so I don't know if she has capacity at this late date.   
Angela's Hundesitting in Feusisberg SZ. I don't know them myself, but EF member Suzanne57 has written about this service, do a quick search of the Pet Corner for her write up.     
Both are about 45 minutes outside the city.   
Another possibility.  Tierheim Surber, in the city by HÃ¶nng.  I adopted Heffalump from them. It's a rather unusual Tierheim - but I visited many times during the adoption process  (yes, they were that thorough) and I can certainly say that the folks I met there are true animal lovers. They offer a Tierpension as well as take in homeless animals.       
ETA;   
Two pet sitting lists, unfortunately you have to subscribe to a membership in order to contact the sitters:         
Also you might try Rent-a-Rentner - this is an exchange for retired folks who are looking for occasional jobs:         
Hope a solution can be found.

			FWIW when our cat disappeared (in Vaud) some years ago we had immense support from:    
Centre SVPA 
Rte de Berne 318 
1000 LAUSANNE 25     
As it happened, what we learned on line was true: cats rarely stray very far from home but do not respond to calls. We found on a UK Web site the best advice. We left a patio door open and food for the cat, and within a few days our cat returned for a meal.

			hi guys 
so i have been busy with importing my cat (fully grown, pedigree) from south africa to here. 
he is arriving in July, and i thought to share the procedure that I needed to do in order to comply with swiss laws.   
bear in mind that the cat is flying solo (not with a passenger) 
FSVO permit took the longest, but its a very simple process when you know what to do...       For the accompanied entry into Switzerland from a rabies risk country, the animal (dog, cat or ferret) requires the following:     Â·          
The microchip must conform to ISO standard 11784 and must be readable with a reader as specified in ISO standard 11785, i.e. a so-called euro chip, which contains only numbers and no asterisks (*). Otherwise, you must make sure you carry a suitable reader with you.      Â·          
A rabies vaccination can only be recognized as valid if the microchip was implanted before the vaccination. The rabies vaccination is not valid if it is carried out before the animal has reached the age of 12 weeks.      Â·          
A blood sample must be taken from the animal no sooner than 30 days after the rabies vaccination (but within the validity period of the vaccination). This sample must undergo analysis for rabies antibodies. This analysis must be carried out in a laboratory approved by the EU. A list of approved laboratories can be found at  http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/live...pproval_en.htm  
The blood analysis is followed by a further waiting period of 3 months until entry into Switzerland is possible, provided the result is at least 0.5 IU/mL.     Â·          Must be issued by the official veterinarian responsible or the authorities responsible in the country of origin. The model veterinary certificate and declaration of ownership can be found via the following link:  http://www.blv.admin.ch/themen/04670...x.html?lang=en      Â·          To enter Switzerland via a Swiss airport, a permit issued by the FSVO is required. To obtain a permit, you must send the following documents to the FSVO before your departure: a copy of the laboratory report on the blood analysis, microchip certificate with date of implantation, certificate of rabies vaccinations and the application form (obtainable at  http://www.blv.admin.ch/themen/04670...x.html?lang=en ). The permit costs CHF40. This fee is collected by customs upon entry.     We draw your attention to the fact that, if the animal does not fly with the owner in the passenger cabin, but is carried in the hold, it is absolutely essential to make sure the animal is checked in as ÂAVI in HoldÂ or ÂExcess baggageÂ. This makes it clear for all parties involved (airline, border veterinarians and customs) that the animal is accompanied by the owner, which simplifies entry.

			My 2.5 year old bitch, Lucy, was recently spayed (February). She had her ovaries removed and was forbidden from running around off the lead for 10 days. She also had to wear a nifty body stocking to prevent her from worrying at the incision. Unfortunately, unlike the body stocking that my other dog Schotty had to wear after his castration, there were no suitably placed apertures in Lucy's outfit - which meant partly undressing her every time she needed to ""do her duty"".   
Be warned, though, the night of the surgery (generally they are released home the day of surgery) your dog will be in discomfort and may not have any appetite (Lucy whimpered for a number of hours   and refused everything except some boiled chicken). But Lucy soon bounced back.   
Your vet will (should) prescribe adequate analgesia after surgery and I would suggest giving her the analgesics for a day or two after surgery as, unfortunately, dogs can be in discomfort or pain and not show it. I felt that this course of action was best for Lucy (better safe than sorry).   
Good luck with your little lady.

			The bunny (Hufflepuff) is doing well.  She doesn't have a friend yet, but we have seen a possible match at the tierheim and hopefully she will be paired up soon. She's got a new, enormous hutch and is gradually transitioning to living outside. She still gets lots of visitors--the neighborhood kids love her--and has a pretty interesting life for a bunny. We are really enjoying her.

			Hi   
I am starting a new job in Geneva at the end of May.  I am not yet sure if I will be living in CH or just across the border in FR - it purely depends on where I can find pet-friendly accommodation.   
I will be importing my pets (dogs/cat) about a month after I arrive, once I've (hopefully!) found somewhere to live.  Animals have all been rabies tested etc, and I have a great Vet who is organizing the export paperwork.   
Is the pet-import process different in CH/FR? I looked at the CH animal import website - which says that I need to apply for a permit <21 days in advance.  Is this the same for FR?  Any thoughts/advice very welcome!   
Thanks!

Just a long shot, does anybody have the number of the boarding home for dogs near mellingen  ( there was only one ) and she was brilliant, the reason 
I'm asking as we have a good as gold pug but a French bulldog 7 month old puppy that is chewing things if left alone so we don't think she's suitable yet to be left in a house unless it's somebody that's with her ALL the time and our usual dog sitter is in the US, this place isn't a kennel as such but more of a heated out house and our pug was comfy there but I lost their number I've tried to google it but getting no where    
If any one can help we want a sitter from 13th may for 4/5 days

425	null	null	null	null	"    Greenmount, there are battery farms and scams in every country. The numbers - let alone the sights - will make you ill, then make you cry, then make you very, very angry. No country is immune, no country can sit firmly on it's high horse.   
Wealthy Switzerland is a target for foreign puppy mill operators. There are ready buyers with money in their pockets. Illegal imports are a continual problem, and yes, some of those battery farmers do come from eastern Europe. And they also come from southern Europe. And western Europe. And the UK. In fact, the only reason that you don't see many illegal puppy farm imports from the rest of the world ending up here is that the cost of shipping eats too far into the profit.    
It should be noted, though, that Swiss hands are far from clean. Show me a foreign battery farmer, and I'll show you a Swiss counterpart brokering the sale and taking a chunk of the profit.   
BTW, the only reason you don't see more puppy mills in Switzerland is that the cost of land is so high. You see plenty of BYBs and irresponsible breeding, though.    
As above, no country can sit for very long it's high horse.   
(An eye opener, for instance: google Amish + puppy mill.)   
We've seen it here on EF. How many threads have there been with posters trying to circumvent importation regs? Were all those naive do-gooders, or perhaps some battery farmers in disguise?    
Slammer brings up a very good point about battery farmers disguising themselves as rescues. As the public becomes more educated about responsible purchasing, scammers and battery farmers get more and more creative - and what better way than to tug at a dog lover's heartstrings with a hard luck story.   
---   
It should be said that just as no country is free of the dark side, excellent breeders and rescuers can also be found in all countries.    
Whether one is a breeder or rescuer, buyer or adopter, or simply a dog lover - we all have to join together to fight the 'dark side'.

It is in Effretikon, so there is a direct S-Bahn. You can bring the dog to the station and they will pick him up for free. If you want to see the premises, they will take you too. The dogs live with them in their house (no kennels), there is a small fenced area in front if they need to run a little and all the dogs are taken on walks twice a day (not all at once, usually it's small dogs vs. big). They are friendly and my dog loves them. They speak little English, but my broken German is enough  .

			I had a cat that was mesmerised by dripping taps and water.   
I can still remember the pain when he daintily walked along the edge of the bath and fell in.  I don't know who moved the quickest.  Me with my beautiful thighs (at the time) scratched and him looking like a drowned rat!!   
And he did it again, and again.  Not falling in though!!  I'd knock him off if he started getting a bit dodgy.   
Also, if your cat goes outside.  They often drink from puddles, supposedly that is good for their digestion to drink sort of dirty water.  Mine often drank the water after i had watered the plants.   
I dunno, I'm no expert, all i know that the cats i have had over the years have been healthy and happy and loved.  Apart from a few visits to the vets they lived long.   
Another one used to lick my forehead in the Summer, i guess it was the sweat and salt or summat.

			Hello,   
We have also taken our dog on a number of trips since being here and we have found the hotels to be very understanding and many welcome the dog with open arms.   
One trip to Baden Baden was very special.  The Dorint provided bowls, snacks and bowls in the room as we arrived.  We spent the days hiking in the black forest and traveling to small villages and towns.  Then off to Munich and once again he was very welcome.  Public transport, restaurants and coffee shops had no problem.   
Europe seems to be a very dog friendly place.

			Greymalk, would you consider a cat from a shelter?   
Two near to you are Tierschutz Beider Basel:     
And Tierschutzbund Basel:     
Both have many cats needing homes.   
You can also browse the Switzerland-wide database of homeless animals, here:     
You can filter by several criteria, such as location, age, sex, etc.   
All the best as you search for your new friend.

But it is mandatory without the vet exemption and can be a great way to meet new people too.    It's not very long from my understanding, something like half a day to do each part (the practical part has to be done within a year of registering your dog/s) and there are trainers around who can do it in English if your French isn't up to it.  Here's a list of approved trainers for Vaud:

			[QUOTE=kittekat;2328511]   I fully subscribe to iPinkys declaration, neither of these benefit a cats teeth. I only give wet food (Bozita) and once a week or so buy them chicken gullets,wings, thighs if on special and even get frozen hearts as a treat  ( extra Taurin that all cats really must have). They both go outside and one is a real hunter, but mostly seems to pick on the shrews around here when they are not hibernating and these cats don't eat. I give them these as the sinews in the chicken products I give them acts like dental floss for them, helping to keep the plaque problem down.

			You can take your dog off-leash in parks, but unfortunately there is not so many of those in the city  .   
Allmend is the most popular location, just next to Sihlcity ( ). It is not fenced, but big enough to either let your dog run freely or use a long training leash. One thing to remember is that the area is divided by the river and while you can do whatever you want in the northern part, the southern is (and should be, but that is another thing...) dog-free.   
Another place is Werdinsel ( ), but here you have be careful and not enter the Badi area (also forbidden).   
Areas along the Limmat (both directios from Werdinsel) are great for long walks, because sometimes the path gets really wide and there is lots of grass.

			Another vote for leaving the dog behind in CH. Although having a 3-months-old pup myself, for those long 6 weeks I would bend over backwards to arrange my closest family or myself to stay with him/her.   
I have to board mine for 2 weeks. I will probably leave her in Effretikon ( ). Dogs live in the house with the caretakers. PM me if you want more details.

			I agree that this is a good way to remind people that what pets (not only dogs) turn out to be can largely depend on their owners.   
It also reminds me of the one time I was out for a walk and this grenade of a tiny dog came shooting at me. I calmly but firmly called out to the owner to get his dog under control but no, the ""oh he won't do anything"" tripe was spouted. Tripe in this case, because that dog had nothing better to do than to run up my legs. Owner walked up to me and said ""oh, he does that."" Thanks indeed  
Not funny as I wasn't in the mood for a dog to do that, because I expect dog owners to have their pets under control when out with them and to at least apologize if they can't even do that.  
So... had the owner either gotten his pet under control or at least said ""Sorry, what can I do to have your pants cleaned"" or, for crying out loud, ""May I offer you a tissue?"", I might have been less annoyed, but that's precisely the way to annoy people with your dogs.    
On the other hand, if someone walks up to me with their dog on a leash or at their feet and the dog curiously sniffs my shoes, I ask them if I can pet the dog and   they agree, I do so, asking what the dog's breed/mix/age is and complimenting the owner on their dog's behavior.   
It goes both ways - sometimes people forget that. Thanks for this, Meloncollie.

			Hi All,    
I know it's been a while since this thread was posted. But someone did take my offer to let us watch their Boxer while the family went to the U.S.    
I just wanted to say it's been one of the best 3 weeks we've had in a long time! Even the neighbors enjoyed watching the two Boxers romp in the yard. We also had pics and videos for the family to view online while they were away. :-D   
We are definitely going to miss the ""big"" little bugger when he returns home. Fortunately... the family lives close enough for us to hookup for morning walks. :-)   
""No one will ever care for your dog as you do. But when you find someone that does... it's a godsend.""   
(We didn't charge them, however, they gave us Fr. 100 for expenses of which they'll receive most back.)   
BOXERS, GOTTA LUV 'EM!

453	27.09.2014, 19:23	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    For orders from zooplus.de, is German VAT deducted after the items have been mailed? In the shopping carts, they don't deduct the VAT if you select Switzerland as your country of delivery.   
E.g. I put items for say â¬ 50.- in the cart - total price due is â¬60.- (â¬10.- delivery), including German VAT.   
I put items for â¬ 25.- in the cart - total price due is â¬ 35.- (â¬10.- delivery), including German VAT.    
Are the following conclusions correct:  
- I'm stuck paying for German VAT no matter what, but I get the difference (19% - 2.5%, that would be 17.5%) back because the items are being delivered to Switzerland. 
- If my order is less than â¬45.- (including delivery!) I will probably not be hit with customs fees as the CHF amount probably won't be higher than 62.-. 
- If I order something large for say â¬150.- including delivery, I'll need to pay the price shown in the zooplus.de shopping cart plus whichever amount of customs charges CH customs deems due, as well as an admin fee, but they should (?) adjust the amount of VAT due.

We're moving on to group lessons for the next part of Negura's training - I'll let everyone know how it goes!

			The most useless drawer in my kitchen has now become useful.   
I am talking about the drawer fitted with the insert for holding bottles. I never used it and was thinking I could put it to use storing dog food.    
We keep the bulky bags (12 - 15kg) downstairs in plastic bins and use smaller tubs (rice keepers from Japan) to transfer the food for daily use. The rice keepers were too big for the bottle drawer and were taking up valuable space in another cupboard.    
I looked everywhere and finally found the perfect solution. From Rotho. They have a new line of pet food storage containers.   
As we needed 3 bins I bought the 4.5 litre containers.      
I could not find these containers in any store so I ordered them online. They were delivered with an invoice.   
I sawed off the inside wires of the basket for the bottles so the containers fit inside the frame.   
I adjusted the height of the little drawer above and in there keep all the dog meds which are given with the food. The dog food scale is not in the photo but it sits between the containers.

			I wish the Stiftung Warentest had published the full article free online. Since they haven't (at least as far as I can find) I can't comment on their conclusions.   
However, there is apparently a some criticism of their test assumptions, for instance here:       
(Just found this via my friend Google as an example - but it makes me wish that the Stiftungs Warentest full article were available as I'd like to compare and contrast.)

The important thing is that every dog owner should educate himself/herself. Know how regulations work, which will differ slightly by EU/US/UK, etc. Know how to read a label, know what is important vs what is marketing, and most important of all - read all you can about veterinary nutrition, from various sources, speak with your vet, and evaluate the food you choose with your individual dog's needs in mind.

			Thank you for your helpful suggestions and ideas and especially to those of you who have reached out with offers to borrow a temporary crate. Hopefully the very large VariKennel we ordered will arrive in short time, but we've brainstormed some alternatives that should work in case the order is delayed. Thanks again!

When a sitter takes a dog into his/her house the dog slots in with the sitter's family and routine. The sitter is doing his/her normal housework, running errands, caring for his/her own family and pets in addition to yours. In this situation fewer hours a day are devoted exclusively to your dog.    
When the sitter moves into your home obviously the sitter does not do any of the above - the sitter's time is exclusively devoted to your dog.   
The CHF 200 per day average is generally figured on an assumed 8 hours spent actually working with your dog at CHF 25 per hour - the same wage you would pay a babysitter or other household worker. But you are getting a bargain - the sitter is there to care for your dog throughout the full day just as you would. Yes, he/she is sleeping overnight, you would have negotiated how much personal time the sitter would have away from the house during that time, and a good deal of the time at your home is spent doing one's own thing around the house - but 200 per day is actually a very good deal.   
(I know of one sitter who charges CHF 600 per day - that is, 25 per hour for a 24 hour day.)   
But either at your home or the sitter's, while one is not 'working' that is, interacting with your dog the full time, nonetheless the sitter takes on what is in effect 24/7 responsibility, just as the owner would. If a crisis occurs in the middle of the night, one needs a sitter who is both willing and able to respond. That responsibility is actually what you are paying for.   
My sitter and I have been through two of the awful 'what if' situations. One anticipated and thus discussed and decision-making planned for, the other completely out of the blue. Every sitter and owner need to anticipate these terrible possibilities - and what you pay your sitter reflects the willingness and ability to take on this responsibility.     
It should be stressed, though - if you are paying the sitter then under the TSchV the sitter needs to have done at a minimum both the SKN courses - the same courses that any owner has to do. A sitter takes on owner responsibilities, so it makes sense that the same legalities apply. I know that many people consider themselves as sitting 'casually' rather than professionally but still want to be paid - one needs to understand that it is payment that triggers the education requirements.   
It is only the case of sitting as a favor, not for money, where the education requirements do not apply.   
I've said this before but it bears repeating:   
If you find an otherwise promising sitter who has not yet done the SKN courses, why not sponser that person for the course, have him/her do it with your dog while sitting for you? Win-win all around.

			I think the best way I can explain what I meant by my original statement that   is to use my own son and dog as an example. When a stranger comes to my house for the first time, my son may or may not like the person but he will be polite, say hello and shake hands. With my dog, I don't know how he's going to react. He will either love the guy or hate him. Some people he jumps all over like he's known them forever while others might get barked at or sniffed suspiciously.   
Sure my dog is predictable in some situations, like when I put his food out, I know he's going to eat it.   But she does not exhibit human-like behavior and we can't expect her to. She's a dog. A full part of our family, like a kid to us but still a dog in behavior.

			The 'Crate' thread reminded me, so an FYI to Ruffwear fans:   
Ruffwear has introduced two new harness styles, the Front Range harness for everyday use (much lighter than the Webmaster, a good choice when the walk doesn't involve climbing a mountain) and the Load Up, to be used as a car restraint attached to a seat belt (not for walking!) in situations where a travel crate is not possible.       
Because I sometimes have to transport dogs unexpectedly I keep a set of the Load Up harnesses in the car - these have been a godsend.   
All the Muttley Crew wear Ruffwear harnesses of one type or another - in fact, Hooligan's original Webmaster is going on 9 years old now, still in pristine condition. Given that she's a rough-and-tumble kind o' gal, that's saying something. Love Ruffwear products.   
The new styles might not be in stock in most Swiss stores - but Meiko (and possibly other retailers) can order one for you.

			Latest update ..  
He's been back at the vet and the vet spoke to her colleague for second opinion. He's still got the cherry eye, they decided it's pointless to push it back in again, he's to get the operation.. However they want to wait another 2-3 weeks because they fully expect the other eye will go too and need done.   
Looks terrible but he doesn't seem to care.    
Suppose getting both done together would be cost effective but I'm guessing he would be vision impaired until it healed up??

			Something folks might not know:   
Private persons may list an animal in need of a new home on the Tierdatenbank, it's not exclusively for use by rescue organizations.   
There are conditions, though - for private persons, the animal must be born in Switzerland, have a valid vac and be chipped. This is to prevent dubious folks trafficking animals into Switzerland from using the system.   
A private person cannot use the online Meldung, it has to be written. The form is here:     
The Tierdatenbank is the best place to reach serious animal lovers in Switzerland.     
---   
Years ago the Free Ads were 'the' way to reach the public; unfortunately they have become so infested with dodgy and unscrupulous ads that many serious animal lovers avoid them. Thus there are better tools available to reach the kind of people one wants when in need of rehoming.

The first is the Coop site. Both require a paid subscription to get a sitter's details.    
(Be aware that it is the responsibility of the dog owner to determine that a carer is compliant with the education requirements under the TSchV.)     
Another site that isn't specifically for pet care but has provided useful contacts for many folks is Rent-A-Rentner, a platform tor retired folks who wish to work a bit:         
ETA:   
And of course you could always post an ad on the EF market place. But the same caveat as to dog care requirements applies - be sure that the person you hire is compliant.

			If your dog is registered with ANIS, you will receive a confirmation letter from them with your account and pin numbers. (My recent mutt was registered on 3 January, I just received the confirmation letter today, FWIW.)   
If you don't have this letter, call ANIS (  ) give them the chip number, and ask the status of your dog's registration. They are very helpful folks and will advise you what to do next.   
It would be odd that the transport company did the ANIS registration - first time registration is supposed to be done by a vet. But who knows, we've seen all sorts...   
If in doubt, if you have further problems, see your vet, he/she will take care of the bureaucracy for you. (Cost of ANIS registration is 20-40, usually rolled into an initial consultation visit - total usually under 100.) You'll want to get to know a vet anyway, an introductory visit is always recommended.   
Don't stress about the 10 day thing -  just follow up on the registration both, ANIS and at the Gemeinde/Polizei. And make sure you understand which training classes (federal, cantonal) you are required to do.   
And enjoy your Swiss adventure  - always more fun shared with a four footed friend!     
ETA:   
If you don't yet have a passport, your vet will give you one. There is a new format from 1 Jan 2015, do make sure you get the new version.

			Part of what makes a reputable breeder is the extensive health and genetic testing done on the parent dogs to determine if each is fit to breed and then if the pair is a good match - this will significantly add to the cost of breeding.  From the little I know of the SKG world, in the two breeds I see most often Swiss breed clubs do seem - at least on paper - to take these issues more seriously, with more oversight, than, say, what I have seen in the rescue fall-out from breeders in the US.   
(Bearing in mind that this is not my world - I generally only come into contact with breeders via rescue work. But from that perspective, I respect many of the breeders I have met in Switzerland and Germany.)   
Add in all the rest of what a good breeder does - necessary accomodation (you can guess how much a property with sufficient land costs in Switzerland), a solid socialization program, health testing and care of puppies, etc., - and you will of course see higher prices.    
There is a lot more to rearing healthy puppies of sound temperament than just vaccinating. Look at the retriever.ch site to read up on the various genetic health issues of the breed. A good breeder plans a pairing with genetic health in mind - and the tests involved are expensive.   
----       
The reputable breeders I know don't actually make much money from breeding - most cover their costs. Good breeders generally do it out of love for the dogs.   
It's the battery farmers, who do none of the necessary health testing, who do no socialization, who toss any two dogs together with no thought for genetics, who breed a dog every season until it drops dead, whose dogs live in misery in small cages their entire lives, whose pups are often ill with parvo, with respiratory infections, with inherited conditions - these are the folks cashing in.   
These folks need to be stopped. And the only way to stop them is to educate people to buy only from a reputable breeder.  Stop supporting the barstewards who are ruining our dogs.   
---     
Bottom line, though - the purchase price or adoption fee is but a drop in the bucket. Dog ownership is expensive - especially in Switzerland.

			Animal welfare - of pets, wildlife, and livestock, is regulated under the TSchV and TSchG. These includes not only minimum accomodation standards for pets but also care and handling requirements.   
You can start by perusing the BLV's pet owner website, Mein Heimtier:     
And also the Wegweiser linked above.   
Have a read through Mein Heimtier - and then taking the Swiss perspective (and requirements) into account think about which animal would make a good pet for you.   
Good luck!

			In Germany you need a special ""haftpflichtversicherung"" called ""hundehaftpflicht"" and it costs you at least 40 euro (~50 CHF) per year (look  ). If youÂ´re german and you have already such an insurance, you should ask if its valid in switzerland. If some swiss insurances really including a dog insurance like meloncollie said, take this option.

			Here is a link to a website that allows you to find a veterinarian anywhere in Switzerland.        
Of course, it is always good to know if someone else has used that vet and what their experiences were.    
I have found that veterinary practices here can vary quite a bit, depending on how many doctors there are, and whether the practice is located in a village, town or city. What does seem to be standard in our experience is that most do not have a lab on site for analysis and sending blood or urine samples out for testing is quite expensive. Not only that, but waiting for results can be really frustrating. There is one lab called Diavet that is used exclusively by vets. Then there is another lab called Medica which is not just for animals but humans and I find the results with this lab are much faster.    
We actually use the services of two different veterinarians. The one we used before we moved I still use exclusively for injections as they give us a discount for having 3 dogs  . But the local vet is just 5 minutes away from our home which is a big advantage. She also had a Basset as her patient for years until he recently passed on. Bassets are not very common here and they have some problems unique to their breed so it is good to have a vet who has some experience with one. I am considering asking about the price of injections as it could be that she will not charge us for an ""examination"" as the other vet does when I take them for injections. It is not as though the dogs are examined at all - the vet just asks me if they are sick or not .   
Hope all worked out well for you and your cat.

			Hi There,   
Not much help for cats, unfortunately,but here's a site where you can rent scanners.   , and here's the Avid site  . I rented mine and simply sent in back after I was finished with it. Pretty easy. Oh, and be careful with any drugs for animals, as the airlines are usually pretty strict these days - usually don't allow pets to travel ""under the influence."" Check with the airlines first!   
All the best,

We left our Welsh Terrier, Fergus, at Tierheim Stolzboden in Sihlbrugg  and were very pleased with the experience.  It doesn't look like much,  upon arrival, and to be honest, the first time I drove out there I  decided I would not leave my baby in a place with so many dogs.  But we  returned recently and met Ivo, a very nice man who obviously loves all  animals, and Fergus took to him immediately.  We were shown an area  where Fergus would stay, and we left him for 3 days.  He was a very  happy boy when we picked him up.  Note, they close for lunch from noon  until 16:00, which can be inconvenient!  Also, when I called last week  to make an appointment, the lady answering the phone did not speak any  English at all, and I have not learned enough German to make the  appointment (shame on me!).  If Ivo answers, you're good to go! 
It is a short walk from Sihlbrugg station, which is also a plus for me.  Other kennels we have tried are more than a 30 minute walk from the nearest bus or train.  We have a car, but in bad weather, I prefer to drop our pooch off via public transportation!

			Orion,    
There are not that many breeders in Switzerland, and therefore not many puppies. Which is a good thing, for the welfare of the animals.   
You see, good breeders do not plan a litter until they have enough interest expressed from potential buyers in order to ensure that there are homes ready for their puppies. Most breeders will have waiting lists, some a year or more in advance.   
If one wants a puppy of a certain breed, one needs to first establish a relationship with the breeders.  Generally, you need to contact each breeder, introduce yourself, explain who you are, what kind of home you can offer their pup, etc. If you meet the breeder's criteria you would then meet him/her and the dogs. If the 'interview' is successful - that is, if you have convinced the breeder that you can offer a good forever home to one of his/her pups, you would then be invited to join the waiting list for the next (or a subsequent) litter.    
The process of developing a relationship with a breeder is in the best interest of the pups - which is what all good owners want.   
It is not often that a breeder has a pup to offer a last minute buyer, but sometimes it happens - for instance when a buyer already on the waiting list drops out.   
---   
The reason that we stress the 'proper' way to find one's puppy is that the breeders out there who advertise pups ready immediately are often battery farms/puppy mills. Often these dogs are bred in abusive conditions, no thought to genetic health or suitability, the pups sick, poorly socialized, mentally damaged - and if found in Switzerland often illegally imported. Sadly, small fluffy dogs - including the Maltese - are the breeds most often subjected to this horrific trade. Battery farming of puppies is vile - please do not support these criminals and animal abusers.    
Fortunately, the new revision to the EU passport scheme , in force as of 1 Jan 2015, has stricter measures put into place to help combat these barstewards.   
---   
So - plan for as long a search as necessary to develop a relationship with a good breeder. A dog will be with you 15+ years - waiting some months or a year is nothing in the long run.   
To start your search, look for the breed club of the SKG  - in Switzerland that is the Zwerghundclub:     
For more discussion on the process of finding a puppy from a Swiss breeder, see these threads:           
---   
And just because rescue is my thing - as a possible alternative, and if you are in a position to offer a rescue dog the right kind of home, from time to time take a gander at the Tierdatenbank, the database of homeless animals here in Switzerland:     
While there are currently no Maltesers in need of a home, I have seen some listed on this database, a few recently. Yes, purebred dogs do indeed land in shelters or in search of new homes. It might be worthwhile to also keep an eye on the database as you continue your search.    
---   
And of course  - because the ins and outs of the TSchV is also my thing - if you are a first time dog owner in Switzerland, have you done the SKN Theory course, or if not a first time owner but new to Switzerland have you contacted the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt for a ruling on whether you must take it or not?    
If you fall into the category of those required by federal law to take the course, good breeders will want to see your SKN certificate before inviting you onto the waiting list. If you are required to take it but haven't yet, this might be why your search is stalled. In which case, you'd be well advised to make the course a priority.   
---   
Anyway, all the best to you and your future four-footed friend.

This part of my profile relates to my employability in Switzerland, I am totally unemployable in Switzerland because I don't speak German and I am non eu. I am not unemployable in the UK, I was a police officer until 10 days ago, a job I loved and was good at and resigned from to accompany my family on a life changing experience to Switzerland.    
This site I'm sure was started to help and encourage, not to make people feel like crap for making a massive life change to become an expat, spend a bit more time being nice to people instead of assuming the worst.   
You've made me feel like crap for wanting to make my time inswitzerland as fulfilling as possible while I'm over there. Finding a breeder takes months, I know because I did it for the last year in the UK.  
Go back to when you were first an expat and ask yourself if the way you answered my question on this post was the most appropriate for a newcomer.    
Thanks again for making me feel like absolute rubbish on what is a massive emotional and life changing personal situation.

			Whatever the Swiss dog rules are they don't seem apply to all.    
Last summer my friend went for a walk near her house (she was 5 months pregnant), she was attacked by a large dog while the two owners stayed 50 meters away watching it. The dog jumped on her, ripped through her jackets and pants with his teeth and bit into her wrist while she was trying to protect her face.    
Finally the man yelled in Swiss German blaming her that she was the one that clearly provoked the dog by looking into his eyes. She was very shaken and wanted nothing to do with them at that very moment so she rushed home without taking their details.    
As she lived in a small town, it turned out that they lived a few houses down from her. Police was notified and the owner was called by the police, which he lied to saying that he had nothing to do with it.    
However the same day the owner went down to the Gemeinde and registered the two dogs, as we later found out he only had one dog registered and the other two officially never existed even thou he lived with them for two years in that apartment.    
Finally it came down to a confrontation a week later in a parking lot, she recognized him and approached him, he admitted that it was him but she couldn't prove it, at that very moment another friend of hers walked behind him and heard the entire conversation. He realized that there now was a witness and started screaming at her, threatening her.  His exact words were; you f...ed me and I will f... you back.   
At the end of a long police interview, she was told that unfortunately they couldn't do anything unless the dog attacks again.     
The police was presented with photos of the ripped clothes and body bruises and they believed here, but supposedly there is a two strikes rule in this country.   
As yes the laws here clearly state that dogs should not be without a leash but not everyone follows them.

			I would also add that if you go googling for the SKN course you may find people advertising the ability to do the theory part online in English.  Please note that these courses are not recognised by the Swiss Vet Office and you would have to take it again.  So look for an English speaking instructor who can do both the theory and practical course with you in person.  The only online course which is approved is the one by Wolf Zemp which is in German.  Of course if you speak German then you can do the theory part via his website.

			Thanks for that. I'll give them a go. It looks like Advantix isn't prescription only in the UK (I used Advocate in England which definitely is so assumed Advantix was too) so it doesn't look like that will be a problem. Seraquin isn't either so I guess I can order that from UK too. Just Milbemax to find then - which is prescription only - but 2 out of 3 isn't bad.

			Last thing anyone wants is you panicking and being afraid of NOW doing what is right. But I'm afraid your previous thread seems to indicate your dog arrived around March- but even if September- as many posters confirmed on that previous thread- you had to, by Law, register your dog within 10 days of arrival with your Gemeinde/Commune, pay the fee for the whole year, register with Anibis- and perhaps do the SKN course.   
There is huge concern at the moment with dogs not being properly imported- due to the possibility of being infected with all sort, and also due to the possibility of them coming from dreadful puppyfarms, with defects, illness and weakness and behavioural problems, lack of socialisation and much too young- due to the way they are kept in the first few weeks of life, to mothers that are forced to produce litter after litter in the most appalling circumstances. Poorly socialised dogs are often scared, and will tend to bite when 'threatened' by noisy and boisterous children- and then abandonned in a shelter!   
A long article about this in the current 'Terre et Nature' magazine- with an estimation of of 100s of illegal dogs being bought just this year in Romandie alone- mainly chihuhahas and other small breeds- many who die within days or weeks of being bought. The importing gangs have no conscience- and often use relatives or friends living here as intermediaries- very happy to make 'easy' money.   
Vets are being asked to keep a very sharp eye on this- and to report any owner they suspect from illegal import. The article finishes by saying that, even if the buyer buy in good faith- they can still be fined for not doing the necessary checks- picking upa dog from a car-park or at the border- without visiting the breeder and seeing at least the mother with the puppies- to pay a cheaper price. They can still be fined 1000s of francs for importing without due care.   
Of course, this does not apply to you- but as I just read the article today, I thought it was a good idea to share.   
So, don't panic- it is too late now. But- get your dog properly checked, vaccinated and recorded in passport, and anibis +Gemeinde registered. The last thing any vets wants to do is get an owner- and therefore a dog (it can be quarantined or even euthanazed in case of doubt) - but they will do if they are concerned. Keep a VERY close eye on the vaccination date, as if you go over 1 year, it may cause real problems. We were 2 days late for our dog's booster, and the vet changed the date on the passport, but only because a/ he knew the dog well and b/ he knew us well as we have used him for many years with other pets.

			Swiss animal protection law already forbids 'Qualzucht', abusive breeding practices, but the current definitions are vague. The BLV has now revised the legislation adding definitions and specifically forbidding certain practices. The revision is set to enter into force on 1 Jan 2015.   
The provisional text:     
And an article by TIR:     
I am especially thrilled to see that  the proposal forbids breeding animals where due to the pairing it cannot be ruled out that the offspring would suffer loss of one of the senses, such as deafness or blindness, or that due to anatomy the animal would have difficulty in giving birth.   
This addresses double merle breeding (collies, shelties, aussies,  etc.) as well as other breeds  such as danes and dalmations, where known problematic genetic combinations can result in deafness or blindness. It also addresses breeding animals whose heads are so large that cesarean sections rather than natural births have become the norm (some of the bulldogs). The revision also addresses many health issues and extreme conformation problems.   
Additionally, the proposal explicitly forbids breeding toy dogs whose expected weight is less than 1500g - the so-called tea-cup trend.   
It also forbids breeding cats with shortened forelegs, the so-called kangaroo-cats. The legislation applies to all breeding, not just cats and dogs.   
Tables 1 and 2 following the text list specific 'Qualzucht' issues.       
TIR is pleased to see these proposals, but one objection they make is that the proposal sets up a control system that would rely on private persons. TIR is concerned that would allow for vested interest groups to water down the enforcement and would like to see control fall under the aegis of the BLV or the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt.     
But this is a huge step in the right direction.

			Hello all! For the holidays while we are away visiting family, we are looking at sitting/boarding options for our pooch. Our Hundekurse teacher recommended Tierheim Stolzboden in Sihlbrugg. We visited this weekend and everything looked on the up and up - clean, animals were well looked after, and they gave us a tour of the facility. Our dog would love the time with the other animals (she is a very sociable gal). Before we commit, I was just wondering if anyone on the forum had experience bringing their pet there. If so would love to hear it. Many thanks!

			We have had our share of lumps and bumps. In the early days when I found one it was alarming.    
Veterinarians have different ways of treating lumps. Some aspirate them, or try, examine them carefully and then decide to send them to a lab. Anaesthetic has never been used for this. It seems that a pet can develop multiple lumps which are all the same type.    
The ones we have removed were when the dogs were younger, and a general anaesthetic was used. It is also possible to use a topical anaesthetic if the dog can be kept still for the procedure.   
As the dogs age only the lumps which interfere with mobility have been removed.    
I second the idea of getting a second opinion particularly if your dog has has major surgery and you want to avoid invasive treatment if possible.

			My parents in law had problems because their vet in the UK hadn't filled the passport out correctly and because no one checks on the way out of the UK they stayed here for 2 weeks, went to the vet here, travelled back and then hit issues. They had to find a vet in Calais to redo the passport, pay for a hotel and a new trsin the next day!

We just been to ""Sniffany & Co"" at Gockhausen and it's a real gem. The owner is very friendly and helpful. She stocks a good variety of healthy foods, including Orijen, Acana and Terra Canin. None of the ""Pal"", ""Hills"" etc poisons. There is a wide selection of treats, shampoos, even ear wipes  . The toys and accessories you find there are way above what you see in Qualipet. We just bought a really cool harness for our little yorkshire. It apparently protects his back and neck/chest area when he's pulling after the girls    
All in all, although the shop is located a little bit off the beaten track, it is well worth a visit if you want to spoil your mutt.

			Dears,   
I have a little less than half a large 10kg bag of Royal Canin Light for cats. Probably it's around 4kg, not sure. My cat cannot eat it anymore because he has just had an operation and must eat specific food now.   
If anyone wants it you can take it for free. You would need to come for it at Wallisellen because I have no car (otherwise I would have taken it to one of the cat shelters).

547	26.11.2014, 12:09	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Milchbuk, Zurich	"    Heksita, if the puppy is one of the 'kleinwÃ¼chsige' breeds, then you only need to follow the federal SKN rules, which for you will be the SKN practical course as you are not a first time dog owners.   
If your dog's breed falls into the List 1 (large and massive - 45cm or 15 kg adult size) category, then you need to take the additional ZÃ¼rich courses, which do indeed include a puppy course, a juvenile course, and an adult course.    
See the breed list here to determine which category the dog will fall into:     
(Mixes, if the puppy is too young to guess at final adult size, usually fall into the largest of the dogs' parents, or go by common sense   )   
More information on the ZH law can be found here:             
Be aware that the ZH Kantonsrat has just this week voted a revision into the ZH law making the ZH course requirement applicable only to the first List 1 dog you own, not to each one. However, this is not yet law, it is expected that the transition period could be 3 years. So for now the current regs stand.   
(I'm glad to hear that you are thinking of getting another dog, and wish you all the best.)

			Cath, there are a few vets whose practice model is a house visit. Googling 'Tierarzt Hausbesuch' comes up with these, for instance:         
If you are not mobile, perhaps something like this might be a solution? I would guess, however, that these practices function as others do, that is, normal visiting hours. Whether one can call on them in a middle-of-the-night emergency is something that one would need to discuss after becoming a patient of the practice.   
Also, some vets in traditional set-ups also offer house visits to their established patients if one lives within a certain radius of the practice. (There might be an extra charge for the service, and whether it can be done out of hours/on an emergency basis needs to be discussed with the vet.)   
It should be born in mind, though, there may be a limit to what can be done in a house visit. For many emergencies, one often needs the equipment available only at a practice or hospital.       
But something to look into if you do not have your own transportation.

			Yes, black cats can suffer from the same problems as highlighted by the Cat Chat website in the UK.       
Most of my cats have been black and white ones.  Had two sisters and then a sister/brother combo, but he was white with black instead of the other way around.  Didn't particularly choose them for their colour, just because they were available when we were looking for a pet.  The sisters came from a market stall (back in the days in the UK when they were allowed to sell them) and the sister/brother were rescues from a lady who'd found them in a church cemetary.

Therefore, presumably, if you have already been registered as the owner of a dog of a List 1 breed and acquire a new dog of a List 1 breed after the new law is enacted, then you will not be required to do the extra classes with that dog even if you slithered through without needing to do them with your existing List 1-breed dog.

			Since the pet passport scheme is an EU one, the information in this leaflet from the UK government website probably covers pretty much what you need to know:    
Basically it looks like the new passports will be more tamper-proof, and there is an increased restriction on very young animals being transported.   
Thanks for the head-up, meloncollie.

It was the motive and circumstances in this case that determined wanton killing - and it was the determination of wanton killing that invoked animal cruelty law.     
But again this is only my conjuncture, based on my reading of the article, with caveats as to my lack of competency applicable. This question should be asked of someone who actually IS a lawyer.    
As the TIR folks are lawyers, they would be best placed to answer questions on this ramifications of this case.

			I agree with lmerkel - do try to find someone who can stay in your home and care for your dog.    
My dogs each still carry some of the baggage of their past lives so I truly understand your predicament. To give my guys the environment they need I need to keep their lives as free of stress as possible, which makes finding care difficult here. Given their characters and medical issues, none of the kennels I have investigated in Switzerland can provide the level of care needed. So I have a sitter who moves into our home to care for my dogs while I am gone.   
My sitter no longer takes on new clients - but perhaps you can find someone here on EF who would be willing to care for your dog. Yes, the average fee a live-in sitter charges is high, but well worth it when you have a dog with 'special needs'. (Be aware of the SKN requirements.)   
Given that 1 Nov is tomorrow, and a holiday in Switzerland to boot - do you really have to go? Is there any way to delay your trip until you have found appropriate care? Or, is there any way to take your dog with you?   
If not, put an ad in the market place section, giving full details (including what breed/mix/size your dog is, whether she is spayed or not, if your dog can live with other dogs, cats, children) and the price you are willing to pay (as this will generate more interest). Perhaps someone will respond. Alternatively, look at the usual pet sitter sites   or   . Or perhaps even  , the platform for retired folks who want a bit of work here and there.   
These are only short term solutions - long term, as lmerkel has said, working on your dog's adjustment issues will be key. Towards that end, if you tell us a bit about how you manage your dog day to day, what kind of training you have done in the past and ongoing, describe her issues in a bit more detail, perhaps we can help with some suggestions. However, that likely should be another thread, as cluttering up this one won't help you find a sitter quickly.     
----   
FYI, there is one Tierheim I would trust to care for my dogs. It's not in Switzerland, but in Germany, 83233 Bernau. I think it would be about 3 hours from Schaffhausen, maybe less. But again, it's a bit late for tomorrow - nonetheless you might want to keep them in mind for the future, visit (without your dog) to see if it might be a good fit, if so then schedule a trial stay. They have a good reputation in the rescue community.           
Hope you find a solution for tomorrow...     
Also, you might want to ask a mod to change your title, as 'dog assistance Schaffhausen' really doesn't say what you need or emphasize the urgency. Something like 'URGENT - dog sitter needed 1 Nov Schaffhausen' might garner more views.

			My family here also have outdoor cats, two of them.   
They got a really big wooden box (grandson made it) lined it with thick insulation sheets, put it on a low shelf in the bicycle shed, hung a thick old carpet piece over the entrance (to stop wind blowing in) and put their padded ordinary cat beds inside.  The cats love it.   
Although now and again they change to sleeping curled up in some old water barrels under the eaves outdoors that have straw inside (depending on the weather) - they can peep over the tops to keep control over the territory.

			Heksita, have you tried the Tierrettungsdienst and/or Tierheim PfÃ¶tli?     
It's true that there is less need for volunteers in Switzerland than in other countries. This is perhaps due to smaller shelters, perhaps also the trend towards using professional staff rather than volunteers. Additionally some of the animal care diploma courses require a student to do a Prakticum at a Tierheim so often students get the first pick at volunteer opportunities.   
(A bit frustrating when you are passionate about animal welfare, have the time, and would like to do a bit of good to find that the only thing welcome is your money.)   
But there are still shelters needing dog walking, and a few needing help in other areas - just keep asking around, perhaps at shelters in other cantons as well. Or consider volunteering in France or Germany - which is what I do.   
Another thing to consider is offering to help your local senior services group. Often elderly dog owners could use a helping hand - walking the dog on bad weather days, delivering heavy dog food packages, driving an elderly owner and dog to the vet, offering to care for a dog if the owner has to suddenly go into hospital. These can make all the difference in helping an elderly person to keep his/her canine companion. Most Gemeinde have some sort of senior services; while few would have any sort of official pet volunteer coordination you could write and offer your help on an ad hoc basis. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.   
Good luck!

			Yes, we're paying a relocation agent but, fundamentally, if the properties aren't there, then they aren't there. The commuter belt is pretty wide, but -as ever- dog friendly places are in short supply and we'll be on a much-reduced budget.  Plus, we can't live too far out in the sticks - I need to be able to get to English-speaking medical care on a weekly basis, without having to leave the hounds for hours.    
I was hoping someone with experience of these loos could tell me whether they actually work or not, otherwise we will just have to restrict our search to balconies with downspouts.

Yes, we are ready for a puppy, but of course we will not start looking until we are settled, I was thinking Spring - I wont be working and we have been researching the breed and breeders in the UK for some time, and were at the point of meeting breeders and their pets to then see if suitable for their waiting list, so i have some idea of what to avoid/look out for.   
I knew about the SKN but not in quite so much detail, so thank you. Lots to read up on and think about!

			In canton Vaud, another place to call for advice:   
BUREAU DES ANIMAUX TROUVÃS 
Centre SVPA 
Rte de Berne 318 
1000 Lausanne 25 
tÃ©l. : 021 784 8000 ou 021 784 8002 
fax : 021 784 8001 
e-mail :    
You are doing the right thing carrying a slip lead, treats to lure him... Can you call on friends to help? The more people on the lookout prepared to help the better.   
Theoretically there cannot be a stray in Switzerland as all dogs should be chipped... But the reality is there may still be a few unchipped dogs, or dogs who are chipped but the owner has not updated the contact details. Nonetheless, once you catch the dog first priority should be to have him scanned.    
Any vet will scan the dog, this should be free of charge for the finder of a lost animal. If it is after hours and there isn't a 24/7 emergency clinic in the area just call any vet practice, most will have an after-hours cover group.    
Around my area police do not have holding kennels, but larger stations should have a scanner,. This is usually my second port of call, I prefer to enlist the help of a vet rather than the police as vets tend to be more sympathetic.    
Once scanned, the vet will file a report with ANIS... And if the police do the scanning, I'd recommend calling yourself as well, just to make sure the report got done. (Often stray animals are not a priority for the police) ANIS will contact the owner.   
Now to the legalities, once you have caught the dog:   
A finder is required to file a report to the cantonal Meldstelle, for all found animals. There are two online reporting sites that will fulfil this obligation:       .   
look under 'gefundene Tiere' (can't link on the iPad, sorry)   
Or call the cantonal Meldstelle directly.   
Just an FYI, the waiting period before a found animal can be rehomed is 60 days, starting from the date the finder report is filed.   
If you wish to keep a found dog at your home during the waiting period you need permission from the cantonal Meldstelle. But be aware that if a finder chooses to keep the dog during this period the expenses in such a case are born by the finder. (If an owner is found you can ask the owner to refund your expenses, but the owner is not obliged to do so.)   
If you can't keep a found animal with you, find out from the cantonal Meldstelle who the official cantonal Tierheim is, this is the shelter obliged to take the animal. Other Tierheim might charge you for the animal's care, as they are not obliged to take in strays. (But some are willing to help nonetheless.)   
Here's hoping this dog can be caught, and helped back to his owner... Or helped, full stop, if it turns out that the owner doesn't deserve him.   
Good for you for caring and trying to help.

			Ecb, the best approach - and by best I mean most effective in bringing about changed behavior - is to speak with the owner directly. Often situations are best dealt with face to face.    
(Were it me I would do this - but as a fellow dog owner I'd likely feel comfortable in my assessment of not only what had happened but also of what should or should not happen, and thus could speak to an errant dog owner with confidence.)   
However if you feel that is something you cannot do, the proper authority to register a complaint is the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt. Are you in Kt Jura? If so, the address is here:     
You could also speak to the Gemeinde - but be aware that whether or not a complaint is taken seriously depends on local attitudes.    
I hope your boy is OK.  I know how difficult this must have been for you.

			My opinion is with those who support the idea of cats coming under the same regulations as dogs.   
Owning a cat is the ""easy"" way out of having a family pet.   
No licence fees, just feed it, no official training required, no picking up of poo, no walkies,  roams freely, kills small animals,  comes home for cuddles and comfort.  They don`t make a noise so can be left alone at home.  In other words - they are ""free"" - to have and to hold.   
And they irritate households who don`t want cats on their property!   
Unlike dogs that take a lot of their owners time (& money), with all involved in owning a pet.   
I have cat owners on 3 sides of my property, they insist on attempting to prey on fledgling birds in my garden, and other small wildlife - not out of hunger, just for the fun of the hunt/kill.   
If a window is open they enter, or try to,  the house.  One day I will be tempted to do something drastic about this!

			We've been here for a year now. We had to wait 2 months to bring our baby over due to the fact that we lived in what is classified as a ""high rabies risk"" country. It was never in my mind even an option to leave her in South Africa, she is my baby, she has been since the moment I looked after her for a week before adopting her.   
I agree with Meloncollie, a dog is a responsibility for 15+ years. Getting a dog is a decision people take far too lightly (and that, combined with backyard breeders, are the main reasons why there are millions of dogs in shelters around the world). But you made the decision and commitment to get this puppy (granted, without the prior knowledge of a possible move to CH), and now you need to do what you can with the decision you've made.   
Switzerland is an absolutely amazing country for dogs. Honestly, I think this is heaven on earth for them. Most restaurants and hotels have no issues with dogs, they even bring Peanut a bowl of water when we're at a restaurant with her. Your options for dog care are plentiful, as are dog walkers and so forth. I am incredibly happy that we jumped through all the hoops to have her here. Yes, there is legislation, and yes, it is obviously more challenging to have a dog here than to not have one here. But the advantages far outweigh the negatives in my opinion.   
Having said all of this, it sounds to me like you have made up your mind and you are looking for people to support the decision you made. From your responses I get the feeling that this puppy will be a burden to you. And in that case, I feel that a loving home in the States would be a better option for him.   
But please, if you cannot find him a home, and the last option is a shelter in the US, please bring him with you. I cannot even bring myself to imagine the trauma he would go through if he had to return to the shelter.

			Our cat went missing for 8 days, we contacted ANIS (where her microchip is registered) and also the tierklinik register for lost animals, no joy however they suggested posters, 2 hours after putting posters up around Maur where we live a couple turned up with their dog and in their arms our cat, very sorry for herself, scared and thin, they had seen our poster in the morning been out walking in the forest and found her 2.5 kms away and walked back with her! Don't give up and suggest you ask your carer to put signs up too. Good luck

			We are moving to Basel on Tuesday. Unfortunately we can't get our flat key until Wednesday morning so will have to have the cats with us in a hotel (not the first time).    
We are currently booked in the Pullman as they allow pets subject to a 15 CHF surcharge. However, I'm concerned that the room may be too small (we will also have a lot of luggage) and that the bathroom may not be suitable for the cats overnight (they chew wires sometimes so we can't let them in the room when we're asleep).   
Does anyone know of another hotel that allows pets and perhaps has a basic bathroom (no wires from hairdryer for example)? We also need an en-site car-park. If not, I guess we'll stick with the Pullman as price is ok and I'm sure we'll manage somehow. Just want it as easy as possible for the two felines after their stressful journey (and confusion over the past week of packing).

Perhaps a reminder here for all those who might want to travel at Christmas to put cat/dog boarding on priority list- as most places will be full for that key holiday period.

			For French Bulldog Owners: 
We are owners of a young Frenchie that we take to Rieter Park every Sunday. We want to create a group of (perfectly sane) French Bulldog owners getting together so the dogs can make flat-faced friends and we can discuss all things FBD.The last Sunday of every month we will meet at 1pm in Rieter Park. Meet at Park entrance on Seestrasse. Leave 15 minutes after 1 to go on leisurely walk around park, ending at Museum Rietberg cafe.   
October 26 will be first gathering and every last Sunday after that at 1pm.   
English Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, and Pugs are welcome accomplices.   
Hope to see you there.

			We have two cats, one a 4 month old kitten that we adopted from a shelter a month ago in Bern. We live on the 3rd floor in the city, right next to tram tracks so our cats are strictly indoor. Our balcony is completely netted in - a balcony is not cat proof unless there is no earthly way that the cat can get out! Many cats have fallen from balconies, and I suspect that any shelter in CH will require your balcony to be secured with net if you're on the 4th floor.   
The shelter we adopted from didn't visit our apartment, in stead they requested our address to check where we live, on what floor and what we could offer the kitten. We discussed the fact that our balcony was ""cat-proof"", they wanted pictures of it etc. To them it was important that 1.) they would be 2 kitties and 2.) there was a safe way for the cat to be outside (cat proof balcony or normal access to outdoors). It should be possible for you to find a shelter that is willing to let you take a couple as indoor only, but I don't think you'll get around the cat net.   
Good luck and thanks for adopting shelter cats!!! There are so many cats in need of good homes.

			meloncollie and other posters are right, the problem of stray cats is a huge one in Switzerland. When I helped the stray cat (described earlier in the thread) I was calling around organizations to figure out how to possible get help with the vet bill and find a home for him. Only then did I gain insight into how enormous this problem is. Simply put, it pisses me off that intelligent animals like cats are left to their own devices like this. I spoke to a very nice woman at a larger organization that focuses on TNR (trap, neuter, release) and she said that most people in CH downright refuse to believe this is an actual problem. The popular view here seems to be that cats have a right to roam freely (if you neuter and vaccinate I'm ok with outdoor cats), have kittens at least once and if they are strays or ferals, hey, that's just in their nature!    
It's a paradox that cats are such valued companions, yet they're second class pets compared to dogs. Having had both, there is no difference in the bond and responsibility that goes into having a cat vs a dog. Cats should have more legal ""rights"" to protect them, like mandatory chipping for starters. But I could go on like thisÂ   Anyways, OP, adult shelter cats make for wonderful, grateful pets.

			Finella, is Birmensdorf too far away? It looks like a 20 minute drive, but I really don't know the area so my estimate could be off.   
If it's not too far, several people recommend Marcus Mouwen for Agility:     
(He's also a respected animal physiotherapist, btw)   
If it's too far you might write him anyway, ask for other suggestions closer to you.   
I'll keep an ear out for other possibilities.

			We've tried many different brands of dog food for our GSD, from the cheap and cheerful to the ultra expensive, because she has a fairly sensitive stomach.  A lot of foods make her sick or give her an upset stomach and extremely bad gas  , so as Meloncollie and PG have said, you just have to figure out what your own dog needs, regardless of the price of the food.

			I have had my horse for over 20 years, and now she is 32 years old.  Last summer 2013 my husband and I brought her to Switzerland after months of serious thought, planning, organization, and regular vet checks to see if there would be any health issues besides her age that we would need to take into consideration.  Now here in the pasture just outside of our apartment she is very happy, healthy and getting lots of attention. Seeing her happy here made all the work and personal sacrifice to cover the expense worth it.   
The process was greatly simplified by our shipping company, Equiflight, run by Katie Forest, who personally walked us through the entire process, step-by-step. I highly recommend her.  She is great to work with and was very patient to explain everything and answer our never-ending questions. Our horse was quarantined at her facility, and I felt so much better knowing that she was not just some agent, but that she was personally overseeing the care, quarantine, transportation, etc. of my horse.  Yes it was expensive, but not as much as I had imagined it would be.  It just depends on how important it is to you.   
I would be glad to explain the process in detail if it would be helpful to someone in a similar situation, but with regulations constantly changing, it may be even more helpful to contact Katie Forest directly.  I wish you and your equine friend the best!

They were unrelated, adopted about six months apart and slept together regularly until one died.  The other one cries for his lost ""brother,"" two years later.   
They did establish dominance occasionally, and the fur did fly, but spraying wasn't a problem.

My cats do have their own eating space high up on a table and Keira has her own spot down on the floor.  As for sleeping areas, my cats always sleeps with my daughter because she sleeps on a bunk bed.  I even bought them a 300sfr cat tree.  Thought maybe i'd spoil them a bit.

			I haven't found that. Some owners can be a bit miserable and it follows that therefore the dog is quite reserved too but we meet loads of friendly dogs. However we are in kanton zug where the dog rules allow dogs off the lead. I think it is one of the only kantons left where yiu can walk your dog off the lead in public places. I expect that makes a difference because if dogs are on the lead, out and about, all the time it does doesn't afford them much opportunity to be social. Come and walk in kanton zug!

Not much more I can add here as MC, our resident expert, has said it all, in her usual eloquent fashion. Except that our dogs eat grass when their stomachs are upset, this seems to cause them to puke and they feel better afterwards. But it is just grass, not dirt. Occasionally one dog will dig in the dirt if there is something very interesting under it. (once she found a bone buried in the garden.)   
Our eldest dog is almost 14, and she is taking Karsivan. She had back surgery a few years ago, and her problem now is the one of back legs is weak, so she is a bit wobbly. But she is not in pain. Karsivan is supposed to improve the circulation and improve the quality of life. (I have been wondering if humans can take it.  )   
Our youngest dog, who is almost 10, has severe arthritis in one of her back legs. The vet has prescribed Cosequin capsules but this dog has such a sensitive stomach that we are not sure if this is the right treatment. Arthri dog might then be an option.    
I think you have to trust you vet and your own instincts. Last week I met someone who has a dog going on 19!

Probably save money that way, since I can eat home and resist the urge to buy expensive cafe food or similar.

			Here is a summary of the Solothurn cantonal dog law, from the Tier Im Recht website:     
For all dogs:   .    
There is a general on-lead requirement in the forest in May and June, and in other places so signed.   
For the BLS breeds (Bullterrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Rottweiler, Dobermann, Dogo Argentino, Fila Brasileiro and all dogs crossed with these):        
Dogs of the listed breeds must always be on lead in public.    
---   
The actual text of the law is linked at the top of the TIR page.   
---   
There may be additional Gemeinde requirements, ask at Einwohnerkontrolle for specifics.

			I, too, find the 'oodle' craze very disturbing, as by far the majority of these dogs are unregulated breeding by folks with no understanding of what they are doing - and many are battery farmed, byb'd, the dogs are simply used as commodities. All to fuel a demand from naive buyers who think they are getting a 'designer dog' when they are simply paying silly money for a mutt.   
(See my link above to Wally Conron's statement of regret at coining the 'oodle' name.)    
Nothing wrong with a mutt, as I have said many times. I love mutts, I love all dogs of any and every flavor. But why line the pockets of unethical producers who breed for all the wrong reasons?   
And remember - one cannot guarantee the genetic characteristics in crosses, especially early crosses. So if one wants a curly coated, non-shedding dog... why not get a poodle? If one wants a fluffy dog, why not get one of the many poodle crosses sitting in shelters, waiting for their forever home?   
And again, to repeat for those seeking 'oodles' because of allergies:   
If you have severe allergies, you must test the individual dog you are considering buying/adopting, full stop. No breed or crossing can   a dog that will not trigger your individual allergies. You will need samples of adult hair, saliva, dander. Get the test done with your doctor.    
---   
I have a foster dog here, a poodle. It's funny to watch people's reaction to him.   
Strangers oooh and ah over him, asking ""Is he is a XYZ-oodle, isn't he gorgeous, what a lovely dog, what a delightful character, I want one just like him, where can I get one?    
When I say ""He's a poodle"" the next comment is usually ""Oh,   a poodle? What a shame.""   
Nowt so queer as folk.

			There are many nice areas in Dornach to walk your dog -- up in the woods, farming areas and even neighborhoods.   I can't comment on the Hundeschule as our dog is not a puppy.     
You can get to Novartis pretty easily via public transportation, but this will require about an hour via bus, train and tram.   Its similar for the ISB, where you need to go to the Dornach Bahnhof to get a bus that goes across to Reinach or Aesch and then a tram to the schools.     
It can be a bit of a hassle but it is very nice!

			I'm planning on flying my cat in within a couple of weeks, so I'm reviving this thread. Has anyone got any new information so far?   
I'm all up to date on paperwork and such (or I hope so), but the actual airport part is still a bit murky to me. I know that when I arrive in ZÃ¼rich I must take it to the ""goods to declare"" part. Since I will be coming from an EU country, I only need a paperwork check and not a full vet check, but does that mean I still have to pay a fee? (I read 80 CHF somewhere)   
What about the security checks before boarding, does the cat in the carrier go through the x-ray like the rest of the carry-on luggage (doesn't seem too healthy to me...) or do I pass it through the metal detector only?

			Not a license per se, but you are correct Lucy. Unlike what most of us are used to in our home countries, commercial (that is, paid) dog care is a regulated activity in Switzerland.    
A dog walker will need at a minimum to have done the SKN theory and practical courses. These are the same courses that all dog owners are required to do.   
(Have you recently acquired your dog, or recently moved to Switzerland, Croberts? If so, you need to do the course (or courses - this is the short version) yourself. Search for the term 'SKN' there are many threads explaining this requirement.)   
It only make sense that someone who is being paid to look after a dog be held to the same training standards as an owner.   
The requirement for the SKN courses applies to anyone caring for 5 or fewer dogs at a time. If one is caring for more than that, one needs more in-depth courses, the FBA or the Tierpfleger diploma, depending on what is offered. If caring for more than 5 dogs, the carer must be registered with the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt.   
---   
The above does not apply if the carer is not being paid. Friends may still do friends a favor.    
---   
It is the responsibility of the owner to ascertain that the dog carer is duly qualifed. Fines have been given out if a complaint is made and it is discovered that the carer is not in compliance.   
--- 
One should also ensure that a dog carer is duly insured against liability. Generally someone working in your home (which would include walking the dog) is covered under your Privathaftpflicht (in ZH and about half the cantons Privathaftpflicht/Liability insurance is mandatory for dog owners, the cover sum varies by canton), but one should check with one's insurance provider for the specifics of the policy. A carer who runs his/her own business, though, likely is not covered under your policy and would have to have his own liability insurance.     
Hope you find the person you need, Croberts.

			I have now adopted two dogs since living in Switzerland and it has been a very rewarding experience.  It is not always easy though, so I can't recommend highly enough all the required courses plus investing in further courses to become acclimated with all things doggy and the responsibilities that owning a dog in Switzerland entails.  These will build you up to be a wonderful dog owner and accepted by other fellow dog friends and owners.  We adopted from two different shelters and it was no problem, as we did take the ownership seriously.  We now have two wonderful furry companions and have met some very nice Swiss people through our ventures.  It is every day ""work"" but very rewarding ! Start reading up now and find out where you can best do the courses near where you live.

Certainly seems to me that the word, sometimes pronounced 'biatch', is often used in Rap-type music when simply referring to one's girlfriend, and has become part of the modern black-American dialect.   
In the UK it may be used as an insult, but rarely (unless in the last few years only) used in the above sense.

			Lappi, if you work through the forms referenced in the links that Medea provided, your cat MUST travel as manifest cargo - which means in the hold. You have no other option - so you might as well go Swiss, as they have a good reputation with animal transport.           
Additionally, see this about the captain's affidavit:       
You will need to keep this in mind when you plan your cat's travel. 
---      
I brought my dog into Hong Kong, but that was 20 some years ago, under a different regime, so my experience likely no longer is relevant.   
However, even back then the paperwork was complicated and the consequences of screwing up unbearable to think of. So I used a professional shipper to take care of the paperwork, plan the travel, troubleshoot, etc.  You might consider doing likewise if you are unsure of the process.

			Glad to hear that it's all sorted, Jamima.    
FYI, the course the ZH VeterinÃ¤ramt is referring to is the SKN Praxis (Practical) course, the federal requirement. You have 12 months from the date of entry to get that done.   
Just a comment - no vet should ever treat a client in the way you describe. Ever. The owner-vet-dog relationship needs to be a good one, you should feel that your vet supports you at all times. The relationship is as important as the vet's skills, as the interaction between vet and owner is critical to providing the care our pets need. Were it me, I'd be looking for another vet.   
If you post where in ZH you are, perhaps we can recommend other practices...     
ETA:   
Here is the database of recognized SKN trainers:     
Do you speak German?    
I'd recommend doing the classes as soon as you can, even though you have 12 months, as this is the best way to learn about expectations of dog ownership in Switzerland - but also a great way to meet new friends as you are finding your feet here.   
Good luck!

			My wife and I might be able to help as well. We have just moved to Fribourg with our little terrier, who could use a friend. I will be working, but my wife has not yet found a job, so she'll be at home a lot at first (I should mention, we have not actually found a place to live yet, but wherever we land will be dog friendly!) Will you need a sitter indefinitely? And what days/hours will it be? And where will you be moving from? And welcome!

			Understood - when it's a case of he said/she said, sadly, there seems to all too often be a reluctance to investigate on the part of some authorities.   
I wonder:   
If he is providing dog care in his home, under the TSchV he should have the appropriate credentials - which would be either the SKN courses if he is caring for fewer than 5 dogs (not including his own dogs) at a time, or the FBA or Tierpfleger diplomas if caring for more.   
I do know of one case of a local lady who had been offering holiday care in her home for decades but had never taken the SKN or any other course. Then one day she received a complaint from neighbors over barking. When the police came to speak to her about the complaint, in the course of the conversation it came out that she was running a Hundehort without the proper credentials. She was told that she must stop her holiday care business until she had completed the appropriate course.   
But this was in SZ, so who knows if the same would happen elsewhere...   
If he has a diploma as a groomer, though, that might be sufficient to cover the Ausbildung requirement - I'm not up on how the various animal related education courses fit together. Again, TIR could advise.    
If he is not declaring the income that is an issue for the tax office - but I have no idea if they would take an interest, or not.    
Again, good luck following through.

			I don't know if good and cheap go well together in this respect. The technique is rather easy to perform yourself, if you want as cheap as can be. All you need, as an outlay is a stripping knife. You can find them on google and they are not expensive. You can do it between your finger and thumb but with a bigger dog your hand will soon get sore. All you need to do is use the knife to ""cut"" but as something to hold the hair against as you pull it out in the direction the coat grows.    
Start at the neck and work down the back towards the tail, following the shape of the dog pull out the longer, bristle top coat, leaving the softer undercoat. It comes out rather easily. You just need to decide how you want the legs, chest and skirt. You can use scissors to blend this into the stripped part.    
Have a go! It can be funâ¦

The moths apparently all fly at more or less the same time, or at least within a very narrow window. They mate and then lay eggs on fresh box trees and then die within a few hours. They can smell box trees from miles away. So the spread of the moth or even its survival depends very much on what happens on these two or three nights. Heavy rain can prevent them from flying. Atmospheric conditions can prevent the odour of the box reaching them. If the flight of the moths coincides with increased bat activity, they also get decimated (bats love the box moths). So lots of factors can transpire to either decimate or help the next generation of caterpillars.

You mentioned that one of your cats came from another family where she was having problems. Did she have similar problems to Betty's (this is the kitty)? And how long do you think it might take to settle her in? Betty was with my friend for 5 months now, and my friend is not sure how long she has to be trying -- when this doesn't work, it is difficult not only for her but also for Betty. In general, based on your experience, how long would you consider trying to make the cat settled before thinking about another home for a her? Of course this probably depends on how bad the problem is and how much progress is made...

Dog ownership in Switzerland is not how I imagined it would be when we moved back here from Asia with our dogs. It's not the dogs, but rather their owners. The farmer over the road from me just doesn't see the need to keep his dog away from the sidewalk and everyone who is walking by with dogs. Last week his dog ran across the road when he saw me with our dogs.   
Then there are others who walk dogs off leash yet their dogs do not stick by their side but instead approach us. Of course the owner will say, he does nothing.    
Basically my rule is to avoid all dogs I don't know. We are lucky as our dogs have each other as companions and play together. We have a very large fenced garden. I appreciate that dogs need to socialize and play with other dogs but my advice is to be very selective.    
I have seen posts here where dog owners are looking for other dog owners to arrange play dates, walks, etc. Maybe worth looking into?

			You really cannot use the excuse that you do not wish your cat to be in pain as a reason for not neutering.    
If you prevent your cat from mating, the high levels of hormones raging will be driving him insane- emotional pain far worse than physical.  Also, this prolonged increase in hormonal levels and the stress that produces will eventually cause physical problems far worse than being sore for a day or two. Prolapses, cancers and other nasties will be awaiting in his older age. It's simply a no brainer not to have him done.

			Lucy, the penny just dropped that you are in ZH, with labs... who are list 1 dogs due to their size. Were the dogs born after 31 Dec 2010? If so, you'll have more training classes to do than just the federal SKN.  (Dog control is the competency of the individual cantons, and some go beyond the federal requirements. ZÃ¼rich is one such canton.)    
The good news, though, is that the ZÃ¼rich required Welpen, Junghund, and Erziehungs courses will also meet the federal SKN practical requirements.   
What courses you need to take depend on the age of the dog.  More from the ZH VeterinÃ¤mt:    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Sep 2006	Groaned at 18 Times in 17 Posts	Your SKN Theory Course Experience?	meloncollie	Posts: 7,687

It is the first time, in my life of dog ownership, which I can sincerely leave my pet and go away in peace. She is simply great and LOVES the dogs immensely. Super clean, super nice and super organized, for a small group of dogs. Naturally, Swiss qualified.  
Angela is living her dream by taking care of dogs and having her independence to live life, as she desires. Her prices are reasonable and her heart is of GOLD. Wonderful young woman!

			Hi All     
I know that this is an old thread but is there anybody keen to let my little Levi spend from the 26/06-08/07 with them? I live in PfÃ¤ffikon ZH and can give you all the info on Levi if someone is keen? He is still a 'toddler' but is house trained and looooves playing with other dogs and getting lots of love! I'm nervous to leave him at the kennels and would prefer a family of doggie lovers.

			There is def a big need, but regulations for dog walkers are quite different than for dog boarding (but from authorities and from possible landlords). We have a fantastic dog walker who also takes care of our mailbbox and appartment when we are not there. PM me if anyone is interested. 
Also would be very interested how your project is going, loubylou212?

			It's a shame you can't find a dog-sitter -- at least for a while when your sister is here, so that you can do things that wouldn't also have to allow the dogs to be there with you.   
I'm not sure if you'd be comfortable with that, but I've seen some threads on here from people offering dog-sitting services. Here is one regarding a pet-sitting network:       
And you'll also find other threads by doing a search here on the EF for ""pet sitting.""   
Good luck!

My chihuahua Catarina was fine until last year when we moved to Locarno. They have fireworks for everything! Now she even panics when she hears any kind of loud bang, like if someone in the construction site drops something, or a car misfires. I hate to see her so upset. I am not really sure how to help her. I act matter of fact when I hear a noise, so she doesn't react to me. She tries to run away and shakes like a leaf. If we are outside, she won't even poop. She just wants to go back inside. inside she shakes and follows me around. If I try to cuddle her, she keeps shaking and is restless, very alert waiting for the next bang.I am worried about the summer with all the events and festivals in the area.

But if not - or even if there is a small chance that you will leave within that timeframe - it would be best to wait until you know where your future is headed.   
If you know that you will be here for the duration, then why not adopt a homeless hamster?   
You'll find a list of homeless animals on the Switzerland-wide database here:       
For Tierart (type of animal), choose 'KleinsÃ¤uger' for a list of all the small mammals.    
A ZÃ¼rich area specialist rescue focusing on the small furries is the Nagerstation:     
These are good folks to speak to, especially for advice on issues relating to care of the species in Switzerland.

714	13.11.2011, 11:07	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 8 Times in 5 Posts	Location: Bern	"    Threads like these, posts like this, really hit home for me. I've bemoaned my trials with my dog and my mother enough that some who have been around a while know my feelings and my story.   
I came with the expectation that it was temporary and I'd go back to my dog, with the ability to bring her with me when it was permanent. I left her with my mother who didn't see her as a family member the same way I did, so when she had something come up, she left her with my brother and his wife who REALLY don't see dogs as anything close to how I see my Harri. So, it is with a hard heart these years that I've resigned myself to the fact of Harri not being here with me.   
I've also resigned myself (unwillingly, and mostly, but not completely without hope) to the very probable fact that I won't have a dog while I'm here. I can not have faith that any dog I get here will be able to go with me if / when we move and with the other things that have happened here, I just can not go through leaving another beloved behind.     
Meanwhile, by now, having had the fortune to come to this thread after dalingling has had the chance to explain about her dogs, I can see it is obvious that she made the choice to leave her existing dogs back in the US for their own good, rather than for her convenience.      
Dalingling, there are many pet shelters within communities, as well as (I believe) ""rescue"" places who look after specific breeds of dog. Also, near the borders, it seems (sorry if is unfair to say) ""particularly"" the French and Italian borders, there are dogs in desperate need of adoption as those countries seem to have different (less favorable for the animal) animal rights and protection laws in place. You may find your forever friend within Switzerland, or maybe just across the border  .   
So, good luck in finding a new member of your family who will fit with you and you them.

718	23.07.2010, 14:07	Junior Member	Thanked 73 Times in 17 Posts	Location: Aarau	   So glad to see that your pussy cat's arrived safe and sound after their long trip! We moved from Melbourne 14 months ago, and brought our cat with us too. We used Jetpets who were fantastic. And like your two, she sprung out of the cage and was so lovely and happy! Not what we were expecting at all!     I'm not sure of your long term plans, but just a heads up for you if you are returning to Australia with your cats. It will take about 5-6 months preparation before you ship them back! So ensure you get started as soon as you know you will return, or alternatively just make sure you keep their rabies shots done annually (In Switzerland they only need to do every 3 years).      We have to return back to Australia unexpectedly, and now our cat will require 150 days in Quarantine in Australia! The key is that you have to have the blood test for the Rabies antibody done and then your pet has to wait 3 months before they can travel, so they still have a minimum of 30 days in Quarantine... Good old Australia quarantine! Anyhow, we were aware of the Quarantine requirements, but we were not expecting to have to return suddenly, so we just like to let people know if they are not aware!  	earned some respect	Join Date: Jun 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	My 2 cats arrived from Australia today	chopper75	Posts: 59

			Travelling is freight is not as scary as it seems!   
My dog, a tiny puppy at the time, arrived in CH with us travelling as freight in a cargo plane.    
Animals go in a safe - pressurised and heated - part of the plane, and the handling conditions are very detailed and obey severe rules toward the wellfare of the animal. They can't stay on tarmac in heat/cold for instance, etc.   
There would be zero difference for your hamster to be in a cargo plane or in the hold/cabin of your own plane.

I moved from Vaud and had no problems - the cantonal vet trusts another vet to make the decision. Considering I met someone last week with a Cane Corso  Italian mastiff (not on the Valais list but is on the Geneva one!) they are seemingly not as restrictive ....   
Annabelle[/QUOTE]   
The two cases that were mentioned in the 20 minutes article -one a Doberman and the other a Mastiff were NOT examined by the Cantonal Vet. But the owners were given the ""get out"" letter based on the breed being on the exclusion list. According to the article, there have been only 9 exceptions to the law. I am not sure where your dog fits in.   
According to the Vallis Cantonal Vet (translated from the article) ""According to the legislation in effect, it is not possible to definitively import a breed of dog that is on the list for exclusion"". Seems pretty clear to me.

730	null	null	null	null	"    One of the things with Harri's (Harriet) remains was that I'd always wanted her here with me. A lot of things happened that made it impossible, despite the fact that I'd done everything I could to prepare her to come with me when I moved here. Once I was here, she never was in the same place as me the few times I made it back to the US - until December a year (and some) ago, when it was too late for her to come, due to age and health.   
Harri and I both had been living with my mother (who has poor health) for a few years before I came, so leaving her there, in a place that was her home, was not a horrible thing for her - she knew my mother and they loved each other. If I knew my mother would always be in her current house, I'd have been happy for my mother to bury her in the yard, which was what she'd wished. Alas, she hates the house, would leave it if she could. I did not want Harri's remains to remain in the yard, to be dug up by whomever may buy the house next.   
So. I'd thought to have Harri's ashes with me, until a time I can decide the ""perfect"" place to release her - hopefully with my mother at my side, so we can do it together.     
I wish you the best with your daughter's dog. Hopefully things work better (without arguments and stress over details of end of life care) and easier for you and your family and the dog as time goes on.

			Well, I was about to direct you to shopping across the border when I checked current prices... and was surprised to find a bargain in Switzerland.   
Just pulling one example out of the hat, Orijen, one of the premium high meat content grain-free foods, is CHF 105 for a 13kg bag from Editrust in Switzerland. From Zooplus.de, a german supplier, Orijen costs 89 Euros for the same sized bag. That's slightly less expensive in Hochpreisinsel Schweiz - well knock me down with a feather!   
I guess I'll have to double check my assumptions more often.    
I feed Magnusson, Lily's Kitchen, occasionally Orijen to one of mine, and Terra Canis wet food. (The last is indeed quite a bit less expensive in Germany - likely because it is a German product, whereas the Orijen is shipped from Canada to both countries.) I figure on spending around CHF 100-120 per 13-15 kilo bags, obviously more per kilo if I buy in smaller quantities. The most expensive I've come across is Ziwipeak which is CHF 114 per 5 kilos ( ) but because it's an air-dried meat product 5 kilos goes a very long way - it works out to be not much more than normal premium prices.    
So - you should have your choice of premium food in the CHF 7-9 per kg range.   
As to where to buy it - the two big chains are Fressnapf and Qualipet, but neither stock the better known premium brands, although both carry own brands. (Not sure about grain free, though...)    
Meiko ( ) carries Magnusson as well as some other brands, Editrust ( ) carries Orijen, Arcana, and similar, Goldenway ( ) -  I think all deliver Switzerland-wide. I'm not familiar with retailers in the Romandie, hopefully someone from that side of the country will post soon. There are other independent retailers carrying specific premium brands - write the manufacture to find a distributor in Switzerland, or post here for suggestions. You can also order from Zooplus' french site ( ) for delivery into Switzerland.

			We didn't have any particular problem finding a large ground floor flat with a small garden near open countryside that would accept our two dogs, but we were fairly flexible about location (the OHs 25 minute commute is horrifyingly long according to his co-workers...)   
We also benefitted enormously from the services of an excellent relocation agency who did most of the legwork for us once we'd given them our need/want list, so if your employers offer that as part of your package, do make full use of it.

			Hi all,   
I am in need of an in-home cat sitter for my two boys from April 12-23. I live in the center of Luzern, about a 5 minute walk from the bahnhof. They are a year old, very playful and affectionate. I would set a timed feeder throughout the day but would ask that you come once per day to feed them wet food, clean the litter, and give them some love and attention! They are indoor only, and they normally do pretty well when I'm away.   
If you are interested and available, please PM me.

			I mentioned that to emphasise I need a good diaper to protect the dog for long time. 
It is not related to that thread. But the dog is in Turkey yes.  
The story is, I saw a post on Facebook asking for a volunteer. Only one person responded. She will help the dog with physio therapy. There is a hope that dog can walk in the future.  
Other option was to stay at the cold goverment shelter (which is really not a good place). The dog had the surgery, that's why he is at vet now. If only the dog was treated in time.. 
I am happy to know you are experienced, so I can learn from you, get advices. Since the volunteer doesn't have experience with the dogs and I am not experienced with disabled dogs. I am not involved in any rescues but I am in love with stray dogs.

			Refer to this website for any info you need for bringing your pets here.  It's the Federal Veterinary Office's website:       
Do note however, that there are very few, if any, catteries like the ones in the UK.  Here all the cats tend to be kept together in one large enclosure rather than in separate kennels.  So you might be better off checking on the forum here for people who pet sit at your home or someone you could arrange a pet sitting exchange with so that the risk of any possible injury or sickness is reduced as your cat won't be used to mixing with others.

			Hello, 
I have a two years old beagle and would need someone to take care of from April 16 to May 2. I live in Staefa and I have a fenced large garten. I am looking to swap dogs (I can take care of other dogs before or after that period) or eventually a dog sitter (would pay for it). 
If someone is interested pls PM. 
Thank you, 
Clara   
P.S. Sorry that I am not using the pet sitting network but did not have a good experience with it.

			I live in Basel and would love to look after your dog. I am away until April 26th but could have him from 27th if you know someone in the interim. I had a gorgeous poodle/yorkie/dachshund cross until last November when she passed away and I really miss having a dog around. I was a registered dog owner which I think is one of the recommended things when looking for a pet sitter. I would be happy to help for free.

			Thank you so much, that really answered my question. I haven't had any contact with the manager, only briefly the assistant manager and the rest of the contact and talks have been with the staff, mostly interns. That definately wont help my case. The application didnt ask very many questions at all so I will actively seek the manager and address all those things when I go again tomorrow.

I have found and interviewed a woman out of Zurich. She is very thorough and our dogs seemed quite comfortable with her. We haven't gone away yet, but will be toward the end of this month and will likely book her services. I REALLY miss our pet sitter from the US, but I think this woman is very nice and hopefully will be a good fit. Her name is Angela and, I believe, her company is called Royal Cat Dog and House Sitting.

I have heard others mention this problem as well.    
In Canton Aargau there is a leash law in effect.     
The Hundegesetz covers the instances in which your dog must be leashed. Other areas will have a sign posted if this is a requirement.

			Im not sure if this helps but have you looked at           
and of course asked your vet who can advise ?     
Just my opinion but will your Dogs manage the long drive and also if they got sick what is the standard and cost of vetinary care out there ?     
Is it in their best interest to be with you ? or in your best interest to have them with you ?     
Best wishes

			Hi I just flew with my dog to the States in Nov (for a long holiday) and back to Zurich in Jan.  She was also in-cabin with me and honestly, no one knew I had her with me the entire time!  <<Bother to the US and back to Switzerland.  I had to keep offering the fact that I had a dog in my bag...  and hey, here dont you want to check my paperwork!   
Checking in at the airport.. I showed her EU Pet Passport and a health certification I got from her vet within 10 days of the flight.  They weighed her and the bag to make sure we were under the limit.  And, confirmed payment for her.   
Walked through security and screening - no one cares about her papers.   
Walked onto the plane - no one ever asks about her papers again.  I have boarded a plane three times w her and never once did anyone ask.  But they might not have noticed her in the carrier either.   
Going through customs in Washington Dulles - no one asks about her papers.  In fact, I carried her in my arms as customs officials ask how my trip was etc.   
It was a similar experience on the way back from USA > Switzerland.  I just had to go to USDA to get extra certification on her health certificate which again no one bothered to ask me for.  I offered the documentation that was so painful to get.  (A three hour drive to the closest APHIS office in Richmond VA and another three hours back home... days before my flight!)   
Hope this helps.  Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions.   
PS - A great tip is to let a (friendly) flight attendent know you have the pup w you.  I did this on the way home, and the attendent gave me a whole row to myself since there was room!  He and some of the other lady attendents kept asking if the pup was ok.  He even told me if it werent for some of the snotty attendents (hehe his words!) and probably air safetly regulations - he would let me hold her out of the bag.  They helped me to the biggest bathrooms on the plane for me to bring pup in w her potty pads to do her business and stretch.  We had a great experience!   
Best of luck w yours!!   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Need info on taking my dog back to USA	dvincent	Posts: 11

			Heads up for dog owners in Spreitenbach AG:   
Four dogs have died in the Spreitenbach area. There is a suspicion of poisoning, but it must be stressed that poison has not yet been established as the cause of death:       
Remembering the Honng case of a few years ago, where early suspicions of malicious poisoning turned out to be toxicity due to fertilizer made from grape production, it would be wise not to panic.    
But it would also be prudent to take steps to protect your dog if you walk in the area. Do not allow your dogs to eat anything on the ground, and as always,   At the first sign of symptoms (shaking, drooling, muscle weakness, respiratory distress, collapse) call your vet immediately.

As an experienced dog owner, I am sure you will figure out what is up with Rookie. I hope the vet rules out anything serious. I was thinking, could it be that he misses your daughter's visits with Lilly and when he hears the door, or sees a pedestrian he is just excited because he thinks it might be them visiting?    
There are different kinds of barking, as I am sure you know. It took me a while to figure this out, but it is also, though not always, associated with body language.

			Yes, I mean some dogs that are accepted in the EU, are not in Switzerland. Such as dogs that have been modified for their appearances, such as clipping the ears on Dobermans and cutting off the tails on other dogs. It is really something that should have been looked into well before even moving here.

			Stop feeding your cat. It's much more likely that the rendered/artificial stuff in the pet food is responsible for the vomiting with the mouse just not sitting well on top so that's what you see. A mouse is a whole food for the cat - nutritionally perfect and I can't quite believe your cat can't digest it. Perhaps if he's hungry, he'll take smaller bites. And hell, if he's hungry enough the vomit will be cleared eventually.

			Some of the information in that last post was helpful. If the community thinks that's the tone it wants... it will quit being a resource but for a few. As for the course, I have not taken it, since it was not required of me when we moved here with my beloved dog that died in September.

I guess you are right since we have lots of farms around. Had it not been for my vet who confirmed that it is a wild cat, I would have rather gone for a cross breed dating back a long time ago. Still the bushy tail, the rings, the black tip of the tail and the unusual long canines made me wonder.

785	30.09.2013, 01:06	Forum Legend	Thanked 16,111 Times in 5,288 Posts	Location: SZ	"    IMO, the HHB  would be the easiest for a 'normal' pet dog to pass.      
It has a few elements similar to a WT, such as the 'Begegnungen mit auffÃ¤llig gekleideten Menschen' and 'Begegnung mit einem anderen Hund' that can be tricky for reactive or fearful dogs, though. Such exercises are more a test of the dog than the owner, which I see as a failing. It's the owner's skill in managing his dog in a given situation, as well as understanding of his responsibility, that needs to be assessed.   
BH1 is the next easiest, and IMO more fun for dogs who think like mine, but requires much more specific training than the HHB. BH is a sport - some of the exercises go well beyond 'normal' dog ownership. Here's a decent explanation:     
Obedience (GehorsamkeitsprÃ¼fung) skills are not that difficult to acquire, but to do these things to the standard required is.  The judging is so very technical (for instance, if the dog's nose breaks in front of the handler's knee during a heel points are lost...) that it's difficult for 'everyday pets' to pass - and not too many owners are motivated by this type of handling. IMO, there are other certifications that are more relevant to everyday pet life.   
Most of the other PrÃ¼fungen are specialized skills requiring significant training.   
---   
I still maintain that the best way to ensure public safety and promote responsible ownership is to require ongoing attendance at a Hundeschule - Familienhund classes, for instance - throughout a dog's life, rather than a one-shot PrÃ¼fung. Continual training keeps me on my toes, keeps me aware of my responsibilities, and makes me a better owner. And it's fun for my dogs.   
Are these tests relevant? Hmmm...    
Hooligan, who is very well trained, would have trouble even with the HHB if the stooge dog used was a GSD. (A GSD attacked and very badly injured her, leaving her reactive to the breed. We have worked on this for years, but some fear remains.) But understanding her reactivity, I am a responsible owner. Hooligan is on lead in public, and I do not allow her to get into situations where she might become fear reactive.    
Hooligan passed her HHB with flying colors, by the way, despite her reactivity. We got lucky on the test day and drew a stooge dog of another breed. But nonetheless, having the HHB certificate does not mean that the steps I need to take as a responsible owner in everyday life can be relaxed.

The study emphasised that it was not because labs are more aggressive than other dogs, but simply because they are the most populare breed. So the sheer number of them explains why there's more bites reported.

Terra Canis is a good wet-food alternative as well - bio, fully disclosed sources, ethical production, grain free, from a small producer in Germany.   
Neither of these, however, fulfill the primary motivation for raw feeding. But since the discussion has strayed to non-raw, I just thought I'd throw this info out there.

			I don't have any experience of kennels other than the only time I sent my beloved dog to one in the west Island in Montreal. It was for only a couple of days and my dog had lost an important amount of weight. He was with an other dog who was clearly the dominant and didn't allow him to eat food. The owner told us he couldn't guaranty and watch the dogs eating to make sure they all had their part.    
My dog died in the fire of my apartment 7.5 years ago. I can truly understand how the owners will feel to find out the way their family members passed. Even now, thinking about it still bring me tears...   
My hearts goes out to them.

We did alot of traveling before we got a dog, by the time we got the dog we were ready to settle. We had been different places but never really explored Europe.    
Its very easy to bring him anywhere with us in Europe. So many pet friendly places.    
Its only if we go away for a weekend (Flying somewhere) that we leave the dog & before we book any flights we call the person who would care for our dog! It only happens once a year . . twice if there is some emergency at home.

			My dogs live in Ireland. The OES needs a lot of space and walking time(5 hours per day). I don't have enough open space nearby in ZH, my house in Dublin backs onto a 1700 acre park..     
I already knew that this handling permit involves a course as my friend had to do one recently even though he had dogs most of his life(think they were in his parents name). I will see what I can do about this permit/ training, if someone wants a dog walked please PM me and we can try to arrange something. I don't have a permit but I love dogs and can manage the needs of large or small dogs.

			Good evening...   
""If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man."" said Mark Twain...   
I know that Switzerland might not be the ideal country to have a dog (taxes, special rules, neighbors, etc.),  
but maybe there is among you anyone who want to save an innocent soul. 
In Romania the dogs are condemned to certain death and not by methods known to you but by some extremely cruel and painful ones. 
So, if anyone can provide temporary shelter or permanent please, but please, consider the following:           
PS: Sorry, it's only in German but Google can provide a pretty good translation!   
Thank you very much!!!

			I believe that form is only for importing animals who do not meet import conditions.    
Is there any reason why your dog would not meet the standard import conditions? (Such as unable to be vac'd due to medical reasons, etc.)   
If your dog already has a pet passport with a valid rabies vac (and the waiting period has been observed if vac'd for the first time) you should be good to go.    
That your dog originally came from Canada is irrelevant. If he was legally imported into Germany and has lived with you in Germany he is 'German'.   
But as always, go directly to the source - call or write the BVet with questions. They will respond to mail in English.   
---     
LivingInSwiss, I am surprised that the person you spoke to at the BVet was so unhelpful. Hopefully you just got hold of a clueless telephone operator. I would suggest always writing to them - not only will the mail be forwarded to the responsible person who has the answers, but it's always good to have a paper trail.

			Yes, incidents are on the rise. A sad sign of the times.   
I would recommend that all dog owners regularly train the 'leave' command - and better yet, regularly train your dogs never to eat food from the ground, never to accept food from another person. (Offering adulterated treats is also a favorite poisoning tactic.)    
Not an easy thing to do, especially when you have Hoover Hounds like mine. But worth working on.   
We often do 'ignore the sausage on the ground' exercises at our Hundeschule, in order to teach the dogs just that.     
Put the dog in the heel position or on short lead if necessary, walk by a plate with kibble on it - keep your dog's attention on you, offer an even better treat when he ignores what is on the ground. Repeat a million times, varying your speed, direction, left/right side heel, etc. Next try hiding the kibble in unexpected places as you walk by.  Once your dog can reliably ignore kibble on the ground do the same with a higher value treat, repeat. Continue in the same vein until what is on the ground is super high value (like a sausage).   
Do this on your own along your favorite walking trails and in your garden. The more you reinforce the fact that things on the ground must be left alone and that food only comes from you, the safer your dog will be.   
There is a special place in hell for those who harm animals...

			Looking on one website at the ads in German for those looking for properties to rent, it is clear that many desperately searching for housing are pet owners. Some have many more pets than I can imagine any landlord wanting to accept. Some have very limited budgets.    
Looking for pet-friendly housing is about making compromises.  
As long as you are prepared to do that, you will find a property.    
Pet owners who are landlords understand that two dogs might be better than one. Two dogs are not alone, they have each other. One dog, if left home alone, can be very lonely and bored. This can lead to other problems, like excessive barking.   
As your move is a long way off, if you are considering getting the second dog, I would do so now. The reason I suggest this is that it may be more difficult to amend the supplementary agreement to your lease for keeping pets from one dog to two. If an owner does not allow pets, 1 dog is one too many. If a dog is okay, two should not be a problem. More than two starts to get complicated.

			I am not going anywhere for Christmas this year and would love to help, if you are sure your cat would only go potty in his own potty (my place is carpeted). Would he be happy to stay in one room all day while also getting lots of petting and talking to ( I like cats, as long as they are totally potty-trained)? Does he cry if left alone for a few hours or does he just sleep? How much would you pay and what are the dates during which you need him to be sat?  Do you have a cage to transport him in case I need to take him along with me, so as not to leave him alone too long? I live in Thalwil. Would that suit you? 
Kind regards, 
Isabel

			Many thanks to all who replied and especially for the detailed post and links from Meloncollie. We are not sure of the breed, she comes from Spain, but is so mixed the Vermittler also had no idea. 
I had to laugh at the pee of joy idea! I did have the feeling she was so happy to see the kids that she just couldn't help it, and was overcome by worry and fear and happiness all at once. Of course, I can't judge the reality in such a short time though. 
I don't think we could afford a trainer, but we have a good vet, and I think she would have some ideas for us. 
We will go see the dog again, and walk her just with the our dog and see what happens. I have asked the woman who has her if we could take her over the weekend to see how things go, and she was open to it. My theory is that if our other dog is going to sulk we will find out then, and if the peeing is out of control, I would rather know it ahead and then make a choice. 
We will give our vet a call as well, also because she needs to be spayed. 
I will post again after we've seen her again.

First, you really should start your own thread, as your question has nothing to do with boarding in the Zurich area.     
Second, have you taken the SKN Theory course? This is federal law, it must be done before you acquire a dog. So get that done first... And you will likely find that the course answers many of your questions - or the course will help you focus on issues you should consider to determine what kind of dog is right for you, information that is needed before anyone can answer your question sensibly.   
If you need info on the course, just search for 'SKN', there are many threads on the subject. FYI, you'll find the database of SKN trainers on the BVet website.   
Good luck with your search!

			Yes, absolutely Peg.  We were taught the right way to use it with the trainer.  Don't spray with other dogs or people around, or situations you don't want the dog to be afraid of or they will become afraid of those things.  You have to be very careful and aware when you use it.  And we always reward with good behavior and move on.

			Thanks for all your answers. I am just so surprised at the price here, I mean in Ireland, its 150 to 200 Euro, nearly 3/4 times the price here. She is small dog, a border terrier and doesn't have an behavioral issues, other than chewing a couple of the kids toys when they are occasionally left around. Anyhow, we are getting this done as it becomes near impossible to plan holidays back home knowing she may be in heat when we are away. We were going to get the op done in Germany, but have decided against it. Going to try and ring around, our vet is actually Dr. Johr, who my husband thinks is very good, but there is a huge difference between 600 and 900 CHF?? thanks again

I am very interested in a dog swap.  I have been currently doing a dog swap with another American couple and it is working out great.  The only thing is that they are out of town when we need them to watch our black Lab in June.  I am very interested in meeting you if you are still interested.  I live in Meilen and stay at home so I have a lot of time to devote to the dogs. Please send me a PM if you are interested.

			Several articles of the TSchV (and related legislation) have been revised - these changes are set to go into effect on 1 Jan 2014.   
The text of the revised law is here:     
The changes are explained here:   
Click on 'Revision Tierschutzverordnung: Die wichtigsten Ãnderungen fÃ¼r Heimtierhaltende'   
To give a very rough translation of bits that affect most of us in the summary linked above: (And those whose German is better than mine, please correct me where I have made mistakes.)       
Keeping dogs in kennels (Art. 70 Abs. 2 / Art. 72) 
Dogs do not have to be kenneled in pairs anymore.  As long as there is appropriate visual, auditory and olfactory contact with other dogs they may be kenneled in adjoining enclosures.       
Ban on all collars that inflict pain (Art. 73 abs. 2)   
Because new types of collars have been developed to circumvent the ban on prong collars, this loophole has been closed. All collars or 'guiding aids' which cause pain are forbidden, and the use of choke collars without a stop is explicitly forbidden.   
Private Schutzhund training (Art. 74)   
Previously Schutzhund training was allowed only for the army, police, border guards and dogs competing in organized sport. The law did not address the training of dogs used by private security services, now private Schutzhund training is included.    
Training hunting dogs with live animals (Art. 75)   
Previously the use of live animals was only allowed in training 'ground hunting' (my note: 'Baujagd', I think this means scent hunters - anyone more familiar with the sport please correct me), in livestock guardian training, and in herding dogs. Now it will be allowed in training wild boar hunting and in retrieving. Direct contact between the dog and animal used in training is forbidden - the only exception will be when it is essential to the training or testing of the dog. The wild animal must be allowed to retreat to cover. Training grounds where live wild animals are used are subject to approval of the cantonal authorities.   
Prohibition of devises that prevent noise or the expression of pain (Art. 76)   
Devises designed to prevent an animal from making noise or expressing pain are forbidden, with the exception of those attached to a collar that emit a blast of air or water. No other such devises, such as those emitting an scented essence, may be used.   
--- 
My note: Electric shock collars, citronella or lemon collars, acoustic collars are still banned for the general public. The use by licensed professionals remains regulated by the canton. 
---       
Animal shelters or animal care services such as dog sitters, dog walkers or people who take in animals while owners are on holiday, need a cantonal license as soon as they care for more than 5 animals. The carer's own animals are not counted in that number. Breeders and rescue organization selling/rehoming a large number of animals per year require a permit from the canton. (The exact numbers are stipulated in 101.c.1-7)   One will need the appropriate training course or diploma to be granted a permit as an animal carer. Pet owners are reminded to ask for the cantonal permit when you give your animal into the care of someone else.   
--- 
My note: For shelters or other commercial providers of animal care who care  for max 5 animals, it is enough that the responsible person possesses 'the requisite training'. This is quite a change from current regs (for instance, I'm assuming 'verlangte Ausbildung'  means the SKN for dog carers) and I would urge those of you offering/using pet care to clarify this with the BVet.  
---   
There is also a revision to the articles governing keeping horses, but since that is a specialist topic I'll leave those interested to read for themselves.   
Again - these changes are not set to go into effect until 1 Jan 2014.     
Animal welfare legislation (at the federal level) and animal control legislation (at the cantonal level) are both subject to change. Pet owners and pet carers should keep this in mind.

			Hi everyone!     
I am looking for someone in Geneva who could stay with my 6 year old, neutered cat from the 18th of December to the 2nd of January.  I have a very low budget so I would greatly appreciate and prefer a swap, meaning I would return the favor in your future holidays.  Please let me know if this interests anyone!   
Regards, 
Ana

			I'm sorry for your cat, and for your family VC.    
I agree that the driver should have stopped, thankfully your neighbor stepped in and did what could be done. We've witnessed such a hit-and-run of a cat before, we were a few car lengths behind. M-i-l stopped and we picked up the cat in a warm coat then went round to a few nearby buildings to ask where the nearest vet office was. The cat was wearing a (""break-away"") collar with one of those capsules on it which holds a slip of paper so you can write the details for home and vet also, so the vet office where we took it called the owner and the cat's usual vet.

			Not really, I can' t take any dog to my place. But in cases such as when the dog is ill and need to be watched constatnly or its a puppy and you just have to be away too long time, or its a dog lady thats about to give a birth, than I can come and stay longer at peoples places. I know myself sometimes things happen, you wouldn' t expect like an accident and than nobody at work woud give you day off 'just because of a dog'.

This is a great place to go to with kids. It's also nice for adults.    
It's got nice walks through orchards right by the lake, restaurant, food shops, goats, rabbits, chickens, pumpkin exhibition, playground, etc...   
I find it far more interactive than the Kinderzoo, which I like too.

			Hi, 
Right, guinea pigs and rabbits should not be paired together (although they are at animal shops). First, some diseases that don't give symptoms in rabbits can be transmitted to g. pigs, which will be sick. It's rare events, but unnecessary risk. Second, g. pigs and rabbits don't understand each other and won't benefit from the company, compared to that of a ""species friend"".   
There's NOT a shortage of g. pigs in switzerland! I know many people how work with rescuing g. pigs and other animals, they are lucky to find somone who'll take care of baby g. pigs (babies are more attractive than the adults). Thay have a really hard time to find someone who'll take in older animals. The sad reality is that many older animals are put down, even though they are healthy, because there's no space for them anywhere. Animals are handed in to the vet to be put down because ""the children got tired of them"". Live, older animals are, not unfrequently, found left outside in the cold/in garbage rooms/outside the shelter house etc. The problem is rather to find responsable people to take care of the animals for their whole lives (which can be up to 10 years).    
The animals in most abundance is adult, castrated males, as there can be only be one male (and several females) in a herd. A castrate is actually an excellent company for a single female, often it works better than 2 females together.    
I suggested craci.org before, also SPA centers in switzerland sometimes get g. pigs, it's worth to give them a call. Unfortunately, I don't know of other organizations in german-part of switzerland. Also, sometimes people ""donate"" single animals on pages like tutti.ch, I don't like this business but it's better for the animals to pair them up.... Where do you live? 
I've adopted one older (4 y) male before here in switzerland, and now I have 3 newly adopted - 1 older and 2 younger.   
Have you also tried asking to ""borrow"" a castrated male as company for a few years? Some adoption places allow this, you can give the male back if you don't want to keep it when the female passes away. With males, this often works ok, as males often are more adaptable than females.   
Good luck

			First, looking at the lawâ¦   
From the ZÃ¼rchertierschutz:     
""Auch ist es nicht erlaubt, Hunde tagelang im Auto warten zu lassen (z. B. wÃ¤hrend der Arbeitszeit). Bei lÃ¤ngerer Aufenthaltszeit des Hundes im Auto gilt dieses nÃ¤mlich als Boxe, deren PlatzverhÃ¤ltnisse aber nicht den gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Mindestabmessung entsprechen.""    
Roughly:   
Leaving a dog all day long in a car (for instance, during work hours) is not allowed.  Leaving a dog in a car is deemed to be the same as leaving him in a crate/box, where the space does not meet the minimum legal size.   
Here is the law that ZÃ¼richtierschutz is referring to: Note that the federal animal welfare law does not directly ban leaving a dog in a car, but rather sets out requirements for the minimum space a dog must have in any kind of kennel. ZÃ¼rich Tierschutz interprets the law on kenneling to apply given the length of time the dog is left in the car.       
See Art. 72. Boden, Unterkunft (p. 24) and  Anhang1, Tabelle 10, Haushunde (p.92.)   
---   
OK - So what should be done?   
First, do you believe the dog to be in immediate mortal danger? Anytime there is a reasonable suspicion of immediate mortal danger one shoud act immediately - which means calling the police in the first instance, or Tierschutz. But first one should take responsible steps to ascertain whether 'immediate mortal danger' applies or not.    
A car in a garage is usually not as dangerous as a car left outside, but garages can still get too cold or too hot, resulting in danger of heat stroke or freezing, ventilation can be a problem even in safe temperatures. Leaving a dog in a car where the temperatures are too hot or cold and pose an immediate risk to the animal can be an act of 'Tierqualerei', which (depending on the details of the case, of course) can be punishable under the animal welfare law.    
However - if the dog is not in immediate mortal danger, it is best to take a more measured approach. Speak to the dog owner first, explain your concerns.     
If the dog is indeed safe and seems happy in the car, do not go to the authorities before talking to the owner.  Remember, the goal is to help the dog and owner find a solution. Unless an animal is in immediate mortal danger, one usually has a better chance of making a positive change if one approaches concerns as a friend ready to help rather than with condemnation.  For the sake of the animal, again barring immediate mortal danger, it is usually more effective to work with the dog owner than against him.   
Find out exactly how the car is set up.    
(I know people who have gone to great lengths to design their cars boot space specially for their dogs, with safe ventilation and heating/cooling, sleeping and play areas, some cars are roomy enough, etc. Not every car is 'just a box'. But the issue of compliance with 455.1 still remains. If the car complies with 455.1, if temperature/ventilation is deemed to be safe, then under the law there is likely no grounds for action.)     
Find out the reason the dog owner is doing this. For instance, it's not uncommon that landlords forbid tenants from leaving a dog unattended in a flat. The owner might not be allowed to leave the dog at home.    
Once you know the why, once you have ascertained that leaving the dog in the car does not comply with 455.1, then offer to help find a dog care solution that addresses that reason, such as a Hort or other day care provider or a dog sitter who would stay in the flat. Do you know  of a good day care provider? Do you know of someone who could care for the dog in the owner's flat if a Hort is not appropriate for this dog? If you don't, could you help your friend find someone?      
Focus on helping to find a solution. What you don't want to do is to invoke the law leaving the owner with no alternative, possibly forcing him to give up the dog. That won't help the dog, which is what this is all about. Yes, 'Gesetz ist Gesetz', but the day to day reality of animal welfare work is all about protecting the animal first and foremost - which often means working quietly to help the owner rather than blazing in brandishing the law.   
---   
Whenever one has concerns about a animal related situation, once can always ask the relevant Tierschutz organization for advice, or ask Tier Im Recht. Best to proceed from fact - and these are the folks who know the laws, who can best advise re: practical solutions.   
---   
Good for you for caring - and I hope a solution can be found. Paws crossed, thumbs pressed.

			I really do hope that this law is not passed.   
I have no issue with using a short lease in public-  however I really do not like the idea of the muzzle. Our dog will not like it one bit and it will take a lot of time to get him used to it.   
Hopefully common sense will prevail

			So, an update -    
We called Dr. Serban, and he referred us to a vet clinic in Ecublens ( ), very close to where we live, in fact.   
As expected, and as the first vet told us, there wasn't anything that could be done for our really sick rat, and we had to have her pts last week. We are so sad to lose her. She was a funny little monkey who never stopped running around, exploring and getting into troubles when she was out of her cage. Our place is so quiet without her!   
After a medication change, our other rat is doing better. We will give her a bit more time to be sure her health is okay, and then work on finding her a new companion (or companions).   
Upon some reflection, I don't want to give any future readers the impression that the first vet clinic was not good (as you may figure out where we went!). Maybe it is just a case of a different approach and we wanted to ask more questions or try something else. Plus, the responses we've gotten from other people about this clinic have all been favorable!    
The new clinic, however, was quite good, and as they are much closer to us, we will probably continue going there.    
Thank you to all the responses and suggestions that were posted here; I appreciate them very much!

			If you walk at Brunaupark, then continue along the Sihl, the skate park and the football fields. You can't hear the shooting range at all along there, there are sealed paths and it's almost entirely dog-friendly (except one small area that's ""Hundefrei"". There's a little kiosk called Ricci's where dog walkers gather for a coffee or a Wurst. :-) You can walk all the way to Adliswil along the river.

			Yes, a certain amount of moping after a move is normal.  As long as they are still eating and drinking, don't worry about it. They'll settle in in a few days.     
Did the coop come with the chickens?  If not, keep them shut in it and don't let them out for at least three days - they need to learn where ""home"" is so that they find their way back to it when they do go out.   
How old are they - I'm assuming full grown?  Hens, roosters or some of each?   
They need water.  A plastic bucket is OK, try to get one that's about chicken-head-height.  Won't hurt them if they have to stretch a little to get a drink, and the taller and heavier it is the less likely they are to knock it over or scratch food and straw into it.  The water should be changed every day.  In winter you'll need to go down first thing in the morning and break the ice off it, top it up with hot water.  I also used to feed them a hot breakfast on winter mornings (just their regular food with a bit of hot water poured over it, like a sort of chicken porridge - they go nuts for it.)   
Food - I second the recommendation to get some more pellety stuff if you can.  Don't know what's available here though.  They also need some grit (e.g. ground oyster shells) or small stones like you'd put in an aquarium.  You can just scatter a couple handfuls of this around their yard, they'll find it and pick it up as they need it.   
They will eat all sorts of kitchen scraps - well, almost all sorts. Mine hated bananas.  They'd take an experimental peck and immediately start wiping their beaks on the side of my shoe(!) trying to get rid of the nasty stuff.  But potato peelings, onion tops and tails, anything like that... also meat scraps.  And they will   stale bread.  Feed it to them by hand and you've got a friend for life.   
If you have hens they need a place to lay their eggs.  A good nesting box should be big enough for the hen to turn around in but not much larger.  It should be up off the floor (maybe a foot off the floor) and open in front, closed on top, back and sides.  Put some straw or wood chips in it, which they can then arrange to their satisfaction.  One nesting box is enough for four or five hens.  They'll probably find it and start using it on their own, but if you do keep finding eggs in odd places, pick them up and put them in the nesting box.  This time of year, an extra day or two won't hurt them (eggs will keep at room temperature for several weeks) and the hens will start laying there once they see other eggs there.   
Oh, and they need to be shut in at night - summer   winter - to keep them safe from foxes, neighborhood cats, etc.  They'll go in by themselves around dusk, you just need to count heads and shut the door.  If one or two are hanging around outside you can gently chivvy them in.   
I'm so jealous.    Have fun!

			We require a dog/house sitter from 11 December 2013 until 2 January 2014.  
We live in an apartment with a small garden, just off the main street in Rolle, Vaud - a 15 min walk to the strain station or a 1 min walk to the closest bus stop. Train/Bus every 30 mins to either Geneva or Lausanne.    
We have two, mature Jack Russels that needs a daily walk and some love and attention.    
If anyone is available and interested, please PM me.    
Thanks

			I found it in a plant about 10 minutes ago, it was completely still and not moving. I moved the plant around until it fell out onto the gravel. It wasn't moving at all so I moved it into the breeding tank and gave it some food. One of it's eyes is completely red, not the eye itself but the bit around it. It moved around a tiny bit, more like twitching when I put the food in there but now it's just lying there.

You say you have a small apartment - just to let you know that animal law stipulates that you need to have at least a 2.5 room apartment for a cat, with an extra room for every extra cat. You should also have a litterbox for every cat and it is not recommended to have a solitary cat that is not allowed outside if you are not at home for at least six hours every day. Being at home asleep doesn't count. I don't know who checks this but just thought I'd let you know, especially if you are considering a move.

			Sorry about your sisters dog and thank you for the post.   
Just to mention to other owners of fast eaters, there are dog bowls out there to slow them down. They have round protrusions sticking up in the bowl (like hills) which stops the dogs putting their face in to hoover up the food. It takes my dog twice as long to eat using this bowl.

			Hi all, advice I heard yesterday, thought it might be useful to mention here. Be extra careful walking dogs at this time of year, grapes are harmful for dogs if ingested (and there's lots on the ground during harvest). Some dogs don't have a strong reaction but for some it can be highly dangerous/fatal.

			I wasn't sure whether to post in either of the pet sitter threads, given I don't have pets of my own here, so...   
Hi, I'm a 23 year old Australian, recently moved to inner city Geneva.  Unfortunately my animals have had to stay behind with my family, and I'm  having withdrawals! I have owned animals all my life, and worked for  three years in an animal shelter in Australia. I like all animals, but  I'm particularly fond of cats and rabbits. I am not able to take any  animals into my residence; however, if you live in inner city Geneva (around the Paquis area particularly) and need someone to keep an eye on your animal(s) for a few days or longer, please feel free to get in touch   I can show you references from my job at the shelter, and if needed I can also get references from people I have pet- and house-sat for in the past.   
If there's someone really close by who wants their dog walked a couple of days a week, that may also be a possibility.

			I had a chat the other day in Morges with a lady who has a Labrador puppy.    
Yes, you keep the dog for a year. I do not think that there is a lot of ""training"" during the year other that socialization etc. The dog wears his blue learner vest during this period. The dog goes everywhere with you.   
At the end of the year, you give up the dog who then goes to ""school"" for the blind (in the case I was talking with). The fail rate is 50%. The drop-outs can then go back to the family, if they would like to keep them (or can keep them) or they will be placed in another family.   
Sounds like a great idea if you can organize it. Good luck.

			It's not by design, it's just that one whippet isn't enough! I would dearly like a second our first is 8 months! BUT we are moving to Basel in 2015 and I am worried that 2 dogs would be a hinderance to finding a house to rent! I read in some posts that the Swiss are dog friendly and then in another that dogs make finding a rental property difficult!! I am tempted to just go for it and deal with what ever it brings when we arrive but my husband is less inclined to do that! Also they need lots of safe open spaces to run and I don't know if that is available in Basel (we are in West Sussex at the mo and there are loads of foot paths along side open fields for the to run in) haven't ruled it out can't keep my life on hold until July 2015 just because of the move but equally can't live it as if we weren't moving. it's quite a dilemma!.

			Just to clarify something  that it is still in my mind... 
I do not support at all the miniaturization of dogs...I am not looking to buy one and didn't ask anybody to breed one. That makes a huge diference. However that been said there are lots of small dogs already around the world...then why not playing with them if you like them? I don't see why somebody should be annoyed with that..and if I was a bit harsh before it was just because all of you people know nothing about me...I love my dog and I help many shelters in my country and here. I have a adopted three streets dogs in the past and recently tried to adopt one here but didn't work out. I love dogs and I do a lot for them not only for mine...so it makes me quite annoyed when people jump to critize me just because I use the word toy! 
I love all small dogs....I do not support the bredding of small dogs as I do not have any of the tiny races but other people make different choices and have them already and all I said is that my and my dog would love to play with them ( meaning the dog is already there so it doesnt matter if I call him toy or not toy) it wont change his life at all. 
Anyways I hope I made my point and honestly people should be so judgy when you don't know...it just seems to be very convinient to yell and attack when you here the word toy...but if you would read you will see that I never ask to buy or to get one...just to get in touch with somebody who already has one...so anyway if people understand now good and if not still good luck to all of you...but I am just wondering if all the people yelling here do actually do anything for dogs besides yelling around when somebody says ""Toy""...!

			Hi,    
My 9 year old daughter is always asking for me to get a pet, but it's not something I have the time to do right now, since it's such a big commitment. So I thought it might be interesting if we offered to do some pet-sitting for others, for free.    
Here is the story;    
We live in Saint Louis, in France, near Basel. I would look after a cat/dog/possibly other pet for a few days or around a week. I have three children, aged 6,9,10. The youngest loves animals but is nervous of them, so the animal   (we went on holiday recently, and she ended up throwing ball for the dog next-door)   
We live in a house, with a big garden, and I am ready to walk a dog as necessary. As a child, we always had a dog which I always walked/fed etc, but I'm afraid they were not well trained. I have looked after cats for friends years ago. I work only part time so there would be lots of company.    
I would suggest that anyone interested would first visit here with the pet (while children are here) to see if everyone is happy with plan. If you are interested, feel free to send me a PM.

			Mischka,   
Have you already taken the SKN theory class?   
People who have previously owned dogs in other countries but have not owned a dog in Switzerland need to contact the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt for a ruling on whether you are required to take the SKN Theory course, or not. This is decided on an individual basis, depending on your proof of previous ownership.   
But even if you are excused from the Theory course, I would strongly recommend that you take it before you go any further. The questions you are asking on this thread suggest that you are not familiar with Swiss norms and Swiss laws. Through the course you will learn quite a bit about what is expected of a dog owner in Switzerland, and in Wallis.   
And of course you are required to take the SKN practical course within 12 months of acquiring a dog.          Given that you were not able to bring your boxers with you to Switzerland - it's important that this does not happen again. As you are thinking about adding another dog to your family, please consider: Are you now in a position to guarantee that you will give this new dog a home for his/her entire lifetime, some 15+ years, no matter what else might happen in yours?

			Swiss will only accept bunnies in cargo hold, not as a carry-on as you can with cat or small canine, for 130-150 sfr. We brought our rabbit when we moved here from UK (in car via Sweden...) and had no papers for him. I didn't pay a pet fee for Chunnel and they could have cared less. We looked into the flight option this summer as we spend summer in Sweden but decided to pay the boy down the street to keep him fed and watered. Then again Ireland is yet another island...but I would imagine if you can fly Swiss it is no problem.

Our dog did, bloody expensive and a complete waste of time, but I would do them again if I needed to, to keep my dog. And yes they are Draconian, but all we can do is continue to fight BSL. Hopefully one day it will be abolished!   
We are happily living in Kanton Zurich with a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and we have the haltebewilligung with no muzzle limitations. Unfortunately, we cant get anymore dogs, as he is allowed due to being in Zurich pre-ban.   
One other thing, at least in Kanton Zurich, which is supposed to be one of the strictest. They will not take the dog away if you fail (wesenstest), he will just have wear a muzzle (I know its horrible). But, the dog will not be taken away. Only in extreme circumstances, will a dog be taken away.

			My dogs mother tongues are/were English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Italian, High German, and Whatever-in-heck-they-speak-in-Valais.    
I use hand signals.    
Seriously, all my dogs were adopted as adults and regardless of their 'mother tongues' I teach them all commands in English, as that is my default language and likely to come out first in an emergency. I then taught the dogs the basic commands in the language of the country we were living in. And as above, hand signals.   
Learning the commands in the local language is really for the benefit of passers-by, a bit of theater so that folks who are uneasy with dogs can see that mine are under control. But it's also useful, as your dog sitter or vets might use the German.   
So commands I use regularly:   
Fuss - general heel, specifically heel at left side 
Hand - heel at right 
Rechts/Links - left, right 
Bleib - stay 
Warte - wait 
Sitz - sit 
Platz - down 
Drehen - turn 
Rund um - to go around 
Ruhig - quiet 
Kom! come 
zu mir - to me 
Front - front, oddly my trainer uses this in English 
Voran - sendaway 
Apport! - Fetch 
PfÃ¶tli - give paw. I do not use the gib Fuss that your site suggests, as it is too close to the heel command. 
Steh - stand. (I only use the English 'stand', as the German 'steh' sounds too much like the English 'stay', confusing to the dog) 
Stop! - stop 
Peng!  - Bang, play dead - as in roll over belly up. (A trick that can be very useful on the exam table) 
Lass - leave 
Pfui! - the general Swiss-German 'stop that!' used in emergencies. A gentle 'Ah' is preferable for everyday correction. 
Genug - that's enough. 
Frei! - free, as in the exercise is over.   
Oh, and the JÃ¶Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶... fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine HÃ¼ndli! which you will (hopefully) hear from pasers-by as your dogs are sitting pretty.    
For complicated commands I use the English. So for sit pretty I'd say just that.   
I actually use hand signals far more than verbal commands, as dogs are more attune to body language/visual than the verbal. And I had a deaf dog.   All the other dogs picked up on his 'canine sign language' very quickly - and hand signals are universal, not dependent on local language skills.   
But at the end of the day, none of this matters. Anything we humans say is a foreign language to our dogs, the words have no inherent meaning to them. We simply teach our dogs to associate a set of sounds with a desired action. I know a trainer who uses vegetables and fruits. 'Broccoli!' means heel, 'Tomato!' means sit, etc.

My cat disappeared for 3 days when it was really hot. I was so worried. Turned out he found a really cool place to hang out and he kept sneaking back when I was asleep to eat and drink. The neighbours let me know. Talk to your neighbours of you haven't already.

When we were in Japan we visited a bird sanctuary in the winter. It was cold and there was snow and the cockatoos and parrots were quite happy to be outside.   
Also, altitude has nothing to do with it either. There are some very high locations where these birds are indigenous and that is not an issue.   
The main reason that birds are not sold here is the recently introduced animal protection laws which regulates how these birds should be kept. The space requirements and the fact that these birds must be kept in pairs are just two elements that have made keeping birds unpopular. Many birds were given up as a result and the market for new birds has dwindled considerably.

			Nvm I cleared up the issue.   
For others, if importing a pet, from a EU country, into Switzerland and then taking said pet to Canada (as it's final desitination, non-commercial). You do not have to register with Anis if its stay is less than 10 days (give or take). I just spoke with the FVO and they passed this information to me. Just rabies vaccine over 21 days, + microchip + pet passport and then he gets treated as a pet.

			I studied the subject quite a bit, as my daughter (yes, my baby daughter, not my dog) got leishmaniasis in Portugal 2 years ago. Luckily it was the cutaneous form, and she now has a scar on the shoulder and nothing more. Internal form is mortal, so I consider myself lucky.    
As you probably know, a specific kind of mosquito is necessary to transmit the parasit: between animals, or from an animal to a human being.    
According to my vet, once an animal has leishmaniasis, it's systematically lethal. It can't be cured. Death will take a long time, perhaps even years, but there's no remedy. You can prolonge life, but nothing more.    
PLEASE people: if you go to an infected area, that is ALL south of Europe and further down, vaccinate your pets and protect yourself against mosquitoes.

I was asked if his paperwork was in order but they didnt even check it. You will pay enough charges left and right for the animals once in CH. and if you feel bad after passing just donate to the shelter like mentioned before.

			Timely thread...   
The rescue with which I volunteer will take over rehoming, that's all set up. But as mine cannot go into kennels (medical issues), there needs to be someone to step in in the short term should I suddenly kick the bucket.    
The lovely lady who used to sit for me will take my dogs in the short term. But she is retired now - in 5 years or so, she might not be able to do this. So I'm searching now for a Plan B, someone else local who would also agree to step in as short term foster should the need arise.   
But I'll also stress the need to provide for one's pet financially - adopting an older pet can mean taking on a significant financial burden; I would hate to have that stand in the way of my dogs finding the right home should something happen to me.  I've set up funds so that whoever takes on my dogs - both short and long term - will not need to worry on that score.    
Working in rescue I see the fallout all too often. When Mum becomes incapacitated or dies, the family cannot or will not take on Mum's beloved dog - and the future of many elderly pets  is bleak when plans are not made in advance.   
Thanks for bringing up this issue, Odile.     
FYI - If one has adopted a pet from a rescue where there is a clause in the adoption contract that the pet cannot be passed on to a third party without their consent, be sure to discuss your plans with the rescue. Most rescues are thrilled to know that the animal's future is secure, but there are legalities involved. If the rescue retains ownership of the animal this discussion is critical.     
ETA: If your estate is governed by Swiss law, be aware of the legalities around animals and inheritance.  From Tier Im Recht:    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Sep 2010	Groaned at 386 Times in 287 Posts	Plans for 'what if'?	Odile	Posts: 19,655

			We looked for the same with Rusty. There's a place in Oberwil where you can get into the water about 30-40m south of the public bade which is ok. Next to the nudist beach near ChollermÃ¼lli (behind the shooting range), but we didn't care for that one - it's more like a hole in the forest than a beach. And Argus introduced us to a pretty good place in Cham at the mouth of the Lorze - wander around there, either right at the mouth (easy side) or about 200m west of the river. That one is quite ok!

			Fantastic idea! I'll be very interested to hear more as this program gets going.   
---   
BTW, the Alzheimer's care home where my father is makes great use of the Pets As Therapy program. These are not assistance dogs as in the video, but rather PAT dogs who are trained to do Alzheimers/dementia visits. The dogs are calm and gentle, unfazed by the periodic outbursts typical with Alzheimer's. In turn the dogs' presence seems to have quite a calming effect.   
I am so very greatful to the many volunteers and their wonderful dogs who give of their time - the dogs bring a ray of light into the patient's day.       
(What really warms my heart is that several of these PAT dogs were rescued from the pound under a 'Seniors for seniors' program. Older dogs who might otherwise be overlooked find a great new home, bringing joy to older people. Big win all around.)

937	09.07.2013, 12:02	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    All dog owners who have taken on a dog in Switzerland after 1 Sept 2008 must do the practical course. Those already resident in Switzerland as of that date whose dogs were acquired before 1 Sept 2008 don't have to do the course - but if one arrived with one's dog in Switzerland after that date one needs to do the course(s).   
So... Rambokitten will need to take the SKN   course within 12 months of arriving.  The   course is for first time dog owners - but if one moves here from abroad one needs to contact the cantonal VeterinarÃ¤mt to determine if one's proof of previous dog ownership is acceptable, or not.   
(I have American acquaintances who are been excused from the theory course, and who have been required to take it. It's up to the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt to decided on individual cases. When in doubt, always ask your cantonal VeterinarÃ¤mt or the BVet.)   
But whether one is required to do the theory course or not - newcomers to Switzerland should do it nonetheless. Expectations of dog owners in Switzerland are   different than in other countries - knowing 'the Swiss way' will make your life much easier as you settle in here. The theory course is only 2 sessions, the practical 5. Cost is ca. 150 each.  A worthwhile investment, a good introduction to Swiss culture - and a great way to make new friends.

			Thanks! She's a resilient pup. She is much improved. She started to bark at a cat at the vet's office, so that was good. It does seem that the drug is contra indicated in certain breeds especially - looks like asian and northern spitz dogs, and some herding/ working dogs. These guys are usually high energy, maybe the MAO inhibitor is just bad news for them, or maybe they share some characteristic that doesn't work with this crap. Lily is at the bottom of the weight range for this dosage, i think a smaller dose might have worked better. Well, we're not going to try it.    
Everything looked ok, she was just a little quiet,    
The vet didn't charge me for the visit, took back the other two packs of this stuff and gave me a new pack of 3 frontline. Still, it was very stressful.

My name is Marie-Julie Put, I am a 22-year old law student in Belgium and currently living in Geneva (Eaux-Vives) to study for the summer here.    
I noticed that there is a need for pet sitting or pet care on a non-permanent basis. Until 15th of July, I am available during they day, evenings and if requested, overnight stays to look after your pet, walk/play with your pet, keep it company. I understand that during the holiday season, you want your pet to be cared for in his own territory, with the same level of care you provide.  
I would like to help you out with that. I have no official job experience concerning pet sitting, but I have pets of my own at home, share a love for animals in general and understand and/or will adapt your wishes concerning your animal best friend :-). 
After the 15th of July, I am still available in the evening.   
If anyone is interested or has further questions, please email me:  . I will be happy to answer all of your questions.    
Sincerely,   
Marie-Julie Put

			Another thought:   
Stress can be an IBD catalyst, and I understand it can with IBS as well. I tried to keep Haifisch's day fairly routine to keep him on an even keel. But major upsets in the household, such as when Haifisch's best buddy Melon died, or when the Belltie joined the household and the pack realigned itself, could prompt an episode.    
Knowing that, I would be extra careful at those times.

			Have you tried asking around at your local stables?  Otherwise, maybe try contacting IENA at Avenches, it's Switzerland's national horse sports centre, they might be able to point you in the right direction.

			You can also get Varikennels as well as Furrari crates (I don't know this one, but the listing claims that they are approved for airline travel) at Meiko:     
Best to call to make sure they have your size in stock. The nearest Filliale to you is the one in HÃ¼nenberg ZG, but the main store in Villmergen AG will have more stock.

			Hi    
Thank you so much for taking the time and writing all the information about owning a dog. 
I didn't know that a qualification is required for owning a dog in CH. I will look into it today and apply for it. I am hoping at this stage I will also get an idea what breed of dog will be suitable for our lifestyle.   
Currently I am not working so I have a lot of free time to look after a dog. 
I will also check the dog sitting network. Just to be clear, I would like to do dog sitting on voluntary basis so I get to know what is involved looking after a dog and what sort of dog would be right for us.   
Your tip on teenage dogs is great. I will definitely bare that in mind.   
Thank you again.    
Fezza

			According to the Susy Utzinger Foundation for Animal Protection no one can just go out and start killing cats at random. Here is an excerpt from their publication in English about killing animals as it is currently.    
[QUOTE]-> Legal situation regarding the killing of unwanted young animals   
In Switzerland, killing young animals without the appropriate expertise is forbidden. Killing an animal without professional training is a criminal act since it is classified as cruelty to animals and can therefore be reported.  
Cruelty to animals (Art. 26 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in Switzerland)  
In Switzerland, it is forbidden to kill animals cruelly or out of malice. Doing so is classified as cruelty to animals according to article 26 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals act and is punished by imprisonment of up to three years, or by a fine, which can amount to several thousand Swiss francs. 
â 
What does Âkilling an animal cruelly or out of maliceÂ mean?  
Killing an animal out of malice means killing without having any sensible reason, for example out of mischievousness, thoughtlessness, callousness or on a whim.  
Killing an animal cruelly means that death is agonizing for the animal, and/or means killing it unprofessionally and without following the regulations of the animal statutory order. Generally speaking, an animal is killed cruelly if it was not adequately anaesthetized before its death so that it had to suffer or endure pain and fear. 
Regulations of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 
Article 177 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act lays down the rule that vertebrates can only be killed by people who have the necessary knowledge and competence. According to article 185 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, animals must be anaesthetized professionally prior to their death, thus ensuring that they die immediately and painlessly.  
Examples of killing cruelly:    
Â Drowning animals, such as rabbits, cats, chickens (death is very slow and extremely    agonizing)  
Â Intentionally running into or over animals 
Â Laying out poisoned bait 
Â Shooting without appropriate expertise 
Â Letting animals freeze to death 
Â Letting animals starve to death 
Summary   
The killing of animals must fulfil the requirements of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The killing of animals can only be carried out under certain circumstances and with the appropriate expertise. In particular, the killing method has to ensure that the animal loses consciousness immediately and that death sets in quickly without the animal regaining consciousness. There are special regulations concerning how animals are to be restrained when they are killed. The killing must not cause stress, fear or a defensive reaction.    
According to article 26 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, killing animals without these demands being fulfilled is classified as cruelty to animals and is punishable by imprisonment or a fine. This applies to livestock as well as to cats, dogs and rabbits. As a rule, only vets have the necessary expertise for killing an animal. 
What to do if you learn about the killing of young animals?    
- Address and inform the person about the new legal situation and the Animal Protection Act. 
- Offer various solutions to the problem (practical and financial support for the neutering of mother animals, support for finding respectable and animal-friendly placing for the young animals). 
- Organise cooperation with and support from an animal welfare organization.   
- If the person concerned does not listen to reason and if the animal welfare organization is unsuccessful, press criminal charges against the person for cruelty to animals.     
/QUOTE]   
I've attached a pdf of their full brochure in English. It's very informative and if you have a problem with an over population of ferrel cats in your area they can help.

			While I don't have any experience with rabbits or these particular companies, I can only wholeheartedly endorse using a professional pet transport firm. We have moved from China to the UK to here (not all at once!) with two cats and used pet transport firms each time. While they may seem pricey at first, its cos they know all the steps and take care of it all - the transport is worry free and your animals arrive in the best health      
Good luck with your trip back!

			I will be going on holiday for just over a week in July and am looking for someone to look after my pet rabbits.   
I have two male rabbits, both under a year old. They are currently living in a doppel-stock cage inside the house, and I let them run arounf the flat every evening. They are very friendly and never bite, although can be a little mischievous      
Can be looked after in my home or transported to yours if it's easier.   
Ideally looking for some sort of reciprocal arrangement as would be more than willing to return the favor.

			CharneRochford, I just noticed that you will be in ZÃ¼rich.   
Canton ZH has stricter dog training requirements than most other cantons - the courses you'll have to take will depend on the breed and size of your dog. So if your dog is on List 1 or is more than 45 cm at the shoulder or 16kg, plan on spending more money.   
(ZH has implemented BSL, by the way, banning 8 breeds. What breed is your dog?)   
The regulations for ZÃ¼rich can be found here:    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Dog Stuff	CharneRochford	Posts: 15

			Lorvig, I'm very sorry to hear of your loss. What a beautiful dog he was!    
I hope that memories of all the happy years you shared bring you comfort at this difficult time.     
I'm afraid I don't know much about mastiffs, but I know how the loss of a beloved friend and family member leaves an unbearable gaping hole - and I understand how important it is to again have a dog to share the sofa with.    
I wish you all the best in your search, and hope you find your new four footed friend soon.

			Cats and collars!!   
Bells etc.  I must have spent a fortune on them, only to be removed by the cat him/her self or my self.   
I got some really dinky glow in the dark ones once, found them in the garden!!!   
And those stupid things where you put your name and address etc in.  The size of a tiny little toy thing?  You have to have the writing of a lilliputlian to put your details in there.   
I rest my case...   
Another story.   
I lived in Edinburgh and Suzy the cat was a beautiful black and white cat.  They were doing construction work on the building.  Suzy had a hole under the building where she would go and have her siesta.  Unfortunately, the builders bricked up the wall with Suzy inside.   
She had to stay there all night.  Next morning i had to ask the builders (who were very kind) to unblock Suzy's hiding place.  Happy end, unscathed cat and a mama who could have a good nights sleep.

			A heads-up for dog owners:   
A recent article in K-Tipp and a bulletin from Tier Im Recht have highlighted the danger of fertilizers containing Rizinusschrott (Castor). Such fertilizers are apparently commonly used, especially in bio-farms. The pellets are apparently attractive to dog - and toxic. Recently a Labrador died after eating the pellets.          
Fortunately the Bundesamt fÃ¼r Landwirtschaft has reacted and ricin, the toxic substance in Rizinus (castor), will be banned in fertilizers from 2014.       
But that's a year away folks - as always, train your dog not to eat from the ground, and keep your eye on what your dog is doing at all times. Especially when walking near or in fields.

			I'd really like to congratulate you. BRAVO - for looking nice and early for a solution. I cannot believe the number of people who ask for cat and dog sitters or kennels, cattery, for the busiest times of the year, and fo special needs, about 1 or 2 weeks before. I always think - but that if they don't find a solution on time. Madness.   
So, again, BRAVO and hope you find a great solution, with plenty of time for a trial beforehand   Hurrah   "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: May 2011	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Cattery Info Help! - Reinach	Lil'Angel	Posts: 98

I have a catflap, but it was placed on a window, and people around here joke and say you can open the window through the catflap and enter the house. So I blocked it. I am thinking of putting one on the front door, am nothing of a carpenter though... I will think

Last year one of our dogs had a sore on her tail that would not heal and the vet spoke to us about how it might be cancer and simply removing the affected area was too difficult given that there is little skin on the tail and they might have to amputate part of her tail.  At the visit they took a sample from the sore and sent it to the lab. The results came back that it was an infection, and she needed a dose of antibiotics. The sore cleared up. It was in fact a type of cyst which became infected.   
I appreciate that the doctor wants to prepare an owner but doing so prematurely just causes worry.    
The lab tests are not inexpensive but it really makes sense to me not to guess before lab results are available.

We think he must have been in a garage or shed somewhere. We did all the posters and fliers in letter boxes etc too and for a couple of weeks after he came back I got random villagers coming to tell me they'd seen him in their garden.   
Good luck with the search and I hope she turns up soon too safe and well.

			Word of warning about EuropÃ¤ische and their WauMiau insurance. They've just wheadled out of covering our dog's medical bill.   
We got our dog insured with them. They were not the cheapest company. (In fact, they were expensive and we went for the pricier package, assuming it would give us better coverage).   
Our dog recently had to have an emergency medical procedure, during the course of which the vet ascertained that her uterus would have to be removed.    
EuopÃ¤ische refused to cover the full cost of the procedure. They claimed claiming that the procedure was a spaying, adding that this are not covered by them.   
Whilst the small-print does say they don't cover castrations/spaying and pregnancy costs, this was not a spaying as such. It was a medical procedure which also necessitated having her uterus removed. Our vet backed us up on the interpretation of this.    
However, EuropÃ¤ische insisted on playing semantics and have refused to cover the four-figure bill.    
I spoke (in German) with their representative - a rather brusque, charmless lady. She claimed to have talked to our vet about the case, who supposedly agreed with them. Having double-checked with our vet, this was not the case. As as a supposed consolation, EuropÃ¤ische did offer to cover one-fifth of the cost, ""as it was an emergency"". This suggests to me that they know their argumentation is questionable, and that they're trying to ""make it good"".   
However, their terms and conditions also say that they will cover the *full* costs of emergency medical procedures, which this was.    
It doesn't look like we'll  be getting our money back from them, but we can put the word out there and warn other pet owners about our experience.    
I'll update this if anything changes.

			Rats are lovely and very clever creatures, and make ideal pets (except they have a very short life-span).   
I fail to see why the OP can't simply buy another cage and keep each rat separately.   
Moreover, are you sure that this suddenly aggressive rat isn't aggressive because he's sick or hurt???

			Climber, is your dog already used to lino or other similar surfaces?   
I ask because some dogs find lino flooring slippery or even a bit scarey, or if your dog likes to self-entertain by tossing and running after toys (or is inclined to the 'Schwache Funf Minuten, otherwise known as the Puppy Zoomies*), running and breaking on smooth flooring can lead to accidents.   
Another solution might be area rugs. You can get inexpensive sisal or similar rugs (Ikea, Hornbach, etc.) that are very easily cleaned if you think your dog might be happier with some extra traction. Or you can get an inexpensive piece cut to measure at CarpetLand or other similar carpet stores.    
Just a thought.   
ETA: And, having learned from (expensive) experience - make sure your insurance really does cover damage by dogs, to flooring and anything else in rental accomodation. Some policies require an additional rider, others will cover dog damage within the scope of the usual policy. Despite covering the floor, you might need it one day...     
* Despite the name, the Puppy Zoomies are not limited to actual age. 8 year old Hooligan still succumbs to the urge to bounce off the walls at super-sonic speeds now and again.

			A little update:I finally found a puppy school    
I went to the blindhundschule today for their puppy training. It was a really good experience and we are now planing to go every Thursday.   
The instructor is super friendly and speaks French and English.    
I took the advice of getting a mobility membership. It takes only 10 min. from home and Iska doesn't have to be carried for 20 min (and good for me too  ).

			Shildyu, it would help posters to understand if they can offer an appropriate home if you added added some critical information. For instance:   
Male or female? 
Age? 
Neutered or not? 
Is the dog a working sheepdog? If so, must a working home be found, or can he/she live as a pet? 
Can the dog live with children? If so, from what age? 
Can the dog live with other dogs? If so, what gender, personalities, etc? 
Can the dog live with cats or other animals? 
What kind of training has the dog had to date? 
What exercise and activity requirements does the dog have? 
Is the dog safe around livestock? 
What accomodation requriements does the dog have? That is, can the dog live in a flat, does he need a single family home with garden, does he need a quiet country home, does he need a fenced in property, etc? 
Where is the dog now?     
And - it always helps to include a picture with the initial rehoming post.   
Hoping he or she finds the right forever home...

			Treverus, the terms Tierheim and Tierpension are sometimes (albeit perhaps incorrectly) used interchangeably here; added to the confusion, some that are primarily holidays kennels also take in homeless pets as needed, and many that are primarily shelters for homeless animals also offer holiday care.   
Indeed it is rather common that shelters for homeless animals rely on their Ferienpension service to help fund their charitable activities. (TSBasel, SPA Fribourg, and Tierheim Burg in SZ come to mind - but many others do so as well.) Some cantons do not have a dedicated refuge for homeless animals and so outsource their care to private kennels.

			It's interesting because the Shetland hasn't lost her foal, she's simply adopted an additional one.  Not usually the case.     
And it's not just mothering instinct.  I remember my cousin's male poodle was much more concerned over her cat's kittens and their wellbeing than the mother cat ever was.  He was always coming in the room to check that everything was okay with them.  Mom, she fed them and gave them a wash and then she was off doing other things.

As a dog owner, I learned that you need to be able to call on someone in an emergency, whether it is a dog sitter, a kennel, or reliable person you trust. You won't feel you have ""abandoned"" her if you have have left her in good hands. This also means you do not have to put her on a plane, unless this is your preferred option.

			hi there,   
we live in st gallen with our two cats and wondered if there are any ppl out there who are interested in some sort of cat sitting arrangement? i.e. if you also own cats, we would offer to look after your cats when you go on holidays, etc, and maybe in exchange you could look after our cats when we are not in town?   
is there any website for cat sitters or similar services (on a voluntary basis)?   
if you are not a cat owner you probably wonder   what i am talking about, right?    
anyway, thanks in advance for your posts...

			Great news - I've just read in today's '20 minuten' that the dog, Lycos has been found over 1000km away from Zurich in Kiel. 
If my translation is correct, he was in a Tierheim and three homeless men wanted to take him, but he was identified by his microchip. 
Lycos has been reunited with his owner, but she thinks he may need to see an animal psychologist. 
I hope Lycos is soon back to his happy self.

			I trained as a groomer last summer in Dublin as part of my big plan to ditch corporate life and open a quality boarding/grooming centre over here. I'm currently mid way through the new Swiss diploma in breeding/grooming/kennel management. All my Irish grooming colleagues agree that dogs act up much more when the owner is present during grooming. As an owner of rescue dogs myself, I would understand an owner's concerns and personally I would be willing to try grooming with the owner present but I do think it would be easier and quicker if the groomer is left alone with the dog. I also think any reasonable groomer should agree to divide the work to be done over a number of visits to get the dog comfortable with him/her and the environment

			Thank you meloncollie, I appreciate your advice. At the moment I am only looking to do the theory course but it maybe a while until we bring a dog into the home. I want to make sure have done this and looked at which dog is going to suit our family the best, what is involved as I have only ever had cats and small pets  in the past I will  look into the implication of who has ownership this was something I had not thought of.     
I am hoping that when we do purchase a dog my french will be better and easier to complete the practical side with a trainer but I think the online course would be better for me to have written information to keep as reference. Once i have done this then will contact the trainer as there is one in the village but she does not speak english.    
I still have a lot more research to do about costs insurances, vet costs, and any other associated costs before we buy a puppy   "	earned some respect	Join Date: May 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	SKN theory	hayleyob	Posts: 249

			She is awfully cute indeed.    
You don't pay MWSt on a family pet who has been living with you for some time, just as TexasLynette says - the dog is part of the 'household goods'. One only pays MWSt on a dog newly bought outside Switzerland and then imported here. You might be asked to pay an administrative fee for the customs fol-der-rol - IIRC we paid less than CHF 100 per dog at the airport upon arrival. (15+ years ago.)

We would like to find someone that could look after our dog one/two days a week when we are out. Anyone out there who has experience with dogs, has appropriate training please contact me via PM.   
Thanks

What breed is your dog? Luzern is very dog friendly. I am certain you will find an arrangement for your dog. Veterinarians can often recommend a kennel or a dog sitter. The price can vary depending on the size of the dog. We get a ""group"" rate as we have 3 dogs but one of the kennels has a ""suite"" they can all share.

			indeed your vet will do everything for you (at a reasonable cost too). Worming for a puppy should be done monthly, don't forget ticks and flea treatment on a regular basis.   
and you've saved a puppy that could be still in a store, we avoid certain pet stores in Italy because they have these animals in them.   
Are you going to crate train? I'd recommend this for your sleep to be good. My puppy is 1 tomorrow and benefitted from it.   
and follow the advice of your vet. Don't rush your first few consultations.

I got round that by contacting a local gardening firm. They were quite happy to piggy back my little order onto a bigger landscaping project they were doing somewhere else and they laid the turf. It might be worth calling around.

			Looking at the Tierdatenbank,   , there are 3 listings for kittens under 6 months old.    
One listing is a litter of 5 kittens from a farm, currently in the Jura. The other two are from the Nagerstation (in Obfelden, ZH), who do not list individual kittens on the database, but rather would prefer that interested parties contact them. This is for a good reason:   
""Wir suchen laufend gute KatzenplÃ¤tze zu verantwortungsvollen Tierfreunden. Wir mÃ¶chten gerne Menschen ansprechen, die nicht auf JÃ¶Bilder abspringen, sondern die FÃ¤higkeit haben und bereit sind, eine tiefe Beziehung zu einer Katze aufzubauen. Bitte schreiben Sie uns und wir schicken Ihnen gerne den Fragebogen, damit wir sehen, ob wir zur Zeit ein in Ihr Umfeld passenses BÃ¼si haben. wir wÃ¼rden uns sehr freuen von Ihnen zu hÃ¶ren.""   
If looking for a young kitten, contact them in the first instance to fill out their questionaire.   
Several Tierheim prefer to work this way, TSB in Basel off the top of my head, does the same.

Good luck with your search!

			Just a reminder for all who have added a dog to the family after 1 Sept 2008:    
The transitional period for obligatory training classes (the Sachkundenachweis - SKN), required now under the TschV, comes to an end 1 Sept 2010. After that date, the local authorities can ask you to prove that you have taken the course, and might issue a fine if you are not compliant.     
So if you have not yet taken the course(s), best get going!      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Sep 2006	Groaned at 18 Times in 17 Posts	Reminder: The SKN Transitional Period	meloncollie	Posts: 7,687

			It's pretty easy to feed raw here. We get our meat from Carmello's at the Slaughter place near the Letzigrund.    
We have a freezer, so we get about 30 kilos at a time. We feet mostly heart meat, chickens and stinky tripe, sometimes sardines. You can also get your organs there, livers, kidney, esophogus... Watch out because he'll try to unload a giant bag of sawed up bones on you for free. Those can be dangerous. Our dog loves the the pork tails.    
I've seen packages of raw meat in Qualipet, but at ridiculous prices and it's probably minced or cooked anyway. When in a pinch, I just get the MBudget chickens from Migros.

			Was just chatting to a friend in the US, whose dog is on Anipryl (L-Deprenyl) for canine cognitive disfunction.    
Took a peek at Vetpharm, looks like the drug is Selegiline here.   
However, googling further, Anipryl is one of the older drugs used to treat pituitary Cushings... so whether it would appropriate for your dog (is he now on Vetoryl?) is something that would need to be carefully discussed with your vet.       
I don't have personal experience with this drug, however.   
---   
Also, there is some thought that anti-oxidants might help.           
Again,something to discuss with your vet.     
Wishing your guy all the best.

			Hi all the animal lovers!  
I am quite new in Schaffhausen and me and my boyfriend we have two classic persian cats-a snowwhite 8 months old boy (our little baby  ) and a female brown tabby, 19 months old. They are both well behaved, indoor cats (love our balcony), have all the health checks/vaccines/documents... So if you would like to ever exchange pet sitting-then it would be very nice...  
I've had all the pets you can imagine in the past and I have a lots of experience with them... Had many cats, a dog, guinea pigs, hamsters, a rat, rabbits and the list goes on, hahaa  . I might travel with my man maybe in June or July and if anyone is available then I don't have to drag my poor kitties with me... 
And ofcourse-I will return the favor!

			Does anyone have a recommendation for a good vet specialized in rabbits, in the Basel/Binningen area?    
I recently got a 4-month old rabbit, and I would like to have her checked by the vet, made sure she is healthy, given any vaccinations, etc.   
Later on, I would also like to have her neutered, since this prevents uterine/ovary cancer in female rabbits.

			Sam, are you looking for a shelter as in a kennel which houses homeless animals for adoption, or  a shelter as in a kennel offering holiday care for your own pet?   
The word Tierheim can mean both... and some Tierheim fulfill both functions.   
So a little more info might help us give you better answers.

			Your cat will also need to be examined by the vet here if it travels via cargo, so double check they are working if your cat will arrive on a Sunday. Ours came in at 6:10 am on a Saturday and we had to wait until 10 am for the vet to arrive (no one told us beforehand so we had lots of time getting to know the airport).

			Hi, here is (was) our dog trainer's details:     
Socinstrasse 45 
4051 Basel 
Tel. P. 061 271 72 36 
Natel 079 699 52 45   
We have a ridgeback, imported from England 3 years ago. Being in the countryside all his life, he had problem living in a city with all those trams and buses. The fact that he was a ridgeback makes it worse. Then my husband got depression and could no longer deal with this little terror. So we went to a vet, who introduced Martin to us.   
Martin was excellent, speaks very good English, and charged amazingly low price (30 chf per session, the length of the sessions depends on what the dog needs, from 30 min to 2 hours). It wasn't really the money that matter to him, it is the dogs. He is a great guy! (Although 3 years on, the price may be different now).    
Good luck!

Last summer, though, I followed the specialists' advice and stopped feeding the birds come summer. And yes, they did indeed find their own foodstuffs... the berries, cherries, apples and pears I had worked so hard to grow.  My little feathered friends beat me to the harvest, every time - something they had not done in years past.   
Haven't quite decided what to do this year - whether to give up gardening or bird watching.    
But given that it snowed yesterday, I can still feed the birds with a clear conscience.

So I guess, the best solution is to find a pet food that is made in Canada for markets inside and outside the country or a pet food made in a US state which regulates the manufacturing of pet food (Illinois, Washington, Minnesota, Pennsylvania)

I know of 2 horses available now; you can PM me for details, stall visit.   
Please serious inquiries only.  This is intended for those willing to commit to 1-2 days each week in order to build up a bond with the horse.     
This is not a reitschule but private stall and by owner only.  You will need to have the appropriate insurances for CH which will be checked.

			well it will be an invisible fence......so.... 
We used it at my home in Belgium and after 2 shocks they know where they can go. It is not like the dog gets shocked 20 times a day. The thing beeps 3 times first and that is how you train them. The purpose of the fence IS training and safety for both you, your dog, and other people walking by. And the shock really is very minimal (Yes tried on myself)    
If you want it just get it. It really does work wonders and imho is a great addition to any house.

			My vet was also extremely sympathetic when the time came to put Susie to sleep.  He also arranged her private cremation, and I received Susie's ashes about 3 days later.  Dr C is an excellent vet, but his handling of what is always a difficult, delicate situation, was truly exemplary.

			I have had a lot of algae problems with my tank, and I've got a timer on the light, and cut it right back so that it goes on from 7-9am and from 5-8pm. The reason for this is that it's when we 'enjoy' our tank. Otherwise, the fish seem to cope fine with natural daylight and the algae is no longer a problem...

The dogs to be walked are homeless, for a variety of reasons. I would proceed with caution here if one is to volunteer. I am not sure it is a very good idea to bring a young child along either.

			We got our female schnauzer spayed at 6 months.  No worries, no problems and the vet was great.  She just couldn't have activities for 10 days.  Stitches out, no problem.  We did it because schnauzers are a highly active breed, and it calms them.  Also, females are more likely to get cancer the longer it goes on not to get spayed.  Don't know about males.   
And I don't think it is popular en suisse, because I could never understand when we met other dogs why the owners asked me if I have a male or female before they could greet each other. I think it is because they don't tend to get their dogs fixed.  We had no problem and it didn't change her personality either.

			Hi Mop,   
I'll have to echo meloncollie et al. on the ""only get a cat if you can commit yourself to it for its entire lifespan, come what may"" line.   
If you can truly stick to that and really want a cat, get a new apartment and get it in writing that cats are permitted   moving in.  
I recommend using the form provided on this page : 
That way, landlord and tenant know what is ok and can fall back on it if problems arise. 
Maybe it would help to suggest using this form to your landlord?    
About his fears about the cat going outside, could you live with an indoor cat?    
If you're not ready to accept some inconveniences (e.g. forms, complicated rental agreements, indoor cats, people annoyed with roaming pets etc.) with regard to your pet, I'm sorry to say, I don't have the impression that you will be committing yourself to your cat 100%.   
Best of luck.

Cantonal and Gemeinde/Commune rules apply to all, residents and visitors alike. One is expected to comply with local rules when visiting.   
The obvious points will be areas where dogs are forbidden, noise regulations, areas where a dog must be kept on lead, etc.    
In the cantons where BSL is in force some cantons require visiting owners of those breeds to apply for a special visitor's permit for their dogs. If one has a listed breed (generally the bull or molosser breeds - the lists differ by canton) one must make sure that one understands local regulations to the letter.

			HI   
I have an afghan  hound and I would like to go away for 2 weeks 
he is 3 years old, likes long walks , very nice personality 
I need someone who knows how to handle this breed because they have a  great sens for justice hence they need to be handled with a lot of love . 
anyone interested ? 
he is well raised ....funny character...big hound 40 kilos  
I would love to find someone privat ...Earley (my best friend) doesnt like crowds ,cities....he is a sight hound and can see up to 3 kilometers...   
His temperament is typical Afghan Hound he can be aloof and  dignified, but he is happy and clownish when  playing. This breed, as is  the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get  along with small animals. Early is very intuitive and  a great companion.      
 The breed has a reputation among some dog trainers of having a relatively slow ""obedience intelligence"" ....he is more like a cat    
thanks

			Declawing seems to be de rigeur in the States in recent years so OP might be expecting to get that done at a vet.  Same with tail docking on dogs here, just not done.   
200 isn't cheap, but that helps make sure that people don't take an animal and then return it without giving the adoption serious thought.  With feeding, shelter, vet and staff costs to keep the animals safe and happy for months, if not years in some cases it's worth paying to my mind.

			Good news.  I received a reply from the folks in Bern today confirming that we are OK to fly on the scheduled time, provided that we:   
1.  list both of the chip numbers and both rabies vaccinations on the certificate from the USDA   
2.  bring a scanner with us which will enable customs to read the old, non-ISO-compliant chip.  Turns out there is a service here in the US that rents these scanners out for precisely this kind of situation.   
I'm going to print out the e-mail thread and take it with me through customs just in case.   
I am really impressed with how fast they have responded to my request (in English, no less).  It looks like we are going to be OK.

			in fact, quarantine can be avoided it seems:   
'that the dog or cat had not been landed at any intermediate port outside the country of export. In the case of an aircraft, if the dog or cat was landed, the dog or cat had been conveyed in a crate and remained within the precincts of the airport at which the aircraft landed (Prior permission from AVA is required should there be a change of aircraft carrying the animal).'   
However I would have still preferred a direct flight (which seems there is none that can carry a dog).  I wonder why A380 cannot accept dogs?

			In addition to valid vac (as shown in your pet passport), do research the dog control laws of the country/area you are visiting. For instance, make sure you understand the local leash/muzzle laws, as these vary quite a bit.    
Check with the embassy of the country you are visiting for (more or less) up to date info on traveling with your pooch. If you are traveling by train, check with the train company for their regulations as well.   
Gute Reise!

			I took my cat to Texas and then back to Switzerland. As I didn't want her to be a nuisance but mainly as I wanted to reduce stress for her to a minimum, she travelled in the cargo area and not in the passenger cabin. She had a giant rodent water bottle and no food during the flight. (The water bottle was required by Lufthansa). I put newspaper and a thick towel in her crate and I think she peed, but I am not sure.

			Hi there!   
We attend the   A-Z   & Umgebung which is located at the Wiese(on the road where the Zoll Otterbach is located-Freiburgerstrasse) with our two Dackels. There are a variety of class levels and dogs that attend. Most classes are on Saturdays between 11 am and 2 pm and last 45 min. There are 3-4 trainers that rotate so that you usually get a different trainer every week or 2 weeks, which can be quite fun. They also do a nice mix of agility and obedience training, so it usually isn't boring. This is important as our older dackel gets verbal when he gets too bored sitting around doing nothing when he could be running around and digging holes. 
It is also very inexpensive at 200 CHF per year (if you go religiously there are ~30 classes per year). All classes are in Swiss German, but the trainers have been very good about speaking high German with me (if I am alone) or English if I'm very lost. They also allow my partner (Swiss) and I to train together, which has been beneficial for both of us (though more so for my comprehension of Swiss German).   
The website ( .ch/) seems to currently be down, but I will lay out the basic schedule:   
11:00-Noon: Welpenspielstunde 
noon-13:00: Beginners class (basically 4 months old and up, new people for a few classes, etc...) 
13:00-14:00: Intermediate 
14:00-15:00: Expert   
We currently attend the Expert training with our almost 3 year old dachshund and Intermediate training with our almost 1 year old dachshund. The trainers recommended that we skip the beginner class with the little one due to the class size (they have had over 10 dogs there on average) and our current experience-since we train weekly with our dogs at this club and our breed club. The trainers are all very patient and know all the regulars by name. We have met quite a few people there and I would highly recommend checking it out.If you would decide to check it out, I would recommend going to the Beginners class to start. Make sure to bring your pet's passport so they can check that he/she is up to date with shots and have fun!   
Currently the school is on winter break until the 23rd of Feb. and then there will be normal classes and clicker courses.    
Hope that helps.

She thinks she should have checked his chip after every visit and she says ""Lesson learned"". She also adds ""Everything happens for a reason.""    
It is not even 3 weeks, he just got his new microchip and new rabies and we have 1 more week here, so we are going to be away from him only for 2 weeks.   
It is really great because all the ladies in the ver are willing to help. Mel is like the ""mascot"" of that vet, he is happy there with those ladies, they all love them. They all want to keep Mel and offers their house for him. They want us to visit their houses and choose the one that we feel ""good"". This is so nice, right?   
They will also carry Mel to the airport and do all the stuff there. This is a big responsibility but it is nice to know we have nice people there.   
We can not cancel our flight, because my husband needs to start working in ETH on February 1st. I can not delay it because then where I am going to stay with the doggie? All of our friends have cats or allergies this and that  Our landlord has already found new tenants so I can not stay in this current place for 2 more weeks. Plus, we just have the entry visa for now, which means we need to begin the paperwork as soon as possible to get the appropriate one.

Unless I am missing something.   
If the OP is bulking at 600 because its seems excessive, I get the point. If it is because they don't have that kind of money, then I would argue getting a dog is perhaps not ideal also.   
I shell out close to 1,000 on my dog a month, but that includes 660 p/m daily dog care. If one does not require dog care, and manages to get a relatively healthy pooch, (of course, can't predict future), then a monthly cost can be kept around several hundred for food and toys etc.

			IIRC, our initial neurological evaluation which was a consultation only, reviewing test results done by the referring vet, ran less than CHF 100. This was 3years ago... and I remember being delightfully surprised at how reasonable it was.     
FYI, routine veterinary care is one of the few bargains to be found in Switzerland (as compared to the US and UK), but specialist care will be as expensive as it is everywhere else.   
Again, all the best to your doglet.   
ETA:   
If you need a referral to see Dr Steffen, your current vet could do so. Just give him the above link to the Tierspital site. Or your general practice vet in Lausanne could refer you as well.

			Cristina,  one thing that your friend should understand is that dog ownership is viewed very differently in Switzerland to what one might expect coming from other countries. The responsibilities of owners, breeders, trainers, those working in rescue, dog carers, and anyone working directly with dogs are regulated to a greater degree, and animal welfare is taken very seriously.   
How a puppy is raised in the first weeks of life is one of these things. No responsible breeder or trainer would allow unrestricted public access as your friend's question seemed to suggest. Yes puppies need socialization - but that means a proper socialization program. Bad experiences during the puppy phase, which is all t oo possible when random people are allowed access, is the cause of many later behavior problems.   
And, just a note: A Welpenspielgruppe is an owner and puppy training class, and should be a controlled atmosphere. I would seriously question a trainer allowing strangers access to the class.     
If your friend is truly interested in puppies, I would suggest that she take the SKN theory class. No,she won't get to play with puppies, but she will come away understanding why the question was inappropriate.

I've already made little beds and hideaways with old towels and blankets under some covered areas around the house. They do use them but some of the cats have become quite territorial and now chase away the poor starving kittens. I try to feed them after all the others have left. Based on how they are with each other it looks like I'm dealing with at least 2 colonies of cats coming around. Thanks for putting up this link. It's given me some good ideas.

			Oasis des VÃ©tÃ©rans is a wonderful organisation, rehoming more senior dogs in a very homely environment.  I went to an open-day there and was most impressed.  Please consider a senior dog (some of them are not so senior, just middle aged!) as quite often available for rehoming due to an elderly or ill former owner.

			I'll add to the mix, since my experience is still fresh in my mind. And since Jetset had a great format, I'll follow it for my own:          cat    13 pounds    Swiss.com    Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier    Arrived at the airport 2 hours before scheduled flight    January 10th    $100 payable at the check in counter (paid via CC)    direct, Newark, NJ - Basel     
- Took him to get him rabies shot at vet within 30 days of departure date. 
- Had vet put in microchip that meets ISO Standards 11784/11785. We did not purchase it ourselves (he had it in stock, as well as the forms required to be filled out by him) 
- Took him back to vet within 10 days of travel to have vet confirm she is fit to fly. (this was stressful, as the holidays/vet closure left me only 7 days from departure) 
- FedEx'd forms we received from visit in Step 3 to the local USDA where they signed and stamped the forms and FedEx'd them back (FedEx used due to the tight timeline   Switzerland requires additional paper beside the USDA forms.  . The omission of this document with the USDA and rabies forms caused yet more stress for me 
- He rode in the plane with us, sitting on the table next to my seat (we flew business class). During take off/landing he had to be moved to the space behind my seat and the bulkhead.      
The cat was very quiet the entire ride and only made a small wet spot inside the kennel. After we landed we took him through customs, declaring him (we didn't know if we had to or not, but felt it was prudent to do so). The guy at the counter glanced at the paperwork, checked for the chip and wished us a nice day. No money changed hands.

pee or spraying has lot of reason in cat. Some of them is not about natural behavior rather is sign for some illness .for example kidney stone    
you should do Xray for her & be sure is not because of illness   
pet are part of family we can't leave them just for some problem. I know is really bad situation but try to find why she is doing maybe you can stop it   
I have a male cat & have same problem with him ,he is usually spray on the wall but it happened some times he did in bed   
what I'm doing now let him go out & it help a lot. He walking around garden and spray everywhere (actually he showing his territory by this  to another cats)

			Thank you Odile:    
I have read all this multipul times from other threads and on the government website. However, if you read other threads, they had no problems bringing in their pets that were docked as puppies from other countries.  As it states as well, you can bring in a docked animal as ""claimed personal property"".     
I would happily take a non-docked dog, however because it is done at such a young age breeders in America generally are not ones to want to do this, because they haven't developed enough to see if the dock as show potential or not, which is ultimately what they are breeding for. So in a breeders mind if they leave one not docked it might be the one that they would have kept and shown or also it might be the wrong a more aggressive dog when you want a more mellow temperament vise vera.     
I have found one breeder near our area in the US that does not dock currently, however, after doing some research it has been reported that it questionable whether she does proper health testing with the mating pair.  Not testing for health before breeding is a huge warning sign.     
I still have a little less than a year to figure this all out before we will be bringing a dog into our home.

It is unnerving for her to be thrown off balance by anything. She has enough problems with uneven surfaces, she really doesn't need a dog round her feet to make things more difficult. So when I see particularly considerate owners, I often thank them in the hope that they'll keep up the good work.

			Very helpful comments, thank you. Yes, I already checked previous EF threads, and also with with my vet. His view is that a combination of raw food and her usual diet (kibble, rice) shouldn't be a problem. He also used to have pugs so is tuned into their specific problems. 
Nick, that's exactly what she gets - interdigital cysts - and they're a real problem for such an active dog. 
I've decided to give BARF a go, introducing it slowly, (I take your point MÃ©lusine) and making absolutely sure I pick up all the poop to avoid risk of salmonella to others.   
Julieyogini, I think you're right about the commercial side of animal food. Bit like humans I guess. Is it good for you? No. Can we make a profit? Yes. Bring it on! 
I'll give it a month and report back. In the meantime, hope your little pug fella improves, Nick, whatever you decide.  
Thanks for all the advice, everyone.

Ithink a week for one cat is around 250chf.  I paid 800chf for 2 for 2 weeks over Christmas and New Year which I know seems alot but the price per week is a little higher for peak holiday periods.  The fee covers all the cat care, food, litter etc so you dont need to supply anything just let them know what food your cat(s) like and they will get the same there    
There are options of having a pet service come to your home to feed, clean and pet your cats or dogs.  This costs in the region of 30chf per day, per pet.  Again its pricey but if you dont like putting your furry friend into kitty borstal its an option!   
Another option is to have a look in the Pets Corner part of EF as there is a pet sitting network thread that may also offer osme help if you are willing to repay the favour for whoever helps you out.   
Pet care here is expensive and if I can will use favours from good friends for weekends etc but will tend to use the Cat Garden Hotel for longer periods like vacations etc.

I agree with you that you're about to make a big mistake  Number 4 is the killer point for all the tree species you named. None of them like cuddles. It's a comon missinterpretation of guinea pig's shock behaviour that they actually like cuddles. They just endure them. However, they are fun to observe. But know that they can live a long time (around 8 years) and need a big cage. The room in which it's set up will be dusty (from the hay) and there will always be sawdust and hay on the floor.    
If you still think that guinea pigs are a good idea, you can get them for about 50 CHF from a private breeder. The cage (at Qualipet) costs about 200, the little houses about 30 a piece (of course you can make your own if you're handy).   
Below a link to the page of the Swiss Humane Society (in German) and a quotation from it about the cuddle situation.         Meerschweinchen galten lange Zeit als das Streicheltier par excellence. Genau dies sind sie jedoch  gerade nicht, als Beutetier bedeutet fÃ¼r sie das Gepackt Â und Hochgehobenwerden Ã¤usserste  Gefahr und extreme Angst! Untersuchungen in den USA zeigen, dass die Stresshormonwerte im  Blut von Meerschweinchen selbst hochschnellten, wenn sie nur ganz kurz in die Hand genommen  wurden. Danach brauchten die Tiere Ã¼ber eine Stunde, um sich wieder zu erholen! Meerschweinchen  kennen kÃ¶rperliche BerÃ¼hrungen auch nicht in ihrem Verhaltensrepertoire, daher ist Streicheln oder  BÃ¼rsten fÃ¼r sie fremd und unangenehm. Meerschweinchen sind deshalb Tiere, die man beobachten  kann, aber keine Streicheltiere!  
Wie die meisten Tiere lassen sich Meerschweinchen aber mit Geduld und Zuwendung   "	null	null	null	Help! Maus, Hamsters or Guinea Pigs (for my 6yr old)	guest	null

If you did you will notice the reference to composting and disposal of cat litter which is relevant since the OP has a cat. You would also have read that several posters before you had advised the OP to put the poo bags in his household trash or poo down the toilet. Based on these responses it would seem more than a little bit ridiculous to suggest that the OP takes his bags of poo to a bin in the neighbourhood when he could save himself the bother and toss them in his household trash unless of course he was out walking the dogs at the time in which case it would be a logical thing to do. I would imagine that he would be extremely unlikely to be out walking his cat though so the disposal of the cat litter would still be necessary.

			Because of the very strict quarantine laws when bringing animals into Australia, i'm in a real tight spot regarding my wifes cat.   
Long story short, i'm giving up our apartment end of Feb, but the cat needs to stay here in Switzerland until the end of May. If I send him in Feb he will have to spend an extra 4 months in quarantine there.   
I'm not a ""cat person"" and as stated before, this is not my cat. Regardless of that i find it cruel to leave an animal sitting there in a cage for such a long time.   
Even if he stays here until the end of May, there is still the minimum 28 days quarantine in Oz. Even that is too much but that's the minimum.   
So this is the cat, his name is Milo.           
He is an 8-1/2 year old, desexed male, ""long haired domestic""   
He needs a temporary home here in CH from mid-February until end of May 2013.   
He is a housecat, he's been ""outside"" once in the last 4 years, after jumping from the balcony to fight with a free-range cat, who kicked his butt pretty good.  
So now he stays inside. He likes to sit out on the window ledge, but that's as far as he goes.   
Is there anyone in the northern Canton's, who would be able to take care of him for these 4 months?   
I will be here in temporary accommodation until May, but rules are strictly no animals, and I cannot keep him with me....

			Just 'cause y'all piqued my curiosity, I took a peek at the TSchV.       
The keeping of chickens (HaushÃ¼hn, HausgeflÃ¼gel), is regulated under Article 20, Art. 66-67. Also Table 9-1, pages 89-91    for requirements the conditions in which chickens are kept.       
But as above I know nothing about keeping chickens, so I'll leave you to read all about it. If you have questions, contact the BVet or your cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt.     
ETA: The above are federal laws regulating the   of chickens. As animal   is in general the competency of the canton/Gemeinde, I would imagine that there are also various local regs as well.

No, you don't have to stay in the car, but you are not allowed to stand between the cars and there is not much room on the sides. There are emergency toilets and not much else.  I think the car sickness problem might have been exacerbated by the fact that we were on the top tier.   
I think the animal has to remain in the car the whole time though.

			The Wheatons are our first non shedders.  They are very affectionate, maybe a little energetic, but no more than a lot of dogs I've had over the years.  They can get into mischief up until they're a couple of years old, but mostly they are great dogs, and just about the perfect size (about 10-15 kg). I actually have two. here's a link to an old post that shows the other one with a proper haircut.

			Jordan has given you a good summary - you need to do quite a bit of research and preparation before you bring your four-footed friend home. There are countless threads asking the same question; rather than repeat all the info given I'll just encourage you to do a bit of browsing in the Pet Corner.   
And since you specifically asked about dogsitters -  this thread is recommended reading:     
If a dogsitter is a necessity given your family situation, it would be advisable to look for someone BEFORE you get your pup. It is extremely difficult to find a qualified dogsitter. (Yes, dogsitting is a regulated job in CH).   
And do be aware that qualified dogsitters are expensive - if you need in home care, plan on CHF 200 per day.   
To get you started, read the BVet's Hunde Richtig Halten':     
and get yourself registered for the SKN theory course:     
Wishing you and your future best friend all the very best.

			We have 3 dogs (not small) and we have rented houses in the past.    
It is not impossible, but a challenge.  
Be prepared to sign a supplementary agreement to your lease and provide proof of liability insurance. You can also expect to be asked for the maximum rental deposit (3 months).   
3 dogs are not necessarily noisier than one, except maybe at meal time.   
Whatever you do, don't lie on the rental application. When it asks if you have pets, be sure to say what type and make sure you say dogs (plural).

			I just checked it quickely.   
But I wouldnt be affraid of the peepee and ""making bussines"" in house. It is surprissing, but when the dog is grown up(no more puppy-most of rescue dogs), he has a good controll over these things and make no ""accidents"". He makes just what he really wants. Such as the pug that peed all over the place. If you will not accept it, he will not do it.   
I think it is important, to firts think about where you want the dog to be/walk, and where he will sleep-calm place, where no one go to often, where kids dont run around and so on. Than you show the dog, the place to stay, something soft, watter and food. and than he will be curious and go with you and walk around. And you just have to say ""no"" whenever he steps where he shouldnt. It can take a lot of ""no""s but it works better than the door closed and everything.   
with rescue dog you have to be allways sensitive, but you can be sure he will do his best for you

Peg has done the SKN courses.  This is a qualification required of anyone who cares for dogs commercially (as in, paid.) This requirement that dog carers take specific education courses is part of the new-ish (2008) federal animal welfare law.

			We flew Lily from Raleigh to Zurich 5 years ago - she was 3. We really had no choice but to use a connecting flight, but we were able to use Continental - they had a specific pet transport program (pet safe) at the time, and she flew Raleigh to Newark, had a chance to get out and walk around in a secure kennel, and then Newark to Zurich. She was fine. I don't know if the airline still has this program - they've been consolidated into another airline.    
It's great if you can do a single non-stop flight, but if you can't and your dog is young, all you can do is arrange for short lay overs and keep an eye on things.    
Lily's 8 now though, and although I don't see much evidence of aging, we might do things differently.

			All the information needed regarding commercial import is available on the BVet website. All serious breeders working within the FCI breed clubs already know the regulations.   
Apologies if I have the wrong end of the stick, but you sound as if you are proposing some kind of third party import scheme. If so, beware.   
Please understand that 'Hundehandel' is a very dirty word in Switzerland. Importing dogs into Switzerland with the intent to sell them on is looked on as very dodgy. The people who operate like that are usually battery farmers/puppy mills. NO serious ethical breeder would even consider operating in such a manner.   
Yes, knowledgeable dog owners here in Switzerland often go to breeders in other countries - not surprising given how few breeders there are in Switzerland. A knowledgeable dog owner then imports the dog they have chosen themselves, under the private import regulations.  - and very much frowned upon. People here expect to go directly to the breeder.    
A knowledgeable dog owner gets to know the breeder and dam (and sire when possible) personally, usually well in advance of the birth. A knowledgeable owner investigates the ethics of the breeder, ensures that the breeder's early socialization program is up to snuff, researches lines, checks that the breeder is a duly accredited member of the relevant breed club and that the sire/dam are properly angekÃ¶rt, that all relevant health and temperament tests have been done... in short, knowledgeable dog owners do due diligence.   
And a serious, an ethical breeder does the same (and more!) with all potential buyers. A good breeder checks out the buyer, requires the buyers to visit them and the dogs,often several times as the pup grows, and checks references.   
Knowledgeable Swiss dog owners expect this - and welcome it as a sign of a good breeder.   
As said, the people who ship dogs here to be sold on are generally battery farmers, selling sick, poorly bred dogs often under false pretenses. The BVet regularly runs campaigns against this awful trade, to warn naive buyers.    
All would-be dog owners are required to take the SKN theory course BEFORE acquiring a dog. How to buy a dog, how to assess a breeder, how to spot dodgy folks masquerading as breeders, the evils of 'Hundehandel' are discussed in the course.    
So be aware of the general sentiment and expectations of most Swiss dog owners who are looking for an FCI pedigreed dog.    
And those of us who aren't fussed about pedigrees go to well-respected rescue organizations.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2012	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Importing dogs?!	Julia_Karai	Posts: 35

			I've had cats pretty much my entire life. Your cat is trying to get your attention by using everything except the box when relieving himself. Either he's very sick, or he's really unhappy.   
I personally think you should take the cat to the vet FIRST to rule out any medical issues. Cat his size and even his age often have medical problems such as UTIs, kidney failure, diabetes, etc. Not saying your cat has any of these, but if he does they certainly can explain his behavior.   
Only start working on behavior modification if it turns out all is medically sound. Starting such techniques earlier (discipline, changing his routine, food, litter, etc.) will only create more anxiety for him if he is already sick.    
Hope it all works out and that he is healthy and happy soon. Ragdolls are not normally known for behavior or anxiety issues.

			Reading through the Pet Corner I came across some threads about the places where dogs can run off-leash. If someone is interested I can suggest this kind of place in Zurich.   
In Zurich Affoltern there is Katzensee. The area itself is considered to be a nature reserve, and you need a leash there, but near it there is a nice wide open space with fields, and exactly these fields can be a perfect place for a dog to run in the freedom. This is also really good opportunity to train a dog to bring a ball etc.    
Why do I suggest this place? Well, with my dog Penny we achieved a lot already during three months we have her, but she of course needs more education and training. I know that other dogs eagerly learn from each other. Besides Penny is a friendly dog and would love to have company for the walks. I personally can share everything I know about the dogs. And actually I am not a boring person myself   I can also add some photos of the area to give you the idea of this place if you are not familiar with it.   
So if you are interested and you can come to Affoltern in the afternoons (appr. from 1.00 to 3.00 pm - this is the time for out longest walk, until it is not dark) Â PM me   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Looking a tandem partner for a dog	Warcraft	Posts: 26

			Clara,   
Just a heads-up:  Responsible pet sitters are in great demand - those who offer care in the client's home even more so.    
For the kind of service you seek, over the holiday period, expect to pay premium rates.     
Hope you find the care you need.

			One last try...   
As a  , it is not allowed to bring a pet animal here with the intention of passing it on to someone else. The end owner must import the animal.   
In order to bring an animal here   either via sale or for adoption, one must import under  .   
Yes, I know that people import incorrectly, declare animals as theirs with false intention, even smuggle animals in. But they are acting outside the BVet regulations.      
As I have said many times before: if you wish to help animals, please do it right and stay on the right side of the law.   
Animal welfare work is very much in need of public goodwill. A rescue needs to maintain a sterling reputation here in Switzerland if it is to operate successfully.     
The law is clear. What you chose to do with this information is up to you and your conscience.

			Rackiec, as you are in Basel, please get in touch with the Tierschutz Beider Basel:    
I think you've been given this link before, but even if you have decided against seeking their help in rehoming, the TBB has an advice service:       
Perhaps they can help you; they offer various training programs. Working with such a well-respected animal welfare group would likely go a very long way to establishing good will and show that you are taking the matter seriously. Their prices look reasonable.   
And if needs be, consider their Tierpension - at 20-26 per day, depending on the size of the dog, it's a bargain. I don't know if they offer day care in addition to holiday boarding but it wouldn't hurt to ask - especially if you explain the situation.   
Paws crossed for you and your dog.

			Cats are meat eaters, pure and simple.  Try them on tinned cat food, which works out way cheaper, and I bet the problems will disappear.  Some cooked fish or a little raw mince as a treat will be much appreciated believe me.  My cats thoroughly enjoyed 2 meals a day of tinned cat food with dry food inbetween as snacks and never had any health problems.  All this dry food is better for cats is just marketing nonsense put out by the manufacturers.

			Thanks, Meloncollie, and I do agree, I could never hit or hurt Leggy, that is not why I adopted her. She has had a bad enough start to her life already. And I also want to earn her trust and love first. I have never had to use pain or fear to convince any of my dogs to do anything, they all just did it because they wanted to please me and I am hoping to get that same relationship with Leggy. She shows no interest in dog treats, probably doesn't know them, but loves cheese, turning into a real Swiss already! She is also bright as a button and a quick learner (probably had to be on the streets of Rumania). Her appetite is not great, I've tried 2 types of dry food without much success, but she likes canned food, cheese and bits of leftover meat. So we use that to reinforce good behavour when letting the kitten out for half an hour in the evening, with my husband holding Leggy firmly by the collar, armed with a bowl of cheese cubes! 
We've decided to continue training Leggy for 2 weeks and if the situation doesn't improve will just find a GOOD home for the kitten.

			I agree with what's been said, walking the shelter dogs is one of the most important - and most rewarding - aspects of volunteer work. You can see how the dogs immediately relax and enjoy themselves when they get out for a leg stretch. The Valais shelter I volunteer at has 35 dogs (on average) and tries to make sure each dog gets at least a 20 minute walk every day. That wouldn't be possible without volunteer walkers. Good luck and well done for thinking of doing this

One of your neighbours could report you. Just because I own dogs does not mean I want to listen to someone else's dog barking.    
I am not a dog psychologist but I think your dog is lonely. Splitting up the dogs, as you and your ex have done, makes no sense to me. Dogs are not property to be divided. It would have been in the dog's interest to share ownership of the two dogs.    
What does your ex do with the other dog all day? Is he left alone and barking as well?

			As you may know canton ZH has BSL in force, banning 8 breeds and any mixed breed dogs whose DNA shows 10% or more of any of the banned breeds.   
Have any of you ZÃ¼rich dog owners been required to have your dog DNA tested in light of the ZH ban?   
I ask because on other forums there have been stories of wildly inaccurate DNA results, as the companies offering these services use somewhat limited databases.    
Just for the laffs, I had mine tested, although not using a Swiss company. I was quite amused to learn that the analysis claims that my sheltie is a... wait for it... schnauzer/BMD/dachshund mix.        
(She is a rescue, but I do have her pedigree and have met her sire and dam. So yes, I can say with certainty that she is, in fact, a sheltie.   )    
Such stories are not uncommon, apparently.   
It's fine when one uses such tests for fun. But given that under the ZH law a dog could be condemned on this data... I worry about the general accuracy of such tests.    
So - have any of you done DNA testing on your dogs, or have you been asked by the VeterinarÃ¤mt to do so? Were the results what you expected, or were there surprises?

			The problem starts and ends with irresponsible owners. These restrictions are simply band-aids, doing nothing whatsoever to address the root cause - and a could possibly cause more problems in the end.   
A dog whose behavior warrants it should be kept on lead or muzzled. No argument from me there. However these laws will aversely affect hundreds or thousands of dogs whose behavior is perfect, who have done no wrong, whose owners have continually work on training, who take responsibility for their pet and respect others.   
A concern with a muzzling requirement for all dogs - those whose behavior does not merit it - is that you have cut off an important natural communication point. Dogs communicate with one another (and with us, if we pay attention) via body language. There are a range of facial expressions called 'calming signals' (read Turid Rugaas, please!) that dogs use to navigate encounters with other dogs. A muzzle restricts the dog's ability to 'speak' with his face (set of mouth, set of eyes, etc.) or block the other dog's ability to read his face. The result can be that dog A can't see that dog B is trying to say ""hey, it's all good""  - and suddenly conflict errupts.   
(Geneva's general muzzling requirement was struck down by the courts - it will be interesting to see what happens with the Vaud law.)   
Most responsible owner will decide to leash or muzzle their dogs without being told. There are already laws on the books - in every canton -  that could deal with the few irresponsible ones. If those existing laws were actually enforced there would be no need for this new legislation.   
I see this in many Swiss rules and regs - a law is on the books but it is not enforced - and there is no mechanism of enforcement. So half the population ignore it. The problem isn't solved so new, stricter laws are passed. For which there is no enforcement mechanism so half the population ignore it, and the problem continues....   
By the way, I wrote to the VD VeterinarÃ¤mt several weeks ago asking how 'large' is defined in this law, but have received no answer. Could I ask someone whose French is better than mine to do the same?   
As for banning based on breed alone: Bad science. In most cases it's how a dog is raised, trained and treated that counts. The majority of pitbulls are actually bred/raised to be quite friendly to people. Even the poor dogs who have been trained to the fighting ring have to be people friendly, so that they can be handled when their adrenaline is up.  It should be understood that dog-dog aggression does not automatically translate to dog-people aggression, as the behavior is motivated by different instincts.     
Remember - the owner in the Oberglatt incident was a known criminal. The dogs had been illegally imported into Switzerland. They were kept starving (thought to be training for dogfighting) and at the time of the tragedy had been left in the care of someone incompetent to handle them. The owner had already broken several laws, complaints had previously been made.  The tragedy could have been avoided if any of several laws already on the books had been enforced.    
It's an old saying but one that rings true nonetheless: deed, not breed.

			I got the answer what has happened to my cat so I am posting it for other cat owners.       He had a reaction to the Feluk vaccine.  As a result of this, his immune system was suppressed.    The cat flu he had as a kitten, the vet says stays dormant, and when his immune system was suppressed, it has emerged again making him  feel bad.   His gums are a little inflamed (she said this is caused by that same flu virus) and why he does not eat and she said he has a little cystis and his bladder is inflamed.   
I had brought him to the other vet numerous times and was told it was nothing. 
I am glad I went for a second opinion and listened to what I thought even when the vet kept telling me nothing is wrong.   
I did not know the cat flu stays dormant in the cats and also did not know all of the side effects that can happen with this vaccine.  She told me he can never have that specific vaccine again.   
He has meds and she believes he will be on the mend soon.

There will be a reason why that particular shelter has those conditions, but they're not the same everywhere.  I know the SPAFribourg prefers that cats have access to at least a balcony if a garden isn't available.  They would also prefer you, if possible, adopt two kittens rather than just one so they have company of their own kind.   
It's certainly worth checking with your vet or other vets in the area as there are often small ads for pets looking for homes in their reception areas.

1Snow, this is not true everywhere; a foreigner is required to ask the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt whether his/her proof of previous dog ownership is acceptable, or not - as Jules has done. Some of my colleagues have had their proof accepted, some have been denied.   From the BVet website, the FAQ on the SKN (Click on 'Haufige Fragen' on the right side:       
""Muss ein Hundehalter, der frÃ¼her im Ausland bereits einen Hund gehalten hat und sich nun in der Schweiz erstmals einen Hund anschafft, den theoretischen SKN absolvieren?   
Wer nachweisen kann, dass er schon einmal vor dem 1.09.2008 Hundehalter war, muss nur den prak- tischen Kurs absolvieren. In welcher Form aus dem Ausland zuziehende Personen diesen Nachweis fÃ¼hren kÃ¶nnen, ist nicht geregelt.  (z.B. BestÃ¤tigung der frÃ¼heren Wohn- gemeinde).""     
Roughly translated:   
Must a dog owners, who earlier owned a dog abroad and now in has taken on a dog for the first time in Switzerland, take the SKN theory course?   
If one can show that one owned a dog before 1. Sept 2008, one must only take the practical course. What form of proof is acceptable is not defined. One must contact the cantonal VeterinarÃ¤mt, to determine what they will accept as proof (for instance, confirmation from the previous place of residence.)       
FYI, Two of my colleagues who have been denied came from the UK. The problem seemed to be that there was no official registration or dog license. One of my UK friends was accepted, however, because she had a UK pet passport issued prior to 2008. MY US colleage was accepted - because she has a dog license from her town. These were in three different cantons.   
From what I hear, each cantonal veterinary office might look at it differently.     
But regardless of what one is required to do, it is strongly recommended that every dog owner new to Switzerland take the theory course - because the laws and social responsibilities here in Switzerland are very different from many of our home countries. It's a chance to learn what is expected - before we make mistakes.      
ETA:   
And just to stress: there is no test for either the practical or theory courses. Course attendance is all that is required.

Baby mattresses are ca 120x60, 5-10cm and children's 160x 70, 8-12cm. When Melon's old bones needed a bit more comforting I put two mattresses together to make a thick bed. I made fleece covers (out of CHF10 fleece throws, on sale at Manor, IIRC), easy to clean. The foam is a nice egg crate foam, has held up well so far over about 8 years and four dogs. If the size isn't quite right, the foam is easy to trim.   
If those are too small, you could also get the full sized foam mattresses, 200x 90 or daybed mattresses 190x 80.     
(But despite having lovely comfy beds in every room in the house, where do the muttley crew sleep? On the sofas and in my bed, of course.   )

			Hi all. I have 2 wonderful little chihuahas. 2kg each. 4 yrs and 2 yrs. Well trained and well behaved. Only the odd bark hear and there at a loud noise or when they get a bit too excited while playing but definately not the annoying barks all the time type of pups. Great at being left alone as they just go to sleep until you return even if its 8 hours later and are not bothered when you leave as its normal for them. Their normal day is walk in the morning and then sleeping behind my desk from 8-5pm in the office as I go in and out but they barely look up anymore as they are happy to snuggle under covers until the day is over. Then we walk home.    
My normal dog sitter is away and i want to take a trip but need to find a place for them first. Please pm me if you are interested. I prefer someone with experience and/or references. Thanks. Erin

			If you're still looking for a sturdy scratching post; I'm saving up to buy on of these:       
Yes they're crazy expensive, but I've read they're very sturdy and more importantly: it's easy to remove all fabric parts and wash them separately. (They're 100% cotton too.)   
Another website with the same principle:       
Not sure yet what the difference is between the two, but I'm sure I want one. I wish I would have seen this earlier, cause I ended up spending a lot of money on a scratching post (bought in Switzerland) that basically started falling apart after one month.

I am in Riehen a couple times a week AND have taken the SKN theory class (and gotten certified), and would be happy to come and take your dog out for some hours in the afternoons.   
I'd love to discuss it further when you have time.

			I had friends traveling back to the US in July with Lufthansa (ZRH to Frankfurt then on to DC). In Zurich they were allowed to put the cats through the x-ray machine while still in the carrier.  They turned down the level of the x-ray apparently and told them it was safe.  In Frankfurt they had to be rescreened, but this time they had to take the cats out of the carriers, put the carriers through the x-ray and walk through the metal detector with the cats.  They had leashes on the cats, but apparently some old woman thought that this was a nice time to just walk up to my friend and try to pet the cat without asking. Needless to say, the cat flipped out, scratched my friend quite deep, slipped out of the harness and ran off into the Frankfurt airport. Luckily, her husband saw where the cat was going (he too had a cat in his arms), and they were able to find the other cat quickly.  Both cats are now happily living in the states but it was quite a difficult day for everyone. So, if you do go through Frankfurt, be mindful that you might need a second security check.  If that is the case, keep an eye out for idiot travelers that might think cats love all forms of attention even when in unfamiliar places.

			One more thing...   
Have you asked your vet about possible behavioral side effects of any of the meds your dog has been on? Some drugs can affect behavior while the dog is on them, some can (usually temporarily) affect behavior once the dog is taken off.   
(I'm currently dealing with behavior changes while the Belltie is being weaned off Prednisolon, hence my question. )

			We are a Swiss diplomatic family, searching for a loving home for our cat, Migros.  Here is a little of his history.  Migros lived at the residence along with the other cat, Coop.  Although Migros wasn't comfortable around us, he was very much loved by the staff who worked at the residence.  However, there have been major changes at the embassy and poor little Migros is now without a home.    
Migros is Persian, three years old, extremely intelligent, beautiful, loving and sensitive. He thrives in an atmosphere where he can have attention and he gives absolutely no trouble.  He is primarily an inside cat.  He will add a real personality to your household.   
We very much hope that Migros can be united with someone or a family who will give him the love and attention he deserves.  He is currently living outside Switzerland, but we can arrange to bring him to Switzerlanld and will support his food and any medical costs for the first year.  He is in excellent health, and all his shots are up to date.   
Should you be interested, please contact me and I will give you the full story of this remarkable cat and can also send a photograph.

			as indicated in the link above, you need to have a Brevet for basic competitions (and remember to pay the 'validation fee' every year that you want to compete) and a Lizenz for higher competitions. Both need to be taken at accredited stables (see list on link), you can use your own horse though.  
Also, your horse needs to be officially registered at the FNCH and you need to pay every year (as well) to keep that registration active. 
This is to my best knowledge, as I have been thinking about competing as well and my riding instructor gave me these hints.  
Otherwise you can call the FNCH, they are supposedly really nice and friendly, to make sure you get all correct registrations.

			I lost two dogs recently. One died during the night before we were ready to put her to sleep. The other, I took to the vet and held him as he quietly went to sleep. There are no easy answers. Both were terribly painful. The first, because she died alone, at the foot of the staircase probably wondering where I was. The second, because he could have lived a few more weeks or months. Don't feel any guilt, but the hurt doesn't go away, it just gets a little easier each day.

You heard right - under the new-ish federal animal welfare law (TSchV), dog owners are indeed required to take courses. These are called the Sachkundenachweis (SKN), and there are two types of mandatory classes:   
First time dog owners - that is, anyone who has not had a dog registered in his/her name in Switzerland* - are required to take a theory course BEFORE acquiring a dog. This course discusses the basics of dog care, dog laws, your responsibilities as a dog owner in Swiss society. It is designed to prepare you for sharing your life with a four-footed friend - and to get you to ask yourself if you are indeed  ready to make this commitment and to stick to it for the next 15 or so years. The theory course is usually done over 2-3 lessions.   
All dog owners, regardless of experience, must take the practical training course within the first 12 months of ownership with each and every dog acquired after 1 Sept 2008. This is a very basic training course, really just brushes the surface. The course is usually done over 5 lessons.   
The price of the courses may vary a bit by trainer - but usually are in the neighborhood of CHF 150.   
Only a trainer certified by one of the BVet recognized organizations may teach the SKN; to find a trainer near you, see the database:       
You can read more about the courses on the BVet website:     
And the subject has been discussed at length here, search for 'SKN'.   
So as you are doing your research, if you are required to do so, take the theory SKN now - it's a good introduction to dog ownership in Switzerland.   
All the best.       
* Folks who have owned a dog - as in the legal owner - in Ausland but not in Switzerland should contact the cantonal VeterinÃ¤ramt with proof of previous ownership for a decision as to whether you need to take the theory course, or not.   
But - even if you are not required, I would strongly recommend doing so - society's expectations of a dog owner are rather different in Switzerland than in other countries, and the SKN sets you on the right road.

My original response to the posting was merely in regards to exercise. I wasn't nor would I imply that I know how behavioral issues with dogs (or humans for that matter) are fixed. I do not disagree if there are specific problems that they need to be address.   
As for the dog having a severe fear problem, yes, I would understand the need to take baby steps.   
My one dog, while out hiking in the US got into a wasp (yellow-jacket) nest. Everyone ran except me who went in to get him. I got stung a couple of dozen times, he got stung equally as much.  Now, even if the slightest bump on his arse happens, he go crazy, yelps, and takes off running, without regard to anything. My point, I understand that some issues are much more severe, and I wasn't trivializing this one.   
With that said... I don't agree with your feelings towards CM, but, that is just a matter of opinion and I do not believe he has seen a downward turn from support, other than of course, the divorce with his wife.   
I should mention, I read your other post. I just think it is a matter of different perspective and opinion. I also am not sure how much you have fully understood how he trains dogs based on some of your comments, but, I am just dropping out of the subject and I wish the dog the very best.

			I was thinking that perhaps the dog could still smell the gathering of loved ones who attended the funeral since there is a lot of standing around done during typical funeral, probably the grave area has a strong scent of familiar people.     
I base this idea on the fact that on the first time visiting one of my brothers after he moved to his new apartment, my dog went right from the door of my car to his door (four apartment grouping, his was one upstairs), just by his scent trail.     
Also it says a lot about dogs and loyalties in a different way: The article says that the deceased had obtained the dog for his son, it's pretty obvious that the dog's loyalty wasn't to the son though.   
Poor pooch, glad the cemetery staff are helping to care for him.

			Hi everyone!   
I just moved to Fribourg a couple weeks ago, and I'm looking for some ppl, who wants to walk the dogs together. I have a 2,5 year old male german pointer (vizsla), Pedro, and he really-really would need some new friends to run and play with. I can give everything else to him, but i can't be his doggy-mate to run with    
Write me if you are interested in walkings together!

Well, everyone is right to their own opinion of course, but I'm curious why you'd think this is any more disgusting than having a litter tray (which, let's face it, generally needs to be cleaned by hand)?   
I don't remember either of my two males who learned to tinkle in the potty ever leaving spots on the toilet seat, which is the only remotely disgusting thing I could think coming of it...

			As you can imagine, I have a thing for Berners.    
They tend to be more ""sensitive"" that some other breeds so it would be best that they have someone with them most of the time. So it is good that your hubby will be with him in the UK. You will also need to do a far number of stops on the way to the UK so he can do his business and get some air.   
It is great at that age to get them our and to socialize them but do be careful of him overheating. Be sure to bring a small bowl and a bottle of water so you keep him hydrated.   
Have a great trip.

Looking at one of the local websites where one can advertise if looking for a property, I can tell you the majority of ads placed by those who are desperately looking for housing are pet owners.    
Many landlords just won't allow pets. Given the state of some of the properties I have seen, I can understand why. On the other hand, I have yet to meet a dog or cat who can colour on a wall with a marker.    
I think you need to look for a house, preferably with a fenced garden. I have had success finding homes for clients with multiple pets but it is definitely becoming more difficult. I see more and more ads lately specifically stating pets are not welcome.   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Moving to Zurich area, with pets	Milo	Posts: 35

			I spoke with the vet today, to enquire about the implant.   
They use Suprelorin, this website was useful for some reading    
It is a procedure that lasts 6 months, costs 110chf for implant and 57 chf for consulation.   
The vet asked why I was getting it done, for aggressive behavioural reasons and/or whether he was running away to find a mate, and I said no merely for dog daycare reasons.    
I asked her why she posed those questions, and she said it can make aggressive or horny (she didnt use that word) dogs more so for the first two weeks. So I did ask even though he is neither, could it make him so, and she said not likely.   
I am going to do bit more reading on it, and will ask more questions at the vet if/when I go for procedure.    
Will keep you posted.

			There could be several reasons why this has happened, I wouldn't want to guess... this is a case for the vet.   
My rule is always: Lumps = vet, if only for peace of mind.   
Hopefully it will be something relatively simple and easily treatable. But if it turns out to be a more complex or lasting problem, don't hesitate to as your vet for a referral to a veterinary dermatologist.    
If an allergic reaction is suspected it will help if you keep track of what your dog eats and comes into contact with - including not only household chemicals but also things on your walks. Have neighbors put down lawn chemicals? Have you walked through a newly fertilized field? Has he been playing in water? And so on... Also track any changes to the size or number of the lumps. The more info you can give the vet the easier it will be to treat him.   
Poor little guy - paws crossed for him.

			My vets has a poster up which shows the equivalent (to an adult human) of giving an adult cat various foods, including a glass of milk. From memory, a glass of milk given to an adult cat is the same as giving a human six and a half muffins (American muffins, not English muffins).    
So perhaps changing the kitty's diet could be a good first step?

			I like what my best friend has going on with her dog.   
He gets an early morning walk and he's then dropped off at doggie ""daycare"" where he gets to play with other dogs and receives more walks. He's picked up by my friend and gets an evening walk and loads of cuddles. Each Friday, he's at the groomers for half the day though. Dude's coat is obscenely glossy.    
In my next life, I want to come back as her dog.

			The SPA Fribourg charge 500 for dogs, 150 for unneutered kittens and 190 if neutered and 50 for rabbits.  It's not the sum itself, it's making sure people are really committed to looking after their pets once they take them on.  And having had two rescued cats, albeit at no cost, the love and joy of watching them transform from scared young cats into confident, playful companions is worth any amount of money in my book.  As soon as we get the new house cat friendly, we'll be getting another one or two and I can hardly wait.

			Methinks you are an exceptional dog owner, JBZ - and one of the exceptions to the rule.    
I see the fall-out from poorly planned puppy ownership all the time.    
When a 6-12 month old dog is handed in to our rescue, most of the time it is because the owners got a cute puppy without understanding the amount of work that means and were not able/willing to devote the time needed to teach him how to live in the human world.    
Without consistent-on-the-spot training, socialization, and reinforcement that cute puppy can develop some annoying behaviors - and in some cases, serious behavioral disorders.  And when that cute puppy turns into a rambunctious teenager - this is the point where the family dump the dog.   
Rehabilitation of a pup who did not receive adequate socilization during the critical fear periods can be very difficult.    
Based on the intake interviews I've done in such cases, the majority of those owners left the young puppy on his own for long stretches at a time, and did not make adequate provisions for physical and mental stimulation, socialization, training. Surprise, surprise - they now have an ASBO hound on their hands.     
Over the last 20 yearsI've spent too much time and shed too many tears picking up the pieces.      
I firmly believe that one owes it to one's puppy to set him up for success from day one. That means being available - on the spot - whenever necessary in those early days, to help him learn what he needs to know.    
Especially here in Switzerland, where neighborhood intolerance of an imperfect dog often results in abandonment or a one-way trip to the vet.      
---   
That said - I've told the story of Saint Swimbo's unexpected entry into my life before... (Post 15 here:   )   
Yes, it can be done. But it's bl**dy hard work - and owner and pup start out with one strike against them.    
It can work - IF the owner is creative, IF the owner is willing/able to gather the resources necessary to provide for the pup, IF the owner -   -  are willing to make the pup's welfare a number one priority. Some people can do this - but my rescue experience shows that many cannot. And the pup becomes a statistic.   
I've been there, done that - and by merest chance got very lucky. In hindsight -   -  I would never, ever do it again, nor would I ever recommend anyone else doing so.    
A pup deserves the best possible start in life - which in most cases is someone with him during the critical early periods.

Elsewhere in Vaud, the Nyon SPA does holiday boarding as well, but not sure about others in the Canton.  Nyon fills up quite fast.

			Toothcentral, have you taken the SKN yet?   
If not, this is a good way to get involved with local dog owners - who will have the scoop about local dog-friendly places.   
I've not found dog parks like we have in the US in Switzerland.    
(O how I miss our local park - acres and acres securely fenced, with two lakes, woods, open fields, dedicated dogsport areas... all safe from complaining dog haters. Those were the days...)   
However there is an alternative: the Lecky Trail JÃ¤gglisch-Horn (near Klosters) is not too far from you in Chur - maybe not an every day thing, but a good outing for you and the pooch.       
These are trails designed primarily for 'conflict-free' hiking with dogs. The idea is that folks using the trails will understand that yep, here be dawgs. Those who dislike dogs and do not wish to share public spaces with them hopefully will avoid these trails.    
However the usual dog-etiquette applies: if someone does request that you re-leash, please do so - and please respect other's rights to use the trails.   
---   
Living in SZ where dogs must be on lead in public, I more or less consider our local Hundeschule as our 'dog park'. By that I mean that much of my dogs' socialization/exercise with other dogs takes place at the HS. We practically live there   so it's a good way to ensure the dogs' social/behavioral needs are met. Area walks are on-lead (as per law), so I use these as bonding and training opportunities.   
You might consider joining a local dog club or dog school if you don't find what you are looking for in an informal setting. Fees usually aren't all that expensive.

			Sadly the people who buy these dogs have a clue there is something not right. They just don't want to pay the Swiss/French/German/Italian price for them. A good quality healthy pedigree Chi is expensive. Even a good quality healthy well breed non-pedigree Chi is about twice as much as these dogs were selling for.    
I was just out with some of my Chi owning friends tonight and we were discussing this. There is a woman in the area who has 9 Chis from the Czech Republic! And these are her pets. She imported them all and isn't a breeder.

I just moved to Fribourg a couple weeks ago, and I'm looking for some ppl, who wants to walk the dogs together. I have a 2,5 year old male german pointer (vizsla), Pedro, and he really-really would need some new friends to run and play with. I can give everything else to him, but i can't be his doggy-mate to run with

			Good to know, MiniMia.    
I doubt things have changed much, given the general pace of change here   so your experience is most likely still valid.

			Oh yes there is always the potential of rabbies with wild animals (including unvaccinated cats and dogs, even in America).  I had to get rabbies shots just to live in Ethiopia as well.    
In american, even in the country where barn cats, or letting pet wander outdoors is more acceptable, then you might have to contend with racoons, Bears, wolves, coyote (big problem in some areas, been known to take peoples little dogs from their backyards in california), in Florida you have alligators, some very rural places you still get the florida panther.     
Growing up in florida our neighbors cat was an outdoors cat, he was very sweet to people but fought all the stray cats. One day he came up to us kinda swaying weird and layed down in our drive. When he did that a snake, which had constricted itself around his belly, uncoiled itself and slid away. The poor thing was being suffocated by a snake (granted the cat was bigger than the snake).       
As for DC, anything inside the Beltway is very congested area, most roads are main  roads and a lot of apartment buildings are high rises even. I don't think I saw one stray cat in all my time in DC area, but there has to be some because they have shelters and rescues in the area.

			Hello Peg A,   
and congratulations on your receiving your SKN certificate  
Also thank you for your reply, really appreciate it!   
Actually, in guide dog training a handler is the blind person after he graduates with his guide dog.  
It means that he is now capable of ""handling"" his guide dog, i.e. work & communicate with him effectively.    
It took me a while to decide between experienced handler and dog sitter for that reason. I'm looking for a  
person who is confident enough to handle Tuscan should he decide to act in an dominant/aggressive manner,  
towards other dogs or people, i.e when people visit, he must be reassured that it is ok for them to enter the house.    
What I'm trying to say is that although he is a companion dog and I can go anywhere with him, he has had experience  
in SCH sport and is not the super friendly, social, Lab or Golden that you can let to roam around in free runs with no ""handling & control"".

			If the pup is only three months old, I'd be less concerned about SA rehab - but would still want to research the destruction/SA issue carefully.   
I'd want to question the rescue about whether they think this is something other than standard puppy hijinks. (You should have seen some of the 'performance art' that even my perfect Saint Swimbo created as a pup...  ) Destruction is what many puppies do naturally - until taught otherwise. The question is, will your being away from home affect your ability to teach her the necessary 'otherwise'?   
However, true SA can manifest itself at any age, especially if the pup was abandoned too young to leave her mother, was traumatized by what happened to her. So best to go in with eyes open and a training/rehab plan in place.   
Even when rehoming a pup without any issues, I would have qualms about leaving any 3 month old puppy alone for the time you describe. Not only for comfort and bonding reasons, but also there are the practicalities of house training to think about - being alone too long could slow down house training, allow her to develop habits that may become hard to break. Little bladders need emptying often, as you know. Also, there is the issue of monitoring her interaction with Whisky and the cats - at three months she still needs to be taught what is and is not acceptible. Again, being left too long could allow her to develop behaviors that would be better nipped in the bud.    
Bottom line, so much of training a young dog relies on timing - being on the spot to address behaviors as they arise.   Wearing my rescue hat: I'd want to hear how a potential adopter to planned address these concerns.    
Could you find a sitter to cover some of that time, at least for the next few months?    
(Creative solutions can often be found to make many different set-ups work to meet individual needs, provided the commitment is there -  and clearly you've done a good job with Whisky.   )     
Have you discussed your schedule and your training plans with the rescue? What do they think?    
Paws crossed that it all works out for you...

			I rescued a dog from an inner-city pound. She was a day away from being ... eek... terminated.  A few days later, she was romping around the woods of Switzerland.  She was even provided her own coach and bed.  Must be like Dog Heaven for her.   
It was pretty easy to bring her over.  The airline should be able to give you all the details.  The Swiss are animal friendly.   
She even got a sleeping pill for the trip.  I didn't get one.  But she had to travel in cargo.

About your comment on cat, I partly agree. I do have stray cat came into my garden and poo but I sort it out and manage. Neighbour's cat did come in and they actually apologize to me even when they don't have control over it. That's called good neighborhood.    
you impression about dog's toiling habit is definitely very subjective. It bother sme when dog poo and it affects me at the end. Eg. people pick up dog poo when their dogs do the business and that's call responsible and it doesn't bother me. Unless I get you wrong, the point you're trying to make is irrelevant to my case. If you feel offended to you and your dog, put the discussion else where. I'm talking that specific annoying case of my neighbor here !   
When dog poo anywhere else, I have to say, at least i have a choice not to walk on that place but not oblige to suffer everyday like my case.  Just because you do responsible thing as dog owner doesn't mean the universe is doing the same.

			The term ""friendly"" is not really applicable to chipmunks the few i've seen are very hyperactive and cautious, so i can only assume that it would take ALOT of time, training and handling to get one to the stage where it is considered ""friendly""   
Otherwise I would recommend getting a pair of gerbils. I have em and they are easy to source in normal pet shops and make great pets. 
they don't generally bite, are very curious and are awake during daylight hours. 
they don't smell and are very low maintenance. 
I let mine out of the cage regularly and i've trained them to come to my feet as i usually give them a sunflower seed when they are there.   
If you are looking for something a little larger try a degu. it is like a larger gerbil and they also make good pets apparently(no personal experience here)   
I regularly see them available in the pet section on tutti.ch   
I also personally believe gerbils are just as cute as chipmunks.            "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	help needed for buying a Chipmunk	gcharles	Posts: 11

So no, she didn't answer. But again, I guess my question was too vague. My bad.   
For who may be interested in the answer now that I have experienced it : the lake of Bienne is nice but dogs are forbidden basically everywhere (surprise, surprise...). I talked with many locals, most of them dog owner, and they were quite pissed with that law actually. 
We went in a small town called Lattingen. Some locals showed us a path along the lake , after the camping (see what i meant by precise directions  ), where you can let your dog swim and have fun a bit.    
Sorry EFers in Bern Kanton, I don't help much and I am sure you can find better places to let your dog swim, but I didn't have enough time to find it ! 
If someone does, let us know !   
Good night all.

			Only one of our dogs has seasonal problems with her eyes. Various meds had little effect, only one eye drop helps, and even then, very little. It is just a matter of time before it clears up.It does not transfer to the other dogs.   
Abby doesn't seem worse than previous years but she doesn't spend a lot of time outside. We have two air purifiers at home designed for pollen allergy sufferers - we have them for cockatoo dust    
Abby likes to stay in the room where they are, or maybe she just likes having the bird talk to her .    
Hayfever sufferers say this year is really bad.

1360	10.06.2012, 19:39	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 17 Times in 6 Posts	Location: Schaffhausen	"    My husband and I got 2 cats about a year and a half ago. They were a few months old and brothers from the same litter. They have always gotten along very well but cats can vary widely with regards to whether or not they prefer solitude or a friend.    
Potty training cats is very easy. You set the tray out for them and they go, and that's pretty much it in my experience!    
One thing to consider if you get 2 cats is obviously you will have twice the amount of pee and poop. We scoop the litter every day (well...before I got pregnant, I scooped it every day, but as I am not supposed to touch the litter boxes my hubby is supposed to be doing this and he is not as vigilant as I am ha ha) but we still need to change the litter twice a week or else it starts to smell like cat pee.    
If your cats are going to be both indoor and outdoor cats be prepared to possibly find little prizes brought to your doorstep or inside your house   Our cats are indoor only but my mother and father in law have an indoor/outdoor cat and he regularly brings them mice, birds, etc. and sometimes they are not even dead yet...   
Also...cat hair. Cat hair EVERYWHERE. Our cats are short haired but still, there is so much damn hair everywhere.

			Melloncollie's response is comprehensive.  A couple of things to add as we just got our puppy recently from Italy.  She needed an EU passport, which you can ask the breeder for, because it documents the vaccines the puppy has received to date and also was needed to bring her over the border into suisse.  This will also show transfer of ownership.   
We had to show her passport and receipt for purchase at the border and pay the tax right there.  I think it was around 8%.   
She was 3 months old when we got her and I am a stay at home wife.  I can tell you it is hard work and I needed to be with her most of the time.  Not only to assimilate her into the family, but to monitor her so she doesn't chew the furniture, housebreaking, staying off the furniture, don't bark at neighbors, etc....I found out it is truly like having a baby in the house.  They need to go out and socialize, which means daily walking, meeting other dogs and people. This is really important en suisse if you wish to take your dog out in public.   They are very active when young and constantly need attention and training.  The good thing is my time is beginning to pay off as now she is a bit older she listens to us and is behaving very well.  God luck.

			I have to agree with Meloncollie regarding the grape-skin mush left after the vendange.   That is exactly what caused kidney failure in my dog, certainly according to the vet. 
We lived in the vineyards of St. Saphorin with nothing around us but grapes. 
My dog used to eat the grape-skin mush and the ripe grapes which were overhanging each and every path around us.   Unfortunately I wasn't always able to stop him.  
Had I known about that danger at the time, I would have been tempted to keep him under lock and key, but that wouldn't have been much of a life for a big, strong, male dog.   As it was, his life was shorter than it should have been, but we loved him dearly and still miss him dreadfully.

I had to pay a few for the cat, which I thought would be for paperwork and time but no, it comes out that it includes shots, vet visit and castration for a ridiculous price of 90 euros!!! I didn't know and I didn't care but when I found out about it I was very proud.

Although I thought I had paid for the dogs already as I had given my card details etc only to find that I had to pay when I arrived at Zurich AP and they tried to charge more than was originally discussed. Got it sorted in the end but make sure if the money has been taken asap.

   A lâinstar de tous les animaux, les tortues ne sont  pas faites pour Ãªtre offertes en cadeau surprise. Leur achat demande  rÃ©flexion. Souvenez-vous que les tortues peuvent vivre trÃ¨s longtemps:  ainsi, les prendre comme animal de compagnie signifie que vous en aurez  la responsabilitÃ© pendant plusieurs dÃ©cennies. 
                       Les tortues ont une trÃ¨s  longue espÃ©rance de vie, parfois mÃªme supÃ©rieure Ã  celle de l'homme: les  tortues grecques peuvent vivre jusqu'Ã  120 ans, et les tortues Ã  tempes  rouges environ 50 ans en captivitÃ©! Adopter une tortue implique donc  que vous vous engagiez pour la vie. Il vous faudra Ã©galement songer,  selon l'espÃ¨ce choisie, au devenir de votre animal aprÃ¨s votre dÃ©cÃ¨s. 
Si  le souhait de possÃ©der une tortue vient avant tout des enfants, il vous  faut alors vous assurer que leur enthousiasme durera suffisamment  longtemps pour s'occuper de leur animal pendant des dÃ©cennies.  Disposent-ils des connaissances suffisantes pour dÃ©tenir un tel animal?  Sont-ils prÃªts Ã  nourrir leurs tortues et Ã  nettoyer leur enclos pendant  leur temps libre? De plus, rappelez-vous qu'un enfant ne doit jamais  avoir l'entiÃ¨re responsabilitÃ© de son animal. En tant que parents, vous  devez donc l'aider Ã  s'en occuper, acheter la nourriture et, bien  entendu rÃ©gler, les frais de vÃ©tÃ©rinaire. 
Avant d'acheter une tortue, renseignez-vous en dÃ©tail sur son espÃ¨ce et sur ses besoins.         
         Evaluez le coÃ»t relatif Ã   son acquisition et Ã  son entretien. Un enclos spÃ©cialement destinÃ© aux  tortues dans votre jardin ou un terrarium Ã  l'intÃ©rieur de votre maison  avec filtre Ã  eau et d'autres Ã©quipements peut coÃ»ter quelques milliers  de francs suisses. A cela viennent s'ajouter les frais courants de  nourriture et d'amÃ©nagement de l'enclos, ainsi que ceux des soins  vÃ©tÃ©rinaires. 
Certaines espÃ¨ces de tortues ne peuvent Ãªtre  dÃ©tenues sur le territoire suisse qu'avec l'accord du service  vÃ©tÃ©rinaire cantonal et nÃ©cessitent une autorisation de dÃ©tention. C'est  le cas des tortues appartenant aux familles suivantes: tortues de mer,  chÃ©lydridÃ©s, chelidÃ©s, pÃ©lomÃ©dusidÃ©s, tortues gÃ©antes, tortues  sillonnÃ©es ( ) et tortues tataruga ( ). 
Lorsque  vous aurez pesÃ© le pour et le contre et pris la dÃ©cision d'acheter une  tortue, rendez-vous dans une boutique spÃ©cialisÃ©e, un centre d'accueil  pour les tortues ou un Ã©leveur sÃ©rieux dont les animaux sont nÃ©s en  Suisse. 
Enfin, l'abandon de tortues devenues indÃ©sirables est,  comme pour tout autre animal en gÃ©nÃ©ral, strictement interdit. Certaines  espÃ¨ces de tortues pÃ©rissent lorsqu'elles sont relÃ¢chÃ©es dans la  nature, notamment en hiver. Par ailleurs, leur comportement de prÃ©dateur  peut nuire aux espÃ¨ces vÃ©gÃ©tales et animales endÃ©miques. C'est le cas  de la tortue Ã  tempes rouges, considÃ©rÃ©e comme une espÃ¨ce dite  Â«invasiveÂ». L'importation et le commerce de ces tortues sont d'ailleurs  dÃ©sormais interdits.     
                                   Contact spÃ©cialisÃ©:      
Sorry about this long official link from Swiss authorities. It is not available in English, sorry.   
Basically it says that tortoises live a very long time- up to 120 years - and that therefore somebody who wants to buy one has to be committed for a life-time!! and beyond. Also that the cost a a sufficiently large terrarium with filters, etc, can cost several 1000 of CHF. Also that some species cannot be owned without an authorisation by the cantonal Vet. Of course only animals bred in CH can be owned - as they are a protected species and their import is strictly forbidden. Finally they state that abandoning a tortoise or any other animal in the countryside is totally forbidden and can cause not only cruelty to the animal but cause many environmental problems, with native species being wiped out by invasive species.   
Quite honestly, my honest and frank answer is a big NO.

			A lot of horse owners are desperatly looking for experienced riders to ride their horses.   
I was looking for an opportunity to ride for free too when I was twenty (14 years ago ) and I posted and ad in the PEGASUS magazine. I got more than 20 replies and of which I seriously considered 5. At the end I chose a horse I could ride for free and where I did not have to work in the stable. The only thing I had to do was to groom the horse before riding and to clean the tack every now and then.    
I am positive that you'll find something.

Still too much stuff in the house to find a home for after recent house move and need to work out getting some outdoor cat space organised first.  Hope details are finalised soon for him, whether it's just temporary until he can join you in Aus or whether he's off to a new permanent home here.  And good luck on your move too.

			Sure,    
I guess I thought that it was obvious that I'd be happy with their practical skills as well!    
Libby was treated with kindness and with respect. Listening to their level of knowledge and how the animal was handled during the visit lead me to have great trust on the quality of the work available there.    
Having been involved with animals (horses, cats, dogs, hamsters and other pets) most of my life, it's always a joy to find a veterinarian who not only has the knowledge and the experience for the job, but also has the ability (and interest) to explain procedures and practices, and how they apply locally.

			Eva,    
The links that jrspet has given cover it all - but just a comment:   
Regardless of whether you are required to take the SKN theory and practical courses, it's highly recommended that newcomers to Switzerland consider doing so, as it is a very good introduction to Swiss expectations of dog ownership. Which, as one might expect, are rather different than in many other countries.   
Not to mention, taking the courses means you'll meet a group of potential friends right away.      
(FYI, as a foreigner moving to CH with a dog you need to present your proof of having owned a dog prior to 1 Sept 2008 to the cantons VeterinarÃ¤mt. They will decide if the proof is sufficient to excuse you from the theory course.)       
And I assume that SchH3 is a Schutzhunde title? If so:   
During the anti-dog hysteria of the last few years, Schutzhunde training/sport came under the microscope. I really haven't paid much attention to that aspect of the TschV, as Schutzhund ain't my thang. But:   
From the BVEt brochure, Hunde Richtig Halten:         
(TR: Schutzhunde training is in principle prohibited, because it involves assault training. Exceptions are army, police and in some cases, dogs trained for sports competitions. In those cases, the training organization must be recognized by the BVet, and follow BVet regulations.)   
If you wish to continue Schutzhunde activities, I *think* you need to do so within a recognized club.  Hopefully someone involved in the activity will come along and confirm. But in any case, you should probably contact the Technische Kommission fÃ¼r das Gebrauchs- und Sporthundewesen (TKGS), the group within the SKG which regulates the sport. They could direct you to a club in your area, and advise you of any special hoops you have to jump through.       
(And if I've misunderstood what SchH3 is and have the wrong end of the stick, then my appologies - ignore the above.   )   
All the best to you and your doglet.

			You're welcome gnaula.  I just knew if I didn't take some money out of the current account and keep it safe somewhere else it would just end up being spent every month and if something calamitous happened then where would we be?   Made sense to stash it away in the post account, particularly as my OH had already opened both a bank and postal account then he first arrived here.  There was no point in having the postal one sitting doing nothing except incurring fees every month.

			Liver is high in vitamin A. That's the most likely reason you shouldn't feed it to a dog. It's the same reason that polar bear liver is toxic to humans. Vitiman A overdose is bad for doggy. (A quick google confirms this, but suggests that dogs love it, so a small amount should be ok - not withstanding the raw offal comment above).   
Heart is muscle - so, except for the tubes, it's just meat. Very tasty meat and far too good to give to dogs.   
Caveat. I am not a vet, nor a dog-lover.

			Not much help in this case, but if a dog is microchipped and registered to the legal owner, this sort of case would not happen. Surely the original owner has had to do the dog ownership course, and this would be done with the dog's name + owner, no?   
If the dog is happy and settled, I think it would be cruel to move it again- as said, it is not a toy.

1396	02.05.2012, 16:22	Member	Thanked 107 Times in 67 Posts	Location: Der Schweizer Mittelland	"    This is just my -- one long-time owner's -- opinion. Other dog people on the forum may have other opinions.    
As an owner you're allowed to use some discretion with what you have done. Sure, some things are required or highly recommended.    
Rabies vaccinations in Switzerland, I don't think, are a requirement anymore, but rather are optional, depending if/when/how much your dog travels abroad.    
Lepto is a vaccination that is only useful if you live in places where it is present. In the US, back in the 80s, DHLPP was a combo shot, but now it's more commonly given as DHPP and the Lepto is optional because Lepto is so rare. I think here in CH they still push the DHLPP though.    
Rabies and DH(L)PP come in yearly vaccinations and tri-annual vaccinations. I like the tri-annual, but if you're not staying put and your dog has to travel, it's a waste on the rabies, because you'll still have to have the annual vaccine for many situations, even if the tri-annual is still valid.    
Bordatella is  , particularly if you have a social dog or frequently board your dog at a kennel. It's also not expensive.    
Lyme disease tests are a waste of money unless you're runing around in the forests or your dog is always outside. If you've never pulled a tick off of your dog, Ã wouldn't bother with it. This is also a recent advent in veterinary care. I'd only started seeing this test pushed by vets in the past 3 years or so.    
Fecal float -- bah. I don't bother with this annually, but I do get it periodically. Again, if it's an indoor dog and they're not out eating shit (and I mean that literally) or garbage, then the odds of getting worms are nil.    
Dewormer -- This stuff is poison, and I won't allow it to go into my dog without a reason.  So it's gotta be a fecal float first or I have to have seen tapeworms in their stools.  I won't allow it ""just 'cause"".    
Heartworm test -- if you're routinely using prevention, then the annual heartworm test is also something that you can have done at discretion. Also, again, use your judgement. What's the risk? were there a lot of mosquitos? do you live near a wetland? Is your dog an indoor dog or an outdoor dog? I get this one infrequently as well.   
DENTAL -- don't forget the dental!!! Taking care of Fido's teeth is very important, because he's gotta keep those choppers for 10, 12, 15+ years! Be sure to discuss a professional cleaning with your vet, if one is necessary.

			It takes some aggressive chewing to keep plaque off the outside of the upper teeth.  Unless you have a dog that likes to chew stuff it can build up there.  My vet showed me how to remove plaque/tartar with a guitar pick once a month.  Works great!

Maybe the best thing to do is to determine a fixed place for the syringe and ampoule (e.g. blue jacket pocket) and I'd definitely ask the vet for multiples so you can either put them in several places (if you are the only one walking Herbie) or give them to all people responsible for Herbie.   
Fly nets might not be a bad idea either.   
I'm so happy to hear that the chance of it being some creep spreading poison shrank back to zero.   
I hope you all recover from the shock soon and that something like this never happens again.

			Do follow Glowjupiter's suggestion and check out the animal shelters.   
The Swiss-wide database of homeless animals can be found here:       
Searchable by canton, age, and various other characteristics. Although I would urge you not to limit your search by geography - Switzerland is such a small place, a few hours' drive to meet your new friend is worth the next decade or so of companionship.   
Also, check out the Geneva SPA, which doesn't seem to post much on the national database:         
Good luck with your search - and all the best with your new feline friend(s).       
(And if I might make a special plea - would you consider an older cat? Older animals have so much love to give, and there are so many in need of homes.)

			JBZ, in response to your question, you might find this article in today's Tagi interesting. IMO, the article - and the reader's comments following - pretty much sums up the current conflict between those who have/like and those who dislike dogs:       
The article talks about the Allmend Brunau, a well-known and well-loved green space that has been a 'Hundeparadis' for decades. The area is divided into a dog-free zone, a dogs may run off lead zone, and a dogs on lead zone. One would think that would limit the potential for conflict, wouldnt one? Apparently not...

			Hi Nil,   
I just wanted to say that I wish you a huge amount of strength for tomorrow - don't try to force yourself to do anything regarding Toutoune's passing and memory that you're not 100% comfortable with.  
I had the idea that maybe you could plant a small plant with your daughter as a ""burial"" (I mean this in the nicest way possible, please don't take it the wrong way!), so that she (and you) have a nice plant growing as a memory of Toutoune. Maybe a small flower bush?       "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Sep 2007	Groaned at 442 Times in 346 Posts	How to prepare kids for the lost of their pet friend?	Nil	Posts: 10,408

			I don't think there's anything surprising at all about lots of missing outdoor cats. There's a ton of dangers out there for outdoor cats, I see dead ones all the time on the side of the road, and I imagine that hungry foxes are pretty happy to find a cat during leaner months. I grew up in the country and between wildlife and cars our cats had a lifespan of around 5 years or so.   
Honestly, being a homeowner has pretty much turned me into an outdoor cat hater. As a dog owner, I'm used to being responsible for my pet. I pick up his crap, protect him from danger, and prevent him from hurting other animals, damaging other people's property, or bothering people who don't really want to be around dogs for whatever reason. I can't for the life of me figure out how people can send their cats outside and abdicate any responsibility about the animal's safety, the rights and safety of your neighbors and their pets, and the welfare of wild and in many cases threatened and endangered animals. But hey I guess it means you don't have to clean a litter box!

Chat va bien had been recommended to us but they had no space for the dates we needed as it was quite short notice. They do indeed take small pets such as guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils etc as well as cats but I don't think they take dogs. (or maybe just small ones).

			Can't give you a personal recommendation in Horgen (our trainer is in Wollerau), but a good place to start would be with the BVet database of SKN certified trainers:       
Most of the SKN trainers offer other training programs as well. Are you looking to do something like Familienhund classes? Obedience?  Or Rally-O? One-to-one behavioral work?  Or something like the HHB?

			I have a Cavalier King Charles spaniel and she's about 7kg, but she is very very very submissive, even with dogs much smaller than herself.  We put her in a great kennel from time to time so she is getting more confident around dogs, but still shy.  I'd love to get her a playmate.  I live in zug, so not too far.

			I'll always remember meeting my first 'de-clawed' cat when visiting the US. The hosts thought it was hilarious that I was so shocked about it, and so upset. For them it was the norm- for me it was evil. Not comparable to indoor cats- but just to illustrate cultural differences.   
Over my life time, we have had so many cats, and all bar one lived to be 18+ years having fun outside. As BelgianMum says, it would never occur to me to adopt a cat unless it could be outside when it chose to. There are many other pets which are much more suited to an indoor life.   
However, I cannot understand why rescue would not be happy to re-home an older cat who has been raised as an indoor cat.

Most of the breeders are in France, Germany or Italy.  So.... we broke down for Italy and a good breeder.

			Hi All,   
Thanks for your help. I do believe I reacted in a way like you mentioned...""OH, this is the best so she must have it."" Especially since all the ingredients are locally sourced and it is 100% manufactured by them. And the argument for high protein makes sense.    
And my previous food was made in Italy...where I am not sure the regulation on dog food is very good, even though Qualipet said it was. I always remember that the 20 year old working at the counter may not have the same knowledge, or care level, that I do. She also has issues with ""tear staining"", which in my mind meant something is not perfect, though many people tolerate this. But, this food was very good on my dog's stomach and no problems. However, it was rated low for lack of actual protein and lots of fillers.    
But when we switched to the ""perfect food"", she had gas, digestive problems, constant diarrhea, and allergies started (such as small pimples on skin and licking of paws). However, with her experiencing her first spring (winter baby), I also wondered if this might be airborne allergies. But, the diarrhea was not good, and I could she is visibly uncomfortable on this food. So it's out.    
I started feeding a homemade diet of rice and hamburger, but always worry about the lack of vitamins with a really excellent supplement.   
So I slowly started to introduce ACANA. And unfortunately, once starting with ARCANA, the same thing happened again. So I started feeding a homemade diet of rice and scrambled eggs, with carrots and peas. I also adding a small amount of natural yogurt to settle her stomach and give her some digestive enzymes. And again she was fine.   
But yes, what is good in my eyes may not meet the specific needs of my dog. My original need to switch was prompted by her eating dirt and leaves off the ground. Probably a puppy issue, as my vet says, but I wanted to make sure her diet was providing her with all the vitamins and minerals as many junk dog foods exist. Just in case she was trying to supplement for something that was missing. I want to listen if her instinct is trying to do something besides annoy me.    
And after all, with these high protein diets meant to be closer to the ""natural"" diet, I must also consider...now ""natural"" or ""wild"" is my 5 kg. Maltese. Probably not able to handle that diet, though perhaps her ancestors where. If I gave her a raw bone, she would probably just look at it with a confused expression.    
So, this leads me to where we are today. It seems her best diet is boiled meat or scrambled eggs with a rice.   
So as some of you mentioned, I started to listen to her...well...poop.   I decided to get a great food, 100% made in Switzerland, (so ingredients are highly controlled) with a similar breakdown to what her body likes the most. Plus the vitamins and enzymes preferably.   
So I am going with AllFarm's ""Swiss Natural - Professional Pet Food"". It seems all this food is made in Switzerland...and must be directly ordered from the company in Weiermatt. They make horse food, and other professional dog food. The breakdown for their Junior food seems to be exactly what she does best on when I feed her a homemade diet.       
So, today is her first day off the rice + eggs, and I am slowly mixing in 1/4 of the new food. So far so good. She seems happy, no problems, and we will have to wait for the skin issues and paw licking for a few more days until the other stuff is out of her systems.   
I want to eventually do some allergy testing, since she is 5 months and we have a lifetime of feeding her, and I want to make sure we are aware of any issues she has so we can avoid naturally and keep her off medication. But as a puppy, someone suggested I wait till she is a bit older and might outgrow it.   
Anyway.....I will keep you posted. This new food looks great, and I will try to avoid the pet store junk if I can. It is only a bit more money to try and feed them the best, and why not? The dog is really my best friend...so I should try my best for her.   
And yesterday, I FOUND A TICK ON HER. The season is coming and now to make a decision about what to use for that in this new country. So from one problem to the next.....

			Just as  a follow up: stay on the USDA's butt. I've had multiple conversations with them about requirements, documentation etc etc after I submitted my permit application. I even sent them follow up documents that they asked for. I called last Friday (after a few emails and less than a week before we are to leave) asking why they haven't emailed it to me yet. After that phone call, I got an email asking me to resubmit my application and they'd take care of it on Monday. No admission that they'd done anything wrong or 'lost' it. Just 'sorry for the inconvenience'.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 97 Times in 57 Posts	Returning to US with US origin birds	phdoofus	Posts: 2,364

			Nil, I've obviously got no idea what's required in Spain but here certainly finches, canaries and ""budgies"" / ""parakeets"" are sold only in pairs (or more), unless they're going to a  home with a lonely one.   
If you want to try it and see what you think, try the local animal shelters to see if they have any (and are willing to allow you to ""test drive""), or if they know of folks looking for a pet-sitter while away on vacation.       Well, except in the US we call them ""parakeets"".           
I like this idea (particularly once I got that you meant nest rather than ""net""  ) as one of my objections to birds is that they are messy (particularly in groups) and can get lonely.    
Attracting birds to a spot that's near enough for you to enjoy them but still allowing for their wild freedom seems ideal to me. I know there are flower seed mixes you can get that are specifically chosen to help increase butterfly (or other desirable insect) visits, perhaps there are also specific flowers or plants you can get which will attract birds. The benefit of this being that (hopefully) the flowers / plants will still be allowed to grow, even if / when you move away.

			My last dog was a rescue corgixjack russell who was so smart.   
Because of my security system when I went out I used to put her in my daughter's room as you could shut the door firmly and I knew she would not trigger the system.   
A couple of times I would get home and she would be sitting on the stairs up to the next floor looking sheepish and I first thought it was me going crazy and forgetting to put her in the room.   
When it happened again, I examined the room and discovered that she was pulling a string on a bag that was hanging on the door - it would have been quite hard to do that.   
As I had blown her cover I removed the bag and put her in the room and went out. When I returned I thought that I had been visited by intruders as the room was thrashed!! All my daughters college work had been ripped and shreaded and the mess was incredible.   
She must have been so mad that we had discovered her trick   "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: Aug 2011	Groaned at 6 Times in 5 Posts	Dog tricks and games	TexasLynette	Posts: 365

			I've never heard about buying a spayed rat in Switzerland. Guinea pigs, yes, but not rats.    
I'm all for rescue centers. But considering that the life-span of a rat is 1.5-2 years, which is nothing, if you adopt a rescue rat you may have only a few months with your animal...   
That's why I eventually stopped adopting rats. I would get so attached to them, and they leave us so soon, it was a drama each time. .  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	where to buy dumbo rats?	sophiamcd	Posts: 12

			Clone,    
What type of care arrangement is that?   
If boarding at a kennel, care in the sitter's home, or care in your own home that is actually a very inexpensive price. You may find something less expensive, but if so - please check the qualifications of the carer, and scrutinize the conditions very carefully.   
Given that dog care is a regulated business - and one very much in demand - prices here are indeed high. As you can see in other posts, CHF 50-100 is normal for kennels or in the sitter's home, CHF 200 for care in your home.   
That said, if your dog copes well in kennels, one place where you might find a slightly better price would be with one of the rescue shelters - many provide boarding for paying clients as well. (This is provides some support for their rescue efforts.) But as above, check out the conditions, and do a few trial run stays first.   
Hope you find a good solution.

			One other thing that I have really noticed here are the ticks. My two pick them up all the time so definitely treat them regularly. I do walk them in grassy areas a lot and they have fairly long coats. I just get into the habit of checking them after even walk and I can catch them before they attach themselves.

She gets a totally clean bill of health from the vet, but she's just got something of a delicate stomach.   
A few tricks -- make sure that you only serve food at room temperature, not directly out of the refrigerator.  Also make sure that you groom your cat regularly.  Sometimes they make themselves sick trying to get rid of hairballs (the give-away is that they'll typically chew on your plants to induce vomiting).  If you feed your cat exclusively dry food, consider adding wet food or oil to help 'lubricate' the digestive track and keep everything working its way through.

1459	24.02.2012, 16:02	Forum Legend	Thanked 4,418 Times in 1,867 Posts	Location: Lutry	"    I have visited many kennels and there are always dogs barking. Some might be playing, others might be lonely, or it can be mealtime.   I don't think barking is encouraged or discouraged. I think it is just expected. That is why most kennels are located in rural areas, often remote. Kennels have indoor and outdoor space. Be sure to ask if the kennel has heating as winter is not over yet.    
Our dogs are always very happy to come home after a stay at the kennels. I haven't noticed any changes in behaviour.    
What is usually of concern is dogs who are very unhappy at the kennels and some refuse to eat. That has never been a problem with ours.   
I suggest if you can that you kennel your dog at least once before the two week stay, even for just one night. We did that just so the staff would get to know our dogs, and also to reassure them that we were coming back to get them. Some kennels encourage a trial stay so do ask about this at the kennel where you intend to leave your dog.

			The click-clacking drives me nuts as well.   
Two options I can think of:   
1. Get a Dremel to grind/sand down your dog's nails. It might take some getting used to the noise but my reading suggests its less stressful and the quick won't bleed. With lots of treats and soothing words your dog should adapt quickly.   
2. Get PAWZ, little rubber balloons for your dog's feet. They are great for outside, but as they are rubber I'm not sure how well they'll ""breathe"" if your dog is wearing them inside the house. Maybe you'd need to take them off at night or if you're not there.

So I tried the lint catchers, I bought 6, so thought 3 in the wash, 3 in the dryer. The packaging warns ""do not use with wool or delicates"", but being a man I ignored this of course.   
Point number 1) Follow the advice, the socks are fine, so are the delicates, but the balls seems to be completely wrapped in them. Even so it works well.   
Point number 2) use them either in the wash or the dryer. As the ones in the wash worked well, there was no hair or lint on the ones in the dryer, however the lint catcher in the dryer (the one on the door) was fuller than normal. So I think the fact that they are in there agitates the clothing more, but I'm no expert.   
Sidenote, the ""balls"" are basically plastic tubes with velcro wrapped around them to form a ball shape. It seems the ""hooks"" are longer than the velcro I know, but otherwise the same.   
I hope this helps.

			Great breed! It was always my favorite and first choice until I realized that I just couldn't give a Viszla what he needed (and ended up with the guy in my avatar who has energy for three...but that's another topic )   
I had contact with these guys         
They seemed very nice and I had a good impression from what they answered to my questions. I did not visit them though. By the way, the have just had a litter of pups   
good luck!

Not only will this let dogs of all sizes run off leash, but it will allow dogs to socialize with each other and with people who are assuredly dog friendly.    
Such a pitty the Swiss won't give green space for this purpose.

1474	15.01.2012, 16:55	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    The question I would ask is: is this indivudual owner suitable for this particular pom?    
The one pom I know well, a dog who came into rescue after her owner decided that handbag dogs were so last season   , came in spinning, shadow chasing, and self-harming probably due to the way she had been treated treated: like a doll, not a dog.   
In her new home (with a sensible owner who had solid rehab experience), the pom lives with a rottweiler, a dobe, and a GSD - and certainly keeps up with the big dogs on their long treks over hill and dale, swims like a fish, plays in mud puddles, runs like the wind for sheer joy  - and generally has a whale of a time just being a dog. She enjoys training, especially clicker training - and having conquered the behavioral baggage she came in with, she is now working on her canine good citizen awards. Oh, and she rules the roost - the big dogs have learned their place.    
Not a handbag dog any longer.    
About the breed in general: The Spitz group are active dogs - they will need stimulation, both mental and physical - this must be taken into account.    
I am loathe to make blanket judgements about dogs in appartments, as appartment life is the norm in Switzerland. If we only rehomed to folks in detached houses the PTS rate would be sky-high. Rather, it is important to assess the dog's individual needs, and determine how this particular family will meet all the dog's needs in light of their particular housing situation.   
Creative solutions can be found for many housing situations   the family make the dog's needs a priority - now, and on-going. This takes time, absolute commitment, and often additional resources, including money. Additionally, one must consider neighborhood norms, and the particular neighborhood the family lives in.   
(The flip side is my situation - I had the perfect dog-friendly house. I have the space, the land, the time, the commitment, the resources. My herd - I had five living here at one time - thrived in my home environment and were well like in the Quartier. And then the neighbors from hell moved in, and my 'canine paradise' is now no longer suitable for dogs.)   
Bottom line: I find it best to make assessments on an individual basis.

			Hello,   
Been reading this forum for a couple of years now unregistered but this post has moved me you could say    
I have been keeping herps for around 12 years and this refusal to eat is normal.  I have a 10-12 yrs old python who does this to me at least every year or two.  The worst time was for like 6-7 months.  I wouldn't worry too much.  I typically feed my snakes each 2-4 weeks...usually after a defecation.  Has yours gone since the last feeding?  If not, you could soak him in a bowl of water (max. temp: luke warm) for about 15-20 minutes and then message him GENTLY.   
I would recommend though that you NEVER ever leave live rats/mice in the cage with your snake...this could turn into a very sad situation where rat ends up eating snake.   
Currently have a 1.5 yr old Green Tree Python, 10-12 yrs old Ball Python, and a black/gold Boa (unsure of his age but I've had him for 2 yrs now so I would guess around 4yrs old). To top it off my wife has 2 Leopard Geckos and we have 5 cats    
You could say we run a small zoo at home    
Hope this helps!

			I found two groomers cards at the kennel and at Qualipets once.  I used to have an Airedale so was in the lookout for a groomer.  I didn't get to try them though.   
When I have asked people at the park who they used to groom their dogs I've been told they do them themselves.   
What kind of dog do you have? 
That's all I can think of, good luck.

			Interesting article in today's NZZ about the rise in cases of dogs infected by Heart- and Lungworm* ( ) in Switzerland. The parasite larvae is often found in slugs/snails; dogs (and foxes) who eat these are at a risk for infection.    
The number of cases reported is still relatively small, but one should be aware. (I remember when the mutts and I first arrived; it was thought back then that Switzerland was more or less free of the parasite.) One hypothesis for the spread is the increase in the fox population in urban areas.       
Looking ahead to spring (or slug season, as it's known here   ) it's probably a good idea to discuss your individual risk with your veterinarian.     
*Please note that this is NOT the same misquito-born Heartworm,  , with which many Americans or folks from tropical countries are familiar. In the UK,    is sometimes called 'French Heartworm'. (Although that is generally thought to be something of a misnomer...)

			We found one at Qualipet.  It works better than anything else we have tried.  I think it was CHF 5.  The only problem we have had is that small pills don't stay in the tip very well so they sometimes fall out before you get it into the dogs mouth.  Also, we have found coating the pill in a bit of bacon grease or peanut butter helps it slide right down.   
Good luck!

""fluegel stuetzen""......thanks I like the ring of that! You are right Snoopy, that is exactly what happened. I used ""Schneiden"" believing it clearly NOT defined as ""wegnehmen"" or ""amputieren"".   
We got through the nail clipping and the fluegel stuetzen very well. The vet was experienced, and very gentle with the birds.   
I must correct my post above. I confused where she is located with something else in St. Gallen.    
She is in Kanton Zug and I would recommend her from what I saw on the first visit. She only does birds and reptiles but there are other vets that treat other animals.

1490	24.01.2012, 23:07	Forum Veteran	Thanked 1,633 Times in 563 Posts	Location: UK, formerly Vaud	"    I agree a sign of the times. Vets in the UK will never turn an animal away though  But unfortunately this has led to abuse of their own system where people have requested euthanasia for their animal, then are unable to pay for the cost. I believe a vet in the UK must agree to the request unless they feel its completely unnecessary. So then when the person doesnt pay the vet is left with an unpaid bill and at putsressure on their practice and subsequently other honest clients  So sad.    
Insurance is a good option to spread payments even if they are not sick all the time. I've had my cats 10 years. I started off with insurance for them. Then stopped a few years ago as they were never sick and I thought it was a waste of money. Unfortunately, one of our cats developed kidney failure and now that I stopped the insurance our vet bills are steep. If only I had kept paying the insurance, which isn't that much in the long term. Animals will get Ill as they get older, even if it's a small thing. That's what I have learnt.

			Hi,   
Did you ever get a solution for your grey? 
I hope you are/were able to bring him.   
I have an African Grey, I live in Zurich and have no problems with my neighbours. 
But keep it in mind when choosing an apartment, maybe aim for a duplex or something as they create more space between you and your neighbours.   
It is illegal to only have one here though, something causing me some worry at the moment. 
But there is a place where you can take your bird and they will help him find a friend that you can take home.   
Always nice to chat with another grey owner btw - and welcome to Switzerland.

1498	18.01.2012, 13:32	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 12 Times in 7 Posts	Location: Basel	"    Having brought two cats over this past August ourselves, I can tell you a little about our experience and answer your questions relative to this experience.     
We had to have our cats microchipped with a specific type of microchip compatible with the readers used in Europe. (Not all vets carry this microchip) After that microchipping, the cats had to receive a rabies vaccination (even if they were previously vaccinated, it had to be done   the microchipping.  The veterinarian had to perform a health examination and certify the cats' health, vaccination, and microchipping on   and EU/Swiss form, as well as a USDA form (required by the US Domestic airlines).   The form then had to be notarized by a USDA official. (3-hour round-trip drive for us)  The examination and notarization could not be done more than 10 (or 14?) days prior to the trip, for it to be valid.   
Additionally, we had to contact our airline (Delta) to determine the fees and requirements for flying with the animals (we wanted to bring them on the plane with us) as each airline has similar (but different enough to require researching individually) requirements.  We then had to purchase two soft-sided animal carriers small enough to fit under the seats, absorbent piddle pads (like the kind used for housebreaking- it is a long trip) for any 'accidents', some sort of sedative/relaxant to use on the flight (again, a long flight, and you don't want everyone hating you because your cat is mewling the whole flight), and pay an additional $100 per animal fee to the airline.  We also packed two small bowls, one for food and the other for water, as well as some food for their trip.  Also note that each animal carrier counts as a carry-on item.   
The day of the flight, to clear security, we had to remove the cats from their carriers, take off their collars, and carry them individually through the metal detectors.  Meanwhile their carriers were screened like any other baggage.  The flight itself was extremely stressful, as we worried about everything from the cats disrupting the flight to possible adverse effects from the sedative we were using.   
Upon arrival in Zurich, we had to declare the cats at customs, where the official very quickly scanned our paperwork, did not look at the cats, stamped the paperwork, and sent us on our way.  This was both relieving (for its simplicity and lack of fees- we had been told to expect to pay a duty) and frustrating (we had gone to a lot of effort to have the paperwork in order, and   even examined the paperwork) for us.   
When we were searching for apartments, we did have to disclose our pets, and we found it was about 50/50 on which apartments allowed pets.  Several of the 'no-pet' apartments told us that this was put in place mainly for large dogs, and indoor-only cats were okay.  Our landlord did ask us to sign some additional paperwork regarding our pets (regarding liability for injury/damages) and I believe we had to provide additional deposit as well.  Our neighbors have been accepting of our cats also, but I have read/heard stories where this is not always the case.      Its not required that they see a vet in Switzerland.  Since you are only planning on staying for 5 months, I would just note where a good vet is, in case of emergency, and plan on getting them checked right before returning.      See our experience above.  Only if they have not been vaccinated since their microchipping and/or only if their current vaccine is more than one year old.      We have not crossed that bridge yet, but I would imagine they will require recertification before returning to the US.  And the return trip will be equally stressful and complicated as the inbound trip.     
IMO, for 5 months this is a LOT of stress & trouble for both you and your pets.  As much as I understand the desire to keep your pets with you, it might be much less stressful for yourself and your cats (as well as less expensive) if you let them 'visit' with a trusted family member while you are gone.   
If you do decide to bring them, and your company is paying to ship your belongings to Switzerland, we recommend you purchase anything pet-related for these 5 months in the US (this includes food, litter, scratching posts, treats, bedding, and toys) as it will be vastly cheaper to do it this way and include them in your shipment if you have room.     
Sorry this is soo long, but I hope it helps!

			Make sure you check with your own country about the export rules for each pet. You also need to determine if your snake is covered under the CITES treaty or not. In that case you'll also need a CITES permit.

			OP dont worry. We went through the same process two years ago. The day we brought the puppy home, the cat had just given birth. You can imagine. Puppy being curious going close to the kittens, mummy and daddy cat not very happy, puppy easily found out who is the boss.    
We didnt do anything special. We just left them alone to deal with it. We must have done a good job since now they all sleep together

			Thank-you to everyone for taking the time to reply. It is much appreciated.  
We have now organised our travel arrangements and I now need to learn to relax and stop double/treble checking everything.  
We are going to fly him back with Swissair. They will allow him in the cabin with me (unlike many airlines) and will also allow him to travel under 12 weeks. B.A. minimum age is 10 weeks.  
I fly into Zurich and then catch the train into Basel. We have also organised a pet friendly hotel the night before so we can at least bond a little.  
Our breeder's vet will not do the rabies jab before 12 weeks (I am glad) but will issue the pet passport and a letter for the swiss customs stating that he hasn't been in contact with wild animals etc.  
I would like to think I have everything covered but as I found my car keys in the  fridge once again, please let me know if there is anything I have not considered.  
We are so excited to welcome our little boy to Switzerland. Just need to enjoy Christmas & then get the journey over as safely and smoothly as possible  
Thank-you once again to all who replied

			Wow - it sounds like the kennel's prompt intervention alleviated a very serious situation. Kudos to them.   
I'm glad you have spoken to the kennel - now you must speak to the vet. It will be important to have this included in your dog's medical records for future reference, for you to understand your dog's health issues going forward.   
For instance - was a histology done on the tumor? If so, what were the findings?  What is the prognosis? What follow-up care is required?    
Most vets speak English; but if you have trouble communicating with the vet ask him/her to write a report in German and send it to your own vet. (I'm assuming that you speak English with your own vet.)   
If all else fails, I'd be happy to translate the German report for you. My command of German is far from fluent, but I have a fair bit of practice with 'Vet-Deutsch'.     
All the best to your doglet.

			Hi Robina,   
maybe you saw this thread:     
Summerain mentioned:   
As for recommendations wise, it really depends on where in Zurich you live. I used to bring my dog to Dr Buchler in Hongg. Dr Buchler is very experienced, extremely professional and a highly skilled surgeon. He did my dog's castration and removal of an extra toe with minimal scarring (in fact, I cant find any!). His details are:   
Dr. med. vet. Emil BÃ¼chler 
Hohenklingenstrasse 45 
8049 ZÃ¼rich 
Tel. +41 (0) 44 341 07 07   
Good luck!

			Hello Minimi. 
 I can translate some German. I can understand French (and English, of course) but know that in Switzerland can understand several languages ââ(German, French, English ...). I hope find the information in Switzerland directly. 
 By avoiding middlemen. I was at several show. Here are just looking for breeders economic interest always ask how much you can spend before you give information. I think more interesting to have information here to plan my trip to Switzerland. 
 Thanks for your help!

			i am continuously surprised by the dog related discussions in EF. somebody (favorably) compares dog barking with noise from playing children, others wish to import a pittbull which they admit will have ""problems"", while people continue to whine about CH cities (intended for human habitation) not being friendly enough for dogs while they are the friendliest in the world...i understand you guys are on a mission to change the worldwide culture related to dogs, but i think you are going overboard with this and there must be a particular psychological background about certain human beings attaching so much to an animal...   
OK, bring on the groans now!

			Hi   
We have not gone ahead with the dog house as we moved apartment and have a balcony over head to protect them from weather.    
We don't want our dogs outside for hours. Firstly, our youngest would bark and secondly in harsh weather conditions I don't think it's right.    
It's purely for comfort as we love our large critters.

			I don't neccessarily think leather is a favourite for cats, but as someone else said, it depends a lot on the cat. Our previous cats never seemed to go for any furniture, this new young cat has so far not attempted to savage any furniture on purpose. His favourite is the door mat, that is the only thing i have seen him clawing. you really can ""train"" cats away from things they are not allowed - they do seem to understand ""no"". Of course, unlike dogs, they also seem to choose whether or not to listen!!

			Thanks for all of these great posts - lots to think about and ask ourselves - I can see that we will have a lot of dog discussions over the next few weeks.  The theory course I am doing is in early December so I assume that we could get a dog at anytime after that.  Does anyone know if tierheims here experience an influx of dogs in the new year as a result of ill conceived Christmas presents?   
Melloncollie, I'll find out about dog walking at the tierheim and take the children down Ullainga, what a lovely offer - it's be nice to meet up, I'll PM you.   
One thing concerns me though is the attitude of people to dogs here - is it really bad?  I'm used to the UK and France, where dogs are really very much liked and accepted.  I'm sensing here, that here folk don't like dogs so much and are quite wary.  Is this really the case?

			I was not expecting that my first SOS call would end up on me posting what Tana is going through - but it is such a relieve to share it...    
So surgery went well - The vet found two perforations which were removed (15cm I believe I heard) and they are testing if it was caused by a tumor, which may get back in future. Right now the most important thing is to recover and the next 3 days are critical.    
Tierspital in Zurich, oh my god, they are showing me that Tana (and I) couldnÂ´t be in better hands.

			I try them all.    
There is one that Qualipet sell, but it has been re-branded. It's now called BioKat. You can get it in 20kg bags. This stuff is good.       
Since one of my cats died (RIP Pussolini) - The other one doesn't generate as much and I use Catsan. I now use a mixture of the two which works really well.   
I also use something similar to this. The boys love to kick up a storm inside the box and litter would otherwise go everywhere. Also, they sometimes can't be bothered (or maybe it's just fun to watch me clean it up) but they have been known to think/shit outside the box.       
I also use thick plastic liners. These are marvelous. The boys don't scratch them and it makes removing the chunks easy. Just lift the sand from side to side by lifting the plastic liner. All the chunks roll to the top for easy retrieval.

			Don't be too pessimistic. Our cat, Tacha, has been deemed too fat during her annual checkup.  Sure the local vet (Nyon, VD) has sold me dietary biscuits but also allows me to pop in without rdv for weighing and extra advice (without costs). By the way, the practice also provided me with lots of free samples in advance, in order to check what she will actually agree to eat!

			Hi 
Just booking my Xmas Channel Tunnel back to Blighty with dog and saw that as of Jan 1st 2012 it is no longer compulsory to have the tick/worm treatment performed 24/48 hours prior to entering the country. The recommendations are that is still advisable- but one suspects the stringent timings will now no longer exist. Personally, I am relieved that this stress has been removed from the whole travelling back to UK process- we have had many problems over the years working out when we can leave- all dependannt on when we could get to see a vet. 
Personally, I would continue to monitor things prior to travelling- hope this site helps.    "	earned some respect	Join Date: Oct 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Changes to legislation when travelling to the UK with a dog	ShazzaMcGowan	Posts: 44

			Hello,   
This is my first post on EnglishForum even though I've been in Fribourg since October 2008. I've often used the site for advice since I have been in Switzerlandia and found it VERY helpful.   
I have a 8 month old GSD bitch and we would love to go for walkies with like minded animal friendly people. 
It would improve puppies socialisation not to mention mine as well    
We are available on weekends and/or after work and are willing travel.   
I hope to hear from you soon 
Best wishes 
Zoe

			Additionally to the suggestions others have made - I've seen something like   for the intention of freshening up pets with a bit of between-bath spot cleaning. I'm thinking the ones at pet store are maybe a bit more safe for pets who will likely lick themselves after, otherwise some of the moist-tp or baby wipes would probably work.

When we were in the city, we loved going for off-leash walks behind Sihlcity. Lots of dogs and lots of friends. Or the Kafferberg forest up on the ETH is a great trail. You can walk through the forest or just play in the open fields. Look out for ticks, we use the Scalibor collar which can be bought easily from any vet and it has proven effective.

			Him being young and and active it is a bit of a struggle to keep him calm, after all you can't tell him : ""Slow down man, you have a weak heart"", well you could, but he wouldn't understand.   
Thanks for the tip about the medication, we were told to give it to him for three months and then come for another checkup to see if it has helped him.   
I never knew there were so many dogs with heart issues! Thanks for sharing your experience with me, he is our 4th dog and this is the first time we have such a serious health problem in a dog.

There is no guarantee that a dog will not attack regardless of its origins - be it a reputable breeder or a shelter. Of course I see the point where by you get a full picture of a dog's history if you get him from a breeder which some people do prefer. Here's the retrievers club in Switzerland, in particular, golden retrievers breeders:       
I spoke to them when I was first considering this breed 3 years ago but went back to my terrier obsession in the end. The breeders are all knowledgable and extremely friendly over the phone, but please ensure that you get the SKN theory course out of the way first. Any reputable Swiss breeder will not entertain you now if you havent done that course.    
Good luck and I hope you find the perfect new member of your family soon tnt!

			Thank you Meloncollie. Sorry, in a rush here - can't write as much as I'd like. Everything you say has already occurred to me. Space & time (given the strange complexity of the tale) didn't allow for going into all the apologies and such. Everything (except the dog: Multu) is a complete and total train wreck - and extremely angry making. No: I've got nothing to do with coming to Switzerland or anything Swiss - I'm just someone who became aware of Multu: through his friendship with my dog. Thanks for all the info of quality animal care groups here in Spain. That's kind of what I was looking for. I'm just putting a lot of stuff out there to see if something works out - even if completely unexpected. I just became aware of ""teirhilfe"" they are some distance away - but possible. The swiss groups in Spain my be very helpful - maybe these two Swiss people can speak to them and get some ideas. 
   Yes, Gee: don't I know about : being responsible for the dog etc: tell me about it: but what can I do: here is the situation as presented: freaking out on these two now doesn't help Multu. 
   I would LOVE to foster Multu - but it's a complete possibility: I'm pretty much penniless myself and live in an apartment provided by my brother and his family: their furniture etc... my own dog Maddie is already a source of strain  & stress.  Yea: this story doesn't want for woe. 
   Like I said: thanks. Just trying to see what shakes out in every direction.

			depending on the offer stable costs range from 700 to 1500 Fr... if you just rent a place and do all the mucking out/feeding etc etc you can get a bit cheaper. 
what are you looking for exactly?

1547	09.11.2011, 19:47	Member	Thanked 65 Times in 40 Posts	Location: Gebenstorf	"    Good point, Mrs. Doolittle. I didn't think about mentioning the fact that both are not spayed... which I will comment on the next time she comes over to complain.    
This past week the cats did not come by. Seems my neighbor is working on her bonding problem.....although cats that stop by tend to continue to stop by here - even after I am away for a while. I guess I am hard to forget!      
The dog is one I have pet sat on several occasions. It is a dog that was adopted by an elderly lady after her two dogs had to be put down due to old age. The dog was placed for adoption by a family who was leaving Switzerland and who couldn't take the dog with them  . Although he loves his new home, he comes by to visit after noticing that I have passed by HIS house during the day. (It is almost a given: I go by in the morning and he stops by later on in the day.)  When possible, I avoid going past his house.  No he does not live in a fenced yard. He just comes by to say hello to all of us and then is walked home. He is also very kind to the cats that stop by.

			My heart goes out to you, Sue. I had to put my gorgeous, slobby Newf to sleep a few years ago and it almost tore me apart. But, he'd lived in dignity and I wanted him to die in dignity, so it was the only choice I had. 
I'll be thinking of you both.

I just didn't understand why that man felt so offended by us as we had our dog at our feet, far from him and his way more aggressive dogs... I guess they didn't get the chance to be socialize with other dogs a lot....

			Not in the area, but...   
Many years ago we tried Kynofit in Effretikon with one of my DM collies. He did lake swimming much of the year, but in winter we needed something indoors. At the time, Kynofit was one of the few places offering water therapy for dogs.       
Back then they only had the water treadmill - which freaked my guy out. (He had lots of psychological as well as physical issues.)  I  ultimately decided because of his  mental discomfort in the tank that this was not the right solution for him. However, the staff were quite good, competent at handling him, seemed knowledgeable, etc.   
I see that they now have a pool - this would have been a better option for my guy.   
We only went a couple of times, and this was years ago - so you'll want to investigate on your own. But they would be worth a look.     
A friend goes (went?) to Canesano in Winterthur - I have no personal knowledge of them, though:       
While he doesn't offer water therapy, you might want to consult the physiotherapist at the Spezialistenklinik in HÃ¼nenberg ZG if you are interested in exploring other therapies. He also has his own praxis in Birmensdorf ZH:       
I could swear I've heard that the Tierspital has hydrotherapy facilities, but I couldn't find any mention on their website. Hmmm...     
Often you need an OK from your vet to start therapy (depending on the reason you are seeking treatment), so asking your vet for a hydro recommendation might also be a good start.     
Good luck - I hope you find a place that suits you and your dog. Hydrotherapy can do wonders for our doglets.

			Hi,   
I had a similar case with one of our dogs and it turned out to be duck mite (puces de canard) which they can get from going into infested water such as a lake or even a puddle!  It is very difficult to see the mites with the naked eye.  The vet gave an anti-biotic injection and also some ointment to rub into the skin on the dog's tummy and he was soon better.  The rash was bright red like a load of tiny spots.   
Hope that the rash clears up soon.

			If you want to be sure what your dog's personality is like when he is an adult, you have to get an adult dog. There are no guarantees with puppies, even if you try your best.

			I'm not an expert on cats, but dogs can get stomach bugs, just like us (albeit not from the same virus).    
My doggie got one at the beginning of the year, and after a week of loose stools (getting worse) she ended up at the vet.

			In that case, I suggest you consider getting an older cat rather than a kitten.  Unless you have plenty of things to keep he/she/them occupied while you're away you may come home to shredded socks, broken items, etc.  An older cat will have gone through much of its playful stage and be more inclined to leave breakables alone.   
Also I think you'll find that most of the refuges these days suggest getting two kittens to keep each other company so you could have twice the problems.  It's not a hard and fast rule, but something they'd prefer if you could.   
The best thing to do is have a look at the animal-sans-foyer.ch website which covers all cantons in Switzerland.  This will give you an idea of what cats are available, their pros and cons, etc. which will help you make an informed choice.  If you find a cat/s you're interested in then contact the appropriate refuge and take it from there.

			Hello Telandy   
I have aquarium tank sealant with me and would of course be glad to give it to you free. I will be in Zurich in about 4 - 5 weeks (Zurich). If you have not found anything by then let me know.   
I have to leave my fish tank behind, unfortunately.   
As rob1 suggested DO NOT USE normal sealant under any case.

			Poor little guy! Unless he is back to his old self, I would go and have his chip checked. I know that my two definitely act a bit weird when I collect them when they are dropped off, but as soon as I get them inside to out flat, and give them their baths, they are licking my face off and running around like wild dogs! I have my little sensitive one that gets a muscle flare up (from stress) sometimes that happens after he gets home the next day or so. However they are always themselves, and of course after the initial lick fest, they will ignore me for an hour or so, punishing me for their stay away.   But then they go back to there clinging selves!   GL!

They have a hundesalon as part of the business. It is about 80CHF for a bath/grooming, maybe more for a haircut. My dog is a little nervous, but they're very nice to her and she gets a bath, nails, ears done.    
They're located right off the A6, Rubigen exit (south of Bern).

			The relationship between man and dog runs so deep. It has been proven that dogs have detected cancers in their owners. 
So many dogs are used in making their owners life have a quality that without them would be impossible - think of the dogs who are ""hearing dogs"", Guide dogs etc.   
Whilst the subject of children was mentioned - a lot of elderly people have children who are frankly waiting for them to die. They are not interested in them at all and having known someone in that position the companionship their pet gave them was keeping them going.   
The love I have had from my dogs far exceeded that that I had when I was growing up from humans - they made me the person I am today - when I lost them it broke my heart.

			How comfortable are you with the other owner and dog? If you were to be concerned that things were getting out of hand, would you be able to intervene? Do you think the other owner generally have the same ideas/philospohy about dog training?    
The important thing is to have the interaction be successful. Riotous play that both dogs enjoy is the most wonderful thing. Riotous play where one dog gets bullied can be problematic. Rioutous play that turns into a fight can be disastrous. It really depends on how steady the other dog is, and your level of comfort.    
As with everthing canine - listen to your instincts. You know your dog best.   
If you decide to do this, I'd probably start out by first doing a bit of parallel walking with the other dog and owner.   
 This is where you start out separated by whatever distance your's dog's 'no fly zone' is, and walk in parallel, keeping that distance constant.    
Watch how the dogs react to one another. Are both dogs relaxed? Look at the set of the ears, the tightness/looseness of the mouth, the posture of the tail, the hard/softness of the eyes, etc.  What kind of signals are the dogs offering  each other?    
If all looks relaxed and friendly, slowly reduce the distance between you and the other dog/owner. Continue walking in parallel, continue reducing the distance as long as everybody seems happy - until you are waking together side by side.   
If anyone looks uncomfortable, stop and increase the distance back to the previous point. Never go beyond what your dogs define as their comfort zones.   
Assuming you two are in a safe place where other dogs are unlikely to intrude, once you are successfully, happily walking side by side, assuming all is going well - then casually release the dogs from the lead. Say nothing. You and the other owner should keep in motion, walking around the area, not directing the interaction but keeping an eye out. The dogs may just sniff around, perhaps ignore each other - that's OK. Let them decide how they want to play.    
Presenting a neutral facade, watch the body language of the two dogs. If one starts to look uncomfortable, or goes into defensive mode - keeping your voice neutral recall your dogs to you, resume parallel walking.   
It's best to end on a successful note.   
You may want to do this several times, don't rush the interaction, go at your dog's comfort pace. One eye on safety at all times.   
Enjoyable fun interaction with other dogs is fantastic, dogs can learn so much from each other. BUT - in serious behavior cases, this really isn't a subsitute for working with a pro. Adding the caveat that I don't know your dog, can't see what is going on -  do search for a trainer who can observe and give you professional advice.   
All the best.

			I have used both Doggy day care and now a doggy Aupair (live out  ). Both have worked remarkably well for us. Dogs loved both. I have travel extensively with work and this has been an easy arrangement. However I have always had myself organised up front. I have a back up plan and always keep my eye out for other doggy day cares. It is so easy to go and do an inspection and have a look around in your time off. Rather than waiting until you are stuck.   
I used a daily service from the doggy day care which gave me a priority when I needed to travel or leave them their in an emergency. Many people said it was confusing for them to go daily, but I have to say mine absolutely loved it!      Never a truer word spoken.

			I would be surprised if you need to quarantine your dog. I moved my cat around the world (From USA to Italy to Switzerland) and as long as you are updated with vaccination you should be fine. Talking with my vet he told me that they are very strict only with animal coming from those country where rabies is still widespread. The link that J_T gave you is a great resource. I used it myself when i was moving back to europe.

			Hello and welcome!  
Here's a website where if you type in your post code, it will list the vets closest to you:    
As for recommendations wise, it really depends on where in Zurich you live. I used to bring my dog to Dr Buchler in Hongg. Dr Buchler is very experienced, extremely professional and a highly skilled surgeon. He did my dog's castration and removal of an extra toe with minimal scarring (in fact, I cant find any!). His details are:   
Dr. med. vet. Emil BÃ¼chler 
Hohenklingenstrasse 45 
8049 ZÃ¼rich 
Tel. +41 (0) 44 341 07 07   
But I've recently moved and our local vet is now:   
Dr. med. vet. Lorenz JÃ¶hr 
Allmendstrasse 4 
8700 KÃ¼snacht 
Tel. +41 (0) 44 912 04 04   
Dr Johr also came highly recommended by a fellow EF member and I have to say, I wasnt disappointed. He speaks excellent English and when I brought my dog there for shots, he was very patient and great with my dog who is usually wary of strangers. I've not much experience otherwise with vets here in Switzerland other than shots and castration, as mine's a young dog but I am sure other members will come along with their experiences soon enough.

			I'd echo the same as the others, with the addition of this:   
Don't try to actively coax him out, just let him do his thing and come out on his own time. Cats tend to be kinda funny in that the more you go for them, the less they want to come.   
There are some treats he may like better than others, toys too. Make sure they're someplace where he can see or smell them from wherever he decides to hide out.   
One of the ""sure fire"" temptations for my Bonny is the   from Vitakraft, you can find these at Coop as well as Fresnapf and Qualipet. (She likes them so well that if she's had any, I have to hide the empty packet or else she'll eventually dig it out of the trash.)           
Meanwhile, if he doesn't relax, it is possible to get ""Feliway"" here, I believe it is available as a spray or a plug-in diffuser.

			Bruce,   
I don't know how strict or how lax the SO authorities are in determining if a mixed breed dog falls into the restricted category. Hopefully someone living in SO might be along to comment.   
If listed as a lab mix you are probably OK - unless your dog looks very bull breed-ish.  Do you have anything other than vague suspicion of your dog's parentage?    
You biggest worry might be nasty neighbors who might file a complaint based on appearances.   
To play it safe, you could contact the VeterinÃ¤ramt in SO and ask how a mix is defined. Do be aware that you might be opening a can of worms - stress that you do not know what your dog's parentage is, only that he is a lab mix.   
Here is the contact info:       
AFAIK, only ZH defines mixes (DNA test showing 10% of a banned breed.)    
But to your other question: no, BE does not have BSL on the books. The laws in Bern are summarized here:         
Were it me... Given the difficulties I have faced as a dog owner, I would take the safer route and look for a place in BE. But if that is not possible, do make sure you understand the SO VeterinÃ¤ramt's definition and the neighbor's attitudes to dogs.   
---   
Can any dog owners in SO post of your experience with BSL?

			Feliway - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - in our experience. Our cat works herself into such a state BEFORE she gets in the car that normally she just is so tired and goes to sleep.   
We now close the cat-flap OUT when we leave on the day we will be leaving - so she can come back in - and then not out again. We also make sure she gets plenty of attention as we pack.   
I had one cat many years a go - who'd happily go in his basket - within 2kms he'd have done a poo!! So you'd stop, clear it up, and then he'd be fine!!

			Indeed certain airlines won't transport pets and certain ports are not up for receiving animals.   
For 3 weeks, I'd drive.  I've done Zurich-Arles (France) in one go and to be honest, my dogs were fine in the back of the car.   
Thanks for the info on the rabies shots, that would be nice if a) my dog had the shot and b) if he was a breed permitted into the UK without hysterics.  Mind you, him not being allowed means more room for shopping!   
And before I'm judged for not giving my dog a rabies shot, he has the combi-vaccine but does not have to have a rabies shot in Switzerland as there has been no single case reported for a long time.  So sayeth the vet.

			Hi Laura, et al.,   
I'm also the owner of a (1/2) siamese.  He has striking markings! His name is Leo and he's owned me for about 9 years now.  Here's the problem, it seems that I am pretty allergic to him.  My allergies have turned to asthma.  In addition, I am spending more and more time away from Basel.  This year will be especially bad.  I just returned from two months away and will be turning around and spending about 3 1/2 weeks away again beginning Sep 8.  I think he deserves a new home.  Someone who is around and who can give him the cuddling he needs.  He needs a home without other animals or young children. He likes to cuddle up on a lap while someone watches TV and to sleep close at night.  He's a good hunter and is used to having access to the out of doors. I can find people to come feed him but I think he deserves better.  Can anyone help?  Know someone who could give him a good home?

Also, if I am reading the OP's posts right she is not in an apartment, but in a house. So, as far as being a dog owner is concerned she has really done everything right. But the landlady needs putting in her place...no doubt about that.

			An update: DEFRA has released a bulletin on the new regulations (Effective 1 Jan 2012):       
Seems the tick and tapeworm issue is not resolved, so travelers are advised   to continue treatment as 'best practice' until such time as a decision is made - and to keep an eye on the DEFRA website for further information.

Don't take much dog food with you as the likelihood it will be seized by Customs is very high.   If you're lucky, you'll arrive on a good day when someone is working who's got some sense about them, but the rules are that it should be seized.

			I can recommend your dog school too, we pay 120 eur per dog and go once per week for an hour, but you can do as often as we want - there are classes I think at least 4 times per week. Separate areas for big and small dogs, so the Pyrenees would not step on the Jack Russells. Trainers speak French though, some German as well. PM me for more info.

			In May, we shipped our 5 year old cat from Frankfurt back to Newark, NJ, USA.   
In the end, we went with petshipping.com / Gradlyn Kennels.  The total damage was about 410 Euros.  We delivered the cat to the FRA airport, but had we allowed them to pick up the cat, the cost would have been at least double what we spent.   
We had a very professional experience and would recommend them further.   
Just remember:   
1. The rabies vaccine must be older than 30 days, but younger than 1 year 
2. A health certificate (there is a form in the Swiss or German ""pet passport"") needs to be less than 10 days old when the pet gets to the final destination. 
3. The best airline to send your pets on is Lufthansa - hands down.  They have a camera in the cockpit where the pilot can check on what's going on down there!   
Hope this helps!

1621	06.08.2011, 09:48	Junior Member	Thanked 10 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Manchester area	"    Please check with DEFRA - just not worth taking the risk. They are absolutely and totally strict at the check-in for the Tunnel (make sure you allow plenty of time for this check- as at times during school and main holidays, there can be a big queue.). Remember the veterinary visit, checking the chip, and administering worming/tick and flea treatment, and signing of passport + stamp, date and exact time, has to be between 24hrs min and 48hrs max before departure of Tunnel/Ferry.  
Beware: your dog would have to remain in the car in the ferry- that is 1h3o mins which could be a nightmare in case of a   crossing- so I'd never ever travel by ferry with pets. The Tunnel is so much better as your dog remains in your car with you, and crossing is only 30 mins.

			We tried endlessly and in vain to ÂtrainÂ our cat not to scratch on the bedroom door in the small hours. The only thing that finally worked was a smart little device called ssscat. It is completely harmless for animals, but does the trick wonderfully. Now when the cat sees the device put out in front of the bedroom door, he doesnÂt even try to approach it.  
  It might be a bit difficult to place the device on the pavement, though...             "	null	null	null	New cat in the neighbourhood	guest	null

			Hi Markalex     
I felt really sorry to hear that. Pets become a part of our family and losing them in such a condition bring a lot of grief and sorrow. But your kids are small and I think this time is the best to get a puppy. Both puupy and your kid will enjoy each others company. But do consider that you need to take good care for a new puppy. So the work load and responsibility for you might increase. Do consider all these factors and decide accordingly.

The SKN is the bare legal minimum, the intent is to cover the basics, to highlight what Swiss society expects of dogs - and more importantly of dog owners. Further training is recommended for all dog owners; if one's dog has 'ishooz'   one is most emphatically encouraged to pursue on-going training.   
I have done a combination of group (Familienhund) and individual training, as well as dog sports, with my reactive dog. 4+ years on she is a delight, thanks to all the hard work and support of our trainer. All my dogs, including the ancient one, take classes - I see these as an activity as well as training.    
As you are in SZ, I'm sure you know that cantonal law requires dogs to be on lead at all times in public. This creates quite a barrier to socialization for our dogs; one of the reasons I love Familienhund classes is that these give my dogs the social interaction they need, and could not otherwise find given SZ law.   
While you are searching for an appropriate training option, may I recommend a book I've found to be quite helpful: 'How To Behave So Your Dog Behaves' by Dr Sophia Yin.       
All the best to you and your doglet.     
ETA:   
You may also want to look into this trainer/behaviorist:       
I don't know her personally nor have I seen her work, but have heard good things from colleagues. She isn't that far from you - about half an hour. I see from her  CV that she has done coursework with Turid Rugaas and Sheila Harper and attended seminars in the UK, so I'm guessing that she likely speaks English.

			Oscar has been to stay there lots of times.....in fact we just picked him up on Saturday after his last stay.    
He loves it there (I think) and the people in charge really seem to look after the cats well. He's never lost weight......the same can't be said for other places he's been to. On the other hand he's such a big cat he probably pushes the little ones out of the way when it comes to feeding time! 
He's been there so many times that I'm actually starting to recognise other cats who are staying there quite a lot too. That's got to be a good sign. Another thing I like about the place is that they actually let you see where the cats are living, and the facilities available. I have left him in one place before (never again!) that practically shut the door in my face when I tried to peek into the cat area. If it hadn't been for the fact that I HAD to go on a trip I wouldn't have left him there.....  
(And I'm sure someone's going to say that the cattery was only being security conscious, but any cattery worth it's salt would have a double gate on the enclosure anyway.)   
BTW fees are 16CHF per day.

			Hey,   
I live in PfÃ¤ffikon, ZH.  Moved here a month ago with our two Labs.  We have a forest on our doorstep and its very dog freindly around here.   
We are outside Zurich, but a 30 min train ride away.  I think that is reasonable especially if you do have a dog.

			Just wanted to add that the dog you walked, ""Filou"" has been featured in pets section of the magazine Schweizer Familie.        
The reporter visits the various animal shelters and then writes about animals needing homes.    
Filou is an English Cocker Spaniel. He is a 9 year old male, and he is deaf. However, as an owner of a deaf dog, and there are other dog owners here who can speak from experience, living with a deaf dog is not that difficult.   
Filou is currently at the Tierheim Brunnhalde in Untersiggenthal (near Baden) in Kanton Aargau. The contact details are in the article.

Shall we meet tomorrow (Tuesday 10 February) up at Utleiberg at 1.30pm?  Its lovely up there at the moment.  The dogs can then do as little or as much walking as they like.   
Argus - feel free to join us even if its just for 15 mins for your pup to have a play in the snow and socialise with the other dogs (and us).   
Let me know what you think anyway.

			We recently brought our dog to Switzerland, and it was no problem at all. As the others have mentioned, you will need to have your cat's shots up-to-date (I think you have to have them done more than 30 days prior to your trip and no less than 1 year), and you'll need to have a vaccination certificate. After speaking to the vet 3 times, calling the airline, looking on-line, etc, nobody seemed to know anything about this ""Health Certificate"" that was required, so we decided not to worry about it. Finally, I called the vet 2 days before we left to see if we could get an extra copy of our Vaccination Certification, and the person who answered said that I must come in within 10 days of moving for this Health Cert. They basically just weigh the animal, take her temp., etc. But make sure you get one!   
You will also need to have your cat micro-chipped, as the others said. Keep in mind that not all chips can be read here. (Our dog ended up needing to have another one impolanted).    
No one checked her at the airport, nor did anyone ask any questions about her at customs. I'm not sure if it's the same with cats, but we needed to register her with our canton, and she had to go to the vet to have her chip registered. And while i doubt you'll be traveling to other countries with your cat (although you never know!), she'll need to have her own passport with her vaccination info (available from a vet).   
Also, if your pet cannot travel in the cabin with you, rest assured that there are very tight regulations about animal cargo, and your cat will be absolutely fine (but freaked out!).   
Hope this helps, and enjoy your move to Switerland!

Basically this means in Baden the veterinarian on call is on a rotational basis. If you call the number listed you will be informed which veterinarian is on call at the particular time. This information is also published in the local newspaper, the Aargauer Zeitung. Of course, many veterinarians offer their patients emergency service and you just call your pet's regular veterinarian, leave a message on the answer phone and they call you back.

			To walk from Engleberg to the flower walk is quite steep but there is a little old gondola that takes you up after a not so long walk. Once you get to the flower walk it is fairly flat & easy going. Unless your dog is tiny I think the old gondola would be the best option, it is round the side of the mountain so tends to be quite quiet with few passengers.

actually whilst in the vet some days ago, I saw this dog with his owner, it was a Basset but at that time I didnÂ´t have a clue. I thought it was one of the funniest dogs I have ever seen, his/her solid paws (and super big ""hands""), I was tempted to ask him to give me 5!  . Then I was very rudely staring at him because I found him soooo adorable, and he was looking from time to time, like ""I donÂ´t care"", ""Ok, I am used to be looked at"", ""what do you want from me!"". Also I was impressed by his size, I would have expected to be smaller, in fact because I thought it was a kind of Teckel (long body, short legs) - how ignorant, I know  . He really made me smile.   
I bet you get some interesting comments / looks when you walk your 3 ladies. Just imagine how proud will be Quirin when walking with his new friends.    
Hope everything will go well with the adoption and the integration should you go for it.

			Missed this one :-)   
As said above -  the next big international show is Lausanne.  Bulle is a smaller national show but has been called off due to financial problems.   
Per year there are 3 double CACIBs (international), Fribourg in February, St. Gallen in May and Lausanne in October.  Bulle is the only national all-breed show.  The breed clubs sometimes organize additional specialties.   
Luzern is not every other year, but every 5.  It was as said in 2008 the last time.      
Germany, France, Italy usually have enough shows between them to be away every weekend but mostly during the season.   
If you have any questions just shoot -  spend most of my weekends at one show or another and know the southern European calender.    I show Poodles and Swedish Vallhunds, and yup - I do breed SKG   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	dog shows in switzerland	Bex1234	Posts: 30
1656	29.06.2011, 20:25	Forum Veteran	Thanked 2,396 Times in 995 Posts	Location: Geneva	"    It sounds like your friend and the dog need to attend some training classes. Afterall, a good class is all about training the  .      
Classes don't necessarily have to cost an arm and a leg;  yes, individual classes can run upwards of CHF 100 per hour, but group classes (which might be a better option for her) are much less expensive. For instance, I have a yearly abo at our school for ca. CHF 600 for 40 classes - quite a good value, especially when you figure in the socialization provided for my mutts, and the comraderie for me. All my dogs adopted as seniors attend training classes -  as others have pointed out, you certainly can teach an old dog new tricks.   
If you can convince him to start with classes, you'd be doing him, the neighbors, and most importantly Bellisse a very big favor.       
Please do everything in your power to convince him to have Bellisse spayed - for the sake of her health, if nothing else. If finances are the reason he is hesitating, use my example:    
My healthy ca 13 kg youngster was spayed (ovariectomy) at a cost of CHF 800. OK, a bit steep - but my middle-aged dog, who could not be spayed young because of a heart condition, developed pyometra - quite common in older unspayed females. Although we reacted immediately, she was very close to dying by the time we got to the emergency vet,  The resulting operation (ovariohysterectomy) plus extended stay at the intensive care unit at the Tierspital ran ca CHF 7000. We were very lucky - pyo has a mortality rate of ca 75%.   
Not spaying for financial reasons is a classic case of being penny wise and pound foolish.   
Added to the whole prevention of unwanted litters (which by the way would cost your friend an arm and a leg. Even breeders of top champion FCI lines generally don't cover the cost of raising a litter - they do it for the love of the breed.)   
Please, please - do what you can to convince him that having her spayed is the best thing he can do for Bellisse.

I could see when they put them to the cargo hold and when they were taken away from there in ZÃ¼rich. The cats were in the baggage claim really fast, even faster than my luggage and the cat toilet. We did have some obstacles in the beginning though as our cat booking had disappeared even though I checked it yesterday with Finnair at the same time when I upgraded myself to business (to get more kg's  ). But for some reason the guy who did the upgrading forgot the cats anyways.    
Finally we did get the cats onboard quite easily. There were just two guys that came to check the boxes (and I had to take the cats out) and took the cats, and then I had to go to pay 180Â for them. I almost got it for 140Â because of a really nice lady at the business check-in, but then the other lady increased the amount to 180Â (18kg x 10Â/kg).    
In ZÃ¼rich the older cat seemed a bit silent (read: mad at what he had to experience) but the younger was really relaxed. And now that we're home, they are both really relaxed already   In the customs they wanted to see the passports, and asked the usual (are they new etc.) and let us go.

			Well, since no one else has answered, I'll jump in with a guess...    
What you saw might have been something to do with the Kynologischer Verein Rheinfeld-MÃ¶hlin - but the club isn't limited to BCs:       
They do have an Agility group, though - and where there is Agility one usually finds a BC or two.    Might be worth a look.     
Or, could it have been something to do with the Nationale Hundeaustellung fÃ¼r alle Rasen this weekend? Not exactly in the area, but I think not too far away - perhaps a group doing a bit of practice work?         
Bear in mind I'm only guessing, and could be wrong. I often am.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Calling all Border Collie owners in BL	Britters2000	Posts: 54

			We sent our dog via continental in August 2007. No problems, because at that time, continental had their pet safe program. Basically the animals were kept on the tarmac in an airconditioned vehicle until boarding was safe, and there were secure kenneling services at Newark. Our dog flew from Raleigh to Newark, was kenneled for a couple of hours and then flew on to Zurich. We picked her up without any problems. Here's the web site -- you might want to contact them.        
We were very happy with their service, but there may have been changes in the last 4 years, and with the merger, there may be less service availabe.    
I'd make sure you import the dog on a weekday so that there is a vet onsite.    
Also, I don't recommend this, but we did have the wrong paperwork afterall, and the vet just waved us through. Also, I had Lily microchipped with a European standard microchip in the US, but they couldn't find it once she got to Switzerland and her vet here had to chip her again. Crap happens.    
Good luck! But I'd check with continental.

When we visited the SPA in Fribourg last year, the woman on duty was very helpful indeed. She said the dogs they had (at that time) were difficult, and would be unsuitable for us as a family with a 3 year old child and no previous dog knowledge.   
We were actually matched up with the 6 month old rescue dog we ended up with (from elsewhere). They felt she would be very family friendly, and would do well with training.  
And she is! Our girl is a very sweet natured dog, and gentle around kids.   
We had no preference regarding breed, age. etc. so being matched up worked well for us.   
Good luck!

1672	null	null	null	null	"    Actually, that's why there are so many regulations about what sort of travel device can be used for pets on planes. They can't be ""too"" open, they have to be of certain size relative to the pet, depending whether they'll be carry-on vs cargo the crate itself has to be of certain strength, etc etc.   
They make travel pads to line the bottom, these days they have the same material as a baby's diaper lining, they are quite absorbent. As it generally isn't an every day thing for pets to travel long distances, it isn't really such a huge thing. Sure some get stressed and yep, they need exercise but for something of a ""one off"" type thing, it's not so terrible.   
As far as potential for allergies goes, the airlines themselves help manage that to some extent, as there are only a given number of in-cabin pets allowed per flight. I do not know the particulars but I remember noticing that pet travel bags which are made with intent to be in-cabin carriers usually have a fairly closed mesh (obviously not solid) in the ""open"" / view spots rather than the grates in more solid cargo crates. I imagine this helps somewhat with the potential for spreading dander.

			Yes, it is true that you are not allowed to have only one cat. It's not a matter of if I agree or not. Let's just say it's one of the key factors why I don't have cats since I moved into Switzerland.   
The main point is the protection of the animal: you are not allowed to have only 1 pet to avoid loneliness. That is why you have to have at least 2 fishes, 2 cats or two birds, etc, so they keep each other company.   
Here's the link:       
Though the Animal Protection won't be able to check your home, law abbiding neighbours, as well as animal friendly neighbours, might contact the Gemeinde and you might get a heavy fine, as it happened to a neighbour of mine (wasn't me, I swear!).

This is where we board our dog when we're away and they also take care of small animals - I've seen people leave small pets like hamsters or something and I think they also handle rabbits.  I think they're very nice, and we've been happy with their  service.

			Hi,   
We relocated our dog 2 years ago. His tail was docked before we owned him. They did mention it when we picked him up at the airport but I explained it was before we had him and they didn't say anything else. I shouldn't imagine you will have a problem.   
Good luck,

			hi 
i used to live by Brunau Allmend 
though it CAN be a good place there are some irresponsible dog owners there 
that give the place a bad reputation .. 
i now go by the ZUrich see, there is a nice area off Widmer str.  
it is just where Kilchberg meets Zurich 
near the tennis courts SEa Blick  
the dogs that go there are tame as sheep, you can let your dog go free in that area and have no fear some vicious dog or person may complain. 
Have heard horror stories about Brunau Allmend, my own sweet mutton was attacked and you know how the swiss like to take responsibilty for their dogs.. 
so try the lake area avoiding the area where there are a lot of people like around the ship dock area 
another great place is Adlesville, if you go to Sihlwald on the train and walk towards ZUrich, there is a nice walk for a dog that likes to walk and enjoys a swim! 
Kilchberg itself has a nice walking area around the hospital where the wheat grows tall at the end of the line 184 
good luck ! 
p.s. as for the rules, when in Rome, i ignore them as long as others do the same but i do pick up  the poo  (how do you spell that?)  for  polite reasons  "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 71 Times in 22 Posts	Dog parks in Switzerland	Javo	Posts: 190

			BSL is bad law, bad science - and the thin edge of the wedge. All dog owners - of any breed or mix - should stand in solidarity against these kinds of knee-jerk measures. As they say, 'Deed, not breed.'   
You are in the clear in Basel - Mastiffs are not restricted (although the Pitbull, Staffie, Amstaff, EBT, Rottweiler, Dobermann, Dogo Argention, Fila Brasileiro are on the list).   
Geneva, Valais, Fribourg, Thurgau, Schaffhausen  bann /restrict Spanish Mastiffs and Neapolitan Mastiffs specifically, as well as the catch-all 'Mastiff' - so any of the Mastiff breeds (but not all molossers) are included.   
Tessin goes further and in addition to the above adds the Tibetan Mastiff and Bullmastiff. (Tessin restricts 30 breeds, including the Great Dane, German shepherd, the four Belgian shepherd breeds, btw.)   
To my mind, though, the most frightening example is ZÃ¼rich, because BSL was introduced there as the result of a public referendum.  The average voter knows little about canine behavioral science, but responded rather to fear-mongering and media hype.    
---   
The best way to combat the hysteria that sparks BSL is to make sure that you and Winnifred are good ambassadors for her breed. Hence the suggestion of getting involved in a training group or a dog club.    
One of the reasons I spend so much time at the training school (aside from the fact that my mutts are all nuttier than fruitcakes   ) is that in a world where dogs are increasingly unwelcome, the companionship and support of other like-minded dog owners has been a godsend.    
Hope that you and Winnifred (fantastic name, by the way...) settle easily into your new lives here, and enjoy your Swiss adventure.

			oh purlease, lets not generalise.    
As a owner of a smaller dog, I have ill behaved bigger dogs coming up to mine trying to hump the poor fella. One bigger dog on our usual walking trail, is very fond of rushing up to me and trying to grab my dog's toy out of my hands. Imagine a 40 pounds staff-lab mix bounding up to you to engage in a tug of war, growling, whilst the owner is about 20m away strolling without a care in the world.      . I always say that the problem always is with the owner, never the dog. The dogs only act and react based on what they've learnt (or didnt).   
My general rule of thumb is to be alert on off-leash walks and make sure that your dog is 100% reliable on recall. If you sense potential trouble, recall your dog, leash him up till that ill behaving canine is out of the way. Thats the best we dog owners can do. If you arent comfortable with any dog approaching yours, simply tell the owner no (usually in Switzerland, dog owners are very respectful of other dogs on  leads and tend to call their canine to move on), or if the owner is too far away, step in as the human (and the pack leader), and send the message to the other dog to move on. If your dog is what you've described as well behaved, he/she will simply ignore and calmly move on. No harm done.    
As for playfighting, humping, etc, its all part and parcel of doggy behaviour. They work themselves out, its a circle and hierachy with age. I tend to get worried but I've observed that as he grows older to become a more self assured young man, he has learnt to tell other dogs (especially the younger ones) that their behaviour is too excessive - same way as he was told off when he was a wee pup.

			You could ask the new owners if he could stay back with them for 2-4 weeks after you castrate him.  That would give you time to see if your girl will come in season or not. Then you will have a little time before you spay her (but at least the bills won't be in the same month!)  They would know you were serious (pay for castration) and really what is 4 more weeks to make sure he has a great home?  Hope it works.  Mine is currently at my feet and I love her dearly so reading this has moved spaying to the top of the expenses list for June! Oops - just read he was 6 mos - to me that sounds early (as all others have said).  Hope it works out, maybe you take your girl to the vet & he can check her & advise when it is best time for her surgery.  Then you can have all the info to make a course of action.

			I'd go with a two-pronged approach.    
First, help kitty with his fur. Get a   and help to thin out the undercoat so he ingests less fur. You'll probably have to order one from the UK, I never did find one when I was living in Switzerland. (They're inexpensive enough you shouldn't be hit with customs costs)   
Then get some malt paste. I use  , which seems to keep my hairball-prone girl from developing too many hairballs. ( ). It helps to break up the hairballs in their gut so they can digest it.    
Good luck!

Im looking for someone with a horse that might need help riding her/him. I have been horse back riding since I was 7 (now 26) but do not have the opportunity here in ZÃ¼rich so far. But I am hoping to find a horse owner that needs some help. I used to do jumps (incl competitions) and western. And I am completelly comfortable going outdoors in the forest.    
If you have a horse and need some help or maybe knows someone who does, just send me a mail!    
Cheers 
Maggie

			The bad news is, you really should check with the regie.   
However, if you want to risk their possible wrath, read your tenancy contract and the ""house rules"". If neither prohibits pets, you should be OK.   
Good luck!

			Greetings dog lovers!   
If you are looking for a short term job this summer to make a bit of money and have loads of fun while you are at it, you might just have found it!   
I am looking to hire a dog walker to take my dog out once a day Monday-Friday in the month of June.   
The location: I live right next to Almend Park. It is a large, beautiful dog park with a river going through it and woods all around it. Silh City is across the street from my house, as a reference point, and the tram stop Saalsporthalle is 2 min away from my doorstep, so it is highly accessible. There is also a train station right by.   
Usually I take my dog out myself but I will be in the U.S. for that month, and my fiance works full time so we need somebody to pick my dog up at home, spend some quality time with her outside for about one hour, give her loads of love and attention and then drop her off again in the end.   
My dog, Nina Bear, is turning 2 this summer, she is an English Bulldog and is very loving. She is very good on walks, friendly with people and other dogs. She simply can't be left alone for a whole day.    
Price to be negotiated.    
For more details, please contact me by  .   
Please pass the word along to your friends, kids, family, etc.    
Have a great day!   
Carina H.

			The dog was a German Shepard, very large about 120 lbs.  Too big for a create.  He was not a service dog but a family dog. 
  He is not the only large dog I know of that delta has allowed them to fly in the cabin without a create, regardless of policy, you need to contact directly and have a reason why the dog can't go as cargo.    I had a friend whom paid for the extra seat and had her great Dane also too big for a create on a flight from the states to Hawaii.  If you are willing to pay $$$$ they will accomodate you.

			Sorry if this is not in the right place.   
On Saturday and Sunday, June 18 & 19th, there will be a chance to visit the TierRettungsDienst & Tierheim PfÃ¶tli in Winkel, ZH.   
This is an organization I support and have called on more than one occasion when I have found an injured or lost pet. They offer 24 hour service.       is the flyer with more information and a map.

			Extract from DEFRA reply from when I was in the same boat last year: 
""Thank you for your e-mail sent to the Customer Contact Unit and received by us on the 13th September 2010.   
For your pet dog to enter (or return to) the UK by use of the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) and thus avoid quarantine, the following procedures must be carried out in the stated order:   
1). Your pet dog is micro-chipped, then 
2). It is vaccinated against rabies, (then boosters kept up-to-date) and then 
3). A blood sample is taken and sent to a European Union (EU) approved laboratory for testing.   , assuming that all other rules of the scheme are met. 
*Your veterinarian should check the datasheet of the rabies vaccine used in order to ascertain when the blood test should be taken.   
Please note that steps 2 and 3 above must be carried out in a PETS qualified country.   
Further to this, pets must be treated against ticks and tapeworm not less than 24 hours and not more than 48 hours before checking in with a PETS authorised carrier (on a PETS approved route), for the journey that brings the pet into the UK.   
Also, blood is tested min' 30 days   the injection, so realistically you are talking 7 months from the vacc'   
For animals being prepared in an EU country, you should get an EU pet passport. If you are preparing your animal in a non-EU listed country you will need to obtain an official third country veterinary certificate although note that Croatia, Gibraltar, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland are also issuing passports.   
For further information on how to prepare your pet for export to the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS), including documentary requirements and approved routes and carriers, please see the link below:     
I hope this has answered your question. Should you require further information you may wish to:   
Â· Check our websitehttp://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-pets/pets/travel/index.htm  
Â· Or contact The PETS Helpline on 0870 241 1710 
Â· Or send an e-mail to  ""   
They wouldn't wear it under any circumstance.   
I would check for quarantine services closest to your destination, as at least you will see them more frequently that way and it would be less stressful for the dogs and you I think.   
Also, remember that the blood is tested 30 days   the vacc', so in effect it's 7 months total from date a vaccination before Uk entry without quarantine.... provided the test is passed of course.

			Hope you are feeling a little less stunned today, my dad cried for days and days when his cats, companions of 22 years, died within two weeks of each other.

			Buy a couple of these from Landi, and strategically place them in the plower pot:       
They're the bigger rat variety. I'm sure in the confines of a flower pot they wont actually ""trap"" the moggie, but just make a noise and jump in the air. But this could be counter-productive, as it could   the crap out of it.   
I've had mixed results with the green gel stuff. Water pistol is OK if you're quick enough (or a cup of water, thrown). Coffee grounds are also supposed to deter them too.

We've always used the channel tunnel and you have to get everything checked at a special pets check in before you go through to the normal check in area.

			And for harnesses, I'm a huge fan of the Ruffwear Webmaster harness:       
I originally got one of these for Houdini, who as his name implies, could break out of every other harness type we tried - and I tried pretty much all others on the planet. The double strap is pure genius.   
I liked the harness so much that Hooligan now wears one as well. The harness was a godsend when my husband needed to do a bit of ad-hoc rappelling down a ravine, having completely mis-read his trail map...      
Ruffwear make several dog packs as well:       
I get my gear direct from Ruffwear, shipping to a US address because it's quite a bit less expensive that way. However, there are several retailers in Switzerland and Germany that carry Ruffwear products. See 'International Retailers' on their site.   
Meiko is one -  I don't see the Webmaster in their online shop selection, but you can always ask if they could special order it for you. Meiko delivers Switzerland-wide.       
Meiko carry a variety of harnesses. Their website could be more descriptive - there isn't as much product information as one often needs, but write to them with questions, they are usually prompt to answer.

			My farm hounds always rolled in the most unholy of excrements they could find, and the expense of 'vet grade' dog shampoo was just too expensive on a regular basis. A co-worker eventually tipped me off with a secret to just wash the hounds in "" "".   
The theory evolved around the fact that Dogs ( pH6.5 - 7.5 ) and People ( pH5.2 - 6.2 ) have different pH levels of the skin...... but dogs and sheep are pretty similar.   
Don't research too hard on precise pH levels as these values will vary on the literature, and species of dog (and people etc.)........ and even then, all individuals may react differently anyway.     
I used to use about 3 caps of WOOL WASH in a bucket of cool water (about 5L) with 2 teaspoons of dishwashing liquid.     When rinsing the dog, watch for bubbles in the fur. When there is no more bubbles, you can tell that the wash solution has gone.   
The dogs smell awesome after a wool wash bath, but they still prefer the stench of festy crap instead....... that will never change.     
N.B.  I started to do a bit of 'google' research for you, but I realised there is a lot of variability in the pH of both wool wash products and liquid detergernts. 
I also have no idea what sort of dog you have, so make sure you only try a small area first on the dog before trying this. 
I did this for years, and didn't once have a problem, so you should be pretty right.

			A question for those of you who are doing dog walking/sitting as a paid service, and those who are clients of dog care providers:   
How have you handled insurance issues?   
In the past, I had a dog sitter who ran a proper business and carried her own insurance. In the two years since this wonderful lady retired, I have been unable to find anyone already set-up to work legally - so I'm now looking at either helping a qualified candidate set up his/her own business or - my least-preferred option - to employ him/her as my employee.    
So - those of you who are dogwalking as self-employed or as a business - what insurance company are you using for your commercial liability policy? What does this insurance cover - i.e., does your policy cover:   
damages caused by you/the dog?  
accidents where you/the dog are deemed at fault? 
accidents where the dog is injured by a third party?  
medical care for the dog/third party due to an accident?    
And, what does this type of policy generally cost?   
---   
Those of you who are clients:  If your dog care provider is working as your employee, or if you use someone who is not registered as self-employed or as a business, what kind of liability insurance do you carry to cover the dog walker?    
If I understand it correctly, standard Privathaftpflicht covers third parties in charge of a dog who are not working commercially, but not dog walkers/sitters who are paid. Do you carry another liability policy, and if so, what kind, from which insurer?     
Any insights as to how you have dealt with the insurance issues related to your dog care provider would be much appreciated.

My boa constrictor is staying with a 'long-term snake babysitter' back in the states.   
My three frogs arrived safely last week - we sent them with AARK Air and all we needed was import permits - which AARK Air took care of.  All I had to do was pack them for transit.  Apart from the stress of moving my little guys, it was actually pretty easy.  I went to the reptile shop in Jona yesterday, and now we're all set up.

My dog was very frightened, never slept more than 2-3 hours, vera agitated and nervous, seemed ""elsewhere"", never played with other dogs and never approached any human being, even at home (could stay hidden behind the sofa for hours). They did a wonderful job while the ""comportementaliste"" had lost hope. I will be happy to give the address and website: just send me a message.

It sounds like the fence is too low if the dogs can put their front paws on top of it. Snap a picture and take it to the gemeinde. A video might be even better. Our fence is 1 meter high and our dogs are much smaller and not on any watch list. How far back from the street is the fence?

			Jrspet has given you excellent advise.   
The only thing I would add:   
Are the owners approachable? Is the situation such that you could safely (your own safety, and that of the poor dog's) try to speak to them? Do you suspect willful abuse, or is it a case neglect by a clueless owner?   
If you think you could safely approach the owners, this is often the best route to quickly get the dog into a better situation. In the case of neglect by clueless owners - or possibly even a misunderstanding - sometimes a quiet word works wonders to either change their behavior, or to convince them to sign the dog over to someone more capable of properly caring for him. BUT - you need to judge the situation carefully.   
If you have witnessed willful abuse, if you believe that th dog is in need of veterinary attention, if you believe the dog is being denied food or water, get the authorities involved asap.   
Kudos to you for caring, and trying to help.

			I had mine both spayed at 6 months (our next door neighbor at the time had a female cat and I was worried they would make her pregnant-they used to jump over the wall of the balcony and go into my neighbors flat, eat his cats' food, play with their toys, and use their litter box  he was a really cool guy, he just laughed it off  )    
It affected both their metabolism so they are both chubby wubbies now and the one cats front legs are slightly too short for his frame.  It looks as though he's always walking downhill   Apparently spaying too young can affect their growth.  Thing is, you won't know until they are fully grown.  Anyway, they are both healthy and strong and used to try and make babies with each other but have stopped doing that.     
I'd highly recommend it.  I grew up with cats and got cats within 3 months of moving to CH.  We have always had them spayed and have never had any problems with male cats getting spayed.

She will have had you to fill in a form for the change of ownership, which she should have sent in herself authorising the change.    
You should get the confirmation from ANIS in 3-4 weeks (if I remember correctly) with the confirmation that the dog officially belongs to you and a YELLOW sticker in the letter which contains your dog's chip number where you have to paste it in Page 3 of its Pet passport under ""REGISTRIERUNGSBESTATIGUNG DER DATENBANK"".

			I am sure you cat will adapt to living most of her time in doors. I had a cat in the UK who was free to roam through local fields- often away for days at a time. Then we moved to The Hague- living on a busy main road and so I restricted the amount of time she went out- literally 10 minutes let out at night or early morning to do her business. After a couple of years, we moved to a much quieter area and I though she would be desperate to get out but no.... she would cry to come back after just 10 minutes!!!! To be honest- if you had to re-home her, its probably fair to say that she will be spending quite some time at a cattery beforehand with very limited outside space and the need to adapt to living with dozens of other new 'friends'. I think this would be worse. Plus, don't forget that as cats get older, they do become lazier and she may well enjoy her new surroundings more than you think right now. 
Good luck with it all whatever option you go for

If Carrie just goes for the peace pipe, then nothing will come of it until this lunatic decides to nuke somebody else, who may suffer infinitely more stress. If some guy in the high street or on the train came on to you big time, would you ask his address to pop round for tea and a chat or would you stop by the next station and ask someone to call the police.Suggesting that Carrie might get grief because Gengis Khan is a neighbour is ridiculous. She took Carrie on without worrying about the consequences, so why should Carrie back down now for a peaceful life. No way.Either she has a problem that is being treated, she hasnt been taking the pills and someone needs to know, or she needs some and someone needs to know.

			After my husband refused to allow me to get a stroller for Charlotte (He thought it was too eccentric even for our 16 year old Jack Russell!), I got her a ""Snoozer""  carrier, which has wheels AND it also works as a backpack. She has a wardrobe of carriers, but this is the most practical. Have used it for hiking in backpack mode and in town in wheelie mode.  FYI, they also make a great doggie bike basket.

Many animals are homeless as a result of the TOHOKU-PACIFIC earthquake and tsunami which occurred on 11th March.  , a non profit organization, rescued more than 600 animals from  the quake-hit area after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake hit Japan in January 1995.

			when worm medicine gave both of our dogs diarrhea. and they are not 2,5 kilo chihuahuas, their ""presents"" were probably that size. 
cleaning those up about 5 times per day and a few times per night for a while was not fun, let me tell you. even though we let them out all the time, but still they managed to have accidents inbetween, as they had not mastered the toilet training yet. we were actually happy the day they only peed on the floor..(and luckily they're fine now)    
Now they have a new hobby. wake up in the middle of the night, see their own reflection somewhere. let us know by barking at it loudly. And while a yap of a small dog can be annoying, the sound of our dogs barking in the middle of the night will give you heart attack.    
whenever we decide to watch something on TV, the dogs will never, ever decide that this would be a good time for a nap. no, they will organize a loud wrestling match at the same time until we give up on tv. then they will sleep.    
and of course, no matter on which side of the door the dog is, it's the wrong side.

			Hi all, 
Sorry if this has been posted before - I did look to see but maybe I missed it.  Don't even know the dog myself but he's been missing since 2 Feb  - I have a Chocolate Lab myself and can't imagine how awful that must be so thought I'd pass the message on.   
His name is Momo and he's been missing since 2nd Feb though he's recently been seen in that area.  He has a collar with a phone number if anyone can pin him down. 
Fingers crossed!

In fact their website specifically mentions volunteering as a good option for people who can't own a dog for some reason, but still need their doggie 'fix'.     It also says children are allowed as long as they are accompanied by an adult at all times.

			We go to Luzia Steiner, near the Baar train station. She is superb, but I don't know about the boarding situation, you can ask her. Our cat disappeared once and Dr Steiner phoned to say she saw her at a farm in our area. I was impressed that she recognised the cat and went to the trouble of phoning us. She really cares about the animals and if she feels they don't need expensive treatment or medication, she says so.

They were in the building before us, but we didn't know when we moved in that the only way the cats could get to the road was through our terrace. They would wander into our apartment (and two of us are allergic to cat hair) or stop of in our potted plants and wreak havoc. This was before we had dogs.... Anyway, the relationship with our neighbours quickly turned sour. At one point the neighbour asked how we would like it if our kids were locked in the apartment? I said that wouldn't happen, they have a key.    
A few years later these people adopted a child. I think the cats disappeared shortly after.

			First, have you completed the mandatory SKN course(s)?   
If not, here is the database of accredited SKN trainers, searchable by PLZ:       
Of course, the SKN is only a beginning - every owner is urged to continue training after you have the required classes out of the way. Most of the trainers who do the SKN courses also offer a full range of training activities - so the database is also a good resource for other kinds of classes.    
Look for someone whose methods and philosophy mesh with yours, and of course, make sure that the trainer uses only positive techniques.     
Good luck - this is such a fun and rewarding time!     
(Any chance of a photo? Nothing so cute as a beagly pup...   )     
ETA:   
Just a comment, and please forgive me if I've taken this statement wrong:      A trainer trains you, not the dog.   There really aren't quick fixes in dog training - establishing a solid bond, effective motiviation, patience, repetition, proofing skills in varying environments all take time. What a trainer can do is to help you with your techniques, show you how to more effectively work with your dog. Working with a trainer is extremely valuable - I highly recommend doing so - but be careful of setting up unrealistic expectations as to the speed of results. I've always held that training is a life-long process, to be worked at each and every day.   
Any way, all the best to you and your puplet.

			My dog tank does the same, but it has gotten much much less. we just let him out alot more these days. It had gotten to a point where he would pee on me or my gf.(happened about 4 times)    
with letting him out more he hasnt peed in the house or on anyone anymore.   
now when he gets upset or has to pee he will start yelping so that means its time to go out....

			Thanks Meloncollie,    
I don't know how I missed your post there earlier, that is really great info! I'm getting in a contact with a vet friend now over here in Ireland to look into that. I'm interested working in Switzerland (I'd like to live near Zurich) mostly because I just really like the life over there, I've always wanted to live there. I love working with animals and children, but I'm still improving my basic German so I'm looking at ways of expanding my opportunities whilst I start to pick up the local spiel as it were. I'm also applying for some TEFL teaching work. Although I've cared for dogs and horses for much of my life, not to mention other animals, I definitely prefer to go down the official route so yeah that's a great idea, I'm a UK citizen so visas etc are no problem for me.

			im michaela(22). im looking for a playmate for my dog hachi. shes 9 months old pomeranian, playful, ""somehow"" obedient and very sociable. 
whenever i go out with her i cant get her off the leash because she keeps on trying to chase anything that moves.  
she keeps on trying to go to this group of dogs which are 5x bigger than her, the big dogs were on the leash but still, when i let hachi free, for sure she will try to say hello to these dog which im not quite sure if its a good idea.   
one time theres is this lady who owns a small dog and hachi seems to stay and play with this dog and ignoring everything else, even me  
then i got the idea that its maybe great for her to have walktime and playtime together with another dog (ANY SIZE). and for us to build a good friendship aswell.    
I work mon,wed-thursday. so i prefer tuesdays and weekends however our schedule fits.   
We live near BÃ¤ckeranlage.  
Please message me if youre interested with some details bout you and your dog.  
Id be glad hearing from you.

			We brought our then 11 year old cat with us from the States just about three years ago. He handled the flight like a champ...came out from the bulk luggage pick-up in the Zurich Airport happy to see us, but a little surprised at what he had just been through.    
We flew direct from Washington, D.C., and didn't give the cat any tranquilizers, as we had been advised by our vet against giving our cat tranquilizers, because they wouldn't last the duration of the ~6 hour flight, and that waking up in an airplane groggy from tranquilizers would be harder on him than experiencing the flight without tranquilizers.    
We did put our cat in cargo rather than carrying him onboard with us. He's a loud meow-er when it comes to travel, and we figured that our fellow passengers and flight crew would not appreciate that for the flight.   
That's our story, but here are some tips:   
1. Book a direct flight if it is at all possible. It is worth the extra money to avoid an extra flight leg and extra discomfort for the kitty. If you cannot fly direct, do not fly through the U.K. (they have different and specific guidelines, so it's best just to avoid that).   
2. Verify the exact charges and specifications (including what types of carriers are allowed, and what is allowed in the carrier) with the airline with which you want to fly. I believe that they can only accept a certain number of pets per flight, so it's best to get your cats on the list earlier rather than later.   
3. Share your flight details with your vet, so she can advise you specifically with regards to what your cats would need for that sort of arrangement.   
If I can remember anything else from three years ago, I'll be sure to update.    
I hope this helps. If you have any specific questions, just let me know.

Every shelter has it's own policies, put in place based on their experiences, for the good of the animals in their care. Please don't write off adopting a rescue based on one experience.   
If one shelter is not a good match for you, why not look farther? It's quite likely you will find a shelter with more flexible guidelines, who would be happy to home to you.    
I would counsel you to take this shelter's objections to heart, though, and think about how you might address the issue should it come up again. For instance, think about how you would reassure a shelter about the safety measures you had in place for your old cat, and what could you do to ensure the safety of another cat given the proximity to the road.    
Or taking another tack, think about how you could show that the road is not the danger that the shelter assumes it is - for instance, spend some time counting cars - what's the average traffic really like during the times your cat would be outside? As local vets or police how many accidents there have been in the last x years (a driver is supposed to report running over an animal).    
I know that it can be very demoralizing to be turned down when all you want to do is to do a good deed. But remember that the shelter staff don't know you - it's up to you to go the extra step show them that you are the best home possible for one of their charges. Think of it as you would a job interview - sometimes a well-thought out presentation is needed to sway the decision makers.    
But if this one shelter is firm on their policies, then do continue looking - other shelters may well have different views.    
Wishing you all the best.

			Our vet started with 2 shots for Brownie: one against nausea, and another against diahrrea.   
She also prescribed pro-biotic pills, and a paste to swallow twice a day, and which contains pro-biotic and argile in order to 'solidify' the content of her tummy. She also sold us special cans of food to use for 2-3 days, very easy to digest and specific for dogs with tummy problems.   
All that didn't come cheap - almost 200.- including the consultation - but proved to be extremely effective. She strongly recommanded the pro-biotics for on-and-off bouts of upset tummy.   
And to be clear: there's TWO epidemics going on at the moment: one for dogs, and another one for humans - typical and recurrent every January-February, every year   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Oct 2007	Groaned at 30 Times in 26 Posts	Warning: stomach bugs epidemic for dogs	MÃ©lusine	Posts: 3,398

			My friend's dog loves to go shopping so she takes her's along pretty well everywhere except Supermarkets and places that have the no dogs sign. Mine hates shops so I don't take her out of respect, unless I have to.   
On public transport dogs have to be in a carrier or pay kid's prices. Mine is small enough for a carrier but her ego won't allow it ( what can I say, pig headed dominant dog).   
Dogs are allowed in restaurants but its up to you if your dog can behave in one. Mine loves it so no problem with barking. And now that nobody smokes anymore inside its great.   
Some kantons are nicer than others to dogs of course but I won't go into that.

			Hi   
Looking for professional price per day dog sitting for my dog. I remember seeing a thread recently where someone advertised themselves but after searching I can not find it again   
Need a dog sitter for a week from 13th Feb but not kennels with lots of other dogs. Has anyone got any recommendations. As I mentioned on the pet sitting thread I can't return the favour at the moment hence looking for a paid (guilt free) service

			Climber, fees vary depending on the services needed - but expect around CHF 25-50 per hour for a dog walker who comes round once a day. You may need to pay mileage on top of that.   
Daycare, where you bring the dog to a carer's home or professional care facility, can run from CHF 40-100+ per day. You would need to vet any facility carefully.    
In-home care, where the sitter stays in the client's home, generally starts at CHF 200 per day.   
Do be aware that professional (which in most cases means paid, depending on how the business is set up) dog walkers and dog sitters are required to hold certain qualifications, and be registered with the cantonal veterinary office.   
You are absolutely correct that there are dodgy sites out there. There are people offering dog sitting services who do not have the necessary qualifications/registration/insurance, who are working 'schwarz'. A sitter/walker working illegally puts the client at risk.    
An alternative would be to find a friend with whom you can exchange dog care (as opposed to paying)  - but if this is a regular thing that goes on for more than 3 months that friend might need to do the SKN with your dog as well.   
(Speaking of which, don't forget that you must do the SKN theory course  you get a dog, and then complete the practical course within the first 12 months.) 
---   
Is the dog you are looking at a puppy, or an adult?    
If a puppy, you will need to have someone with him/her all day, a dog walker who pops in for an hour is not enough.  A pup cannot be left for long, this is a crucial socialization and training period. It would be grossly unfair to the pup - and you'd be setting yourself up for problems down the road. It is generally recommended that people who work full time should not get a puppy.    
An adult dog is a better choice for someone who is gone from the house full time - but you still need to choose the dog carefully. Some adult dogs could not handle being left while you work, even with a dog walker - some would be fine. You'd need to understand the individual's character.    
All dogs need companionship, training, and socialization - which requires quite a time-intensive commitment from you. When one works full time one often must devote pretty much all of one's free time to the dog, in order to meet the dog's needs. But that's why we have dogs, isn't it? Because we love being with them.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2010	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Doggy sitting service - advice needed	climber	Posts: 44

			When we lived in Japan our dogs slepts in crates every night. One of the main reasons was because of earthquakes. In the crates we knew there were safe, and we could find them quickly if we had to.    
When we returned home to Switerland we brought the crates with us but we just didn't have the space for them. They were very big. But the dogs were happy in them.

			We recently got two british blue kittens (got the idea from a forum recently) There are websites like tutti.ch and ricardo.ch which offer Tiere for sale, not all pedigree and prices vary.  I noticed also that there is an animal rescue centre next door to Zurich Zoo?? Other than that the local vet usually has a noticeboard and may know about kittens looking for a new home. Good luck they are such lovely animals and get on well with our 13 year old westie.

			Laddie, our dog (that's the little nautical  ) produces a lot of tartar and needs cleaning several times a year. I do that myself, of course without any medication but with professional instruments and technique.    
When I prepare the tools, he sits down wagging his tail and starts licking his teeth. I know it sounds crazy but he truly seems to like the procedure.    
However, I would not dare do this on other people's dogs. So, no inquiries, please.

			Alarm bells ringing here, too.   
Never, ever, hand over money before you have visited the breeder/rescue. While some breeders do indeed ask for a deposit, this should only be done once you have met the breeder, passed passed the breeder's homing criteria, once you have determined that the breeder passes your criteria for ethics, responsibility, health of pups, etc. Once you have seen the dam (and sire where possible) and thoroughly vetted the pup's living conditions and socialization program, once you have seen the health certificates - only then should you proceed.   
Unless you have a binding contract in writing, do not exchange money.   
Same goes for any rescue organization.   
Money upfront says BYB or naive breeder at best, scam or battery farmer at worst. Walk away. If the breeder is proposing to ship the dog to you then   away. That is the first sign of a battery farmer.   
---   
That said, I have adopted from a shelter in Italy. The paperwork is easy, you just need to follow the BVet requirements:       
Now - I took a vacation to visit my guy and spent a long time with him - got to know my dog's personality and needs, got to know the shelter staff - and they me - before finalizing the adoption. And this for a broken old collie that no one wanted .   
--    
Do understand that some of the worst of the dog world hide behind the snazziest websites  -    
Please read the thread Summerrain has linked. Then re-read it, and read it again.   
What breed are you looking for? Perhaps someone can point you to an reputable breeder here - or you may even find the companion of your dreams in rescue.

			There are many good breeders in the UK, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Sweden, in the US, in Australia, in every country. Nothing wrong with finding your puppy over the border.   
But please - do not buy over such internet sites. These sites are littered with battery farmers and scams.    
If you are not aware of what goes on in the battery farming trade (a more accurate term than puppy farming, puppy mills) please do a little googling. Best to have a strong stomach, though.    Every pup bought from a battery farmer condemns another dog to a life of misery - do not support this vile trade.   
I'll say it again - if a dog from a breeder is what you feel is best for you, go directly to the breed club of an FCI kennel club (the KC in the UK, VDH in Germany, etc.) who will guide you to reputable breeders within their club.   
Again, see the 'How to find a reputable breeder' thread - the same process applies to all good breeders, worldwide. Prices from reputable breeders in the western world are not all that far off those in Switzerland, btw.    
Reputable breeder, reputable rescues - both work hard to ensure the same thing: a loving forever home for their dogs.    
Yes, the process of bringing a dog into your life can be time consuming and costly. But well worth it, when you consider that your dog will be your loyal, loving companion for the next 10-15 years.

			My daughter attempted to import a docked tail spaniel puppy from the UK and was refused entry. She was warned that if she did manage to get the puppy past the customs without a problem she would then be prevented by the local police in Vaud form getting it licenced. She eventually imported o spaniel puppy without a docked tail.

Sue I make my own Schleppleine out of climbing rope and a carabiner or clip. You can get a variety of strengths - my guys are 10-16 kg, so I use a fairly lightweight rope. You can find this stuff at climbing stores, but I buy it  at Coop B/H for a tiny fraction of the 'profi' price.   You can also find the materials to make your own at Landi, again at very good prices.   
The Schleppleine you find at the pet store are indeed different weights - you will need something that will hold up to your dog's strength when running as he normally does. To start, probably choose a middle weight, one that feels comfortable to you. Or better yet, ask the staff at the pet store - they should be able to advise you.   
And if you haven't used one before -   attach a long line to a collar, only to a harness. The long line allows a dog to build up a nice head of steam - if you pull taught , or the line gets caught you could injure his throat.   
As for the cost of training classes - all over the ball park.    
To give you an idea, though - I have a yearly 'Familienhund' abo for each of my guys, ca CHF 600 for 40 or so lessons. Other classes like Team Training are something like CHF 20-25-ish per class, and Agility once a week is CHF 250-ish per semester.   
I train in SZ, so unless you are right on the border probably too far for you - but take a look at the Certodog website for trainers by canton:       
There are many other training organizations, though.  You can also look at the BVet database for SKN qualified trainers - most will also offer other training opportinities: (Searchable by PLZ)       
Good luck!

			Absolutely classic! I have three dogs and they fit that bill almost exactly - the tenterfield terriers are very intelligent and always play the sulking game when they think we're leaving the house without them (the female's the most dramatic) while the maltese terrier cross is thick as two short planks and we're lucky if he even responds to his own name - my sister reckons if there is such a thing as a retarded dog, then he's it! But we love him.

1839	null	null	null	null	"    Not only would it be helpful...  it's also the law.    
(Please forgive me for sounding like a broken record, but under the new Tierschutzgesetz anyone acquiring a dog after 1 Sept 2008 must take classes with a trainer certified by a Bvet-recognized training organization. First time owners are required to attend theory classes   acquisition of the dog. Given the confusion surrounding the roll-out of the law, you will have until 2010 to comply, though.)   
See the BVet for a list of training organizations recognized to certify members, click on 'Anerkannte Ausbildner von Hundetrainern' and 'Wer Darf Sachkundenachweise Ausstellen?:       
For instance, a list of Certodog eligible trainers can be found here:       
And a further list of training schools; some of these trainers will be certified to offer the Sachkundenachweis soon:       
The required courses are fairly minimal - 10 hours IIRC.  You will probably be able to complete the requirement via a puppy or Junghund class, but it certainly is a good idea - for you and your dog - to continue beyond that if you find a trainer with whom you like working.   
As for English speaking, I wouldn't worry so much. Just start calling trainers near you - even if a group course is offered only in German some trainers will be willing to do private lessons in English.    
Or use this as an opportunity to practice your German.  Seriously. Thanks to training classes and tolerant fellow dog owners, I speak fluent 'Hund-Deutsch'   - although my High German is imperfect and my Swiss German downright awful.   
If you speak any German at all, you will probably find that you can get by - and there is often someone in the class who speaks enough English to help when you get a bit lost.   
Honestly, being in a class where I didn't quite understand the language actually helped me work more effectively with my dog. After all, the dog is going through the same thing - trying to decipher a babble of sounds and an incomprehensible set of rules, relying on visual clues and universal tones to guess at what is being asked. Having been put in the same shoes, so to speak, I've learned a lot about how to use non-verbal communication more effectively.    
All the best to you and your pup.

			Years ago I owned a puppy and bought a child's tooth brush and some chicken flavoured toothpaste from the Swiss pharmacy. I used to clean her teeth once a week, she never enjoyed it, but at least she only bit the brush and not me! I had to give her away when she was 12 months, the new owner was mildly amused that I cleaned her teeth regularly.

When you were looking for a ""super store"" that carries small animals, I am positive others gave you a few links to animal shelters / animal shelter ""database"" as well.     , I'm sure you would have seen that not only do they have kittens and small animals but also (grown) cats and dogs as well.    
Perhaps it may prove useful to you to bookmark them.

			Our daughters found a stray who'd been hit by a car. We took him to the vet who said he was between 3 and 4 years old. A collie cross, black, white bib and 3 white paws. He was the most wonderful dog and fit almost right to the end. We had him 17 years, so was more than 20 when we decided it was time. Pepper was the best dog ever, and we were privileged he shared his life with us. Strays generally live much longer.

Iam finishing my current work this friday and will be having 3 months off before starting my MSc in March. So I wanted to offer my services to walk your dog. If you need a dog walker for a small fee just send me a line and we can meet up.   
I could take your dog for a run as well, if he needs more excersie. I have always had dogs (labrador, soft coated wheten terrier & tibitanian spaniel) back home and used to go running with them as well. I also used to work in a dog shelter when I lived in Canada.  
I live in Oerlikon/Seebach but I am very flexible both in location (ZÃ¼rich) and times.    
Take care,

On weekends, he is happy to snooze in with us till 9ish-10ish. But the moment you get up - he is relentless and constantly following you around - from the bathroom, to the kitchen, everywhere basically - refusing to let you out of his sight or sit down for a coffee until you bring him out. Bless. I personally feel bad if I chill because I know I wouldnt like it if I have to hold my pee in whilst someone else is enjoying their morning cuppa!

			Which is why I truly think it is important to have a dog suited for the conditions you live in. The fashion for having naked/hairless dogs here and St Bernard's in Mexico is daft imho.   
So glad to hear your dog is better btw. I used to help at a wildlife hospital in the UK, and bleeding from both ends usually meant ingesting rat poison/warfarin - sadly a terrible, slow death.

We had planned to but the vet advised us to let her drop some excess weight first (she was an enormous 27 kg). About a week after we got her she seemed ill and the vet, who had checked her out before we took her home, said she suspected early pyometria. But at 3 1/2 spaying is more complicated, not to mention on an overweight dog. But there was no choice. So we went ahead and she was fine, just had a longer hospital stay (most dogs go home the same day).   
The cost of spaying a dog in Japan is about 350 chf. We had our other two rescued dogs done while they were much younger.    
Hana recovered well but then developed bladder problems and there were months of tests with inconclusive results. Finally we took her to the oldest veterinary hospital in Japan where they found that the silk sutures used when she was spayed were the source of the trouble. This is so rare - then again, Hana is an unusual dog.  "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2007	Groaned at 9 Times in 9 Posts	For dog experts: puppy pees on his bedding?	kri	Posts: 1,030

Switch vets. I can give you some recommendations of vets in the Baden area, (they are on the sticky thread here). There are probably others with positive experiences with a vet in Basel.    
I think you should post the name of the vet, if you feel comfortable doing so. I know of vets in my area that I would not recommend based on my experience there. Then I spoke to a few other dog owners, they felt the same way. You may not have been the only person to have a bad experience with this vet. But you won't know if you don't publish the name.

			I just came across this online order site which offers the full range of Royal Canin and Hill's dog and cat food with free delivery  
They even work with a vet so you can order the products that you can only purchase from the vets. Wish I'd found it a year ago when one of our dogs was on one of the special vet only Royal Canin foods.

			MIL has a course hair beagle. He is ""challenging"" - partly because of the breed and partly because he was rescued when younger.   
Full of energy, needs plenty of exercise - but they are hunters - and will wander off if not controlled properly.   
He will bark at pretty much anything!!

			We just moved from Atlanta to Zurich with our 14 year old female Jack Russell Terrier. We live in the Seefeld area and are looking for someone to walk our Jack Russell twice a day on weekdays (around 12:00 and around 16:00, but we can be flexible).    
She's very low maintenance and doesn't need a lot of exercise. She really just needs someone to let her outside for a few minutes while we are away.    
Please me know if you are interested.    
Thanks!

I was just about to ask what paperwork your dogs needed from the consulate, and then I realised that human paperwork is important too. No good the dogs being good to go if you aren't I guess....   
Hope you get everything sorted ok. One last word of advice though is to make sure the employer is on the ball about your accommodations. This is often delegated to an assistant who will naturally not be living there him/herself, so might not necessarily have the right priorities. I'm not saying be worried, I am just saying that you should make sure that they are looking for what YOU need, not for what they think THEY might like.....

			Poor Hana, I hope her paw stops bothering her soon.   
Just guessing here, but I've found stinging nettles hurt far worse when I've managed to touch one with a cut hand. (Note to self: Do not work in the rose garden first and then try to tackle the nettles.  ) Could Hana have a cut on her paw, or an area of broken skin that could have come into contact with the nettles?   
Do let us know what the vet says.   
(Very pleased to hear that Hana doing so well after the disc surgery.)       
ETA: For what it's worth, I just looked on a UK based dog forum that I generally trust, and a few posters there report their dogs having bad reactions to nettles.

			Bobby, first can I say how wonderful that you have adopted an elderly dog in need - good for you!  There is something so very, very special about the oldies, they ask so little and have so much love to give. I wish you and Lady all the very best.   
---   
Nutrition can be quite a complicated issue. Good nutrition is especially important with senior dogs as their appetites, ability to digest, energy needs, and emotional relationship with food changes as they age.    
Billhardie and FairyDust have given you very good advice.    
My first thought when any of my mutts, but especially my seniors, starts to get fussy with food is to look for an underlying physical problem. It is generally easier to address physical problems than psychological ones, so I try to rule out physical causes first. Has Lady had a baseline blood chemistry done?  A blood chemistry is non-invasive and can give an idea of organ function so it's a good place to start. I do this as part of a regular senior dog check-up, this is an easy way to catch some issues in a timely fashion.   
(Mine are generally hoovers-on-legs, so turning up their noses at food starts my alarm bells ringing. An example: what I initially took as fussiness in my girl was acute pancreatitis, fussiness in one of the boys turned out to be chronic IBD.)    
It is important that Lady gets a balanced, nutritionally sound diet. That can be accomplished with either a good quality commercial diet, or a vet-approved home made diet - but you want to ensure that Lady gets what she needs to eat, not just what she wants to eat.   
----   
The question is: Is Lady rejecting the foods you offer because she doesn't like the taste of that particular item, because she is intolerant to an ingredient in the food, or because she is holding out for something better (in her mind)?  If the first two, the key is finding a nutritionally sound diet that Lady can and will eat. If the latter, then some behavior work is needed.   
Some random thoughts:   
In determining if a particular food suits Lady, look first to her general energy levels - is she alert and age-appropriate energetic, or lethargic? Also condition: how does her fur look - glossy, or dry? And watch her stools.  Firm, good color, normal amount? (Ah, the wonders of dog ownership - one quickly becomes something of a scatologist.) If her condition, energy and stools are not so good, she likely cannot tolerate one or more of the ingredients - which is why she may be rejecting the food.    
Allergies or intolerance to foods are not uncommon; you might start with something Lady has not had before, perhaps a fish and potato based diet, and see how that goes. Some dogs needs a grain-free diet, some need different levels of protein. We feed Magnusson, a baked kibble - most extruded kibbles are too greasy for my guys, the baked food suits them better. Adding hot water to the kibble helps bring out the smell, making the food a bit more appetizing. And mush is easier on my ancient almost toothless guy than kibble.  Lady might tolerate a senior diet better.    
If Lady absolutely cannot eat kibble, then a home-made diet is a possibility. But here it is very important to get the nutrition right. Any home-made diet probably needs a vitamin and mineral supplement, and you should ask your vet to analyze any home-made diet to ensure that it is indeed nutritionally sound.   
A very good resource discussing canine diets is the Whole Dog Journal. The magazine analyses commercial dry and wet foods, as well as home made diets and raw feeding - lots of good articles. In light of the melamine scandal of a few years ago, assessing quality and ethics of commercial companies has become a mission with them. This magazine is US based, so some of the commercial diets discussed are not available here.   
The magazine is subscription only, but there is limited free content on their website:       
There are times when I have fed home-made; the diet I followed is here:       
But please note that supplements are required.   
Changing foods can cause stomach upsets for some dogs; for this reason chopping-and-changing, trying different foods often to find something Lady likes, can be sort of self-defeating. As you look for a good food, try to stick with one for a while so that you get an idea of what Lady tolerates.   
----   
Assuming that Lady has been given a clean bill of health, then there is likely a behavioral reason, perhaps a relic of Lady's past. The bread and milk thing suggests that she has been fed this way in the past. (And no, bread and mild not a sound diet. ) However, if she was in a Tierheim for 8 months than surely she was fed on a no-nonsense kibble diet during that time. Have you spoken to the Tierheim to get an idea of her behavior around food there?    
If the food rejection is largely behavioral you need to decide what approach to take. With a healthy dog, I'd probably take a pretty hard line.   
If she is in good health, missing a meal or two won't hurt her - I'd try putting her food down, give her the 'time to eat' command, leave the bowl for ten minutes, then take it up again if uneaten. Ignore begging and pleading looks until next mealtime. Most dogs catch on quickly that nothing else will be on offer, so I'd best tuck in.   
When doing this it is important that you remain absolutely non-reactive. Meals should be a neutral time, not a time when you get upset at her behavior, or a time when you coax her to eat, bringing emotion into the event. (I know this is difficult to do when one is worried about one's pet.)   
Please note - this only appropriate if Lady is in good health. - If she has any health concerns do not do this without first speaking to your vet.   
---   
Another approach might be to do away with meals altogether.  My two younger dogs don't get food in bowls - instead they get their daily ration one piece of kibble at a time, as training rewards throughout the day. (This means I walk around with pockets full of kibble all day, but hey ho...)    
Will Lady accept dry kibble from you, as opposed to eating it in a bowl? Does she like to train? If so, perhaps you could try this. My guys love to work, love training. Feeding as rewards rather than meals has the added benefit of cementing the bond between us, gives the dogs the brain training they so love - and keeps them from getting fat. If I fed meals in addition to training rewards mine would both be barrels.    
A variation on that is to turn mealtime into a game - this is good for play-oriented dogs. I have a treat dispenser that looks like a gumball machine with a lever. I trained my girl to press the lever to get a piece of kibble. Some days I put her part of her  food allowance in the dispenser - she loves the 'self-service' game. You can do the same with a treat ball or cube, or home-made activity box. Another game is search: I hide kibble in toys, containers, etc around the room, give my dog the 'search!' command -  she runs around the room looking for her food.  If Lady is play oriented, doing something similar might be a way to motivate her to eat.    
Be aware, though, that turning meals into a game can back fire with some dogs. Mealtime as playtime might not fit into your schedule every day.  The key is you decide when the game is played.   
You could also feed  Lady in a kong if she likes those - stuff a kong with either kibble mush or your home made diet.    
----   
Do you think Newton's behavior around food might influence Lady in any way? Could interaction between the two over food play a part in Lady's fussiness? I've seen some dogs reluctant to eat in the presence of others, sometimes because of subtle signals the other dog gives off.  On the other hand, I've seen some who get food-obsessive and bolt it down when other dogs are around. Something to think about.   
(I had accidental success curing my MILs fussy-eater cairn when she came to stay with me for a holiday, simply by feeding her in the same room as my piglet of a collie. The cairn was doing her usual diva routine and before I could stop him, my collie scarfed down all her food. The little cairn quickly became a paid up member of the clean plate club after that. Be careful though - you don't want to set up a food jealousy or resource guarding situation.)    
---   
Another thought:  how much food Lady does actually need?  The feeding recommendations on many foods are notoriously over-generous. My healthy dogs get ca. 10g food per kg bodyweight - which works out to a little more than 1/2 the recommended allowance of many foods. If I fed mine the manufacturer's recommended amount, they'd be huge.   
Also, perhaps Lady needs small meals more often - my boy with IBD can only eat a spoonful or two at a time - so he eats 4-6  tiny meals a day. Many senior dogs have digestive issues; feeding little and often seems to help. If you find this is the case a vet visit is likely in order.   
---   
These are just some random thoughts, some may apply, some not.  Start by checking for or ruling out any physical reason why Lady might not want to eat, and then spend some time observing her behavior around food. Perhaps with more specifics we can come up with some more appropriate ideas.     
Good luck - and bon appetite!     
ETA:  Re: adding bullion to Lady's food. While adding something appetizing is often a good idea, I'd stay away from commercial bullion  because of the huge salt content - especially in a senior dog where kidney problems could be a risk. Rather, make your own so that you get the meat smell and flavor but no salt.

			ok so no over stocking, make sure you do a very good clean of the ground when doing a water change. knock the lights down a bit and see what happens.  i would increase the water changes also as you have a small filter   
Easiest way is to get some quick growing plants - the algae is because of excess nutrients so quick growing plants will compete for this. go for water wisteria - it grows quick and looks ok and isn not hard to grow.   
to remove snails you have 2 options, by hand or by natural means - look for assasin snails, they look quite nice and will love to help you with the snails!!!

One will likely be asked several questions, sort of like an interview to assess your skills, knowledge, etc. Then one usually meets with a staff member and further questions are asked, often to pair you up with an appropriate dog. One usually is asked to leave one's Ausweis when one takes a dog walking. It's very helpful if one can volunteer with some frequency, as you develop a rapport with the dogs.   
Some rescues have an orientation program that dog walkers need to complete.   
Most Tierheim do not allow minor children to walk the dogs, some will allow a child to accompany an adult, but children are generally not allowed to hold the leash.   
Every Tierheim I know requires that the dogs be walked on-lead only.   
Some Tierheim will ask for a regular-ish commitment, some are happy to accomodate less regular volunteers. Each Tierheim sets it's own policies, so don't take my word for gospel, call and ask.

			Well, we all arrived safely to our Zurich apartment (2 parents, 2 babies, and a cat).   
It's funny how the part we were most scared of, i.e., the Zurich airport part, turned out to be the easiest one: We went through the red ""goods to declare"" lane (I doubt it if they would have noticed that we are traveling with a cat otherwise), were asked to present the FVO permit (apparently, this is the only document one needs), Shirley's microchip was read to verify a cat-permit match, paid 88 CHF, and we were free to go. The whole process lasted less than 5 minutes.   
In contrast, we did have some unexpected difficulties in Tel Aviv airport (from which we took-off): First, we found out that Swiss (the airline) requires that cats will be carried in a soft cage (when traveling with us in the passengers cabin), so we were forced to buy one (US$40) and transfer Shirley from her old cage to the new one. Then, security demanded that we put the soft cage through the x-ray machine (although it was bought in the airport 10 minutes beforehand). We refused to put Shirley herself in the x-ray machine, so they suggested that we take her to a quiet room nearby where I held her in my arms while the security guys scanned her cage.   
I don't want to imagine how she felt throughout this journey. But I'm happy to see that less than 24 hours have passed since our arrival and she is already getting used to her new home (spent the night in our bed; walking on my keyboard while I'm trying to write this post :-)   
Many thanks to all of you for the helpful advice,

			I think tuna for human consumption is to high in phosphorous for cats and is bad for them in the long term, especially if they are neutred.   
Not a great fan of Royal canin nor hills..and vets selling it is a bit like Doctors pushing certain drug brands..   
Give Orijen a try, its from Canada and you can get it from Zooplus,   is in english and you pay in euro

			Hi Charz   
Try looking on here - breeders post kittens as they become available, after about 7 weeks when you can start to go and visit.

1903	27.10.2010, 00:49	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: bern	"    Well, if your breeder gave you Proplan, go re-stock what she gave you rather than switch brands. Surely she didnt give you something that your puppy is allergic to?   
Why not stick to Pro-plan in the meantime?   
On a side note: if you want to change food, best way to do it is to add a small amount of the new food into the old and increase it over the next couple of days once the dog shows no reaction to it. Look out for loose stools and the likes.

			Hi!   
My boyfriend and I are the proud owners of a friendly and playful 6 month old Dackel.  I think that we are probably on opposite sides of the city (we live in the Gundeli area behind the SBB), but perhaps we could have a play date and/or do a pet swap at some point.  Our boy is very good with other dogs, especially those around his age.  We currently have a friend acting as a dog walker, but it would have been nice to have an alternative when she had an emergency trip this week.   
Anyhow, I hope that you and the pup are well and maybe we'll see you wandering around down by the Wiese at some point.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Reciprocal Pet Care/Sitting in Riehen/Basel	annast	Posts: 12

No brisk walks...Bassets are noses on legs....95% sniffing, 5% walking 
Bassets are incredibly funny, but extraordinarily single-minded and stubborn, however....a way to a Basset's mind/heart is its stomach. Bassets will do anything for food. Bassets are terribly social and friendly, which makes them lousy guard dogs...they would see a burglar as a potential new friend and if he gives them food, well then he MUST be a friend.

			Not another, I want to breed my dog thread.   
Toy breeds are typically fraught to breed, and many do not birth naturally, causing a great deal of stress all round. I'm especially concerned that the OP seems more concerned with the length of the studs coat than if it's properly scored (or her bitch for that matter). No responsible person would breed without ensuring they have homes for, or will keep any pup's, and that's before conversations about health, facilities etc are even entered into. A litter of pups is noisy, messy, stressful, expensive and bloody hard work, and should never be entered into lightly... regardless of how long the coat is.

			Can cats create these yellow patches too? They've recently started to appear in the lawn in front of our apartment building. Lily never pees in the lawn, and I've only ever seen other dogs rarely pee at the perimeter. I suppose a dog could be coming up peeing when I'm not around....I have, however seen several cats hanging about in the lawn. I was wondering if the yellow spots are from them?

			Woof Striker!! *smells your bum*   
My name is Oskar, a Norwich terrier and I will be turning two in a month's time. Its great to see someone from the terrier group joining this forum and I cant wait to play with you! I prefer younger dogs because the older ones are sooooo boring. They only want to snooze    
I went to school and a junghunde play group here in ZÃ¼rich. My teacher was Carolina Jaroch, and she is great! I understood her much better than mummy did because mummy's German sucks and she still sends me cards from time to time.   She runs a puppy play group where you can meet alot of new friends and she is located at the end of Tram 13 AlbisgÃ¼etli on Ãetlibergstrasse:       
Mummy says you'll have to attend a compulsory BVET course too and Carolina runs that as well.    
We live by Lake Zurich so its a great place for dogs to run about and swim. Hope to see you down here soon!       "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Puppy play group	maybelstar	Posts: 10

			Here's a little more to the story (and don't worry, no dogs were harmed). This took place in early June of 1991. After the fighting was over in Kuwait, my unit had to wait it's turn to fly back to the United States. Because we were one of the last units to arrive (Christmas day, 1990) we wound up sitting in the desert outside the city of Al Jahra. By June, the area was declared safe and Kuwaiti citizens were just starting to return to the area.   
With absolutely nothing to do besides wait, we took to getting ourselves back into good physical condition. My buddy Tom and I decided to go for a 3 mile run, and because it was extremely hot and the fighting was over for months, we decided to not bring our rifles with us. When we were about a mile out of our camp, I saw the dog pack. Being a dog lover, I thought ""Oh how cute. a bunch of puppies!"". The dogs looked at us and thought ""Oh how cute. Lunch has arrived"".   
The dogs ran towards us and it didn't take long to figure out that they were not looking to have their ears scratched or bellies rubbed. They quickly surrounded us and began their attempts to separate us. We stood back to back and started looking for some kind of weapon for protection. When we tried kicking or punching, the dogs snapped at us. Although they were not big, they made up for it with speed. If a dog doesn't want you to touch him, they can easily jump out of the way and take a bite out of your hand.   
We were in open desert with absolutely nothing around us. We kicked in the sand for rocks and the best we could come up with were small pebbles. Nothing that could hurt a dog, but they didn't know that. Luckily, the dogs had had a few rocks thrown at them before, so they would back off if you looked as though you might throw one. Actually throwing the pebble was a mistake because they knew we were then defenseless.   
So we held our pebbles above our heads and started our way back towards base camp. We had to move slowly or the dogs would lunge at us more boldly. We also had to constantly turn in a circle. If we ignored any angle for too long, the dogs covering that area would move in on us. After about 30 minutes, which felt like hours under the hot sun and the bad situation, a Humvee (American military vehicle) saw us and drove up. The driver got out and fired a few shots into the air. The dogs took off running farther into the desert. The driver got back into his Humvee without so much as saying hello and drove off (a ride back to our base camp would have been the polite thing to offer). Tom and I sprinted the remaining half mile back to base camp where we took our fair share of ribbing for being scared of a bunch of mutts. We never left base camp again without our rifles or in large groups.   
The fact that these dogs could survive out there was absolutely amazing. I have no idea how they were staying hydrated, and what they were eating for food was a pretty grim prospect. I remember a few of the dogs looking as though they were apologetic or unsure if they were doing the right thing. Others looked quite savage as though they never knew about the traditional bond between man and dog. We were just prey to them. The alpha dog of the pack had a real intelligence to his eyes. He looked like a smaller version of an Australian Dingo and was maybe 15 kilograms. From time to time some of the dogs would start backing away like they had doubts about the venture, and the alpha would then bark at us even more fiercely, which would rally the other dogs back into the hunt. We focused our threats of thrown pebbles towards him because all of the other dogs would jump back when he jumped back, and when he moved forward, they all joined in.   
Looking back on this it seems very interesting. At the time I was genuinely in fear for my life. They may not have been big, but with so many attacking at once, I am quite sure they could have killed us.

			FWIW, I got my apartment and retrospectively told them my pet Yorkie was joining me 3 months later after the pet passport was approved. I assured them, truthfully, that he was quiet and house trained.  The agent sent a contract amendment allowing a small dog to live there. Given the circumstances it may have been too much hassle or even unlawful for them to object...

I want to know same as Deb, would you do it again or was it too hard at separation? I ask because I've been thinking for a while that I'd like to do it as well...   
Also, I did read (last year) that they want the dog to be brought up in a house without other dogs - I can not remember what they had to say about a household with cats (I think they said it was alright).   
Another thing is: I sometimes have visiting dogs or cats while their people are away, is this something that is alright when one has a future guide dog or not?

1940	25.08.2010, 12:07	Senior Member	Thanked 19 Times in 17 Posts	Location: Biel/Bienne	"    To do it right, bringing a new dog into a family requires planning and preparation - some things to think about :     
1. English Bull Dogs and Pugs are two very different breeds. Please research both breeds, and determine if either is appropriate for your lifestyle - both here, and in India.   
2.  Please research 'Brachycephalic dogs/ flight risk'.    
3. Please think about the stress of a flight on a puppy - most airlines have a minimum age limit before they allow a dog to fly.  In any event, please think about whether you would have time to properly acclimate him to his travel crate before flying.   
4. Please research importation requirements for dogs into India.   
5. Please consider waiting until you are settled in India - moving countries is always a very hectic time, lots of stress and rushing around. Adding a new dog to the mix would complicate things greatly - for you, and more importantly, make it very difficult on the dog. Why not wait until you have more time free to introduce a dog to your family, to train him, to properly socialize him - then look for a reputable breeder in India.      
Wishing you and your future dog all the best.     
ETA - There's also the SKN to consider; if you are a first time dog owner, still resident in Switzerland, you would be required to take the theory part of the Sachkundenachweis before you purchased a dog - a breeder /Tierheim is not supposed to allow you to take a dog home without proof that you have completed the course. Again, would you have time to do the course before leaving?

However, portsmouth68 is right in so far as some countries have restrictions as to how animals may be imported. Between import restrictions and the airlines conditions and even export restrictions depending on the animal it makes sense sometime to get a pet shipper to help wade through all the bureaucracy.

			Assuming the plant is indeed Elderberry/Holunder (Sambucus nigra)...   
... and according to the toxic plant link above...   
Sambucus nigra is 'schwach giftig' - mildly toxic - for dogs, meaning symptoms of toxicity would first show after eating a massive amount.    
But, you really should have an expert identify the plant before doing anything else.    
---     
FYI, another list of poisonous or potentially toxic plants, with common symptoms, from the DogsTrust (UK):         
---   
In any event, this sounds like an ideal situation for training a solid 'leave' or interrupt signal.   "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 3 Times in 2 Posts	I think my dog is part goat	Janite	Posts: 120

			Hello everyone, 
I am looking for a cat sitter in October 15-20.  
We have 2 cats and during this period of time they will require two visits. We live in Dietikon (12 min from Zurich S12 and S3), but apartment is just a minute from the train station. 
I will appreciate any help or suggestions with it. 
Regards to all

			We always take our two cats with us (across Europe when we go home for holidays) cos I just wonÂ´t leave them with strangers..  
I love them to death, and travelling with them in the car during cca 12 hours journey is easier every time, they got used to it and sleep almost the entire time! 
However, I guess I am a bit of a hypocrite because I would be willing to look after other peoples cats, knowing how much I would care about the job and responsibility. 
So there must me someone else out there just like me.

			Hi Amanda,   
I'm writing concerning your dog walker request. My name is Marcela, I'm Brazilian. I've been living in Switzerland since Aug. 2008 when my husband was transferred to work here. At the moment I'm working as pet sitter around Zurich every weekday.  However I'm available between the time you've requested. 
As regard my personality I'm easy-going, patient and I love pets and children 
My charges are usually CHF 20 per walk(one dog), and CHF 25 per walk (2 dogs). If you're interested, please let me know.   
I look forward to hearing from you.   
Best Regards, 
Marcela

			thanks I am going to print all this, and off to buy a new bucket and tests on my way home, i will test the water 1st and hopefully understand what I am looking at,

I really appreciate all your advice, I am the last person any one expeceted to get fish ha, I never thought I would be interested in them , more a doggy person, but now we got them, I am determined to one day have a huge aquarium ha and I tried to do this correctly on the pet shop guys advice, so bit annoyed with him, but no fish going to die on my watch ( or should I say wash   ) I will update everyone on how I do, and maybe pick some brains again

			Jimmy snuffles me when I am asleep (or pretending to be) to see if i am still alive. And starts that purring that goes up into a chirping sound, whilst dribbling. Usually around 5 a.m.   
He also only sleeps between the legs of men. Otherwise it is around my neck.   
And has recently taken a liking to green olives.   
Otherwise, just a cat like thing.   
PS and sits in front of the telly.  I think this is because he was used to sitting on top of the old telly, now i have the flat screen....

			OK, so I've 'stuck' the 'Vet' and the 'Boarding' Threads. Let me know if you make another and it needs the same treatment. If, at any time, things change, it is no problem at all to Unstick them.   
I think it's not a bad idea to have the general links, the sort of 'vet-look.ch' thing on the Thread too as there is so much info to be found there when all else fails. The emergency numbers are easy to find. However, it is obviously even better if folk put in their own recommendations.   
Great that you started the job. Keep up the good work.

			Dear Bizzie Bee, 
Thanks for your kind response, and the concrete 'care routine'. 
That's great that your bunnies have a sense of adventure! 
We have a hutch and a garden, and I hadn't realised the bunnies need daily exercise; I hardly get time to do that for myself. Do you think they would be into a pilates class, and we could hit 2 birds with the 1 stone; hardly appropriate for the pets corner, but I hope you know what I mean...   
We live in Eglisau, I notice you are also in the Zurich area. 
If your daughter agrees, you might like to visit us one afternoon, and check out where her rabbits would be, and meet Anna. All still being well, perhaps we could arrange a time for them to visit that would be useful for you, for example a week or so when you go on holiday or something like that. 
Kind Regards and hope you folk enjoying the lovely weather, 
Caitrin

			dianne, in some cases it can just be the ageing process and something that has to be accepted (unfortunately). If you are talking to your vet and want to test how hard of hearing your pet is, ask about an  ""audiometry test"", which is apparently the ""technical"" term. Note that in order to take this test your dog needs to be lightly sedated and also that the equipment is not widely available  (Tierspital in Zurich and the Tierklinik Obergrund in Luzern are the ones I know of).

We are arriving in Lausanne on Thursday 2 September.

Does anyone know of any dog-sitters or kennels?

			Our English Setter used to have the runs because of the meds for his auto immune disease. Boy, he could paint the walls, I'm not kidding. Our Boarding Kennels in Valais (excellent by the way - they are champion breeders) recommended Flatazor and after that we had few problems. Our boy had the low protein one.     
I guess people have set ideas about dog food. The breeder in the UK we bought our Setter from fed his dogs on a diet of tripe and boiled potato. Swore by it.

			Thanks guys!   
A lab is certainly high on my list. I have seen a few in action as guide dogs and explosives detectors, and I do love them. The smaller labs would also be easier for me to handle. I've tried with the bigger labs but their strength is just overpowering!   
My one concern, even with a slimmer lab, is weight: if I ever had to carry the dog I think it would be a struggle.    
For this reason I am also considering a beagle, a spaniel or a terrier.    
I will be in touch with REDOG once I've collected some more info. It's been a fantasy of mine to work with them for some time.

			We moved to Switzerland from the US last spring with two dogs. Although we are not in the Zurich area (we reside near Neuchatel), finding housing that allowed pets required more work, but was by no means impossible. 
The relocation agency that my partner worked with was not that helpful. Finding the right accommodations required personal footwork, but was well worth it. We know of another american couple who also relocated with two large dogs and found a great house to rent, right on lake Neuchatel. Hopefully you will find equally as viable options near Zurich. Be persistent!

The story might be cheesy and all, but had I not read it, I would not have volunteered at shelters or fostered an abused dog which thankfully gained her trust back in pple and found a great new home. They were great experiences and who knows, if someone else will be driven to help abandoned dogs/cats/other pets, I guess the story's purpose has been served.

			Last night I walked out of my apartment just to be attacked by the same neighbour dog on the stairs. I was fast enough to get back to the apartment, so no harm done. At the moment of attack I was on 3rd floor, dog was nearby and the dog owner was two floors below.   
Next morning I went to local police, explaining the situation. All I've got is ""ok, we'll look into this"", no papers to sign and a big lecture about dog psychology. In the end of the discussion police officer told me that if I don't like this dog behaviour I might need to change the apartment.  A!

For the 4 hours Theory, I was unable to find anything in English. I actually went along to a Theory course held in French, and had a lovely French/English speaking lady sit next to me at the back, and simultaneously translate the French into English. The vet who was holding the theory course was happy for this to take place.   
For the practical training, I have finally found a trainer happy to do the training in English. Had our first session this morning. Don't know who is more knackered, me or the mutt!

			Anyone have a line on any reliable pet boarders in Ticino? I have to go to Russia for a couple of weeks on 5 Sept and my wife is coming with me so we need to have someone look after our two eclectus parrots. Turns out our reliable friends are also gone at this time. We've tried contacting the people at Canile alle Rive a couple of times (even earlier this summer) and almost never get a reply back or, if we do, it's 'Oh we'll call you very soon' and they never do. Makes me...not confident in them.

			Hi Friends,   
Does anybody know of any place where they give the theoretical course for new dog-owners in English or Italian?   
I need to do it - or at least to book it by end of August - but I cant find any place where they do it in a different language than French (that I do not speak!).   
I would be interested in any course in Neuchatel, Lausanne, Geneve, Bern, Fribourg areas. I could also go to Basel if needed... but that would be a bit far.   
Many Thanks in advance from me and my special puppy    
Sorry, I just saw the other post on the same topic. Moderator, you can cancel this post if you want. 
Thanks

I've spent hours this past week researching Swiss and UK law (Defra [the UK authority] only knew that prior Swiss rules were withdrawn, and had no notion of what documents are now needed for parrots). But as far as I can tell, so long as I have a CITES certificate (I applied for it today), that's all I need:    
Our parrot and our cat get along famously, and they will stay with us and our daughter in Switzerland for the next six months or so while our London place is renovated.   
I suppose if we are denounced we'll have to borrow or rent a companion for our Figaro.

I'm studying music here, and my schedule is quite flexible, so I'm looking to do some pet sitting! I love animals and have been taking care of them my whole life. I've been pet-sitting, volunteering in animal shelters, and dog walking since I was 9 years old. I'm definitely available for those dates, so please let me know if you haven't found anyone else!

			Can I just clarify:   
For those of you who have received the tags from the gemeinde after you've paid the tax - what does it say on it?    
Is it similar to the one that you can get yourself in Qualipet? I have a feeling we are talking about different types of tags here (the ones you get yourselves and the ones issued by the Gemeinde).

			Hello   
My one year old English bulldog, Nina Bear, is a happy young dog who loves playing with other dogs, especially bulldogs. We walk three times daily at Brunaupark and were hoping to find other dogs interested in getting together for playtime.    
This is the biggest dog park in Zurich with lots of other dogs and places to explore. Nina loves to sniff around the area, swim in the river and say hello to all of the other dogs. All she needs is a buddy to join her in her adventures! She has many friends at the park but most owners don't speak English, so it can be a little intimidating approaching them to set play dates.    
On a side note, any bulldog owners out there?    
We hope to make friends soon!   
Cheers,   
Carina and Nina Bear

			Thanks to you all for your input.  This whole communication has been a little complicated on my end, because (due to the language barrier) my husband has been doing to communicating for me.  I do not know what the final resolution was for the owner (and will not ask DH to call back for details  ), but he does not have the fish any more.     
The tank and furniture are set to be picked up tomorrow, so I guess the whole thing is finished then.

Its relatively informal and i don't really think its possible to fail the test since from what i see they're not really judging aptitude but more attitude and responsibility...

			If you think it is the female, it most likely due to the surgery.  Spaying females can be a pretty in depth procedure, and it is not uncommon that there are complications.  Seems like she is finding soft, comfortable places to pee.  That, to me, indicates something is wrong.  It might actually be uncomfortable for her to go in the litter box. 
Two things to try: 
1.  Separate her somewhere in the house where she will be comfortable with her own litter box.  If the peeing in the rest of the house stops, then you know it is her.  If you don't find pee in her box, then you know something is wrong.  Monitor her behavior because any changes can be symptoms of something else.   
2.  Take her back to the vet and have her checked out.  You can *never* be too cautious in these situations.     
Good luck, and keep us posted...  :]

			Ok, first I would like to ask you if you have ever lived with a female cat in heat? It is HORRENDOUS! I would never recommend it and once they have their first heat and they have not had kittens they came more and more frequently and you run the risk of losing her if she is a special breed. 
I would never let my cat breed with a street cat, the reason: feline leukemia...it is contageous and can kill them.

			Hi there, 
We're moving to Leysin at the end of August and we'd really like to bring our dog with us. He's a bit of a special case as he's a rescue dog who can get anxious when left alone for too many hours during the day. We lived in Hong Kong before and had someone who looked after him at her home from 7am to 3pm. We'd really like to organise something similar for him in Leysin. He's a fabulous, affectionate dog who loves walks and company. Does anyone know of someone who might be able to ""dog sit"" for us during the day? Thanks!

			Thank you Transatlantic, dmay. I'm going to try rats. Two females sounds good to me. Although we may have to wait until the latest child can crawl and fiend off overly excited rats.      I have read and thought about this. What.... are you getting at? A pet is, usually, an animal. Therefore a pet lover is an animal lover, even if very specific to just a species.   
Reptiles, as cool as they are, would just not fit this household. Maybe in 10 years, same for ferrets. A 4 years of a rat pair seems perfect to our current situation.   
Much thanks given.

			Hello... 
I am moving to the La Tour de Peilz - Vevey area in two weeks with my husband, two kids and two dogs. I am curious if a good place to board your pets (while on vacation) exists in my area. I am open to suggestions.    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Hotel for Dogs, Vevey area???	stephgrohe	Posts: 5

I read before that somebody suggested only offering dry food (or even a wet food in this case - anything but tuna) for up to 3 days at a time.  If there is no medical issue, and just stubbornness, then eventually they will eat if hungry enough.  If after 3 days he doesn't touch it, then offer tuna to feed him, then try again.  But, I would suggest talking to somebody more professional about this before starting.     
Lame question - but have you offered tuna flavored wet/dry food? I sometimes take the water from the tuna fish can and dump it over the cats' dry food.  They think it's a treat.

			I just brought my cat from Canada. He was allowed in with his tattoo, no microchip required until next year. I got the info straight from the Swiss authorities and brought along her email confirming his tattoo was acceptable. The email really helped at customs because they started to shake their heads when I said he wasn't micro chipped. As soon as they read it they just wanted their 88 CHF for entry.   
I was really worried about how he would do being stuffed in a carrier under my seat but he took it all in stride and was very calm through the whole flight from beginning to end. The staff were great, the agent even came on board just before we left to move a girl who was seated in the middle seat beside me so that I could have the extra room for my cat during the flight.   
Good luck

			This may seem obvious but assume you have checked with the SPA in Nyon. Usually missing pets find their way there if someone cannot find the owner (ie. new to area and no identifying collar). Also, you can post a flyer/poster there as well.

022 361 61 15        
Also, I live in a neighboring village of Grens and have not seen the posters. May be worth driving to all neighboring villages and placing a poster in the center of the village. After a period of time, cats can travel some distances.   
Also, since you live so close to Signy shopping center, worth placing a poster there on the board as well.   
Another possiblity is placing an add in the local paper, La Cote, do it for the Thursday 'tout menage' edition, and you will get greater reader coverage.   
Edited to add:  Yet another possibility is to place a poster in the inter-communal dechetterie that is a stones throw from Grens, and gets all the visits of the neighboring communes.  It is on the border of Grens, Signy, Borex.  If you haven't visited yet, good to go and the farmers running it are very nice.

			Go for a long-hair Chihuahua... they only shed twice a year and your daughter will love grooming it and doing ""princess"" things with it.   
Also, they are the longest living toy breed with very few genetic problems- your girl will grow-up with it and you will have few worries. Their life span is approximately 15-17 years.   
I've two short-hairs (there is a dog en plus each month in the vacuum bag, because they constantly shed) and I find them the neatest dogs, 'cause they are like cats... but that need to be walked (good for calorie burning).

			Actually by law, if you find a ""runaway pet"" you are obliged to feed it and give it shelter until the owner has been found. This can also be achieved by taking the pet to the Tierschutz or calling the Tierambulanz.   
Art 720 of the Civil Code states that whoever find a lost pet must inform the owner or, if that is not possible, inform the authorities. Article 721 states that such ""things"" must be stored/kept in an appropriate manner. This has been interpreted to mean that pets in such a situation must be given food and shelter.   
I think Mrs. D was more angry at people encouraging you to ""shoo"" the problem away rather than carrying on what you were doing which was quite obviously looking out for the cat's interests. And, should an owner berate you for feeding the cat, then I think you have enough arguments to quieten them down.   
A) You were doing your civic duty 
B) Given the cat had no name tag, how could you possibly know who to call

			hopefully Oscar will make a full recovery. I understand how you feel though - my cat was hit by a car last fall, unfortunately she didn't survive and was found by a neighbour close to our house, by the side of the road.    
I probably can't blame the driver, as the cat was obviously not on the leash and sometimes they do run on the road without looking around, so maybe it was not even possible to avoid it. But it's a small village, so the driver was probably local and the cat was wearing a neon pink collar with our address and phone numbers, quite hard to miss...was it really so difficult to let us know what had happened? We spent two days looking for the cat before the neighbour called. I only hope my poor kitty was killed instantly and not just left to die..

			Hi Yuna   
First, you need to decide on the airline, they might not even fly your pets, so this you should know first.   
Second, decide how would you like to fly you pets, there are normally 2 options, depending on the airline. 1 is pets fly with you and will be put under your seat. 2 is they will be put with the rest of the suitcases. The costs are fairly different.   
After you decided which airline, you can contact them for further details regarding costs and requirement of the cage. The cage also must meet the ITAT requirements.   
You should also check the local airport and company with connect with your airline (the courtry you are moving to) for any extra fees for landing your pet.    
Since you are leaving from Switzerland, i would suggest you to take Swiss airline, direct flight is the best for your pets since they will be extremely stressful, they will take a couple days or weeks to recover after the move depending on your cats.   
Dont forget to check on the govn. website (the place you gonna be) to make sure you have fulfil all the requirements such as health certificate, rabies etc. If you need to get your pets rabies injection, they wil not be allowed to fly for first 30 days after they are injected.   
Good luck.

I guess the CHF 63 includes some safety margin because you won't know the exact exchange rate in advance.

			Hi everyone   
My girlfriend recently got a dog - a mini Schauzer - and I am really enjoying running with it and getting it fit.  I have heard that the going rate for dog walking in Zurich is 30CHF per hour and was thinking for that rate I could surely do something much better and run and play with the dog to increase its fitness.   
I just wanted to guage interest if anyone out there has an active breed dog that is missing the necessary exercise and hence is overweight or engaging in destructive behaviour in the apartment.  If so I could get a couple of dogs together and go running with them, or swimming in the lake with them, play frisbee, catch etc.  Combined with a good diet your dog could be fit in a month or two if it isn't already.   
I wouldn't be interested in working with aggressive dogs and the dog would need to be sociable with other dogs so i can take a couple of them together.  I work full time so it would need to be in the weekday evenings after 6.30pm.  I could come and collect from you and the areas of interest are Zurich (where I work) or Zug/Cham (where I am living).   
If someone wants to track the progress of their dogs running then I can easily provide a map via my GPS running watch of where they went and you can see the average speed etc etc.     
If people are interested please let me know and you can PM me if necessary.  Ideally I would like at least 2 dogs that I can take at the same time to get the idea off the ground.  Based on level of interest etc I can decide whether to go ahead and rates etc.   
Cheers

			I was sleeping and my then young cat wanted me to wake up, so he did his usual ""jumping up and down on the boss' head"" routine. By coincidence, he threw my reading glasses on the floor, which I had parked on my bedside table. Of course, I picked them up and told the cat to never ever ever do this again. And I can be grumpy as hell early in the morning.   
What he learned from this was: Throw the glasses down is the quickest way to wake the boss up. Who cares, that he isn't happy about his glasses being thrown on the floor, after boss gets up, first thing is food for the little zoo anyway. We're hungry, therefore glasses must fly. Howgh!   
Then he kept on thinking further like: What else could we throw down from somewhere and what's going to happen then? How about this nice video-camera there on the shelf, could be fun...    
When I figured out, why he threw everything down from everywhere, it was clear, that he was basically playing fetch with me   Took me quite a while to reverse this behaviour.   
Now, he is allowed to throw empty pet-bottles to the floor and then he gets the caps to play with. it's much cheaper, than if he throws cameras and I take them to the repair shop...

			Hello.    
I am looking for a dog sitter for the last week of August. Below are a few details:   
- My dog is a 4 year old mixed breed, approximatly 20 kilos.  
- We live in Zurich, Enge / Sihl City 
- She needs at a minimum 2 30minute walks per day (morning and evening) and a quickie before bed...plus lots and lots of love:-)   
I do not want to send her to a boarding kennel as she has already been through a lot of traveling, transitions, etc and she is most comfortable in her home.    
If interested please PM me.    
Thanks.

			Hi Meloncollie   
Thank you for your fantastic and invaluable post.   
I think it is prey drive and territory that are the main issues here.   
Yes the owner got bitten when she intervened.  I know we're not supposed to, but if I had a little dog and a big dog attacked, I would probably do the same thing!  Heart over head.   
Holly seems to have a fixation with small white animals.  We have been walking her on the lead (with a halter - will get basket type muzzle) and we have noticed she whines and tugs when she sees small white animals (whether they be dogs, cats, rabbits).  There is no aggression toward people - just small white furry things ...    
We've been exercising in the backyard under constant supervision.  Neither of the dogs are allowed out without supervision.  Thanks for suggesting this because it just reinforced my own decision on it.     
We will try all your suggestions to see what we can do and get on with the professional training.  If the worst comes to the worst and it has to be a management option, then management it is.   
BTW:  We have a cat and the dogs and her get on extremely well.  I think the trigger is small, furry and white.   
BTW 2:  I think the wine is a great idea!

otherwise check out the 'fohlenschauen' that are currently held, next Monday there is one in Berne (also has some older 'foals' 3yrs etc)    this site sells horses that otherwise would get slaughtered 
there are many smaller 'gestÃ¼te' specialized in different breeds, so it really depends what you are looking for   
Not to sound intrusive, but have you really thought about what it takes to have an own horse? Not just financially, although this is a big part, but also timewise. I am talking out of experience; I ve had my horse for a year now exactly, wouldnt miss her for anything, but it takes a lot of organizing/worrying/time etc etc

			I don't know if this is the right place to post this but Ikea will no longer be carrying items for dogs and cats. I don't know why but everything in stock is drastically reduced. I was at Spreitenbach tonight, it was open until 10 for the midsummer sale. They were some fantastic bargains ( I bought dog beds for 9.95, regular price is 29.95). There was also an additional reduction of 10% for family card members.

			We moved here at the end of april, with rex, owever all our relocation costs were covered by my husbands company. On my own back i dont know if i would ever use rex again, they were disorganised and quite rude as he was supposed to come on the thursday, we were leaving on the sunday. Something happened and we got told oops he cant go on thursday( they new from the start we were leaving a few days after him) he will have to go on the monday. We then had to put him into kennels from the thursday to the saturday at our own expence as we had given our house up on the thursday(all our furniture was being moved out to be shipped here) and staying at mum mums however she doesnt like dogs. But anyway back on subject then we got told on the thursday oops you will have to take him back to the vet again for his pre flight check as the one he has expires on the monday. Then we had to take him to dunfermline to the shippers vets for boarding till the monday which is an hour and a half each way. After all that only got a ""sorry"" talk about proffesionalism i think not. even tho the company were paying the relocation costs because of rex we still had to fork over 200 between kennels,vets and petrol all because the screwed up.

I've been putting his suncream on every day, and even though he seems to have a taken a liking to the taste of the stuff and keeps rubbing it off with his paws and licking it, some of it must be staying on because so far there's been no problem.   
Here's hoping we can get through THIS year without a repeat of last year's catastrophe

Our old giant schnauzer had a terribly painful time while teething, at one point he had 8 canine teeth, so we put some water in a freezer bag and froze it, then soaked it in brandy.

You mind your own business, think you are doing the right thing and then  , the owner or landlord abruptly sends you warning letters. Luckily, it hasn't happened to me yet, but many a friend (and foe) have had these kind of issues.   
Hopefully, instead of indirectly sending me a message of being unhappy about my cat, they will come by and knock on the door. I'd rather not get the ol ""Excuse me, may I have a cup of sugar? And oh by the way, I poisoned your cat this morning.""   Talk about trying to avoid confrontation and communication.

			I attended my first theoric lesson yesterday evening with two work colleagues. It was long, almost 4    hours but i didnt notice the time pass by.    
We were surrounded by dogs that were staying at the dog hotel. All dogs were sleeping quietly through the class. No conflicts whatsoever. That alone, made me pay more attention to what she had to say.   
The Natural Dogmanship method is brill. It all makes sense. But i have to carry on many adjustments to our daily life with our dog, which is good as long as it makes her feel safer and stable.    
Attending to these lessons with an open mind really gives you knowledge about your dog and your dog's needs from a completely different perspective.  I am very pleased so far.    
We have the first practical lesson next monday but i have tried some of the stuff she told us and the result is quite amazing!    
Sadly, the books and information about this method is nowhere to be found in english but if someone is interested in reading a bit more, and are still looking for a trainer, do read and i can give you the contact info of this place.

			Hi, I hope someone here can help, our 2 female rats really need a holiday home for a month while we are away, July 3rd to Aug 3rd. They are fully self contained in their largish cage and are not a lot of work, just need to be kept topped up with food and water, their home given a wipe around every couple of days and a proper clean out every week or two depending on state. They are both pretty friendly and like to play however Twinkle can bite if she feels threatened.   
We will obviously deliver and pick up with all necessary equipment, food, etc anywhere around the BS, BL or SO area, please post any questions here or by PM.   
We would be happy to reciprocate and look after similar pets or a dog assuming they get on with our Old English Sheepdog, Boris.   
Many thanks

			As you are in ZÃ¼rich, here is a list of Tierheime in the canton:       
Tierheim PfÃ¶tli has a good reputation.   
A list of Tierheime in other cantons can also be found on the Tierschutz site. Don't let geography be a deciding factor; Switzerland is a small place, and traveling the length and breadth of the country to adopt a dog who tugs at one's heartstrings is frequently done.     
Be aware that some shelters require a handover fee, to aid in the (sometimes significant) costs the rescue incurs in taking care of your pet.   
----   
(Volunteer hat on...)   
Is there really no way that you can keep your dog?    
(You don't need to answer that here -  but I hope that you have looked into all possibilities to try to keep him. After all, when we take on a pet it is with the understanding that we have made a life-long commitment.)   
---   
If you   give up your pet, please do all that you can to help him find a good forever home. It will take work on your part to find a good Tierheim, and there is a chance that it may take time before a rescue place is available. .    
Giving the rescue as much information as possible about your dog's good -  and perhaps difficult - points is important. Absolute honesty will help your dog find the right people this time around.    
And please if you are giving the dog up through no fault of his own, make that very clear to the rescue. Again, this will help considerably to finding him a new home.    
Give the rescue as much information as possible about his health, give them copies of his vaccination records, a summary of the training he has had to date - as well as the training that is missing. Can he live with children, and if so, what ages? Can he live with other dogs? If so, are there any concerns over living with a dog of the same sex? Can he live with cats? Can he live with small furries? Can he live with livestock?    
If he/she is not yet spayed/neutered please have that done before you give your dog up - it will save the rescue much needed funds, and is the right thing to do.   
Wishing your dog all the best - may he soon find a family who will truly commit to giving him the forever home he deserves.

I think some of ya'll missed my point and missed the point of the article.   
It isn't about being ""fit"" as much as being healthier in general. Having someone there to help motivate you and give you encouragement without the judgment entailed in human friendships can go a long way to helping someone overcome issues they may be having.   
Your dog isn't going to wonder why you're walking woozy if you're dizzy, they're not going to wonder about your limp or even if you felt like going out without a shower (depressed, hungover or even simply lazy)... they just want to go out and enjoy the walk.

			Alternatively, if you don't have that document handy, just bring an unmuzzled pair of cane corso, make sure they are foaming at the mouth too. This may shorten the interview to a considerable extent.[IMG]file:///C:/Users/PAB/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.png[/IMG]

			Hi! Ours are two female chihuahuas. One is over a year old and is called Kara. She is very delicate(1.8kg) and timid(afraid of dogs) and loves cuddles and to be in your lap.I used to leave her with a friend of ours who lives in a very quiet flat.On the contrary, our 5 month old girl puppy Iska is boisterous, loves dogs and people. She is a very strong and cheeky puppy. She is equally happy in a busy environment as well as somewhere quiet.When we walk they usually get a lot of attention because of their size.  
You can see pics of the puppies here  
If it looks interesting to you, please pm me with some info about you! 
Best

Whatever one thinks of the new law... at least they are making the new rules clear(ish) to dog owners.

			Anybody interested in house/pet sitting for 6 weeks from late June to early August in Engelberg? We have two friendly Australian Shepherds (age 11 and 15). The younger one likes to go on hikes but the older one can only handle short, level walks. The house has a small lawn that needs to be mowed once every couple of weeks (20 minutes max).   
The house is located on the edge of the main town (5 minute walk to the Dorfstrasse). Engelberg is very nice in the summer with endless hiking possibilities, decent mountain biking, tennis, golf, swimming, ice rink, etc.,...   
Ideally this would be for a retired/unemployed individual/couple who would be around town most of the time and not leaving the dogs unattended for hours on end. Daytrips are not an issue as there is a fenced in yard but we would prefer that they not be left alone on a daily basis. It would also be good for a family with some young kids who want to enjoy the mountains for a few weeks (we have 3 young kids (2, 4 and 6) and the dogs are great with them).    
We would be willing to pay a nominal fee for this service but we don't want somebody who is just looking for a job. We want someone that likes dogs and likes to be in the mountains primarily and has some spare time to enjoy them.   
Send me a pm if you are interested or want some more details. Thanks.

			Hi Laurie,    
I attended this dog school with my dog as part of the BVET requirements here when he was much younger:       
The school is based in Albisgutli compared to others which are quite far out.    
The trainers there are also available for individual training. I rate Carolina Jaroch really highly. I didnt have one on one sessions with her but from what I have experienced and observed, her methods are all positive reinforcement based and she is also big on clicker training. I am sure she does private lessons if the timing is right, but she can be quite hard to reach on the phone. She speaks decent English if needed.    
Good luck and tell her that Oskar's mum sent you   "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 76 Times in 30 Posts	Recommendation for dog obedience classes needed	Laurie	Posts: 188

Her name is Alexandra from 'Le Paradis Des Animaux"". She was fantastic! She came and fed Ashka daily, collected our mail, watered our plants etc.    
She can be contacted via email -  
She only speaks French, but was accomodating to us, and was happy to corrospond via email so we translate.   
We highly reccommend her!

			I can recommend Editrust for dog food, I order from them all of the time. I used to import from Germany but it was kept at the border a bunch of times so I gave up. I used to order the Solid Gold (from the same site above) but the owner stopped getting it for awhile so we switched.   
If you really believe that Purina is a high quality dog food, please do some more research by visiting www.dogfoodanalysis.com, you might change your mind.

			Great option. Definitely worth looking into.   Anyway, you better check with your local community rules or your rental contract (if you are renting) for any paragraph prohibiting ""anything, living or dead, to have any impact on anything on Sundays or public holidays"". (I'm sure it's in there ) Otherwise you will just have to get a 24 hour tranquilizer gun option included at the pet store.

			Hello    
Thanks for your post. I am still interested cos although a girl is coming to walk him twice a week, it is temporary.   
Congo is energetic but adorable and funny. He is sure to return all the care you give him with love and happiness every time he sees you    
How much would you charge me for an hour?  
Would you be available to come in the afternoon? Maybe at 1 or so? (Are there any days when you definitely cant make it?)   
Congo pulls a bit on the chain but he is well behaved with a firm hand and gets along well with all dogs.    
Hope to hear from you soon, 
Sarah    
(Oh by the way, do you also have the possibility of dog sitting at your house when I am abroad?)

			I have recently got a cat who was used to stay mainly outside, but she adapted very well to the indoors life. She is a burmese,which is a very active breed and she is now just over an year old. Spending time with her,playing,giving her attention, buying her new toys,etc...would make your cat happy inside too. What is important is to keep her"" busy"". 
Mine started to enjoy watching cartoons on TV. I hope she won't damage her eyes...coz she stays to close to the screen.

No need for application, just put the collar on the little fella and wait for a week before coming into effect and voila. Had zero problem with ticks or fleas last year despite my dog's obsession with long grass. *touch wood*

There was nothing on the course which was new for me, other than information about the Swiss regulations. I'll be doing the 'praxis' course soon. The course trainer knew I knew this too, but we went through the motions.   
Neither of these courses come cheap, but I think these price and time barriers are intended to put off anyone who is only casually interested in looking after a dog, which is a good idea in my mind, since owning a dog is time-intensive and costly. If it reduces the number of abandoned dogs, then I'm all for it.   
Other countries (notably the UK) are bringing in identical rules.

			Tanks for the messages.   
I went to fetch her at the vet yesterday, and she is doing ok. They sent her tumor to be analysed, and we'll know on Friday if it was malignous or not.   
My son was quite shocked to see her, because they had to shave part of her back. Moreover her skin is orange because of the disinfectant, and she has four stitches. We sat all together on the sofa and I let him touch the very smooth skin around the scar. But still, all this is quite worrying for a toddler.

			I live in one of the  small towns just south of Bern. We registered our dog within 10 days at the gemeinde, and then visited the vet afterward. We didn't need to show insurance or registration in ANIS to register and pay tax (my tax is CHF80 per year), but we did all of this  in August 2007, and things may have changed with the Federal Dog Control stuff.    
It depends on where you live, of course, but our gemeinde is just one building, so we did one thing on one floor and went upstairs for the animal stuff. If you live in Bern itself, it might be a bit more complicated.

Yes, my Bonny is pretty much like Simon's Cat... if she can tell I'm waking up, she'll start attacking my feet, especially if they're out of the covers.    
Also, she brings her toys to our bed as if we'll play with her or maybe to show them off as if she's killed them... we wake up with all sorts of cat toys at the foot of the bed (   ), including her newest favorite - q-tips (aka cotton swabs) - some of which she fished out of the bathroom trash.     (I've taken now to giving her fresh ones from the cabinet to keep her from dragging used ones around the house - and into my bed.)

			For other food options, these threads might be of help - reviews of a variety of foods available here:           
And yes, a juvenile will eat more at this stage - you may find that he starts needing less as his metabolism changes - which often happens around 12-18 months. My 4 year old Hooligan now gets about 1/3 of the food she got as a teenager. She's still a whirlwind energy bundle, but she simply does not need as many calories anymore.

			Update!!!   
Hi all   
I just wanted to update you on the sneezing dogs ;-)   
The sneezing continued through the weekend and by Sunday our other dog was also sneezing.  8am Monday morning I called the vet for an appointment but they recommended a Homeopathic OTC cold remedy to give them every 2 hours.  By Tuesday morning the little one was much better and by Wednesday so was her brother.   
Thanks again for the advise.   
Have a great day all!

			I was told by a employee working in a shampoo production, the shampoo for dogs is basicly the same and does not differ from those for humans. It is probably only bad if you use a strong parfumed shampoo on dogs because of their sensible nose. 
You can`t go wrong with baby shampoo.   
But I would be carful washing the dog because of dandruf, it could be you make it worse because of degreasing the oily skin or even the washings did cause that. 
As long he did not play in mud I would just brush the dog .

			Changing pads are waterproof, and when I say 'water'... Basically, you just have to roll them and throw them away, no need to mop the floor.    
The problem with newspapers is also that on linoleum the wet ink tend to 'print' the lino, and it's very difficult to get rid of it.   
The babies' pads cost 10.-/10, so the Casino brand is cheaper. But they are all much cheaper than the 'doggie kind' anyway.   
Casino is a French brand of supermarkets, but we have one in the centre of Lausanne. No idea about Zurich though. Perhaps they have that kind of items in Lidl? Anyway, it would be cheaper than a pharmacy.

			Metacalm is an excellent anti-inflamatory medication.  My vet prescribed this for Susie for her arthritis - it was extremely effective - and has less side-effects than Rimadyl.  When Susie had a real crisis, the vet would give her an anti-inflamatory injection which worked wonders.  Perhaps a consultation with your vet would be beneficial for your old pal.

			LOL.... mopp been there. MG had all three dogs for a walk in France last summer, as she approached a garden at the end of the chemin, the dog who sometimes walked wth us appeared.

			I left my cat behind as I now live in a second floor apartment. He loved to be out roaming  and I knew I just couldn't lock him in going from a free spirit to an indoor cat at 12 years old.    
I still have the guilts but I get updates on his new family, he is loved and has settled very well, still with a nice catflap into a very large garden. So this helps me to deal with the emotions!   
I would say leave him where he is, the slight change will suit him far better.    
Good luck making your decision, I know how hard it is.

			And, if you wish to look further afield, here is the Tierschutz Switzerland-wide database of homeless animals:       
I will always advise those looking for a canine companion to consider rescue first - so many wonderful dogs looking for homes, the need is so great. Most dogs end up in rescue through no fault of their own. You will find all manner of dogs in rescue, from puppies to (already trained   ) adults to seniors - from pure breeds to delightful one of a kind mixes. All my guys are rescues - and I thank doG every day that I have been given the privilege of sharing my life with them.     
However, if you feel that rescue is not the route for you, then please only go to a reputable breeder. NEVER buy a dog from a pet shop - chances are those poor puppies on display in a shop window, - deprived of the opportunities for socialization and learning so critical at that age - came from a puppy mill (or the more accurate, less fluffeh term: battery farmed dogs   ). No breeder of any worth or ethics would ever consider allowing a puppy to be sold via a pet store.    
(In fact I don't think it's even legal to sell puppies in pet stores in Switzerland... someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)   
A good breeder will not sell you a puppy via the internet shipped to your door, nor will a good breeder meet you at some highway rest stop to dump off a puppy. Again, these are all signs of dodgy battery farmers.   
Dodgy breeders - whether battery farmers or clueless BYBs - don't do health or temperament checks of the parents, such folk care little for the genetic health of the line - meaning the cute puppy you buy may be seriously ill. Battery farmers often breed in appallingly cruel conditions - the dogs are treated as little more than machines, and dumped or killed once no longer profitable.  It is filthy, vile trade - please do not support it.   
A good breeder will require you to meet him far in advance of bringing a pup home - many even have waiting lists well in advance of conception. A good breeder will grill you carefully to determine if you can indeed provide a good home for one of his dogs. (A good rescue will make you jump through the same hoops.) A good breeder only breeds dogs who are genetically and temperamentally healthy, socializes the pups in a nurturing environment - giving your puppy the best start in life.   
The BVet has a good brochure on the subject: ""Augen Auf beim Hundekauf"".       
To find a reputable breeder, see the SKG (the Swiss Kennel Club) website, under ZÃ¼chtertafel:       
But even before you take that step, please research the different dog breeds. Think about breed characteristics, and think hard about your lifestyle and what you can offer the dog. Look for a breed whose needs match your lifestyle.   
And then - under the new Animal Welfare Law, if you are a first time owner you will need to take the theory class of the Sachkundenachweis   you purchase your pup.   
And, again by law, within the first 12 months of ownership, you and your dog will need to complete the practical course.   
See:       
OK - hopping off my soap box now.    
Wishing you and your future four-legged friend all the very best.     
ETA - Prices:   
Rescues ask for an adoption fee; this varies. My guys' adoption fees ranged from CHF 400 to â¬800.   
A puppy from a good breeder will be expensive - think thousands.     
ETA II:   
Fahad, forgive me for jumping back on my soapbox, but in your other post you mention that you are here on a gap year, afterwards you will be moving on to complete your studies. Will you be able to bring your dog with you when you move? Bear in mind that when you take on a dog you make a commitment for the  next 10-15 years. OK - lecture over.

			Thanks for the reply.  We bought a scalibor collar yesterday and put it on her so that she's protected for when we go away (we have to take it off if she goes swimming), and the nurse gave us milbemax wormer saying that it also covered heart worms, so hopefully she'll be ok.  They said to give her a tablet before we go away and another 2 weeks after we get back.  They didn't mention a blood test or any other medication for heart worms though.     
She's a german shepherd and I read somewhere that she has a higher chance of getting one of the diseases than other breeds of dogs, but hopefully she'll be covered.   
She has the pet passport, is chipped and is vaccinated against rabies, so hopefully this will be enough.

Firm fixed price, everything included. Went with the second guy, he came on a Friday, measured the door, gave us a quote and installed the new double glass panel with the cat flap next Wednesday - took him half an hour. Of course we kept the old one so in case of moving, can reinstal the original one.   
 The company is Daniel Maeder's Glas-Reparatur Service, Steimertenmatteweg 17a Lupsingen. Tel 061 791 1966 
He said he is specialized in installing cat flaps and does about 80 per month.    
Our cats are absolutely loving it and have been in and out about 5 times while I was writing this comment here.

And even if you find a public pond with goldfish in it already (in a park for example) it is a bad idea to drop yours in it, because yours may be carrying infectious diseases (ichtio is fairly common in aquarium fish, and often is latent) that would spread and eventually kill all the other goldies (and other fish) in the pond.   
Besides I think in Switzerland you can be fined if you're caught releasing your goldfish in a pond. They have introduced some new strict rules about pets a few months ago, some of which specific for goldies (even dropping a ""dead"" goldie in the toilet is now forbidden).

It may seem like a weird suggestion, but the only thing I can think of to do would be hassle somebody who is already a horse owner and see if they can help you.. 
On this website   you can see the horses section (Pferde & Ponys) on the left.. maybe you can find horses for sale or looking for a ""Reitbeteiligungen"" in or near BL and ask their owners for advice? 
I've emailed a few people from this site, not always enquiring about what their ad is about (a couple of times I would be asking if they had any work at their place etc) and they could usually speak English and would usually send friendly replies..   
Thats the only thing I can suggest unless somebody here can help you

			We have a 6 yr old Labrador and she does not seem to bark much when we are away...on the contrary, she goes to her bed and sleeps. We live in an apartment with neighbors on two sides, and they have never complained (well insulated!).    
But when we are home, our dog barks a lot! At the other dogs walking outside 6 floors down and far away...and seemingly at ghosts that inhabit our flat! Hard to keep her quiet when we are around.   
We had a Husky some years ago and he NEVER barked. We thought he was part Dingo until he treed a raccoon! So I guess my point is, it is hard to tell what he/she will do.   
I wish you well and hope you can provide a 'forever home.'

			In danger of repeating myself, I think you should give this forum a try:   even though it's in German. There are just so many good offers both from prof. sellers and private people who really know their stuff, quality is mostly better than from stores like Qualipet as these fishes didn't have to endure long transporation and mass breeding.

			Hi there,   
I haven't read all the answers you got, but it seems as if your dog has never actually been told in his own language what he is expected to do and what not. 
I live in Basel and train dog owners myself. If you like we could go for a walk some time and have a look at your dog - as friends though, not as trainer and learner - unless you really want that. I'd be happy to help you with your dog, practise my English and have a nice walk. I am convinced he would love to please you, if only we show him what we'd like him to do. What do you think?

			I have plenty of experience with this situation, as all my life we have added kittens to my home. And you are right, your cat is probably very lonely being alone during the day, and I did the same thing for my cat about two years ago. I didn't necessarily want another cat but knew it was better for my love (who was definitely lonely).    
A few simple guidelines, and there should be no problem with the integration. 
1. It doesn't matter the sex of the first cat or the second for that matter. I prefer males, so I never get a female (and have never had a problem). What matters is the AGE of the cat. If you want things to really go off without a hitch, you have to get a kitten and preferably a young one at that (no older than 12 weeks in my opinion). There is a dominance issue that has to be worked out naturally; so for your cat, he considers your house to be his territory and he thus has to feel like he is in control of the situation (even though he really isn't) when a stranger (ie-the kitten) arrives. So make sure to let this play out. There will be hissing and growling, but it will work itself out for sure.   
2. If/when you get the kitten, make sure to keep them separated from each other for at least a week. Normally, I acclimate the kitten in the bathroom b/c it is the perfect location for controlling messes while litter training as well. You can do occasional 'supervised' visits where you introduce them to each other with you around, and as time goes by (and dependent on your cat's reaction), you can make these more frequent until separation is no longer necessary.    
The only other thing I can say is to make sure that the new kitten has a clean bill of heath from the vet just so that no diseases are spread. This can be a problem.   
Otherwise, I hope you enjoy your new kitten (and your cat does too)!

It's an organisation who arrange for retired couples to house/pet-sit.  Not only do your animals get to stay at home, it's way cheaper then kennels

And meloncollie is right.. you never know what kind of breeders you are buying off, anyone can make it sound like they know what they are talking about and have taken all these precautions.. but be careful trusting them!

Hope your doglet is feeling a bit better today.   
Not knowing all the relevant details I'm hesitant to second-guess your vet... But as a general rule:   
If you are uneasy with the approach your vet has taken, speak to her - ask her why A and not B. She should have given you a full explanation and discussed the whys and wherefores of her treatment plan with you before proceeding.   
There can be many ways to treat a given condition - one is not necessarily right and the other wrong - rather, the question is often what is most appropriate for an individual in a given situation. I expect my vet to discuss available options and outcomes, and together we decide which approach is best for my mutt.    
I firmly believe that an owner has to be respected as an equal partner in all decisions concerning the treatment of our animals. (It took me a couple of tries before finding a vet whose ideas meshed with my own.   )   
I've run into a few vets (and doctors   ) who've shown a somewhat patronizing attitude towards owners/patients - who perhaps don't give the layman credit for the general knowledge that comes with being an experienced owner. Or perhaps some owners in your vet's practice may not feel comfortable doing their own first aid or after care, hence the request to have you bring your dog in so often?  But - again bearing in mind that I don't know the details of your dog's condition and so can only speak in generalities -  I'd ask point-blank why the vet feels the need for follow up visits so often.  If an owner feels competent to do the after care, my vet often prefers him or her to do so, as the animal is far less stressed at home. And keeping the stress levels down aids recovery.   
Hopefully your vet will address your concerns to your satisfaction.   
Oldhand has hit the nail on the head - listen to your gut instinct. Both in treating your dog now, and in assessing any owner/vet relationship.     
Hope your guy's toe heals quickly, and that the recovery period isn't too boring for him   - or stressful for you.

			My best man's, well he wasn't that good otherwise he would have stopped me, mother used to feed the 30 or so stray cats hanging around the back door, finest steak fresh from the butchers.   
He came home from coll one weekend to find the back wall splattered in blood - what happened? he delicately enquired - well there were too many  cats so I got a man in with a shotgun ....    
didn't stop her feeding what was left with .... finest steak fresh from the butcher.   
She was from Glasgow - maybe that explains it.     
To counteract that rather unsettling tale:   
We started off with the cheap stuff from coop and under pressure from moral blackmail from my daughters our beast graduated to the most expensive stuff (Whiskas ?). If I can I buy the stuff in Germany as it is cheaper by far.

			From my experience in the pet industry Demodex can be quite common in juvenile dogs and especially those prone to skin problems (i.e. staffies, weimaraners, shar peis, etc) and the vet we were working with used an Ivermectin shot that generally got them through it quite quickly. 
Ivermectin is also used by the guinea pig association of WA and the rabbit society to get rid of mites quickly (in the part of Oz I come from mites are a big problem). 
Perhaps discuss this option with your vet? Good luck!   "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Dec 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Dog with demodex	moonlight09	Posts: 23

			We went through something similar several years back, my sympathies to you for being put in this position.    
I think it was said best above - you'll know when it is time. We adopted two kittens who had been quite sick and recovered - but one hadn't really (the original disease mutated) and a couple of days after we brought them home he began to quickly decline. It turned out he had the wet version of  , which is a swift killer. His sister that we adopted was fine, as was their sister we'd left at the shelter (or so we thought). A week or so after our boy had to be put down, we brought home his sister. A month or so later, she ended up with the dry version of that horrible disease, she was constantly low-grade ill, sometimes quite ill. We knew when it was time for her, she told us, and we put her down on Christmas day 2003.    
Your other kitty will also suffer from the loss of your kitten, so don't forget extra love, treats and other special things for it. Our remaining one went into a deep kitty depression for a couple of months, constantly looking for her sister and moping.    
Your little boy seems to have a great handle on this. I hope all can go as smoothly as possible for you.

			Thank you very much everyone,   
I went to the vet this morning after writing in the EF. They have given me a tablet for her to eat. The flea should start dying in 8 hours. I have to repeat the dose after that. They have asked me not to wash her which is usual practice after Frontline. I will definately take the idea of combing her with a tick comb and hot water.    
For the house:   
I got a special spray from them to disinfect everything after I'v vacumed and mopped etc. Washing the laundry with hotwater is def going to be a good idea.    
I feel so sorry for her. She's been a city dog all her life and now she has fleas from the barn in our farmhouse. Haha! Still, she prefers the barn life than a small flat life.    
I'l go and start brushing her now. Thank you for all your help.    
Cheers!

			Hello,    
My husband and I have just recently moved to Zurich with our standard poodle from Colorado.  He misses his canine friends back home and we are hoping to find a friend or two for him here.  I am not currently employed and have time to meet for walks or hikes, or possibly take your dog out for you.     
Also as an alternative to boarding, I would also like to find someone who is willing to dog-sit trade.  We keep your dog while you are away on holiday or on a work trip and you do the same for us when we are away, assuming our dogs get along.  We will not be traveling too much without him, but I would like to establish a situation where we don't worry about leaving him in a kennel or other type of boarding scenario.     
Our dog is neutered, very friendly, not at all aggressive, and playful.  He is about 45 lbs. or 20 kgs. and makes a great playmate for small and large dogs alike.  He also gets along well with children and other animals.     
Also, we live in the north-east corner of zone 10.     
If you are interested in meeting up and seeing if our dogs get along, please PM me.

He is not really a barker but randomly he might bark (ie to another male dog on the street or if someone makes him feel insecure by coming very aggressively towards him in a limited space (I would as well feel insecure in such occasion, come on...) But for sure, you wouldn't even think of calling him aggressive nor has ever caused any harm to an animal or human being...imagine that at the age of 3 my dog has accepted living and sharing everybody's love with a kitten... he actually raised it and even shared his food...

			Hello,   
I am a student studying at EPFL, and I plan to stay in lausanne throughout this christmas holiday to prepare for the exams afterwards.   
I would like to have a little friend around during this period when I have to stay the whole day at home for studying.   
Since many families are leaving for holidays this time of the year, if any of them needs a carer to take care of their pet while they are away, I will be available from 19th December 2009 to 10th January 2010.   
If you are interested, please contact me!

Sometimes circumstances leave an owner with no choice but to give up their pet. The owner of our eldest Basset had cancer and that was the reason they had to find her a new home. It's easy to be too quick to judge the owners. It was not easy adopting a dog who was almost 4 years old but I know we did the right thing. She just turned 9.

			Although I probably should have put this under the Family Matters section, I'm posting here because this applies specifically to pet owners.   
We are a year away from being eligible to apply for Swiss citizenship, but among the things stopping me: I am concerned that I might not be able to ensure that my dogs are adequately cared for after my death if my will had to follow Swiss inheritance law.    
As an Auslander, I've claimed Heimatrecht and set up a trust in my will that ensures my dogs are provided for financially for the rest of their lives - the balance then goes to the rescue group who will care for them. But if I understand it correctly, if I were a Swiss citizen setting up such a trust  (which means the bulk of the estate goes outside the family, and some of the folks who would be obligatory heirs get zip) is not allowed.   
The family members who would be obligatory heirs under Swiss law are not really animal lovers; it worries me greatly that my taking Swiss citizenship could mean that the mutts would essentially be left to their goodwill. Volunteering with a rescue, I've seen it all too often: The family promise Mum that they will look after her beloved four footed friend - but before Mum is even in the ground poor Fido is abandoned without so much as a backward glance.   
So a question for pet-owning Swiss citizens: How do you ensure your animals are provided for after your death, given the restrictions of Swiss inheritance law?    
All info and advice is much appreciated.   
(I know that there are threads about wills as Auslanders, but this is applies specifically to writing a will as a pet owning Swiss citizen, which I don't think has been covered - please forgive me if I've missed something discussing this aspect.)

I go on holidays from Dec. 30 - Jan.13, and my usual ferret-sitter just cancelled...   
Would anybody be available to babysit my two monsters? It should be someone with a little experience with ferrets, since they can be tricky if you don't know that kind of animal... That is, they are perfectly nice and litter-trained, but your house needs to be ferret-proofed for their safety and yours!

2288	null	null	null	null	"    Look everybody! Here is your big chance to own a dog of this truly rare color.       
I believe she is still available for adoption at the Geneva SPA. I have met this dog and she was very sweet, loving, and well behaved. She is an older dog at 6 years of age, but I have owned Amstaffs before and they are an exceptionally healthy breed that can live very long. She is a truly beautiful dog.   
Unfortunately, It would be difficult to adopt her if you live in the canton of Geneva, as the ban has been in place here for over a year now. I was amazed at all of the really interesting breeds available for adoption at the SGPA. If you don't have the space or time to keep a dog, but would like to spend some time with one, you can always stop by the SGPA from 14h to 17h on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays to take a nice doggy out for a walk. Very therapeutic for you as well as the dog.

Thanks for this advice. We are moving over from the Uk with Nestle and St Legier is one of the places we are looking at. You say it's difficult to find places to let the dog off the lead - where do you go near there then. Also, you don't happen to be able to comment about the state schools around there do you - (two?). Good one/bad one - things to watch out for?

			Drive to Montreal and take a Swiss flight. Swiss is the only airline that we fly our dog with, the rest have a weight limit and as she is 40 kilos it can cost over $2000 one way from Canada to Zurich.   
Honestly, Air Canada is crap. I would never ever fly my dog on AC even if they didn't have a weight limit. Swiss has a heated cargo space specifically for animals. It's $350 each way. We haven't had any problems and they took great care of our dog. Travel with your dog, it will be much easier in the end, they won't have to see a vet upon arriving, no added paperwork, etc.

I should mention that if he does need to be re-homed in the UK  then he has a lovely home to go to with another staffie that is his best friend, so it may be more traumatic for the owners than for the dog... it is just such a shame that because of irresponsible idiots these dogs have such a bad press...I know several Staffies and all are sweet gentle animals with lovely personalities...

			Hiya,    
We were having a similar problem looking for cat care for the Christmas holidays.    
This company was available and charge reasonable fees. We didn't go for them simply because we found a university student who was willing to look after our cats (and i would prefer her to have the money). If we hadn't found her, I would have gone with this company as they spoke fantastic English and seemed really nice.    
Good luck!

			Seems to me that your little mischief might be attention seeking. She wants to stay with you or inside all the time and there could be more than on reason to this:   
1. Since you might have moved recently, she might still be insecure at the new place 
2. she feels scared or cold outside at night ... I would too  
3. she needs company... get her a friend so they can play together and cuddle up together.   
Why do you want her to sleep outside all night if during the day she is allowed in al the time? I think she is confused and feels its a punishment that you put her out   "	null	null	null	Nocturnal cat drivez hoomins crazies	guest	null

But I guess they might just control the pet passport with rabies vaccination and microchip ID, which are the only requirements (no other vaccinations, not worming or fleas treatment, only rabies and microchip) 
In fact, I know that you don't need to register a cat by authorities, but you can register him by the ANIS (Animal identity number) with his microchip number just for your peace of mind in the case he/she might get lost.

2308	03.06.2007, 16:47	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Zurich	"    Are you asking me?  
My dog traveled in the cabin with me. She traveled under the seat in front of me. Well, except on the way back where she actually stayed under the seat of the three year old behind me as his feet didn't touch the ground!    
I made the reservation at the time of booking the flight as there are only 2 dogs allowed per flight. So I had to check that the flight I wanted to take had room for the dog. She was considered excess baggage & I paid per kilo. I can't remember how much I paid, though. It's on the Swiss website.  I only every fly Swiss. I should have mentioned that so I don't know about other airlines & she only ever flies in the cabin with me. I never put her in the hold. You must check the regulations per airline as they vary. They also vary per destination (i.e. No dogs in the cabin to UK and no dogs at all on EasyJet).   
She slept the whole way and didn't make a sound. She seemed quite Ok and was bright & happy when she arrived. Much happier & brighter than I was! The flight was 8 hours to & 7 hr back.    
Yes, dog are generally banned from restaurants except outside cafe's usually allow them.  Since she stays in her bag, I did bring her to a couple of restaurants and just didn't mention it... No one ever notices her. (Yes, I know I shouldn't do this.... ) When they did notice her they all wanted to see her out of the bag. After all these regs are not made by the restaurant, but by the law.   
Recommendations: the travel case can not exceed a certain size (this will be given by the airline). The problem with this is that they don't tell you which direction measurements must be. Thus the bag I took was under the size limit, but didn't fit under certain seats & I had to change seats to have a seat without legs or other metal peices in the way.  You can't really avoid this as they don't know which seats have legs or whatever under them... Also, your dog should be used to staying in the case/bag. My dog is quite used to this so she doesn't get upset when she's closed in the bag. They do not let you take the dog out of the bag & it really isn't safe for the dog to be out anyway.    
If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask.

			Our children really want to bring over our guinea pig from the USA.   
The US Vet thought guinea pigs needed certificates of health ($150) for travel to CH, but the Swiss FVO site states:   
""No animal health permits or health certificates are required for animals deemed ""pets"" according to the definition - except for dogs, cats, ferrets (see boxes). They may be imported from all countries.""   
Does anyone have an experience with this??  I don't think the airlines will allow them in carryon cases and they are very fragile animals.

2319	null	null	null	null	"    Yep, me too! I am not usually some self righteous busybody but this is an accident waiting to happen and someone has to speak up for the dog.           This was actually why I asked the question as when my son was telling me the tale, I wondered if there is such a law as many dogs are allowed to walk free. I had a border collie and we took training with the RAF twice a week for fun but the upturn of that was I knew he was bombproof off a leash, and totally tuned in to my commands, nevertheless, I would have never dreamed of walking him on a busy highway without his lead, just because I wanted him to always be safe. It only takes 1 spook and he was lost... He was way to precious to take that risk.    
I think Kevlegs hit the nail on the head regarding Jack Russell terriers, they are so wick that they would be under a car in the blink of an eye, before any one had registered they had run into the road.    
I am a firm believer that education in such cases are the best, and all this lady requires are a few facts regarding training and leash use and both me and her dog will be much happier!   
Thanks for the considered reply.

Besides, what I can't figure out is where to put the scooper when I am walking the dogs . It is not as though it is self-cleaning. I carry wet towels for my hands....just in case one of the poopie bags has a hole in it.   I am just grateful there are lots of robidogs all around.

They arrived here perfectly fine. It is better for the pets that the hold is dark as the pets sleep. They don't hear humans talking, smell food being served, etc.   
I don't know what ""horror stories"" you are referring to. I have worked with many pet shippers over the years and not once has this been my experience.   
Many animals travel better in the cargo hold than in the cabin as they don't have nervous owner fussing over them, plus in the cargo hold they can have a larger, sturdier and roomier kennel fitted with a water bottle, which is essential for a long flight to avoid dehydration. How does one affix a water bottle to a carry bag? The extra space in first class doesn't change anything from my perspective.   
I once sat next to a passenger with a dog that whined most of the flight. It was awful.   In first class, if your dog does anything but sleep, you are going to annoy others who opted to be in first class for a reason.    
If you are travelling with your dog, you don't need to use the services of a pet shipper. My pet shipper always recommends pets travel with the owner (though not necessarily in the cabin). This keeps the costs down.

Well, I know my cats slurp happily away at water now and then, and I only feed them dry food. Their fur is a lot nicer to the touch than that of other cats I've felt (that do not eat the same food). hmm...

			hahaa, cheeky little bugger.    
If you've been extremely consistent about not letting the dog on to the sofa whilst you are at home, chances are, he is doing that because that spot on the sofa is the most comfortable - even more so than his blanket / bed.    
The crate is a fantastic idea, as long as its not for too long periods. And its never too late to crate train the dog.    
However, another possible solution is to purchase large plastic sheets that the painters used for protecting furniture / floors during a job, and put it over your sofa when you are out. Unsightly at first but its not comfortable for dogs (feel and sound wise). He will in time, find no more joy in jumping on the sofa for a snooze.

			I think the moral of the story is:   
Check out the service provider thoroughly; test safety measures in place, quality of care, attention to individual needs, ability (and willingness) to follow owner's instructions, understand the provider's view on animal care, visit unannounced wherever possible, check references carefully, etc. Discuss the 'what ifs'.    
And be aware that not everyone offering pet care services is qualified to do so, or takes the responsibility seriously - or is even a pet lover.    
Unfortunately.     
(I dread the day my wonderful sitter retires. I don't think I can face the stress of finding trustworthy dog care again...)

			As you mentioned puppies rather than adult dogs - I just to want to emphasize this from the BVet link given by temiatwork:   
In the case of puppies too young to have completed the vaccination course and eligibility period:   
""Animals aged less than three months may only be imported into Switzerland from the EU unvacci-  
nated if they are accompanied by and dependent upon their mothers or if a veterinary certificate can be  
provided showing that they have been kept at the place where they were born since birth and have  
never come into contact with wild animals which could have been exposed to an infection with rabies. ""   
If the dog you are importing is fully vaccinated according to the BVet requirements, this of course does not apply.   
Also, please bear in mind that under the new Tierschutzgesetz you are required to complete the theory course   acquiring a dog if you are a first time dog owner. So, if that applies to you, best to get that out of the way well in advance of bringing your puppy home.   
And, don't forget the practical course requirement - you and your puppy have to complete that within the first year of ownership.   
Wishing you and your new pup all the best.

			I'm so very, very sorry.   
It is never easy to come to terms with the loss of a beloved pet - but when such a tragedy occurs out of the blue you will of course be in shock.   
Grief hits us all differently, the ways we need to work our way through the pain differs as well.  Once when I found myself unable to cope with the loss of a very special dog (I was in Switzerland, with no one to talk to in my own language)  I turned to the Blue Cross Pet Bereavement Helpline in the UK:       
The counselors at the Blue Cross were a great help to me - perhaps you might find them helpful, too.   
---   
I hesitate to say this, as now is probably not the time - but when you feel able to cope perhaps there should be a follow-up discussion with the sitter. (Is the sitter a professional, registered with the BVet? Is she insured for her commercial activity? How did your contract deal with safety and responsibility issues?) 
---   
For now, please concentrate on yourself and your family - and cherish the memories of the time you had with your dog.   
I'm truly sorry, and wish you and your family strength to see you through this difficult time.

Personally I recommend that you take her to a kennel. You won't have to worry about someone cancelling at the last minute, or letting you down. I know of another kennel but not in Olten that just added a cattery. It is really nice. This kennel is used by the Tierschutz in Basel. Here is a map.     
The application is online (I have a translation if you need one).

In any case, you have to really make sure to clean the area where it happened and use deodorizer. If not your cat will do it at the same spot over and over. Also sometimes it works to put a litter box on the exact spot where they did it. It teaches them that it is where it belongs.

			Hi Emilie,   
We have a wonderful little pug that we did get from Sweden in the end. We almost got one from Switzerland but decided to go with one from home. Sweden have strict rules regarding breeding to avoid any health issues and it was easier for me as my french is limited.   
I dont know if you want a purebred pug with all the papers. If thats not so important I would maybe check out  . Make sure you get some details about the mother and father if possible.   
For example   but these are in France. 
Just do a search for Carlin every now and then and see what comes up.    
Good luck with finding a pug, they are wonderful dogs and will love you to bits. I have always had pugs growing up and they are fantastic  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	wanted: pug pup+ information :)	Emilie	Posts: 4

			Adoption is a great route to go if you dont have a preference for any breeds. I am so glad that a dog will be able to find a new home with you and your family.    
Now will also be a great time to start looking for where you can start taking the legally required BVET courses. If you are a first time dog owner, since Sept 2008, its obligatory for all first time owners to take a theory course before you acquire the dog.   
Once you get your dog, you'll have to take it on a compulsory 5 sessions course on basic obedience and the different but common situations that your dog will be exposed to (trams, approaching dogs /strangers etc).        
Keep us posted!

			Bernese are gorgeous dogs. I live in Australia and have owned 2...my first one had to be put down due to cancer - she lived to 8 years old - and my second baby girl was treated for cancer at 4 years old, she has had major surgery and was given a year to live by my vet. 
There are (apparently) very few breeders who don't have cancer as a hereditary/genetic problem in their Bernese.   
It's very sad, and I was wondering if anyone knows what cancer is like in Swiss Bernese Mountain Dogs?

The pooping on the bed is a sign of stress, the feliway would help with this, it spreads the pherimones around and makes them all chilled out and relaxed.    
You can get it from your vets, qualipet may have it but Im not sure. There are also drops they sell called Angst vor larm dropfen. It works really well if you put a couple of drops directly into the mouth and you can also put it in their water bowl. Its still very early days,Im sure the cat will settle down in no time at all.

There are advantages behavioural and health wise for having your dog neutered but leaving them entire doesnt mean that they will definitely suffer health problems - hence my point about it being an individual decision. I dont think less of people who dont.    
But yes, I neutered my dog mainly because I want to prevent future health problems in that respect. Its a case of rather-be-safe-than-sorry -- much to my husband's dismay and protests.    
Afterall, I dont have any plans to breed him etc. With regards to behaviour, I see not much of a change. Still playful and cheeky,  but he was never aggressive or territorial to begin with..    
People also tend to neuter their dogs to calm them down but mine's still as boisterious as ever (though nothing a good run or long walk wont fix).  
I have to say though, he has since decrease his markings outside and stopped humping my husband and his bed.   "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 71 Times in 22 Posts	Dog Breeding in Switzerland	Javo	Posts: 190

We tried putting bell collars on them but they always managed to get them off. We had one of those cat trees that goes from the floor to the ceiling which they managed to break last time we tried to keep them in overnight.   
I'm pretty sure the 3rd kitty already thinks his name is No that he now responds to it by purring. Good tip with spraying the water though. I'll give that a go and hopefully it will work.

			Definitely not a rumor.   
A thread discussing the dog tax, which varies by canton and Gemeinde:       
And, you will also need to take the newly mandated theory course prior to obtaining the dog, as well as a training course within the first 12 months of ownership, as discussed here:       
Some cantons require you to purchase liability insurance (usually a cover of 3 mio.) as well; even if you canton does not require it, I would definitely recommend doing so. Also, you should know that some cantons have enacted various forms of BSL. For the cantonal regulations, see:         
Hope you find the pup of your dreams soon - and as you look, this is a good time to read up on the obligations and expectations Swiss society places on dog owners. Browse through the Pets section - lots of good info and discussions here.   
Best of luck to you and your future canine friend!

You can't imagine what mine managed to steal, and then hide in strange places: erasers, tissues, countless pens and keys, potatoes, onions, hair clips, etc. Stocking food in my shoes/bags is also very popular. Always useful and nice to discover a handful of dry food in your handbag    
Moreover, if you haven't seen my ferret with my son's dummy in the mouth, you missed everything...

			We too have just moved here from Washington State and are missing having a dog park available for our dog. He is a terrier and really can't be trusted off leash. One look at a cat and he would be gone. (He was raised with cats and is used to chasing and being chased by them in return in play)   
We've been taking lovely long walks (there are numerous beautiful trails through forests and around farmland) for exercise, but I know he's missing being able to run helter skelter after tennis balls in a safely fenced area.    
I did find one very small fenced in area that is specifically for dogs to do their business near where we live. I've taken him there to toss the ball around a bit but it's just not the same.    
Our ""chuck-it"" is gathering dust!   
Still our dog seems quite happy and loves those meadows even on leash!   
Good luck with your move and welcome to Zurich!  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2008	Groaned at 3 Times in 2 Posts	Are there Dog Parks in Zurich area?	Switzerland2009	Posts: 157

			Thanks Sarah, I live in an apartment in Basle as i work at Novartis the Pharmaceutical company but i'm waiting for confirmation that my contract is extended and then i will give up the lease on the apartment and move across the border to Germany in the Freiburg/Lorrach region purely because i can have a large house with a garden and it is so much cheaper to rent and of course the Black Forest is not far.. My problem is that with 6 dogs i need somewhere secure to put them all when i go to work normally in the UK. As i work 200KM away in London (i live in a rural area with a 2 hectare garden) the dogs go to boarding kennels for 5 days which costs me about 1000Euros a month. As i miss them a lot whilst here in Switzerland i get home to see them every 2 weeks. So at the moment i'm waiting to see what happens with my contract to decide if i can bring all 6 or pick 3 good dogs. I would probably bring them all over by airfreight as my husband's company owns a animal freight company transporting horses, dogs, pets etc. 
Crufts in the UK have banned docking of Weimeraners 2 years ago. You may know that Crufts is one of the largest dog shows in the world and all weimies now have long tails. If i went to Germany to live with them i don't see it problem i guess it should be okay. Apparently they were docked because their tails are very thin and prone to breaking the bone. I would love a weimie with a tail as it is funny seeing my 2 wag their tails. 
Weimies and dalmations complement each other as they are full of energy but weimies are far more intelligent and more dominant. Of course i love all of them.

			Well if you are around Zug, we could do the hairy monster for you . We have 2 cockers and clip and trim them ourselves. As they are both spayed, they  can't be hand stripped but we clip them, keeping some feathering to keep the cocker look.   
Is yours used to being groomed???

			Hi there,   
in ZÃ¼rich where can I get a cat visited? There's one in my building which hides in the basement although initially was sitting on the stairwell. My suspect is that it is either sick or abandoned.   
I've tried to place a plate of tuna fish next to him but he escaped. Then tried with some water which did the same.   
On top of the doctor contact - any suggestion on how to grab the cat, put it in a box and bring it into the car? I feel already scared by doing this alone    
PS: any idea how much a visit would cost?

			^ Same thing happened to me when my dog and I arrived from Canada.  The customs officials had no interest in seeing my paperwork, they just waved me through. Quite a surprise.   
I guess it's better to always make sure you have all the paperwork done, though.  You never know when you are going to run into an over-eager boarder guard.    
Plus, it made my vet's life easier to know exactly which shots my dog had and when.

If you look in   (you can search in English) us the word ""hundesalon"" and you will find several places. I have no personal knowledge of any of them so you would have to call or visit. I certainly would do so. I would also check that they are staffed by more than one person at all times. 
Last year there was a tragedy at a dog groomer in Wohlen (Kt. Aargau). Apparently the dog was strangled to death as the dog was left unattended and attempted to jump from the table.    
P.S. Your post should probably have been in the pet corner section and I am sure a moderator will move it there.

			Hi  
I need a cat sitter for the month of November and am prepared to offer the person a months free accommodation in return (incl bills). 
It must be someone who has experience with and loves cats, and must also be a non smoker. You will share a stunning large 3.5 room apartment with one other. However he is only here 4 days a week mid week, and is easy to share with. 
I live in Triemli, Zurich

			Well, the consultation definitely wasn't included, since we got the food from our regular vet and there was no appointment.  I'll have to dig up an old receipt and see if the price is too high-maybe they just made a mistake...I hope that's the explanation!

			We've just imported our 2 dogs from the uk.  They arrived yesterday.  If your animals are to go over the borders, out of Switzerland, say if you go on holiday, then your  animals will need the rabies vacc to be up to date.  My uk  vet told me that we musn't let this lapse even by one day, because then you'll have to go through the whole rigmorole of vaccine + blood test once again.  However, if you remember to do the booster before the 3 years is up then no blood test is required.   
I got varying advice regarding importing/exporting pets.  The official line is that if they fly directly into Switzerland they do not need anything as Switzerland is Rabies free.  However, I was then told that no customs vet would allow a dog out of the airport without full load of vaccinations.   
The best advice I got was from B-vet on Melancollie's recommendations.  They reply promptly to all your questions and in English.  They are very very clear.   
The English (Defra) however, is another matter; tardy replies and then the most I got out of them was ""we don't know""!!!   
Good luck.  My boys are now happy to be here.

			Pour tap water into a large bucket and leave it for 24hours to let it dissipate. However, I would suggest you still need to check the pH of the water...   
Alternatively some aquarium shops will sell the water 'ready to go' - an expensive way to get water, but maybe necessary if you can't manage.   
Preserve the water you have already, and don't change more than 1/3 at a time, and make sure the water is the same temperature when you add it or you will give them heat/cold shock...

			Neil,   
There are a lot of people offering casual pet sitting services - some good, some not. Demand is very high during the school holidays, so I would think that there is opportunity for you. If that is the kind of service you are considering offering, think about what you can do to stand out from the crowd.    
In contrast, there are very few people offering professional in-home sitting, as the person I finally found does. As she is fully booked months in advance, I assume that there is indeed demand for more of this kind of service.   
If you study the Animal Protection Law of 1 Sept 2008, and if you keep your eyes on the proceedings going on in the WBK and their proposal working it's way through the federal legislative process, you'll see that being the person in charge of a dog has become rather complex.  (Offering cat care services is far less complex, as I understand it - but I am not a cat owner, so am probably not au fait... ) Speak to the Bvet, speak to an insurer, speak to the Gemeinde and cantonal tax authorities about requirements.   
A few random thoughts and rhetorical questions, from my perspective as a customer (dog owner):    
First,  think about how you will structure the business. For my part, I want the sitter to be legally self employed. I wish to be a customer, not an employer - and do not want to be put in a position where I could be construed to be an employer with an employer's liabilities. If a sitter is working illegally he/she could be putting the customer at risk, in addition to running afoul of employent law one's self.    
In addition to properly registering with the tax authorities, some dog sitters need to comply with Bvet regulations under the new Tierschutzgesetz. The owner's insurer might refuse to cover damages if the sitter is not fully compliant, leaving the customer very much in the lurch.  (Think of the recent incident in Schaffhausen...)   
Pet sitting is not a casual job - it's a big responsibility. If I have booked the sitter, I expect the sitter to fulfill that commitment. Most customers cannot easily change plans, re-schedule flights, etc - which means a sitter should have back-up, in agreement with the client, in case of emergencies on his/her part.    
As mentioned, I use an in-home service - my sitter moves into my home in my absence, living there 24/7 to care for my dogs. During the time I've booked, caring for my mutts is not something the sitter does for a few hours on the side - it's a full time job. Even if you take the pet into your home, the commitment is the same - would your family be able to cope with that? Do you have children or pets of your own? If so, how would the business impact them - and would your children/ own pets/ home commitments limit the kind the pets you could care for?   
I expect demonstrable experience or qualifications. I need a sitter who is conversant in behavioral theory, whose philosophy and methods mesh with mine. I would quiz a sitter thoroughly on how he/she would handle a variety of situations, and I would set up a test period to evaluate the sitter's skills. Think about how you could convince a prospective customer that you are the right person to care for his/her pets. And, what would you do if a customer's ideas differed from yours - think about who you want your customers to be.   
I expect a sitter to be fully conversant in local, cantonal and federal animal welfare and control laws. And of course, I expect a sitter to comply with those laws. For instance, I see you are in canton ZH - be aware that new dog control legislation is in the pipeline following the cantonal vote last November.   
I expect a sitter to be able to deal with veterinary emergencies - which means knowing basic first aid, having a good enough command of the local language to get through the answering service gatekeepers to get the dogs timely veterinary care or to speak to the clinic staff, and having a car to transport the animal to the emergency clinic if needed.  A sitter needs to draw up a detailed agreement with the client as to how emergencies are handled.    
Are you willing/able/qualified to deal with special medical needs, such as dispensing meds, handling pets with limited mobility, diabetes, epilepsy, etc? Could you care for an incontinent pet? Could you handle pets with behavioral challenges? And if so, think about the liability issues surrounding taking on such responsibilities.    
If you choose to take pets into your home rather than watching them in the customer's home, do you have permission from the landlord to do so if you rent? Do you have permission from the neighbors if necessary? Think about noise and neighborhood tolerance levels.   
And if you take pets into your home, is your home safe for animals? Stairs? Hazzards? Is your garden securely fenced in? These are issues to discuss with your insurer.   
I am admittedly a demanding customer   , as I have dogs who are a bit of a challenge. My sitter offers me peace of mind, knowing my mutts are in safe hands. For that I - and many dog owner in similar situations - are willing to pay a small fortune.    
The right  person, with the right business model, can indeed do well with this gig.    
Wishing you well as you explore this venture...

			Hello all!   
We need to be away for the weekend of 15th and 16th of August and we have no place for our 17 months old Bulldog... Ou rususal kennel is booked up and none of ours friends is around/can help    
anyone who could help? We would then be glad to exchange the favour...   
He is lovely, completely housetrained but a bit boisterous... we have a 10month old baby so he is used to children but he is not so ""delicate"" with them    
Needs very short walks (he is LAZY) 3 times a day and pretty much snoozes the rest, or enjoys a couple of sessions of play about 2-3 times a day.   
If anyone could help that would be great!   
Thanks

2414	null	null	null	null	"    That seems to be a fairly uneducated statement. I owned a large German shepherd and did intense training with it and can tell you that one can teach a large dog to ignore its natural prey instinct completely (it should remain still even if a gunshot is fired next to its head or a small animal like a cat passes by).    
A well behaved dog would have returned to the owner or just remained totally still if told to do so.

			Thank you all so much for your help. We just can't imagine leaving our girl at home, and as there are no quarantine requirements, we are going to go ahead and bring her. I was reading a post about the dog legislation being tossed around and am a little nervous about it -- she's a bullmastiff, which I'm sure will be on some ""list"", but we'll work it out. She's the best dog ever -- so very sweet and calm, friendly with dogs and people; I'm sure we'll make it through whatever test they throw at us.

			What is good is to think long and hard about the suitability of your home and family for a dog, not bring one in THEN find out they can make a mess and your wife is allergic, and all this in less than 2 weeks.    
What is crap is an attitude that this is somehow reasonable, because they posted for sale to a good home. The OP is probably a really nice guy, but this is a sad episode especially for the pup.

although i think 300chf is well worth it - we always got our dogs neutered 
no unwanted puppies that way too - too many strays otherwise

			Hi abzurich,   
I'd keep a close eye on him until you can get it checked out.   
If it's asthma then the breathing can go into spasm which would need  medical attention because it can deteriorate. If you find he's having to keep his mouth open with tongue out then get him in quick.   
MY cat had asthma and a number of treatments were tried as suggested by our vet:   
1. asthma inhaler as used by babies - absolute waste of time an money and distressing for the cat 
2. pills to be taken daily - did not work  
3. steroid injection - once every 6-8 weeks   
The injections worked best, but was told they may have side affects - she was alot happier on those than the other treatments.   
Still a happy cat, but sadly in the uk while i'm here ......meow

			In addition to the recommendation of others, I believe I saw a sale paper for this week for Aldi that screens are among the items on sale.   
They do have a website if you care to check it out      
Also though, I know my mother-in-law tends to pick up netting from pet stores to put across her window... as screens on windows don't seem to be the typical thing here she is (apparently) less bothered by the flying critters getting in than I. I mention this as it may turn out to be a viable option for you as well, the time she bought some when I was with her, the purchase was made at Qualipet, they have a few different weave options and it is cut to measure (similar to purchasing fabric for sewing).

			Hello, 
I live in Basel and own a Chihuahua. Does anyone else own a chihuahua or a dog who would like to socialize with me and Keira? She's 17weeks old and she goes to puppy school. She's really sweet and friendly. It's just nice for her to interact more with other dogs.

OP - good luck with your search, and I'm also in favor of not buying pets from a petstore. I was looking earlier in the year and had a bit of a rough time with the tierheims I spoke with, but I'm convinced it's on a case by case operation and not standard across the board.   
Just an FYI - if you're looking for a pure bred cat in CH, expect to pay upwards of 1500 - 2000 CHF to a breeder. The rescues are the way to go, your kitty is out there somewhere!!

			That's so strange - if we have been away our cat pees on my husband's backpack too! I thought it must have just been a one off but no!   
The cat might get more confident with age?  Sometimes they just like doing their own thing and you can't expect them to want to sit on your lap all the time... I know its a worry though if you think the cat is unhappy.    
Good luck

			Thanks to all, will look in the books etc.   
No worries, we take it very seriously and the baby is never alone with the bulldog or even with him too close without supervision. We have installed security gates and have a playpen for her.   
We have thought about jealousy but then again the baby arrived when he was still quite young.   
I think indeed the stubborness is part of the breed but as said, I am a bit concerned that the methods we are trying to use do not seem to work (or we are not doing them properly  )   
Will come back and post results and in the meantime, we are takers of any suggestions!   
Ciao

			Hello,   
Myself and my husband are experienced pet owners, currently without pets as we've recently moved to Switzerland and we are available for short term dog or cat sitting for reasonable hourly or daily rates. 
We're both English speakers, but also speak French and are free from 3pm each day and all day most weekends.  We can visit homes to feed and check up on animals or have room for a pet at home.  We can also do daily walks if required.   
We live very close to two vets surgeries, in case of any emergencies and can provide references from happy pet owners, if required.   
Please send me a Private Message if you need any help.   
Many thanks, 
Lisa & Jamie

			This Labi was socialised from puphood to be gentle and friendly with children. She didn't really have a choice as all the neighbourhood tots wanted to touch her and play with her but most of them knew to ask first, ""May I touch your dog?"" Some dog-loving fathers even brought their barely-walking babies to pet the pup. The Lab is extra gentle with very small children (indeed it's in their genes to be easy with children).   
So, as per the OP's question, if a dog is not socialised from young to be comfy with children, would more frequent exposure to gentle and not-so-loud children help?   
Another question: Is it OK if a stranger asks to touch the pup but he/she rough-houses with it and makes it too excited? I didn't mind strangers petting her or playing gently with her but thought the rough-housing wasn't good for the dog and with my bad German I could only say, ""Nicht so schnell, bitte!""

			I used Continental to send Lily from the US to Switzerland two years ago, and found them to be very helpful. What I'm wondering is whether or not the regulations are different when you leave Switzerland versus when you enter. It seems that the regulations might require that you use a shipper when you leave. Seems to be a bit of racket - animal shippers needing business. Or perhaps there have been too many problems.    
Continental ships pets as expedited cargo and the price is based on the weight of the pet and crate. (For example, 65lbs of dog and crate were $800, over 70lbs, $1000. Continental was very good in providing me information about the size of the crate required (enormous), and we really had no problems, despite entering Switzerland with slightly wrong paperwork. But again, this was coming from the US to Switzerland 2 years ago.    
I would call Continental in the United States - the pet safe program number is  +1 832.235.1541         
One other option - KLM, the Dutch airlines has an ""Animal Hotel"" in Schipol Airport (Amsterdam) and I know that lots of animals are shipped out of A'dam. You might check with them. Air France and KLM are part of the same company (and I think Continental code shares with them), so it may or may not be helpful.    
Edited to add... I just checked here   
and it looks like KLM will only work with a shipper, and obviously AF will only work with one as well. Still not sure about Continental   
This is good to know, if we decide to go back to the US for any lenght of time, we'll have to take Lily and I'll need to plan this, I guess.    
Good luck.

			Dog arrived safely!!  He was initially going to be going throught her cargo dept but we were called that day by the airport to say he could come through the passenger area - we were allowed through, so he came through the passenger terminal in his crate, once we had gone through passport control they let him out, checked him over and no charge was made!  Have since registered him in the canton at a charge of 150chf and he got a tag to prove it!!  Don't need the vets as he is already microchipped.   
Thanks to the replies and hope this info helps anybody else

			Hi All   
Must share our experience! We took our pup for his first vet visit on Monday - Dr Heinz Berla spoke very good English - he and his team adored our pup - gave us excellent advice and recommendation on a puppy school. He also did a very thorough check and pup Nullah loved every treat and toy that came his way. I would highly recommend him. Telephone number is 044 401 3040 - he also has a website if you google him.

My Hooligan is an ultra high energy dog - in hindsight, one of the mistakes I made in the beginning was focusing on physical exercise to calm her down. She is extremely fit and can go all day long - but we reached a point where her stamina was such that she needed ever increasing amounts of exercise, she became almost an adrenaline junkie. I could not tire her out physically; I don't live on a farm where she could run free all day, nor do I have a herd of sheep for her to control. I soon realized I needed other ways to engage and stimulate her: brain-training does just that.   
I've found that interactive games where my dogs and I work together to be the most fun, and are best mental work out for my guys. Most of the things we do are simple games easily incorporated into my daily household routine.   
I use a lot of clicker training - which is really just form of operant conditioning. First, here is a good site explaining the basics:       
I use this method to teach my dogs something new, something they might not instinctively understand. And then I try to turn training into a game.    
For instance, my house often ends up littered with dog toys; you can't move without stepping on a squeeky. So when it's time to clean up, I call the the dogs in to play the pick-up game. On my command, the dogs search the room for toys - when one of my guys finds one, he/she picks it up and puts it into the toy box - and gets a reward. On to the next toy... and the next...    
I do the same when gardening - the dogs bring me my gloves, a trowel, put the plastic pots in a pile for recycling, etc.    
My friend taught her amazing lab to sort laundry using clicker training. I haven't gone that far, as I expect my opportunistic sock thief would have a field day - and we would end up barefoot.    
You can use the basic idea to teach your dog anything - the point is to involve your dog in your mundane household activities. Ask yourself, what part of this task could my dog do? Turn a chore into a game - the dog loves being with you, figuring out what you want and how to do it, getting praise from you. The dog enjoys the game, and the activity reinforces your bond - and the mental exercise really does tire the dog out.   
There are lots of videos on YouTube demonstrating clicker basics, as well as how to teach games/tricks.   
Teaching 'search' has been very handy - I can use this in so many ways, from traditional dog activities like scenting a course, to playing 'find it' games around the house.   
We also play with puzzle toys, where the dog has to figure out how to make something work in order to get a reward. Nina Ottoson makes a fantastic line of dog toys, really brilliant stuff, top quality - and very expensive. As an easier-on-the-budget alternative, I make most of our toys. My husband is into woodworking, so he has done some variations on the Dogbrick - but most of our toys are made of cardboard boxes, plastic bottles, packaging materials - things you have lying around the house. I really like the Spass Mit Hund website - it's packed with great ideas:       
The authors have also written a book, available in English translation ""Playtime For Your Dog'.   
Targeting games are another good mental work out - I use targeting a lot with my deaf dog who needs visual rather than auditory (clicker) cues. One game he loves: I give him an array of cards, some round shaped, some square, some star shaped, etc. He has to touch each one differently - star with right paw, round with nose, square with left paw, etc. I'm working on doing this with color variations as well. Targeting can be used for practical applications - a high five and 'gib pfotli' games, for example, are how I desensitized him to give me his paw so I can clip his nails.    
You can also make basic obedience training into a game around the house. My dogs tend to follow me around - usually underfoot, tripping me up.   So taking that natural instinct, I've taught them to off-lead heel - up the stairs, into the kitchen, through doorways, etc. My morning coffee break is a good opportunity to teach a down-stay; our goal is to be able to hold a down for the time it takes me to finish my cuppa.   
Team Training teaches the dog a sequence of steps - turns, weaves, etc., kind of like dog dancing.  The point is that the dog learns to focus on me while doing something that requires concentration. Now, I have no interest in turning my dog into a circus performer - but it's a fun way to teach close-in work. A bit of serendipity - I've found this a very useful distraction/re-focus technique with my reactive dog.   
Yes, my young to middle aged dogs do need a lot of physical exercise - they are herding dogs after all. But I've found that their brains need as much - if not more - exercise as their bodies do - it's all about balance. We play brain-training type games randomly throughout the day, for short periods - a few minutes at a time really is enough. After a good mental work out, my guys usually toddle off to their beds for a nice long nap.  And peace reigns throughout the house.    
I'd encourage you to find a training class or group you could join regularly for socialization as much as for training. The group I go to not only gives me support and encouragement, new ideas and techniques, but through the group the dogs and I have found some good friends.   
All the best to you and your dog.

2441	27.06.2009, 23:11	Member	Thanked 197 Times in 99 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    I am sure you must be relieved. From time to time one of our dogs will limp and it has always been a case where she just sprained something (usually a result of playing football in the garden ). She does have a problem with the patella popping out. Now I wait before rushing to the vet to see if it improves. If the dog does not appear to be in pain, I prefer to wait and see if she gets better.    
If the vet gives something for pain, it should be because the pain is severe and not just a dull pain as otherwise after the pain meds the dog will want to put weight on the affected area, which is not always the best idea. One time she seemed to have done something to her toe....we have no idea how, but she was limping so badly but it was just really painful for her to put weight on that side all because of one toe.    
Another occasion I remember one of the other dogs limping and when I check under her paw and between the toes I found that she had managed to get a wood splinter stuck in her paw. So do check that there is no foreign body there. Sometimes this tickles and the dog will pull her paw away but this is not the same as if she winces when you handle her paw or toes.

This is my first post on Englishforum.  I've been impressed by the quality of the comments and am happy to have found such a helpful bunch of people.  I hope you can help me now.   
We are moving from California to the Geneva area in August.  We have a cockatiel called Cupid which will be moving with us.  I think we've figured out what we need to do to satisfy the Swiss authorities, but we're having a lot of trouble finding an airline that will allow us to transport Cupid in the cabin with us (in a proper carrier).  There are several US domestic airlines that will work, but none that travel the US to Eurpoe route.  Does anyone have any advice?  Is there some kind of EU rule that doesn't allow airelines to transport pets in the cabin?   
Thanks,

			What a wonderful idea not to let your oldie at home. If you ever find a link how it's possible to get your dog on a horse (kind of a dog-saddle), please let me know (I'm serious!).

			Hi all,   
I would like to adopt a shelter cat and am wondering if anyone has done that here and can give me the lowdown.     
First: how much does it cost, what paperwork is involved, what shots are required and does the shelter take care of the neutering/spaying and shots before you adopt?   
Second, and more complicated: what are the rules regarding moving into an EU country (Germany, specifically) with a cat adopted in Switzerland?   
Third, and more complicated yet: what are the rules regarding traveling to and from the US with a cat adopted in Switzerland?     
Thanks!!   
Erin

			Ask your vet, he/she should be able to help.   
Strangley enough, our vet told us they were not allowed in CH, at least the ones you use for the house (electrical dispenser). Maybe it is different for the collar or things have changed in the meantime.   
We also tried one to help our dog cope with August 1,... FAIL!, with every bang he heard, he found an excuse to jump on anybody's lap. That's 30 kg of dog jumping on you.

If you are travelling, importing/exporting it depends on the country. Sweden for example reqires that titre test is done at least 4 months after a rabis shot, Australia has some other time frame... Probably best to speak with your vet about this.

			Right, I am sorry if its coming across as a lecture but I wasnt actually directing that post at you.   
Whilst I cannot share my experience about buying / adopting a puppy from Italy or France, I empathise with what you're going through re the availability situation as I've just been through that myself. Its frustrating.    
I can see that you are looking for a brittany and they are indeed rare here. Fingers crossed, you'll never know some of the gem of information that turn up on this forum.

			Hello,   
Be careful when introducing the new rat! Even though rats are highly sociable creatures, it might be difficult for an ageing rat to accept a newcomer! And traumatising incidents of decapitated or severely injured youngsters are not rare... Could be very shocking for your poor daughter to discover such a scene in the cage!   
It's for you to consider, but if your rat is already old, it might be wiser to compensate the loss of her playmate by tons of attention and cuddles.   
Anyway, all my thoughts go to your poor daughter. I lost two rats due to old age, and it was very difficult. We get so attached to those furry clever things...

I remembered you had posted some time ago about your snake.     
I think that if your snake is not subject to a permit, then you need not worry. But of course, as a courtesy, you probably should have told the landlord about him.    
Last year there were 2 snakes found in a garbage bag in Baden.    
The owner of these two snakes would have needed a permit to keep them.    
If you are really concerned, contact the veterinary office in the Kanton of ZÃ¼rich. For sure it is best to get the information from them.    
I looked on CITES. If your snake is a  , you should be fine.  
Snakes are listed on page 25.

			Dear Summerrain,   
thanks for your link. I went through it. However, it seems that such a condition is caused by a single worm under the skin especially in the face/neck region while this kitten had hundreds coming out simultaneously from within the skin of his hips. They were not more than 1mm in length each and had a creammy white colour. They were also coming out from within the ears and some also from his mouth. There was no reddening or blood coming out of the kitten's skin/ears or mouth but from how he was opening his mouth and how lethargic he was compared to his siblings, I think they caused quite a lot of discomfort      
The thing I thought most plausible is that the mother cat has something wrong (maybe a worm laying eggs in her which attck the unborn babies) or I don't know what to think. I mean, how could a fly deposit eggs in a newborn kitty and they hatch and get out of the skin by the next day?    
Thanks again for your post, it is always useful to learn about such things.

			Smarty's doing well. He's not septic anymore and is out of ICU.    
He has a bit of history. He was with a different vet - in Kusnacht before - and after an operation, they burnt him on the heating pad. So now he has to stay in the hospital for quite a bit longer to see what's going on with the burn.    
But he is doing better. Just has a bit of a road to 100% left.    
I took Gin to the hospital today to check his infection. It's been a week of treatment and the little trooper can now get off his meds. Whew!    There's still a bit of infection left, but they think it will clear up by itself.    
So all is working out.        
Cheers, 
   Nanda.

			That's really sad, poor kitty    
From what I've read, problems like that are caused by long term neglect of the teeth, or it could be a symptom of a virus. Feline calicivirus , FIV &amp; FeLV could be the problem, especially if the cat is young, goes outside and has never been vaccinated. If you are bringing the cat into your house and you have cats, please don't let it get near yours - contain it and give the room a good scrub and wash your clothes before letting your cat in or picking him up. Our cat picked up a virus from our clothes, our vet said they are easily transmitted.   
Also from what I've read it is hard to treat, but can be managed with antibiotics, steroids and continues care of the teeth. Our vet only charged us 120 CHF to clean our cats teeth, I thought that was pretty cheap compared to Canada, but it seems like this woman might not have the money to do so...or she just doesn't care.   
To get the cat to eat you can give it some wet food, best to warm it up a bit to make it more appealing.   
If your vet would be willing to help as a charity case, I'd be willing to donate some money to get this kitty some help....I also hate seeing animals suffer.

			You might be able to get the information you need concerning importing your birds by asking your nearest Swiss consulate. When I first came to Switzerland I brought my cat with me, a few months before departing I asked at the Swiss consulate in San Francisco exactly what I needed to do, they were very helpful and supplied me with all the information I needed to bring the cat to Zurich.

			We got our dog Roscoe (see picture here   ) 
from the Tierschutz site...    
Actually the lead to him came from there. His picture wasn't there and we called a Tierheim in Aargau but the dog we were interested was already taken. Then Heidi told us about Roscoe (then named Pascha). He is a Husky mix (medium sized dog but VERY Husky with his bark and his ability to leap over however high of a fence we have;-).   
Roscoe was a year old when we got him 1.5 years ago and is originally from a Tierheim in Serbia (he was put out of his home and beaten on the head with a hatchet - you can see the scar standing above him   - then someone took him to this Tierheim). It is amazing to think he made his way from there to us here. We can't imagine our family without him! The kitties love him too! At least the younger one does, our 16 year old one is still warming up to him...

			thanks everyone for the replies.    
so i'm thinking that the vet registration was the ""within 8-10 days of arriving"" 
and then i can go get the other registration. i'll call the kreisburo on monday to check (those poor people and my non-existent German right now...).   
luna is adapting really well here so far. i'm sure she misses all the lizards from her old backyard, but the longer, more varied walks have been great, and don't even get her started on the thing. that thing she saw. the other night. omg it was small, fuzzy, and slowly crossing the street. makes her just shiver with excitement thinking about it. my husband thinks it was a hedgehog.

			Hi Jen. 
I looked through SKG magazine 'Hunde' since they have news from all the clubs under the Swiss Kennel Club. Unfortunally I didn't see that they have a club for the frensch bulldog, english bulldog has a club, and then what I feelt was be the most likely club was the 'Miniature Club' -    
I don't see frenshies there either tough, maybe not a populair breed in Swiss? 
You might then considerade to check out breeders in Germany and France.   
Take your time though, make sure you get a responsible breeder who cares about health. I knew one Frenchy, not from a good breeder and with serious health issues like epilepsy    
---   
NellyBelly; well, some people want to have a dog with certain look & size and certain temprament or working power (like hunt dogs). My first dog was a mix and his temprament was a total nightmare compared to my purebreed today... It sure sucks that so many dogs are with out home, but I want a dog who I know will fit my family... 
You might not like purebreeds... but heck, what do I care...   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Where to get a puppy in Switerland	javajen77	Posts: 1

			Id say most definitely get another cat. However if your present cat is female, then you should get another female to ensure they get along.  If you get male and female now , the male will always try to dominate the female, even if he is last into the house, and this will cause problems. ( been there done that) we now have a cat and a dog, who get on famously, but the cat is the boss...

			Good luck with the turtles! You may want to take a look at the website of the Swiss Turtle Association (free translation  ). It's in German/French/Italian and it seems quite serious.       
I have also attached an article which gives detailled information about what the latest Animal Protection Laws mean for turtle/tortoise owners with regard to the size of the enclosure, etc. It's in German only unfortunately but it may be worth getting translated. The new laws are fairly draconian and as we all know ""ignorance is no defence"" in legal terms. It would silly to get into trouble with these bureaucrats over a turtle!!!

			I can't find anything about Aargau but  's a recent 20 Minuten article about a dog that ate poisoned food near the Thur river. I don't know if this is a police communication concept or if there just is no increase in dog poisoning, but there hasn't been a press release about the issue since 2007. Anyway it can't hurt to keep an eye on your unleashed dog in case he is about to eat something suspect.

			Yep, the orange peel worked for me when my cat started using the big outdoor potplants as his toilet. Their eyes squint when they smell it and the avoid it as much as possible. Could be handy for when you're not at home/not looking with supersoaker in hand.

We had a very pleasant stay at the hotel and actually ended up extending our stay for a couple extra nights (we originally booked the package through Hotelplan). The food was good and the on-site sauna and pool facility was a nice treat after a day of hard skiing on the slopes.

			IS there a recommendation for training an older dog (4 yr old jack russell) we got him from the rescuse centre in lausanne in July last year - he is a lovely dog at home - really well trainined and excellent behaviour.. 
but..he really doent like other dogs very much  - sometimes gets very yappy and over excited - we have managed to calm him down a bit - but I think it would be sensible for him to see a trainer.   
Any recommendations around 1800? (and if they speak english even better)   
Thank you

			Now granted I'm not sure how much of this is taken care of by the animal shippers but the official rules we were given last year for bringing a dog here  in order to skip quarantine were:   
First the dog has to have a microchip that is readable by European scanners - the typical US microchips are on a different frequency so you need to go somewhere like Petsmart which will put both in.   
Rabies Vaccine less then 1 year old - and the vaccine has to be verified by:      (its the only lab in the US that does this - your local US vet will draw the samples and send it to them - I think it took us something like 6 weeks to get the results back)   
Then you have to have a vet fill out papers, followed by your state's USDA vet signing off and stamping that everything is in order and meets export rules.       
Then your dog will get to Switzerland and no one will even bother looking at all the papers you absolutely HAD to have to bring the dog here (but of course you have to have them if you actually do get asked).  I think that was everything anyway.  Good luck   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Importing Dog from USA	new2luzern	Posts: 28

2508	null	null	null	null	"    When we were in Japan the veterinarians there seemed to handle most things in a simpler manner than here. When one of our dogs needed an Xray here and the vet said she would have to anaesthetise her, I was confused and said that would not be necessary. She tried it without and it was fine. One of our dogs is prone to lipomas, and as soon as we would find one, the vet in Japan removed it without cutting or sutures. Here it requires an operation (she continues to get them - it's a condition common to Bassets.)   
I have made an appointment today for our dog to see our ""regular veterinarian"" and will take it from here.  I have known him for years. We consulted with him from Japan and I trust him.     
I have referred many people to this clinic as communication in English is no problem. 
Will keep you posted.

2516	03.12.2007, 12:24	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    I'm not in ZÃ¼rich, but if you are up for a trip into the wilds of SZ (Wollerau, just over the cantonal line), I highly recommend:       
Two of my mutts attend classes here - my youngster attended the basics course and has been in   (literally, family dog) classes regularly since then. The trainer is absolutely brilliant with my little whirlwind. And, she deals brilliantly with my... err... foibles, which is what training is really all about. Training classes teach the owner - and you in turn work with your dog.   
I very much like Frau Schuler-Ponte's philosophy of training - she takes a positive, rewards-based approach founded on a solid understanding of canine behavior and common sense.   focuses on socialization and on-going training - for you the owner, and for your dog. The classes are small, 4-6 dogs/owners, and the atmosphere is relaxed.    
My recent addition is deaf; he and I are now doing one-to one training sessions with Frau Odermatt, who handles the senior and handicapped classes. The classes are fun for my doglet, and have been a huge help to me, giving me the confidence I need to work with my new guy.    
HTM, special sessions covering specific or advanced topics and  , (training walks) are offered one to one or in a small group. The school is also affiliated with an Agility club.   
Prices are reasonable. German only, I'm afraid.  Although my High German is far from perfect and my Swiss-German downright awful, I haven't had (much) trouble communicating.    
----   
Two other good schools (again SZ but not too far out of ZH), largely Agility and Obedience focused:           
----   
The SKG website publishes a list of training courses/clubs from it's members: (I don't have personal experience with these.)       
(Click on 'Erziehungskurse' - listed by canton.)   
Or take a look through the Certodog site for an instructor:       
--   
Or, try googling 'Hundeschule' or Hunderziehungskurs'.   
There are lots of good courses out there - if you are looking within a certain area, let me know where and I can ask around for recommendations. Also, ask your vet, ask other dog owners you see out on walks - personal experience is always best.   
The important thing in choosing a class is to understand the instructor's training philosophy and methods - his/her ideas about training should mesh with yours, and should suit your dog's needs. Sadly, there are still some old school trainers around who use fear/punishment techniques - do avoid these. Your best bet is to speak at length with the trainer about his/her ideas, about your dog, and about your goals. Then audit a few classes (without your dog) to ensure that the atmosphere is right for you. Good trainers are happy to have a prospective client do this.

			Hi    
On this page:       
On the right hand side you will see a link to a pdf called ""CITES Arten- Checkliste"". On page 131 you will find the Forpus Coelestis. The list format is not that great and can be confusing. It is worth checking everything twice because one thing that we did find was that there is conflicting information around.   
The whole thing about a CITES certificate is convincing the people that issue the certificate that you acquired the bird legally and that you (or the person you acquired it from) didn't catch the bird in the wilds. I am sure that whoever is doing it in the US will be more ""normal"" than the people who were doing it in Japan!    
BVET should be able to confirm though if you plead ""confusion"".   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Importing pet bird (Pacific Parrotlet)	jmignone	Posts: 12

			Hi Bluefish,   
We use Chat l'Heureux (literally ""happy cat"" and pronounced ""chaleureux"", both of which are good descriptions).        
You need to make sure all the vaccinations are up-to-date and leave the cat's vaccination card with them during the stay. Female cats don't need to be sterilized but I think this works out since the male pensioners do. They have vet service and Mrs Ryter is great with both the animals and their owners. There's outside space, lots to climb on indoors, and it's out in the country.    
If pick-up is a problem for you, I recall they had an arrangement with a lady who can collect your cat at home and do the delivery for you.   
Good luck!

2531	null	null	null	null	"    The veterinarian in Japan showed me how you can induce vomiting with salt water. The dog won't drink it willingly, so you have to force it down. It's really nasty and difficult to do alone.    
Vomiting will not help in some situations, in fact, vomiting could do more harm. Certain poisons, for example, can burn the esophagus or mouth again on the way up. But in our case it was necessary as the dog ate pebbles from the garden (that's what the xray revealed).   We realised it quickly enough that vomiting was the solution. If hours had lapsed, vomiting would have no effect as the material would already be in the small intestine.    
Fortunately she never did that again.   
I would be extremely careful about inducing vomiting without consulting with a vet first.

			Although I usually use the combi vaccine, I switched  my guys to the nasal drops a few days ago...   
Apparently there is a lot of kennel cough going around at the moment; my vet said he has seen a significant increase in cases this year.    
There's a good chance that one of mine has been exposed, and if so, that would mean that she could give it to the rest of the crew. So, the vet recommended that we play it safe and re-vaccinate with the nasal drops. (It had been 10 months since she had the combi jab.) I'm keeping all my guys at home for the next two weeks (the incubation period is is usually 5-7 days, but can be from 2-14), just to be safe. And now we wait...   
For all dog owners: If you regularly meet up with a lot of dogs (training classes, sports club, or just come into contact with a number of dogs on your daily walks) or simply frequent areas where dogs congregate, you should discuss the various protection options with your vet, and make a decision with his guidance.   
KC is very contagious; if you think your dog may have been exposed, please keep him/her on lead during the incubation period, and away from other dogs. If he/she has been diagnosed with KC (or any contagious disease), it's the law in many Gemeinden that the dog must be kept on lead until given the all clear from your vet.

			Mrs Doolittle has already pretty much said it all... the only thing there is is that you are not allowed to be distracted by something while driving be that a Navi, Mobile Phone or... D O G. So,if your dog is secure somewhere and not with his paws on the steering wheel or distracting you otherwise you'll be ok... For now, but I suspect sooner or later there will be a new law.

A dog off a leash is not a threat, just what you perceive to be, and that is not necessarily the reality of the situation. There are many people who are afraid of dogs and do not know how to behave around a dog as they were never taught. At the moment there is a program running in our local schools called ""Prevent a Bite."" It's aimed at educating young children on how to behave around a dog, and none of the dogs used in the program are on a leash.    
I can assure you that kicking a dog will get you into more trouble than standing perfectly still.

			I live in ZÃ¼rich and my Danish Girl friend studies as a veterinary at the University of Copenhagen. She is on her last year this coming summer and in Denmark she often works as a trainee in various practices (no salary, just for the training).    
Does anyone know whether it would be possible to arrange a few weeks for her as a trainee at swiss veterinary this coming summer? She specializes in small animals (cats, dogs etc.).   
Anyone who knows a good, english speaking Vet near ZÃ¼rich?

			Hello,   
I am going away between Dec. 21 and Jan. 2 and need someone to look after my cat in Luzern. The vet has told me that it would be bad to leave him in a kennel, so that can only be a last resort. I need someone to come over everyday to feed him and maybe spend just a little time with him. If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it.

			Hello!   
I live in Lausanne with my husband and my toddler son, and we also have 2 adorable ferrets, Casper and Leia. They live free in our flat (no cage for them!) and love playing with us and our toddler.   
Does anyone else have ferrets in Lausanne or in the area? Our ferrets would love meeting new friends from time to time. And we would also be happy to ferret-sit during holidays if you're ready to ferret-sit ours!   
Cheers,   
MÃ©lusine

2540	26.11.2008, 02:17	Forum Legend	Thanked 6,261 Times in 2,830 Posts	Location: Winterthur	"    I recently bought crates. I posted an ad here and there is info under that thread where others shared their collective wisdom.     
This is what I ended up buying for our 3 dogs..one double cage and one single cage. I had a lot of trouble finding what I wanted but it was worth the effort. Dogs are very happy. The cages fold when not in use though most of the time I just leave them in the car. We have one small cage from the same manufacturer which we keep as a spare for the other cars when we just take one dog with us. What I really like is that all the cages come with two doors, one on the long side and one on the short side. 
Our dogs are not used to cages in the car as before we used these great dog carriers from Japan which were very handy and the dogs liked them because they were open, but the dog can't jump out as there are straps to attach to their collar. I posted a photo of one below. It is a great idea if you rarely take your dog in the car. Also, it is very easy to get a dog in and out of which is necessary if a dog is ill or injured and getting them in a cage is next to impossible.    
As for safety, I see an awful lot of dogs in cars with no cage or carrier of any kind and I think this has got to be a distraction for the driver. There is no law that covers how a dog must travel in a car but I think anything that confines your dog and makes him or her more comfortable is better than nothing at all. I have seen seats covered and the dog's collar attached to a harness, as in the last photo. We have one of those as well though I don't use it at all.   
Our dogs weigh just under 20 kg. For air travel we had a kennel similar to a vari kennel. We sold them all. For the car I find them too closed in. Our dogs like to see out.

			dec. 19-jan 3. very, very friendly (borderline needy) cat. ideally, someone has family visiting who could stay at mine. the cat's great, warms up to new people quickly, but gets vindictive when i'm not around for more than a day or two. i'd like to come back and find that he did not shred my couch, pee on my bed, etc.   
many thanks for tips, advice. . .

			While this does not answer your question about Regal, we use   for our dog. They sell Solid Gold, an ultra premium food from the US, and they are in the process of moving to Natural Balance, another premium food. They have many fish and challenge products. They also deliver by Post for a reasonable fee.

			Just wondering if anyone has had any first hand experience with ""Tierferienplatz Scherer"" in MÃ¼lligen (PLZ 5243)? This is in the Brugg area.       
I am looking for an alternative to the ATS facility on SteinenbÃ¼hlstrasse in Untersiggenthal.  
Our dogs have stayed there in the past, but we have not been altogether satisfied. For example, on one occasion, they forgot to feed the dogs dinner the first day we left them. As I bring the dogs' food, each portion in a separate bag, when I picked the dogs up after a three day stay and there was one extra portion of food for each dog, I knew something was wrong. They admitted they forgot. I was furious. There have been other incidents as well.   
If anyone has any feedback on the kennel in MÃ¼lligen that would be most appreciated.

			I am so sorry to answer that late. Thanks for the ideas and everything. By the way I am new to this forum and I have no idea how to write individual replies for the messages. Because of that , just for this time I am replying to all messages with this one message.   
Thank you Terryhall. It is really nice to hear such a nice thing.(""I'm sure between the people here at least one of us is enough of a cat lover to look after him/her for you. "")here is some information about my cat. 
It is neutered female cat.She is 4 years old, she is a house cat. She loves to play games with everyone.Her breed is tiger.   
Dear Patxi ,I check the web- address that you gave. It is a brilliant place ,but today I think it is closed.Tomorrow the first thing I will do is checking the place and see if it is available at Christmas time.   
Dear Celine thanks for the welcome  I know about this funny passport thing. While taking it from Turkey I had to do the same  and I thought the same thing    I think , now the only thing I should do is checking the customs web page. Thanks for the information.

			Burning the mid-night on this informative post meloncollie!   
I'm not a big fan of leads attached to collars, I prefer show/slip leads.I find them easier to use and provide more control of my dogs...well 2 of them anyway.   
We have 3 labs and 2 responded well to a being on a short slip/show lead high on the neck from early on, and now unless the big boy is desperate for a wee (and that's my fault for leaving to long a gap between walks) they are a piece of cake.    
This techqnique failed miserably with the 3rd, and simply resulted in my shoulder being yanked. Also tried the food reward which is normally a banker for a lab....not this time though. So we switched him to a harness.....bingo, the odd 'I'm a 2 year old trying my luck' tug, but other than that great.   
I guess what I'm saying is that what has been mentioned in the other posts is all good, but is it good for you dog? Good clear control from you is the most important thing, try one method if it works great, if not move on to the next, but don't loose patience, don't use a choker chain and don't over correct.

			I had my two cats micro-chipped with Home Again last month - we arrived in Zurich a week ago.  Unfortunately the vet used the old chips that aren't European standard.  What we did do - that other people in a similar situation might find helpful - is borrow a digital scanner to take with us.  The bvet website states non-standard chips are okay if you carry your own scanner.   
There is an organization called Digital Angel that will ship you a scanner free of charge anywhere in the US that you can take with you when you travel.  I just called them and they got it to me within a few days. (800) 328-0118.  You just have to mail the scanner back to them within 30 days.  They take a credit card number in case you don't return it.   
After all that, no one at the airport (on either end) ever asked for any documentation for the cats (we travelled with them in cabin).  Better safe than sorry though.

			Our cat had a urinary tract problem and needed surgery to remove crystals/stones from the bladder.  He was in absolute agony, urinating everywhere and howling in pain so obvious there was a problem.  Did the vet diagnose a medical problem?  If it is behavioural - maybe there have been changes in the household he is not happy about (moving, introducing new cat, baby etc).  Needless to say, whatever the reason, punishing the cat has absolutely no effect ... 
I hope you sort it out - our cat is now on special dry food from the vet. 
Good luck.

Thank you so much for this link! Our dogs arrived in Switzerland on saturday and our Boerboel just suddenly developed a bladder infection this evening. We didn't have a vet yet, so I immediately logged in to Englishforum, knowing that there would be god advice here. Thanks so much for all the valuable posts like these, it really makes me feel less helpless in this strange country.

			Hi Alanbrito,   
hope you dont mind my thoughts/feedback: after reading your situation, I wanted to just add that whatever decision you take regarding the housing of your dog, it would be a good idea to bring your dog to the place she will be staying,  . If it is a private home, that will of course be better, but you would want to show her that you are ""coming back for her"" by leaving her there for 30 minutes. Be sure you actually leave, and dont hide round the corner and come back, as she will be on to you. she will understand that this is a temporary place, and wonÂ´t be traumatized when the longer period begins because she will remember her first experience there. It is better on her stress (therefore appetite, play, sleep, etc) to let her go through the fear of abandonment for a few hours in the first visit, than for the longer period.   
 Good luck!

			Hi, 
I have a small 4,5 month old norwegian cat named Gina (female). I need to give her away because she and my older Tom cat don't get along. 
I am looking for a new home for her in a family with children because she likes to play a lot and she likes children. A garden would be good; she loves to be outside with somebody sitting next to her.

			It might be that I just spend too much time looking at lamposts, but there seems to be suddenly an awful lot of missing cat posters up in Oberwil, Basel. It wouldn't normally turn my head too much but a friend recently told me that when she lived in Allschwil (the next village over), there were spates with lots of missing cat posters there too.  
Is there a cat-napper working their way through the villages of Basel?  Honestly I must have seen ads for at least ten missing cats in the last week.  Local Baslers, watch your moggies!

			Does any one know of good weimaraner breeders in the French-speaking part of Switzerland and the pros and cons of these dogs? I have my heart set on one and have hopefully found a good one just over the border in France who comes recommended but it would be good to have another one as back-up incase his bitch does not fall pregnant.  I gather these dogs might not be bred at all in Switzerland but if anyone has any information that would be helpful. thanks.

			I have very definite ideas as to the best way to care for my own dogs, as do most owners. Some dog owners may agree with me, some might not - I won't get into a debate here between owners, as we presumably know our own dogs' individual characters - and thus their individual needs.    
(Although I'd encourage all dog owners to review the new Tierschutzgesetz , with particular attention to the article on dog ownership and a dog's need for daily social contact...)   
So pax, y'all.    
BUT - anyone offering dog sitting   should be around to interact with the dog most of the day. Afterall, that's why one pays a sitter.  In most cases it would be inappropriate for someone to set him/herself up as a sitter and leave the dog 10 hours.    
Remember, folks - under the new Tierschutzgesetz (discussed in the Federal Dog Control thread...   , the discussion of the latest law starts with post 164) dog sitters  - preliminary definition is anyone who receives money or other compensation, although this is still under discussion - will now be required to complete a course or a series of courses and to adhere to good animal welfare practices. (Again, details for several aspects of the new law are not yet finalized.)   
SO - if you are a dog sitter, or if you use a dog sitter, be aware that the rules are set to change. So keep an eye on the BVet website for details.      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Doggie Boarding/sitter *urgent*	schouiffy	Posts: 2

			The SVPA (SociÃ©tÃ© vaudoise de protection des animaux) is situated by Chalet-Ã -Gobet, direction Moudon.          ""Le meilleur moyen de savoir quels animaux sont disponibles au placement est de tÃ©lÃ©phoner directement au refuge, au 021/784 8002, pendant les horaires d'ouverture, qui sont de 9h. Ã  12h. et de 13h.30 Ã  17h, du lundi au samedi compris. ""   
N.B. You will have to pay for your dog; the amount covers the expenses for the vet, vaccinations, food etc). I think it is between 100.- and 200.- CHF   
Another way is to look in free adds websites (  or scout 24 or anibis or zannonces) or to put an add. But anyone can give or sell any dog. Difficult to know if there is a problem, if the dod has been mistreated etc...

			Dear Loumar,   
my weimaraner, Congo, is not for rehoming. He is extremely sweet but eneregetic, I am just looking for someone to foster him while I go back to Malta to visit my folks or during holiday breaks. So, if you are interested in doing this, I would be glad to keep in touch. He lives with cats at my house, which I am bringing over to Switzerland with me too next month.

			Well we had a very promising opportunity with someone who unfortunately was unable to proceed due to matters beyond their control. We are really upset about this situation and now very concerned that we may not find a solution that is kind to Eva before the 9th.   
We are ideally looking for someone who is a dog owner, doesn't run a commercial operation (and therefore have lots of dogs at a given time) and is at home all day. We are prepared to pay for the right person.   
If that might be you or you know someone who fits the bill please PM me or email at

			Does anyone have any resources for in-home cat sitters in Basel? I will be going on several business trips over the next six months, and will need to have a sitter come in for a week or more at a time - and I refuse to put them into a kennel.

Can anyone recommend a good English speaking vet in Bern, preferably South of the city centre?  We (and our rabbits  ) live in Wabern, 10 minutes from the city.

I've been trying to find this trainer's details for the past couple of days but I seem to have lost them. In February I found her through Google and was really impressed by what I read. Now that I have more time on my hands I thought I'd try to contact her, but she appears to have disappeared from ciberspace. I would love to get in touch with her as I need help with a very ""barky"" little Lhasa who would really benefit from learning to socialize with other dogs.   
He's getting a bit of a handful, lunging, snarling and madly barking at all dogs and small children  .   
If you could help, I would really appreciate it.

			Hi all,   
I will be bringing my dog from Brazil to Zurich and I would like to know if anybody has bought their pet from what they call Third Countries with high risk for rabies. I have read all the information on the FVO page, but I have to say it is very confusing. If anybody has had this experience, please share, also if you know who might help me, that would also be lovely!   
Thank you so much.  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Travelling with pet from Third Country	carolsamel	Posts: 1

			We were advised NOT to give them anything as if something does go wrong they cant do much.  You flying them or on boat?  Boat should be a breeze but the plane maybe a little harder.   
Our cat comes out on Sept 7 and by plane, we are a little scared but apparently they just go quiet after a while.

			Your dog looks a bit like a teddy bear, I'd want to cuddle her too!    
But jokes aside, I'm really glad the mother took a relaxed view and I agree with meloncollie (what a great collection of tips, btw!) on the training, I've seen some amazing improvements done even with older dogs.    
In the interim I'd just tell any approaching kid ""Achtung, sie ist bissig!"" loud enough for the parents to hear - a sort of disclaimer, really.   
Really hope things work out!

			I moved to Walchwil (in Canton Zug) in August 2007 and am delighted at the number of amazing walks in and around the area which are dog friendly. All the walks seem to have doggy bins available and I often come accross other dogs which are being walked off leash. As people have mentioned before one has to be a responsible dog owner as farmers do not take kindly to there livestock being harrassed and in hunting season I tend to stay away from the woods (in Zug I believe hunting days are Monday Wednesday and Saturday). I have a very energetic weimeraner and she loves it here - we walk extensively in the Zugerberg and there are many quieter routes you can find when there are lots of people around. I invariably walk on my own on some very remote paths and always feel safe. The Swiss are generally very friendly and I make sure that if someone is walking without a dog I call mine back so she doesn't bother people who may not like dogs. There are also many beautiful walks that you can drive to - I often go to the Hunenburg river which is a very popular dog walking spot. There really are loads of appropriate places to let you dog off the leash and have a great time - I love it here.

			Oh well I know the feeling... my scamp managed to stage an escape out of the garden and ran into the road... boy I thought my heart would stop!   
The best thing I can suggest is making friends with someone in your neighbourhood who owns a doggy too... I am a crazy dog mum and I'm proud to admit it   so I'm really fussy about who gets to take me dog unsupervised by me.    
As a kid, one of my holiday jobs was taking dogs for a walk for friends of the family, so perhaps you could find a responsible kid? Try posting something up or I think under the jobs section there are already some adverts for that.   
If I lived near you I'd offer to help but...   
My dog is small but boy she thinks shes a big one!

			We have two lovely tuxedo cats (sisters actually) that we unfortunately have to give up because our new apartment does not allow pets. We are hoping we can find a loving home for them in the Zurich area, although we will transport them anywhere within Switzerland. They are about 9 years old and good with kids, low maintenance, spayed, healthy, etc. If you can provide a home for our cats, please PM me.

Our cat is doing OK, turns out what we rushed him to the vet for was no biggie, it was something else making him sick. The vet thinks he has a viral infection in his throat and that's why he wasn't eating. He's been given some pain killers and is on antibiotics - he's on the mend and slowly starting to eat again.

			Our pets are part of the family, and it's nice to be able to talk to a vet who understands what we say, and whom we understand! So, a hint...   
I've found an Australian small animal vet who practices in Basel, just behind the SBB train station (Nauenstrasse 41). It's a great practice with animal physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, shock wave therapy, and also a homeopathic vet. 
The practice is ""Kleintierpraxis Sevogel"", Telephone number: 0613733888.

I had no idea that the OP's cat was not allowed outside the house (she wrote that later on). I thought it was one of those cats that come in and out as they please. Based on the info I had it was quiet possible that cat could have gone long before the fire. Either way my thought was not that outlandish considering the number of cat furs they were cleaning and polishing in the Swiss cat fur news story.   
OP herself had that thought come into her mind. If the OP thought I wished bad things to happen to her cat then I am sorry but I get the impression that the OP was aware of my love for animals and that I really was worried for her cat. It's silly that I am having to type all this crap just to justify a simple post. Are we in court or something?

			Thanks Meloncollie and Mark. That's helpful info there. As far as I'm aware, rabies doesn't exist in Australia and New Zealand (generally dogs and cats leaving NZ do need to be quarantined either) But I guess Hector will need all the necessary vaccines since he'll be in Switzerland a while. That's if he is even allowed to come. My friend's  plans are currently tentative. They will be flying to UK at the same time or just after Hector is put on the plane to Switzerland. Then they will be visiting around Xmas/ New Years to reclaim (possibly very spoiled by the time) Hector whom I will most likely have become very attached to *sniffs*    
I've sent the links to my friend in NZ, and he will be speaking to his Vet tomorrow. Hopefully they will be able to get an application to UK approved. I doubt they will make a move if they can't bring the dog. Unlike me, they have no family in NZ to leave the pet with.    
well... fingers crossed and we'll see how things turn out.

			I visited once to check out the kennels and assess their service.   
*** Disclaimer ****   
This was 7 or 8 years ago.   
I do have an ever so slight tendency to be just the tiniest bit OTT when it comes to my mutts.        
*****   
Their set up, while fine for many dogs, would not have been appropriate for my mad-as-a-box-of-frogs psycho-collie.    
When we visited we first had a chat with someone there (Not the owner, IIRC - I'm not sure who I spoke with...) to discuss my dogs, their needs, their characters and behavior, any problems/issues etc.,  as well as my expectations. I was quite frank about my collie;  the terrors of his past still haunted him, and he needed careful handling. The person I spoke to seemed rather dismissive of my concerns - and that left me feeling uncomfortable.    
In the end, I decided it was not the right solution for my dogs.    
But you really should go and check out the place yourself, talk to the people in charge, talk to the staff, and see if you think it will meet your own dog's needs. I remember once comparing notes with another dog owner who used them, and this person was quite happy.    
---- 
Instead of kennels, I have a dog sitter who moves into our house to care for my dogs while we are away. I've known her for many years now, and she always does a wonderful job with my collection of misfit mutts.   
If you are looking for that kind of solution, I can pass along the contact details.

			Hi there,   
I thought I'd have to post a message here because I'm sure I'll be able to help some of you guys.   
I provide services for pets while people are unavailable (holidays, sick, working hard, disabled, etc.), or even if they want to take a break by having someone walking their dog in the evening for instance ;-)   
Some cats do not cope with being in a cattery; they don't eat much, are agressed by other cats, etc., so the alternative is that I come to your place everyday while you're off and take care of your cat. Check out my website here:    
I also provide pet food for reasonable prices, that I deliver at your place. Finally, I have also clothes and accessories for pets.   
Will be more than happy to provide you more information, just drop me an email.   
Best regards, 
Jennifer

			Hi, my dog is arriving in Switzerland tomorrow and I was hoping someone might be able to recommend a really good vet in Basel. 
Cheers...

			Wow, thank you so much for the thorough response.   
I will look into all of those sites you mentioned, and will try to get a hold of a few of those books too.   
As for the vet, I actually found an English-speaking one near my house. I'm going there today to see if he's any good.    
Thanks again!!

This part of the Bahnhof is about to get renovated & the skullduggers moved on. Doesn't remove the problem, but will put them out of sight ....

2620	09.04.2007, 22:35	Member	Thanked 47 Times in 27 Posts	Location: Vaud	   Thanks for all that information, I was surprised to hear that they have to be pedigree to compete! In Finland X-breeds are very common in Agility and do very well Both our dogs are registered so hopefully we won't have a problem in CH.  Haku is the competitive side to disaster rescue, was initially started as a training exercise for the rescue dogs to teach them to search in a grid pattern rather than relying on following a scent, it is now a competition sport in it's own right, I would have liked to have got involved in the rescue side of things, but a high level of Finnish is required.  We donât do competitive obedience, But Hundehalterbrevet sounds like a combination of the BH and Character tests we do, BH is a test required to be passed by all competing dogs to ensure they are under at least a basic level of control, and include tasks such as being left in stay, walking past other dogs and behavior in traffic, The character test is just that, and is generally taken by dogs who will be used for breeding to ensure they are not too timid, aggressive or have other major character flaws. We will be living in the Lausanne area, and have already tracked down 1 agility club between there and Geneva. We had already found the bearded collie pages, and they seem to have some good activities    	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 3 Times in 2 Posts	Dog activites	sparks1061	Posts: 157

			I think them wanting to give someone with a yard preference over an apartment person is fair. But yes, adopting pets here from shelters can be a bit of a journey.    
Try this shelter:     
I visited them last April and they were really over-flowing. Hopefully that's changed now. Don't go during feeding time either because they are quite under-staffed.

			At present, dog laws vary by canton -The proposed federal law has not yet been passed. Whether it will be enacted in the future, or what the final form will be, is anyone's guess.     
Where are you moving to? For info on each canton's current regulations, see:       
In any case, I believe your Bostons should have no problems. It's the poor 'bull' terriers who have been (unfairly   ) singled out.   
One thing you should consider - have your dogs flown before? Some airlines have special conditions for flying the brachycephalic breeds - you'll want to look into that.   
As for how easy it is to rent... kind of a roll of the dice.    As your dogs are small you are in an easier position than we were. Are you under much of a time constraint with the move?    
With our mutts, temporary housing was not really viable, so I made a trip over to find the house first. The house I chose wasn't going to be ready for another 3 months, so the dogs and I stayed in the US for that time, husband moved into a short term serviced appartment, and we joined him in CH once we had the keys to the house.   
When I was house hunting I was told housing would be a huge problem, but  in hindsight I have come to believe that was simply the relocation agent trying to scare us and squeeze a higher rent/commission out of us. (So stay away from the evil corporate relocation people!    )  Just stress to any potential landlord how well behaved and friendly and quiet your dogs are.     
(You may have to pay a higher deposit - we did - but again, I think that was just our slimeball agent. Our Swiss neighbors, who had dogs and rented from the same landlord, did not have to put down more than the usual deposit.)   
We settled for an old home in a town outside the city, with a large private garden. The house was small, nothing special, rather run-down, and far too expensive for what it was. But it had adequate secure space for the dogs to run and play, located in a dog-friendly neighborhood, with lots of great walks in the area - which was all I really cared about.    
Make sure you have express permission to keep all four of your dogs written into  the lease - this is very important. And, if there is anything else you need to arrange with the landlord - fencing, etc., make sure you have an agreement in writing.   
You will want to consider taking out insurance against any damage the dogs might do to the rental property - as we found out to our cost, this was NOT included in the standard    (private liability) insurance package offered by Winterthur.  We should have taken out a separate damage policy for that.  So make sure your insurer understands your needs.    
(And, stay away from the awful Swiss parquet flooring if you can! Doesn't stand up to the pitter-patter of canine feet, and is very expensive to replace if your landlord insists on it.)   
Good luck with your move.

			No longer are you searching for a religious vet    
For our cats, we've been happy with:   
Kleintierpraxis am Dorfplatz 
Dr. M. Moser 
Dorfplatz 7 
4123 Allschwil 
061 481 60 50   
Dr. Moser speaks English, and there's another female doctor or technician that does, too. They've been very helpful, kind and competent with our cats.    
They're located in Allschwil, but if you don't have a car it is just steps away from the last tram stop on the number 6.

			Rachcalde,   
Did you speak to the cantonal Tierarzt or the Staffy club for confirmation of what is required to bring your staffy in or to keep her in Basel? Please do, so that you get the official word. If I understand the Tier Im Recht synopsis correctly, you can bring her into Switzerland, but Basel 'may' place restrictions on how she is handled in public.    
(If language is a barrier, have your husband's HR people contact the cantonal Tierarzt.)   
Also, do look into living in other cantons.    
I certainly understand your feelings, however - my dogs' welfare is the first consideration in any decision to relocate (or not)... I moved to Switzerland because we could not bring my dogs into the UK pre-PETS.
