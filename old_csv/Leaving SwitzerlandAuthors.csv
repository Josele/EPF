			Hello, all,   
after a good few years in Lausanne, I'm wrapping things up here and moving on to the next adventure. Most of my belongings will get donated, but there are stacks of books and clothes that I want to box and ship overseas (by slow boat is fine). My questions are:   
a) can anyone recommend shipping companies that would handle about a cubic meter or two of books and clothes and a couple of sentimental knick knacks? 
b) where is the best place to get packing boxes / a packing crate around here? 
c) any additional advice on overseas shipping?

			Hi,   
Picking up this thread.   
I've read the documents suggested above (on the ahv website).   
I'm still slightly confused.   
My AHV / OASI / Pillar 1 contributions are about 5% of salary.   
I am a UK national leaving Switzerland and moving to New Zealand. (New Zealand is a non-agreement state). I am 40 years old.   
Pg 48 of that document states:   
""Citizens of non-contracting states who live abroad may apply for, and be 
granted, reimbursement of their OASI contributions without interest, after 
they have definitively left Switzerland. They must have paid contributions 
for at least one full year to be entitled to reimbursement.""   
Question 1. 
Am I eligible to claim these contributions back? (Being a UK passport holder, but emigrating to NZ)   
Question 2. 
Is this a completely different pension / pot of money from my 'Pillar 2' pension, or are they merged together somehow?   
(I know that I can withdraw my pillar 2 pension, but I will be charged withdrawl tax, etc.)   
I know that I can ask the AHV directly, but I just wondered if anyone here had been through the same thing? (EU national leaving to a non-agreement state).   
Cheers

			if your Mrs does have a good job just resign?  from what i have seen it a pain.  you may be able to wing it if you do 6 months for example and are below the 120K threahold which means you do not need to file a tax return.   
keeping up rent and so on, unless you sublet doesnt make much sense i would think.

			Thanks everyone for the information!   
I am currently planning a move at the end of September from Zurich to Seattle. I have been debating whether to just send packages via Swiss post and sell the rest of my things. I only have maximum 10 boxes plus a road bike that I will ship. (I got my bike box from a friend who recently bought one - but I know that bike shops will have extras and you could ask them for one or ask them to hold one for you!)    
I contacted Allied VanLines (US based company) that put me in touch with TeamRelocations here in Switzerland. They quoted me for 15 boxes (2 cubic meters) at 3250CHF with 5-6 weeks door-to-door transport time. I called to confirm this price (which seems super high) and they said that 2 cubic meters was the smallest spot you could buy even if you had less stuff.     
Any suggestions? Does this seem high to anyone else?

I sent a registered letter and then followed up to make sure that there were no issues with the cancellation.   
I was prepared to pay an additional month in case there was some sort of mix up but everything was cancelled as I requested.

			Has anyone else run into this question and what did you do?    
Did you move larger plastic bins or storage containers across the ocean or just replace any you had when you arrived at the new location?    
They seem a strange size and Googling suggests that the plastic containers don't work well as boxes because they break. I know if they are here when the movers arrive they will get packed, so I should decide before ...

			Hi all   
I am currently in the process of using Liberty to transfer my pension from Zurich to Schwyz. We are heading back to UK and we'll be using it on a mortgage in UK once we've found something when we are there. Process looks very simple and the tax is reduced from approx 6% in Zurich down to 2.5% when I have it withdrawn into the mortgage, saving me a little but enough to do the effort. 
There are fees of approx 600chf by Liberty but it's still worthwhile for what I save.

			This link gives additional information.   
I just started exploring the possibilities.   
Next step.     
My Tax consultant provided me the following information.   
According to the Swiss Compensation Office the refund procedure takes approx. 5 months and the amount to be reimbursed does not equal the total contributions paid, but is cut to the discounted expected entitlement for a future pension of a comparable Swiss resident. This might be considerably lower than the amount of contributions paid. Furthermore please be informed that the refund payments will also be made in favor of a foreign bank account abroad in case your Swiss account is already closed.

If they want to donate clothes and the bins are marked as ""for clothes only, collections given to [insert organization]"", they should be able to rely on the clothes getting to the needy rather than ricardo.    
If organizations want to sell clothes and give the money from these sales to the needy, I believe donors should know what they're up against before donating so they can make a choice - after being clearly informed re: the proceeds going to the needy in something like  , which meloncollie's link links to.

			If you are not present when your possessions are exported, then strictly speaking you are meant to do full customs declarations. A letter of authority on it's own isn't acceptable to the French/German customs. The same applies to entering the UK, the HMRC form c3 on it's own is acceptable when you personally import private goods, however if someone else is doing it on your behalf then T forms will be required and this entails using a customs agent.

			Hello,   
We left Versoix in Canton Geneva at the end of July to Belgium and I requested and finally obtained after 5 weeks the 'attestation de dÃ©part' signed by the Geneva canton authorities (OFPM).  Assura now says they need a ""attestation de dÃ©part dÃ©finitif"" in order to cancel the health insurance cover and that in the meantime the contract remains; it looks like they are looking for excuses not to refund me the month of August; I checked the OFPM website again (one cannot call them, they do not answer) but such document does not exist.  Does anyone know what they mean and if this makes sense ? My understanding was my departure is by definition ""final"" as my permit has been canceled now. best regards

As for moving, in case you havenÂ´t found a mover yet, I can recommend Ben Schmidt as he has lots of experience moving from/to the Netherlands.

			Hi all   
We are currently looking into options of moving several boxes from CH to Oxford in September (ideally earlier than later). As it seems to be impossible to hire a van one-way only we were wondering whether someone would actually be looking into making the trip the other way round (UK->CH)? Pooling a car would be simply brilliant!   
Cheers 
Michel

Saint Umzug. Stay far from them as much as you can. Disaster!!!

			Personally, after that demanded signature (yes, do not sign) I wouldn't trust the tenant (your landlord) to repay the deposit. That might mean I might decide to not pay the last two rents, and let him finance that using the deposit, assuming I'm no other money due. That's against the contract, but in a case such as this I'd probably prioritize reducing my own risks, especially if I was to leave the country.   
You may have to pay some Nebenkosten (particularly due to heating) though by additional invoice though:  
The monthly payments are based on total costs over twelve months. During the winter the actual costs are higher than what you pay, the difference is expected to be made up for with the payments during summer. The yearly Abrechnung (account?) usually is calculated as per april or may, if that applies to your case, you pay more than you consume until you leave, meaning you are money owed. That's assuming a fair subrent contract, which may or may not apply to your case. You want to ask the Mieterverband about that as well.

			Remember you want double walled cartons and seriously, get the tape that I mention (Jumbo and maybe other DIY). This tape will make all the difference in the carton arriving intact and still closed. Remember: all around the box and two times each side.

			Hey,   
Swiss here living in New Zealand. We moved 1.5 years ago and will return to Switzerland by the end of the year. 
Here a few tips: 
- bring your furniture and household items (it's ridiculously expensive to buy furniture in NZ, and it really helps to feel ""home"" once you have all your belongings) 
- Make sure you get the timing right for your move (in general it's almost impossible to find work during the summer lump of Dec/Jan/Feb and it's also difficult to find (temporary) accommodation during that time) 
- Sort out partner visa for wife and kids prior to departure (that way you're eligible for health care the day you arrive) 
- steer clear of Auckland ;-)   
Cheers

			I know that Alfa Moving does (or at least) used to do relocations for a big, well-known Swedish company TO Switzerland - I assume they would be happy to have a paying customer for their return trip, too.   
However, having experienced their ""professionalism"" I would not use them again. But maybe it was just the clowns who handled this particular move. Their headoffice had no issues with paying for all the damage caused by their people.

			If you want to save on VAT tax, I would recommend to find a company outside of Switzerland. Any european shipping company would be suitable for that.

Their details are below:

If you can also write German, then Radio Rottu Oberwallis has a free website  ""O-Bei"" where you can register free and then place your advertisements. You are not that far from Oberwallis, so it might be a good idea to advertise there. We have had good luck with them [collected a beautiful free table and chairs last week], but our major success has been with Ricardo, whom others have already mentioned. 
Alternatively, over this [poor] side of the Lake{!} we have another free website Leboncoin which is also free to register and advertise. Let me know if you need further help

			No, but the new country if it's in europe they will take it and send it back or destroy it and notify the country of origin. If outside europe you probably get to keep it but shouldn't use it after the grace period (12 months usually, may vary by country). 
If you're going to live outside EU getting the international driving permit might help expedite things maybe so i would also do that, it's like a translation and costs only 40 chf.

			Over 5 years you do not need to repaint (usually).  A white magic eraser sponge does wonders for marks on your walls to maybe avoid repainting.   
Cleaning company costs can vary, but you get what you pay for.  Make sure you get one that offers a guarantee - that you will receive your deposit back.  We paid $1100 for a 3 bedroom.     
Also, budgeting for the move.  Our mover quoted us 8 hours with a ceiling cap of 10.  Lucky we had that because they took well over 12.  How they estimated 8 hours is beyond me (I even told him I thought that was too little but he insisted).  And don't get too cheap a mover.  I did that the first time moving from one building to the next...they weren't careful with our goods.   
Also the last move with the more reputable movers, they tried to get us to pay more for 'heavy items', but that was bollacks.  We stood our ground and just offered them a tip since they had been sweating it out for almost 14 hours.   
There are some websites in Switzerland where you submit your info once and get a quote from 3 or more movers.  They can vary widely in price.

			I think we are all making a mountain out of a small hill.    
The transport of personal belongings is usually completely tax free. You might have a problem if you buy large amounts of expensive stuff and then take brand new items across borders. Customs officers are only looking for items that can be sold, and they will then charge the sales tax.    
Most borders in Europe have nobody about these days, you have to drive around looking for an office to declare your stuff.

			whichever company you choose make sure you read their reviews on the website because some of these shipping agents are slicker than snake oil salesmen! Yelp    
Schumacher Cargo Logistics has a lot of bad reviews with tricky billing where they will hold your good until you pay more at the end of the shipping rpocess.

If you don't read all of this review then just take this: AVOID. I promise you will regret using them.  
My move was NYC-UK this summer.  
There are three issues I have with this company:   
1) They overcharged me by over 200 cubic feet! The Schumacher volume was completely different from the Britannia volume. Britannia re-measured the consignment when it arrived in the UK. To Schumacher's credit they have agreed to refund me. Yet we are 15 days later and I have not received a refund. As you will find out if you use them, they will not lift a finger until you make full payment. Why then, when they have overcharged me by over 50% am I made to wait so long? I have important bills to pay and I'm left at their mercy. It shows the complete and utter disregard they hold their customers in. READ ALL FORMS AND CROSS CHECK LIKE A HAWK! I highly doubt this was done in error.    
2) They managed to lose a load of sofa cushions, rendering my couch unusable. OK, things get lost I get that. But you try getting a straight answer out of this bunch. I got a load of finger pointing from both Schumacher and Britannia. I mean this went on and on. Luckily I have insurance but what a pain it is to go through. No doubt the brokerage firm they use are just as incompetent. They, too will probably come up with some excuse not to honour their contract.    
3) They never sent me all the insurance documents I needed to make a claim. The brokerage firm make reference to a whole host of forms I should have received. Schumacher never bothered to send them to me. All I received was a certificate confirming I was covered. Perhaps I should be grateful to have received at least that.     
This is no exaggeration: I have been emailing back and forth with them on a daily basis for months. It is utterly ridiculous. I just want my refund so I can move on. Never, ever again.

Marcel P. 
Manhattan, United States 
 4/2/2016 
The worse company I have interacted with in the 25+ years that I have lived in the US. Unresponsive, totally unreliable, numerous mistakes, misinformation, incredible incompetence, sheer irresponsibility. Among numerous other mistakes, they managed to misplace my documents for more than 10 days without even noticing that they were missing. It is only after I repeatedly inquired about the documents' whereabouts that they found them stuck ""between some other documents"" (actual text from their email). Then when repeatedly reminded and urged (over several days) to send the documents over immediately so that my car could be received on the other end---and repeatedly assuring me that they would do so---they again failed to send the documents over, causing further delays and making me miss the pickup deadline. (This time they tried to blame FedEx, when it was clearly their mistake!). I could go on and on... It's almost as if they were intentionally trying  to make me miss my deadlines. End result: Because of the missed deadlines, I estimate that their repeated mistakes have cost me somewhere around $400, not including about two full days of lost work time trying to make up for their mistakes -- this on two shipments that should have cost me about $1,200 each. You do the math on whether Schumacher is good value. On my shipments I also had a chance to compare them with the various partners that they use in completing the total logistic chain (vehicle receivers, actual ship company, partner agents). Schumacher was by far the worse link in the total chain. Since such a chain is only as good as its weakest link, they effectively managed to ruin the entire chain for all their partners.  (PS: I have documents to support everything in this review.)

In case you drive your goods by your own truck out of Switzerland you can prepare your own proforma-Invoice and packing list. At border crossing you hold.... Moving to one of 100s of Export Broker at Border Crossing in Geneva (drivers moving up and down).  They mostly do it the right way and will make for you the T1 or T2 document to Spain, England or what ever too. Than You do drive to England or Spain and you do close the T1 or T2 in England or Spain by Import Broker again.   
In case ypu want to give all the shipping companies the best is to give it companies like ""peyer umzÃ¼ge"" etc.

			Geneva is very special when it concerns administration. I would visit the tax office and ask for the certificate.    
They will ask you to complete the tax return form for the year 2015. You work for 2 hours, then give them the completed form, and they say come back next month as they need time to evaluate the information. You tell them you are leaving this week, and they then stamp your leaving form.    
Good luck, you'll need it!

Movecorp did send 2 of the missing items as promised by 
TNT. 
They have offered to pay for the glass which is fine by us. 
In any move there will be casualties. We wish there were  
none, but its out of our control. 
I would still use them in the future but do not want to move 
like that again for at least 5yrs.

Once you deregister you effectively revert to tourist status if you don't need a tourist visa to be here.  That's another reason why the document from the Ticino office will be useful.  If you do decide to go back to Brazil and get queried on your length of time here you can show the document which proves you were resident in Switzerland.  Your ""new"" 3 month tourist period would start from the deregistration date.  This is important because an overstay as a tourist could result in you getting a fine, a record on your file and possibly even a ban from entering the Schengen Area for 1-3 years depending on how serious the relevant authorities consider the offence to be.       
That's not likely to happen to you providing you make sure you leave Spain, assuming your job offer isn't approved, before the 3 month period.  Hopefully, you're going to get that job though.

			Hi, I got a reply and it's looking good    
It is possible, but only for three months before leaving CH.   
Permission is called 15.30, costs 25CHF and they will grant it directly at customs when entering CH. They will need proof that you are leaving, e.g. job or rental contract.   
I haven't tried it, yet. But that's the official answer from the Swiss customs (EZV).

			Stop reading/watching (swiss) news if it really annoys you. I know people that live in their own world, don't know jack shit about politics or about what's going on outside of their world and are happy like that. 
In germany with pegida, kÃ¶ln, merkel, syrians and being a destination country, they discuss it more than in switzerland most likely. 
In general it seems to me like a bad reason to move.

The only reason I advise people new to London (like OP, who are relatively young w/o kids) to stay somewhere semi-central is that it gives you more time to 'do stuff' without the hassle of travelling in and out of the boonies, and not spending more time commuting than you'd like.

			Hi there,   
Can anyone share the solution they found to this issue? I'm about to run into the same administrative vortex of doom.   
It seems absurd to me that you have to give the tax office proof of future income, which obviously no employer will issue ahead of time. If you're due a bonus, you might not even have an approximation as to what you're going to get paid.   
Or do they think that everyone about to leave the country gives up their flat and just waits around for a month or so, whilst tying up administrative loose ends...   
Presumably if you declare more-or-less what you will have earnt and deducted upto your date of departure, based on previous months/years they have the common sense to just let it go? Or do you then have to do yet another tax declaration after you've left, to clean up the balance?   
Also, any idea what happens if you don't respect the 3-week deadline? If you've been paying your monthly taxes, it's not like they can accuse you of being in arrears.   
Reminds me of Hotel California... ""You can check out any time you like, but you may never leave.""

			We used MoveCorp when we came here.    
Not the most pleasant experience - although they were by far the cheapest.   
UK side was fine - it was the rest. Apparently the truck broke down so our stuff was 3 weeks late. Then because the other truck was huge it couldn't fit down our road so their solution was ""we'll leave your stuff in our Basel warehouse and you can sort yourself out for getting everything to your house on your own expense. Oh, and we'll be be charging you storage too"".   
After lots of calls to rather nasty customer services I eventually told them to keep all our stuff and we'll claim on insurance. Suddenly a truck turned up next day.    
The unpacking crew on the Swiss side were very nice though.    
I guess you get what you pay for. I should point out, this was 3 years ago, so maybe things have improved...

			Well, deregistering for the 29th Feb shouldn't be a problem, but your cantonal tax office will need an address in case you owe any outstanding tax or are due a refund.  As you're not likely to find out one way or the other by the end of March it'll have to be a UK address.

I get 30kg with Singapore Airlines and intend to use it (unfortunately buying any extra weight would seem to be excessively expensive). Anything I can't bring over reasonably one way or another, I will leave.      Indeed! Am from the UK originally, so this is quite convenient.      Thanks, I've long loved the region and am looking forward to working there. The gaming is just for the occasional moment the heat gets too much and I wanna hide away in an air conditioned room. ;-)

			Normally when it is shared it is sectioned off after each customer has loaded their items and kind of sealed. There will be a customs broker that will see to the paperwork of each section.   
Alot of containers are shared by complete strangers Wetherby they know the people or not. Having the correct paperwork sorts it all out. And even when there is smuggling, they don't penalise sections that have separate paperwork.

			Hi - very interesting to read. It would be great to hear more about the customs situation when going into Germany (where it was in your case @ZwergliofOz for example). Has anyone declared the goods / personal belonging upon entry? We are planning to ship quite a bit of stuff (not just a single parcel) from Germany and I haven't yet figured out how to deal with customs.

			Next Tuesday? Ouch. Can't you find someone who will drive to the UK with you, taking the Tunnel so you can all stay with the dog in the car- allowing plenty of time for the pre-check at the office just at the entrance- and making sure you dog is checked, wormed by the Vet (not you) and chip checked and the passport signed by the vet- no more than 48 hrs before crossing and no less than 24. It would be a lot cheaper and much less stressful for the dog, and all of you too.

			Hi blizard, and thanks for the reply, it clarifies quite a few things. With a swiss passport you won't have much trouble moving between the two countries.   
If you want to do more training in UK then I guess a good move would be to start looking towards some of the larger cities/education centres to look for a college-level (A-level?) or university-level course in the field to take for one/more years, depending on where you can start. If London is out of the question, you won't do bad with other places like Manchester, Edinburgh, York, Newcastle, Norwich... and then many more smaller ones... The best route would be to find the institution/course to get into and then move in the area.   
I would not sweat too much about choosing the first place to land as an absolute best - in UK there is a lot more flexibility in terms of moving home/moving jobs, it's just a lot easier to move after 6 months if you find a better place and got an idea of what works for you there.   
I'm not sure I would qualify the UK as ""dire"" for people with children.... Sbrinz, care to elaborate?

			You can cash out your 2nd pillar when you emigrate or buy a house (there are some threads that explain this here on EF have a look at them, what the 3rd pillar insurer told you is really fishy). 
For the 3rd pillar, read the contract, but you have to pay the taxes you didn't pay by putting money in it so that's one thing, then i don't know if and what the insurer adds on it. The broker should tell you the break down of the costs.   
2k of taxes for one year doesn't mean much not knowing your salary. i put a similar profile in comparis with 80k per year of  income (so deduction already accounted for) and it gave 10k taxi, have a go at it:  
the fact that you have two children doesn't mean you pay less taxes, but you receive them back as money, it's a form of income redistribution.

			As you have so many nationalities to call on, I'd try those countries first if you can actually get a passport to allow you entry easily.   
As for America and childhood holidays, well yeah sure, it's going to seem big and exciting.  But the reality, as when you move to anywhere else, is always different.  And as a personal assistant I can't see you being able to get a visa to be able to work there anyway.     
I don't see why you can't express yourself artistically here, are you planning to do something illegal?

			I have left Switzerland permanently, and am in the process of obtaining my 3rd pillar money to pay off my UK mortgage. All is going well. The money will be subject to a small withholding tax in Switzerland, of course, but... is it then subject to income tax in the UK as well? i.e. do I have to declare it in a UK tax return, or is it consider to be already taxed?

			I moved from Sthlm to ZÃ¼rich after a few years in the Swedish capital. I looked at different options, and in the end, I discovered/concluded that the easiest option by far was to use the simple snail mail office. I mailed myself from Sthlm to ZÃ¼rich a total of 10 banana boxes, carrying clothing, books, kitchen appliances etc - the usual stuff you would imagine that is collected during a few years somewhere. Each box cost me approximately 700 SEK, which multiplied by 10 made around 7000 SEK - this was still cheaper than any transport companies I talked to at the time.    
I had some furniture as well, but that one I decided to drive myself by car a few months later.

			We are going to send our first test box this week. We ordered (rather expensive) boxes from packshop.ch, at least the service was really good. We will ship thru the post -- max price is CHF 164 for 30kg. It is most economical between 20-30kg. There is no point in shipping 21kg -- either ship in each box 19.9kg, 24.9kg, or 29.9kg. So, keep some heavy stuff around until the end etc   
Re: customs in canada, you will pay a fortune in tax and duty unless you fill out the B4 customs form and specifically get it stamped when you enter canada. 
What I don't know yet, and what I need to figure out this week, is how it works if the boxes arrive before you arrive in Canada (which is our plan)   
hope this helps

			u need to also sort out ur taxes first.  what I did.. pay them extra for 2015 taxes.  give the gemeinde tax office POA form from accountant.  go to de-register and they print out a form which i take to the tax office next door to stamp that I am cleared on taxes.  then they do the de-register.  I paid 30chf for certificate of de-register which I can give to insurance etc to get refunds.

			This article and the questions and answers might help your friend to better understand having his pillar III pension paid out and then returning to Switzerland:       
According to this question and answer, there is no requirement to repay pension funds taken out at emigration if the emigrant decides to return to Switzerland:

			Pillar 2 will normally automatically get transferred to a ""FreizÃ¼gigkeitskonto"" on termination of employment unless it is possible to arrange something else with your pension fund. There are considerations about opening the free access account in Kanton Schwyz rather than in ZÃ¼rich to lower the Swiss tax liability, but I am not sure how your US tax liability affects what the Swiss take on getting the pension fund paid out

			I tried reading through some threads but haven't seen anything addressing my specific situation so I thought I'd ask here.   
I am currently a US citizen on a type B permit that expires on August 22.  My work contract however ends on August 31, and my apartment handover date is August 24 (which cannot be moved).  I know I have to extend my permit (which is annoying since apparently I need to pay the full 102 CHF) until the end of the month, however the problem as described by the person at the Kreisburo is that they don't think I can extend my permit beyond the 24th since I will be vacating my address on that date.  My plan was to stay in a hotel for that week and then move the rest of my things up to Germany on that weekend (Aug 28 or 29).     
It further confused me because she said even if I wanted to move to Germany on the 24th, I couldn't re-enter Switzerland at a later date even as a tourist without going back to the US and getting a new entry visa.  This doesn't seem right at all to me - I know some US citizens that live in Germany that were able to enter and stay in Switzerland as tourists with just their passports.   
Does anyone have any thoughts that could shed some light on this?  I am very confused about the visa stuff and it would pose a huge problem if what she said was correct - in the second week of September I need to be in Zermatt for a work conference (attending as an affiliate of my new job in Germany).  Going back to the US would be costly and with how little of a gap there is between my old and new jobs, it would be a huge problem.  It doesn't seem like they check your passport for a visa much on the trains between Switzerland and Germany but I'm worried I'm going to be rejected by the hotel and deported or something.   
Thanks to anyone that can help.

			Check with your commune/gemeinde about how early you can notify them, but it should be easy enough to do.  Say you go in on the 15th of the month and inform them you want to deregister on the 30th.  They'll sort out the paperwork using that date and then give you a letter/document to that effect that you can use to cancel your contracts.     
You do need to make sure you give due notice by registered letter too don't forget.  If your contract/s need a month's/3 months' notice then send the letter/s on time and follow that up with a copy of the deregistration document once you have that.

			You need to assume for swiss authorities to turn   nosy if you exchanged your swiss license while gone inofficially.   
One thing you definitely want to take a very close look at are health  and accident insurance, whether you leave in/officially or not, and whether you leave for 3 or 9 months - will you and your  two kids be covered underway and abroad? To what extent, and for how long?   
Since you go back to Ireland for work, it may mean that the alternative would be to receive unemployment benefits in Switzerland, or some other form of social security payments. That would probably mean for the government to welcome your temporary move, which in turn may create wiggle room and willingness to temporarily look the other way.   
I would tend to make this official, if doable. Because, shit does happen  and if it does while you're on the wrong end you may end up in a whole  world of pain, and then some.

			Hi,   
I have read a few previous posts on removal companies but wanted to get some up to date opinions on them.   
I will be moving from Zurich area (Erlenbach) to London area (Reigate) this September. It would be great to have people's experience of removal companies (Swiss and British). Also, any advice about what to be aware of when dealing with them.    
I have had quotes from Movecorp and Luker Bros. The Movecorp quote is cheaper but I have a slight reservation that the cubic size they quoted for is much lower that it actually will be. Any experience of companies quoting low to get the business but then later advising the actual cubic size is much higher when they have loaded the truck?   
Thanks for all your help.

			hi, did you try asking the insurance company if they can accomodate? Meaning if the handover can be done in their presence and the cheque will be handed accordingly? OR the date of cancellation is atleast on the same day as you catch your flight?   
Also, any tips on how you got the insurance covered? Did you provide any evidence?

			hi, did you try any of the companies in INDIA itself? I wouls suggest to ask them once. They have tie-up with international couriers. They may charge you in INR as well (depends though). 
I am also going to face the similar situation soon and will follow the same.   
Another option is getting extra luggage booked, as moggy has mentioned, through your airlines. This may work out cheaper, though the stuffs you are moving also matters.

			This may be old, but this may help others:   
Cross the border and ship from Germany to other EU countries with DHL. It's almost half the price and no customs once you cross. Also it's a lot cheaper to ship to North America.   
Using Swiss post is expensive, you can use your own boxes so long as they stay within 100x60x60cm Just be sure that you fill out the forms they give you at the post office correctly. They're happy to give you the forms you need in advance so you can fill them out at home.   
Be sure to fill out the customs forms in the destination's language!   
TIP: Postage time, generally priority is on time, maybe 1-2 days late, but I find Economy is often double the quoted time. it says 8-12 days to Canada...often it takes around 20 days to arrive.

			As far as Switzerland is concerned, residence is of the wage earner and based on where they spend most of their days.  Some countries, such as Germany, use a sort of ""center of gravity"" argument to attempt to collect tax, but this is usually when someone leaves Germany to work and their family remains behind in an owned property.     
I suggest you look at the residence threshold for the country you will be traveling to each weekend as they may want the difference between Swiss tax and their tax rate if you are deemed to be there too many days in a year.  Be aware that some countries consider the day you arrive and leave as a full-day in country, so arriving Friday night and leaving early Monday morning may count as 4 days by their rules and you'll find yourself owing some tax.  Have a look or consult a tax professional in the other country...money well spent.

In general, transfers from CS will cost more than from Postfinance. Perhaps have a trial transfer done (and small amount will do) to make sure you have everything in place, and if it works well you send the full amount, instructing Postfinance to use the instructions used in the previous transfer. If the first (test) transfer bounces the damage should be small/negligible.

			Somewhere in my in basket I have the forms form both 1st pillar (AHV) and 2nd pillar (employer) to totally withdraw the pension, and the 2nd pillar has said how much. 
The rule is roughly, that if you are going / returning  to a non EU country you can get a full refund of your dosh. If you are going (or tell them you are going) to an EU country then your pension has to be kept as a  pension till 65 or whatever. 
So, tell them you are returning to Turkey. Me, I'm going to Oz...  
if you don't understand the forms, walk into the respective office and chat to them, they'll help, in English generally but sometimes only German.

			So I checked with my bank (kantonal).     
If you are a US citizen (only), according to this bank, you have to close your bank account when you leave - meaning giving up your residency. She didn't state it as a law, but claimed it was the banks policy.     
but as fatmanfilms mentioned, they have no way of knowing you left, they expect you to inform them.     
therefore you could keep your bank account open as long as they don't find out you have left. The bank teller mentioned that they usually find out when they try to mail tax information and its returned to sender because the address is no longer valid.     
In any event, I told her I only needed it open for a few months after I leave, to receive some payments from my company and apartment deposit etc. She said that if that was the case, I should just notify them via online banking message once those transactions have been completed. Once they are notified they will close my account and transfer the contents to an account I specify in the US at a cost of 4 CHF.

			Hi all,   
I am planning my move to London from Lausanne, to happen at the very end of July (precise date to be decided but in any case after the 28th). I am leaving all my furniture behind so it's just a few large boxes and suitcases. I have been looking into van rental options but it seems that one-way rentals from Switzerland are very costly if not impossible. Would anyone be interested in teaming up for this? Examples: I could return a van from Switzerland to London, or people could return my van from London to Switzerland once my move is complete.   
Any thoughts? Thanks in advance for all replies.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2015	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Moving to London from Lausanne	pandapupa	Posts: 3	1,198	0	Leaving Switzerland

			Can confirm simpa.   
-Prepare a list with all your items (not too detailed--> so many boxes with books, so many with laundry, matress, bed, kitchenstuff, wife) with roughly estimated values (in euros) 
-Copy of swiss ""AbmeldebestÃ¤tigung"" 
-Copy of a confirmation of your new ""Wohnsitz"" (eg Mietvertrag) 
-Copy of id/passport may help    
the germans are not interested in the fact if you have paid all your taxes but the swiss will be   bear inmind that the swiss can AND will block your bankaccount if you haven t   
Beware: you have one year to change your drivers license in germany.

			Hi all, after some research, I think the best option is to ship using DHL Paket International service across the border in Germany. A box with max weight of 31.5kg (max dimension 120cm x 60cm x 60cm) rate is EUR124.99. It's a good deal  . Swiss Post in Switzerland offers the same service at CHF204 for same weight.     
A relocation company suggested the option of using the service of Intrapass at Zurich airport. However it is only possible if one has friends to help carry all the extra luggage /boxes. I will not be able to handle the extra boxes other than my check-in luggage(s) from Basel to Zurich     
Cheers, 
Felicia

			No, you may not simply ignore it, because schooling is compulsory.  The authorities take swift and determined steps against parents who do not send their children to school.   
I suggest you write a registered letter (no phoning, no emails) to the authority which has sent you the notice, explaining that you intend to leave Switzerland in July.  You can probably prevent a lot of trouble for yourself by including a sentence: 
""Should our plans unexpectedly change, such that we stay in Switzerland after all, I will, of course, report to you immediately.""  That way, they'll know that you will/would fulfil your legal requirements.

			One more thing: Your rent contract has been signed by both of you.    
A car may need attention too, if you have one.    
It's probably a good idea to ask your Gemeinde (Einwohnerkontrolle? Zivilstandsamt?) for things to consider, in all likelihood you're not the first to have that happen to so they may have some kind of checklist.

238	13.04.2015, 17:13	Forum Veteran	Thanked 3,969 Times in 1,575 Posts	Location: Formerly in Neuchatel	"    My ideal scenario would be selling the car on in all honesty. I'm waiting for the garage to tell me what price they'd be willing to part with it for. If I think it's reasonable I will have a jolly good stab at selling it.    
That way I don't have to faff around with paying excess mileage and for the minor damage that happens to all cars over about 3 years.    
Paying 500CHF and getting nothing in return (bar getting out of a contract) doesn't sit well with my Scottish sensibilities. I'd rather burn the cash than give it to Ford for the pleasure of taking their car back.

In this case i would advise getting additional travel insurance ( annual cover is pretty cheap) to cover her and tge kids for any non energency treatment they may need when visiting Switzerland as it soubds as though there will be regukar visits.   
Good luckto the OP in this exciting chapter of your life. I would recommend sorting accomodation out ASAP so that you can register the kids for school. As others have said there is a shortage of places in some areas and it might not be very easy to get a place where you want.

Is anyone planning on driving back to the UK in the next months?   
I've agreed to adopt 2 cats from a friend in Zurich, CH but live in the UK and I'm looking to find someone who is driving that way in the next months who could bring them back to me.   
Of course I will pay a fee, which will help towards your trip costs, all documents and UK DEFRA requirements will be taken care of before hand, the cats can be taken to you anywhere in CH or surrounding area and I will meet you at Dover or landing port of your choice to get the cats.   
PM me or offer suggestions to help get them back for a reasonable cost.

			I have yet to get into the minutae posted by Weejeem, and will post on my experience in Glasgow if it comes to that.  Essentially, after being quoted between Â£750.0  and Â£1500.00 for a few boxes a 12 inch Tv and some clothes, I decided to buy a Fiat Brava for CHF 300.00 the dealer organised export plates for the middle of the month for two weeks and insurance for CHF200.00.  I paid Chf 150.00 for the equivalent of AA or Rac covering myself and any car I am driving for a year... so CHF650 plus CHF max 400 in petrol   
CHF 1000 Zurich to Glasgow, I may or may not be able to import and use the car, but even if I scrap it after 2 weeks I am ahead.  I have 4 or 5 boxes, small stereo Tv, couple of laptops etc, and shipping alone  was between CHF750 and CHF 1500.  Then I would have to fly or get a train, minimum CHF400.   
Anyway, if anyone is moving to Switzerland, and wants a car contact me... msolarcayman at gma x l. cxm or call Swiss Cell. 0788 939 180  or (I leave Mon 16th March 2015) so UK phone will be on next week 044 (0) 782 548 5477.

When the moving is already such a stress it is nice to know that we can at least count on his service. Our Ãbergabe went not only smoothly but they were impressed with the job he has done.

			Hello folks! Anyone making the move from Switzerland to London in February? I would be interested in sharing a moving van. I don't have much (about four large suitcases about 30 kg each).    
Also considering shipping my stuff with a third party - are there any independent businesses that anyone could recommend?     
Would be very grateful for any advice!!   
Thanks

			Thanks for your advise.   
Interesting note: 
I live and pay taxes in Basel 
My work location in Aargau 
My employer located in Zurich   
At the end, Aargau was the kanton that created the PD U1. They will send by post to my address in Sweden.   
I hope this information is useful.    
Cheers!

			As Sbrinz said, since this is a private road you want to talk to the landlord. The less effort required by him the more likely he're to agree to what you propose, so I'd offer to inform the people in your building (where you just put up a post in advance[the earlier the better], say when there'll be a van, the road may be partially blocked [or whatever applies] and to please excuse the inconvenience)   
Additionally, if it's a big van you may need to make sure access to the private road is available, ask the moving company what they need. For this case you may also need the police, e.g. to have them put up no-parking signs on the public road leading to your private road.

Interdean was okay, but price quite high... Crown Relo the best on service, but crazy prices,... and then best on price Reloswiss... but service so so...

			The join liability is given but the purchase contract will usually protect the  buyer from non-payment of the gains tax.   
What might be interesting if whether they allow you to deregister before it's calculated and paid. From experience, you get a first bill and then supply evidence to reduce it. I would liaise with an accountant and maybe think about some POA contract for this if you want to leave in a hurry.

			A ""No win no fee"" agreement with a lawyer is forbidden in Switzerland. It's only allowed to offer a ""percentage of recovered funds"" as a bonus, but not to the exclusion of the lawyer's  regular fees.   
This rule has some negative facets, i.e. valid cases not brought for fear of the costs, but on the positive side it does suppress a lot of spurious cases and keeps the legal system free of ambulance chasers.

			It makes good sense to have an inventory list & letter. I travelled with my own stuff so I don't know what would happen with someone's stuff in the van. I had no troubles & no questions from CH/FR customs. The UK customs asked what was in the van but they only wanted a short answer.

			In our case, we were told to get in touch directly with the local Werkhof for our gemeinde (Arlesheim, in our case):       
They are responsible for ""Ausleihe von Parkverbotssignalen bei UmzÃ¼gen"", which is ""loaning of parking prohibition signs for moving days"" to you and me.   
We told them the dates that we were moving and which street we needed blocked, and they told us to come collect the cones the night before the move and return them the next evening, after the move.     
It was all very straight-forward -- I turned up the night before and found the cones waiting for me in front of the Werkhof, clearly labelled with my name and the applicable date.  Took them to the house, blocked the street, and dropped them off the following day after the move.  Easy peasy.

			Hi all,     
We are in same boat... making a permanent move back to Canada.  we hemmed and hawed over cost of shipping our things. Basically, every route we looked at ended up being too expensive to just ship clothes.       
We are also considering bringing extra lugage when we fly as this has seemed to be the cheapest option, with 4 Kids, we have a lot of possibilty for extra bags.  That being said, if anyone has a good option for other shipping, please let us know!  (For example, from Toronto, we were able to ship ""Barrels"" all over the world on freight ships for comparatively little). Not sure if this is possible here...     
Good luck!

When you get a quote from whoever, compare it to the price of an additional bags you would have on a normal flight. For example, if you are flying SWISS one extra bag (23 kg) to India costs, at the moment, 180 CHF,  .   
So if you get a quote which is more expensive than that for the same weight, maybe you want to think of taking extra bags on your flight.   
Best

			It depends on where you're moving to.  If back to the States then yes I expect so, but if you're moving to an EU country some of it may need to be held in a vested benefits account here until you reach retirement age.  Which could be problematic to set up given your American citizenship.   
On timing, again talk to your pension provider.  Only they can tell you how quickly they can deal with it.

287	29.11.2014, 08:45	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: zurich	"    Best thing is to check with the tax folks at Canton Vaud how they want to handle this.    
When I deregistered in Zurich in 2012, they would not let me deregister until my tax situation was cleared, meaning:. a particular tax year had been closed or, for the open years, I had communicated the name of a tax preparer/accountant - treuhander - to which I had given Power of Attorney. With the PoA, all communication is handled between the tax authorities and the treuhander, so if there are taxes due or a refund to you, he/she will let you know and will have your correct information. It is of course your responsibility to ensure that your treuhander knows where to contact you.   
Per the above, I had no issues settling all my stuff even after I had left Switzerland and closed my Swiss bank accounts. Just as a word of caution, it can take some time - my last open tax year in Switzlerland was 2012, and I did not receive the final assessment from the Zurich tax authorities until well into 2014. It appears that several people in different cantons have had similar experiences with waiting times.

			I can only advise from the point of view of working for large corporations with offices in many countries, and the rule they always apply is that as soon as you move country they will cancel your existing employment contract, and give you a brand new contract from their registered office in the new country. If you move voluntarily, they'll reduce you down to a local salary too (if applicable).

			It's always worth checking out the local post office fees for these sort of things.  If you don't need stuff in a hurry they can be the best value.  We found that on a holiday to the US some years ago.  We wanted to ship back some stuff we'd bought, but didn't need immediately so checked with the US Post, Fedex and UPS for their economy service.  US Post was the cheapest by $100 because both Fedex and UPS would simply take the parcels down to the postal service anyway.  Parcels on economy wouldn't arrive for 4 to 6 weeks, but that was fine for us because we'd be home long before they were due to arrive.  We sent back 3 parcels in all.

			Hi Medea, 
Please dont confuse the OP. never the gemainde said that their permits will be cancelled if they stay outside switzerland for more than 3 months. 
Dear OP, 
i think this may be new controls they have introduced recently. but what is your problem to follow the guidelines from the gemainde. just inform them when your dependents are leaving and again inform them when they are back. 
regarding the health insurance, it is mandatory as long as somebody has a resident permit he. so u have to pay health insurance for all the months they are away. 
regarding school holidays, you will have to check with the school. 
it is rather strict here that schools normally do not allow children to take special holidays apart from the regular holidays.   
Cheers 
Happycreature

			I should have been more clear with my post. What I meant is, you go to the French Postal service. La Poste, and ship it from there. And the company that does the official international carrying of it is DHL, or again, they will tell you. And the box, it is a decent sized boy, which you are allowed to put basically as much as you can fit in, until to 7 kilos. It's the best rate anywhere really.      
And in comparison, from the US to the EU, anything over 2 pounds becomes astronomical.

			Right, I am aware of that, thank you.   
Since I am moving to UK I cannot cash out the whole thing, only the non-mandatory part. This is exactly what my pension provider told me. However if you buy a property, it's not quite the same as cashing out. So it is possible to take everything (in my case just below 20k CHF). The property comes with conditions. First of all you have to provide papers to prove that you are actually buying one. Then it has to be for your private use - it's not even possible to rent it out. Finally, if you sell the property and fail to buy another one in 2 years time (again with same restrictions - only for yourself as your residence), you have to return all the money back to your vested benefit account. It would be difficult for the Swiss authorities to monitor your property abroad, but in theory you have to do it.   
My point is that my pension provider (publica) told me it would be possible to cash out everything from vested benefit account (even though the minimum payment is fixed at 20K for those buying a property in Switzerland). But as I mention in the first post, different vested benefit account providers (usually banks) behave differently.   
My worst fear is that I kick-start the whole process in the UK, it arrives to the point of a legally binding contract between me and the seller, and then Postfinance says NO. Where do I quickly get 20K CHF in this case  ?   
So I was hopping that someone has had some experience with Postfinance on cashing out less than 20K of pension money for buying a property abroad.

			This reply is a bit late, but as I found this thread via google a few days ago, I guess more information is still better.   
You have to go to the police office in your area, and there you can reserve parking. They charged me CHF 107, which is for one day. The police will put signs indicating that people should not park there on that specific day a week in advance, and if someone still parks there on the day of moving, you can call the police to have the vehicle removed.

			Good Afternoon everybody, 
I've read some threads about leaving Swiss and people talking about transport and etc but somehow it didn't really helped.   
My parents are moving to Spain this Autumn and they need to transport some things ( some of them are big things, but mostly boxes with lots and lots of stuff ) and they cannot find a good and cheaper way to get them there.   
I've contacted British Bradshaw today, I've read here that people were very satisfied with them but unfortunately they are not going to Spain that often and cannot help us.   
Do you know any other good transporting/moving companies that could help?

			I booked a cleaning company a few weeks ago and I just wrote to them yesterday to confirm they're coming and asked them what time they're coming and approx. how long they would need.   
They said to just leave the key in the parcel box (?) and they would leave it there when they leave.   
I feel a bit uncomfortable not even meeting or seeing these people! I will make sure I'm here in the morning to hand them the key (definitely not leaving it where anyone could get to it!) But is it OK to not see them after they're done? I thought that I would be able to check what they've done against the list they sent me but I guess that will be sorted during the handover the next day. It is not really in their interests to skip corners but I'd rather not have a showdown with the real estate agent and new tenant if I can prevent it!

You treat working abroad (while remaining resident) as any long stay out of the country - minimise the costs - and where applicable charge a shed load of costs back against tax. (Which is basically what MPs were doing in the UK).

			1) as far as I know, no.  All you can do is find another tenant to take over the lease, otherwise you continue to be responsible for paying the rent until you've terminated the lease as outlined in your contract.

332	04.08.2014, 13:22	Junior Member	Thanked 11 Times in 7 Posts	Location: CH	"    I have a more casual opinion on this than some others so thought I'd share to counterbalance the other posts a bit.  Yes, you have to leave the apartment in the condition it was found, but as some other say, normal wear and tear is included and you know the condition the apartment is in.     
I have moved a few times and always done the cleaning myself.  The most I've had to pay out of my guarantee is the 40CHF to replace those un-findable bathroom sink glasses (am I right, anyone else have this problem?!).  I also couldn't stomach the prices for an agency for what they did.  If you don't have time, hire a cleaning lady for 4 hours for the bits you need (oven, fridge, bathrooms, etc).  Or a handyman to help stop up some holes in the walls for 2 hours.   Look at your place and make a list of what actually needs doing and find people to help with those tasks.     
It's always easier to clean when everything's out of the apartment.    
So here's what I would do:  
Get as much as you can into your friends car when they arrive Mon, or tuck it away in the cave if you have one.  I would have the cleaning lady come Mon afternoon.  If she needs more time have her do more Tuesday morning.  Do the handover Tuesday afternoon.  Hit the road Tuesday night and enjoy your last night in Zurich rather than worrying about the handover! (i know, that may be idealistic but just had to throw it out there).     
Good luck to you!

			HI to all     
What's the benefit, when leaving switzerland, of leaving the Pillar 2 funds there versus getting them cashed, assuming you have both options?     
From my point of view, correct me if I'm wrong: 
- if you can keep that money invested until your retirement age 
- if you do not have a better investment solution 
it would be beneficial to leave it in switzerland because the swiss pension system if stable. Also, in case you're cashing it, I understood there maybe some taxes on top of it that will reduce the amount of the capital you're getting back.     
Other comments?     
Another question: what's the difference between a Portable Benefit account and a Vested benefit account? I understood they are bank accounts where you can keep the Pillar 2 when leaving switzerland, but what's the difference?     
thanks

			Hi,   
First you need to be clear about your C permit status. You can only leave CH for up to 6months otherwise you forfeit your c permit, you can make a special request for your permit to be held, but this usually only concerns education placements, ie university course abroad.   
I know you can continue to contribute to AVS, etc if you are a student abroad, but am not sure about working abroad, your best bet is to call up the main office for your area.  I spoke to a very helpful man in the Lausanne office a few months ago and he gave me lots of important and useful information.

			You are right indeed. However, that applies to countries that do have a bilateral agreement with Switzerland. In my case neither India where I am a national of not U.A.E where i reside, have bilateral agreements. And I have already been allocated a refund amount but my issue is that the amount is not fair/rightly calculated.

I don't really know the answer. But maybe she could just do 6 months study every year so there is no problem? I have a feeling it's 6 months a year!   
Also if you are EU, then is she entitled to apply for citizenship of your country? Takes a while so won't help now, but might make things easier in the future!

			You can contact the salvation army and they will come and take a look at what you have and take what they think they can sell and leave the rest.  The rest you will then have to dispose of - not sure how it works in Lausanne, but here certain items here can be thrown away with the normal rubbish as long as you stick on enough ""bin"" stickers.  Putting it outside with a ""gratuit"" sign may get rid of some items as well.

			Hello everyone - 
On the off chance that anyone is moving from Vienna to Basel in the next weekend, or needs some things moved, I'll be taking a van from Basel to Vienna on Friday (June 27) and driving back on the following Monday. Perhaps you have some boxes/furniture that need to be picked up along the way?    
On the same note, I'm actually still looking for a transport van (it doesn't need to be huge). If anyone knows of any possibilities for renting a transporter or van, where they don't charge for kilometers (perhaps a friend of yours has one?), then please let me know!   
Thanks!

			When we did the handover, we didn't need any help as the agency charged us 800 CHF extra for the cleaning at the beginning of the lease. It was a very smooth handover. We cleaned the bathroom, kitchen and floor. I also fixed all the holes and paint that was needed. The agent was truly amazed how clean we gave back the apartment and we got our deposit back straight away.    
We took a B&B for 2 nights just to make sure everything was settled and in order before we left the country.

358	31.05.2014, 10:38	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 28 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Basel Stadt	"    Sorry, the free market doesn't play that way. I could rent out my deceased grandparents' 8 BR-house with a massive garden for some 400/month as well - but that is not what a ""normal"" situation is. If an object is heavily subsidized or rented out by some person who paid off the house and doesn't care what rent they still take in, that is not ""normal"". It's the rare exception, not the rule.     
As you claim you found a 2BR at Bellevue with a garden or probably at least a decent-sized balcony for less than 900 (and I assume this was not 60 years ago), here's how the reality looks like: cheapest current offer in that same Kreis:   Single room, 20qm for 1100, no own bathroom (overrated anyway, rightâ¦). But at least it's got a bed already. Next in line is this one:   1 room, 28qm, close to 1400. It might have the view, though. Very ""reasonable"" indeed.    
This is the kind of reality that the large majority of people in this country are facing - property prices have skyrocketed in all urban areas over the last years; and not surprisingly, it's now starting to spill over to more rural areas.

			The best to get cleaning service is to ask your moving company. They might offer the service as part of their business or they will get you in touch with a good one. I did this with Welti-Furrer, although cannot remenber the name of the sub contract company for the cleaning. Was expensive but the service was impeccable!

You actually go to the Stadthaus to deregister in Zurich, rather than the Kreisburo.  If you have been filing a tax return (in addition or instead of getting tax taken out of your pay check), you may need to designate an accounting firm with a power of attorney to handle any remaining tax issues.  Deregistration was quick and you get letters (and copies if you ask) at the same time.   
You can then use the copies of the letters to cancel other service.

It is depending on you what you want to do with it.     1. You can keep it in the fund and let it grow, it will be paid when you retire in the full   amount or as a pension every month.     2. If you intend to run your own business, you can take all of it out.      I recommend: get in touch with Swisscanto themselves and get advice. A lot of people take it out and waste it for nothing (happens to swiss citizens as well).

			You are quite right to look for recommandations because my experience with cleaning companies wasn't so good - once they didn't clean the place to any standards (even if it was almost clean before) or they change a fortune for a so-so job (no good for an ""Ã©tat -des-lieux""). In my opinion the best solution  is to do it in tango with a cleaning lady - at least you will know what is being done

			The cars here in Europe that do get really fantastic mileage are generally diesels. Unfortunately, due to tighter environmental regulations and misinformed public perception of diesel motors in the US, your choices there are very few.  
Audi and BMW both sell 1 model each that are not SUV's, the A3 and the 335d. Mercedes is planning to start selling a diesel version of the E-class this year. On the more affordable end of things, you would be limited to the Volkswagen Jetta or Golf. Both of the VW's are rated at 30 mpg city, 42 highway.   
If you like any of these cars, you would save a huge amount of money by purchasing them in the United States.

			If you earned all the assets in Switzerland you are not liable to pay tax on these assets in Australia as you were taxed whilst earning in Switzerland. Australia is only interested in any assets you own, and earnings, specifically within Australia whilst a non resident.   
Once you are a resident in Australia, have assets  as a resident of Australia or sold these after moving to Australia, then you might be subject to taxes as you are then taxed as a resident of Australia. It depends on your residency status upon earning the assets and also timing when selling the assets. Any assets you have (thinking property or shares), that are sold after you become a resident may then be subject to tax.    
Just my opinion though, best to consult the ATO website and as requested speak to an  Australian based accountant. I am definitely not an accountant.

394	19.02.2014, 22:57	Newbie	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: zurich	"    I do agree with Kashel27 in all aspects, except the 'two small' cars.   
Two small cars do make more economic sense, except for 'practicality' and 'longevity' of the vehicle.   
Queenslanders typically do have a small ""run around"" car (the small car), and a larger family car (typically at least a 6 cylinder).   (when looking for rental property, you will see the abbreviation ""DLUG"", which means ""Double Lock Up Garage"")   
Keep in mind that driving in Australia involves exceptionally large distances and extremes of road temperature are very tough on the vehicle.   
Small cars have high revving, short stroke engines, which are great for start/stop driving. Larger engines have a longer stroke (Diesel in particular) so they do less work over distance. 
.... the thing is, small engine cars burn out if used on the highways more than larger cars.   
One large car is also useful in terms of lifestyle so you can pack up the family and all your stuff (eg. camping, or a day at the beach etc.).   
If you restrict the use of your larger car for long distances it's actually equally as fuel efficient as the small car.   (I know this for a fact. I had a 6L V8 Holden ute which used the same amount of fuel as a Toyota Corolla on a trip from Brisbane to Sydney)   
Australians don't like BIG cars like Americans, but we don't like small cars that burn out either.   
European cars are obviously fantastic vehicles, but unforunately Australia is a small and unimportant market for their distributers..... hence service, and price of parts become inhibitive to own these cars. Not to mention import tarriffs on purchase price.   
I used to drive 50,000km a year on average (which is a lot, but not as much as other people), so without the public transport system you have here in Switzerland, your car becomes an important choice which contributes to your lifestyle.

			Hi,   
Thanks for your reply,   
I'm aware of the TV and dvd issue. I knew a person that look their TV from Europe to Australia and they were able to use it fine with a set top box. I also know about the zones, we planned to bring our DVD player with us. We also have our laptops which are able to play the DVD's. It just seem's like a great shame to throw out or give away so many dvd's (we love) and such an expensive TV. It's worth a try right? But you're absolutely right, better check before we just try and hook it up!   
As for the bedding i'm also aware of the different sizes but my bed in Australia won't have a problem with the doona (duvet) (which is what we intend to bring).That shouldn't be a problem as we don't plan on shipping the sheets.

			Just a note on that, I'm having to fly through Sydney in order to buy the extra luggage, watch out if any leg of the journey is operated by another airline. I originally booked direct through to Melbourne and had to have the flight refunded because one flight was operated by QANTAS and they were going to make me pay QANTAS' luggage fees as well (which are considerably more).

			3. Sometimes it is possible to get a refund of HV contributions. See below.       
Also, you may need to file tax returns after you leave. This can drag on for ages as the tax returns process can/ will take a while.  We left in Sept 13 and only just received our 2012 tax return invoice. We will still need to file for 2013 (up to Sept).

I'm looking for the same information here in the forum and on the shipping companies websites in Switzerland, but it's not very easy to find a solution.

I will keep on looking and will post again here in the forum should I find a good solution.

It is seen as being a cheaper option to paying ""excess luggage"" fees.    
Everywhere I have moved, this has been the cheaper option for me ( cheaper by far, than sea cargo) with my beongings either travelling in the same 'plane as me, or even arriving at the destination point before me.    
On one occassion, I used DHL for moving approx 150kg, this being the cheapest quote I got from that country.

With British Airways you pay 51 USD for the first extra 23kg and 119 USD for the next 23kg, that means for 170 USD plus your normal baggage allowance of 23kg you can carry 69 kg of baggage home.    
You're allowed up to 10 bags in total per passanger. So it would cost you 1003 USD plus the price of your ticket to take 230 kg of luggage.

			My wife and I are relocating to Oslo at the end of March and we are looking for options to move our things. An internet search would suggest to me that one-way van rental (like Uhaul in the USA) is not possible. Perhaps someone on the forum knows of a person with a van that would be willing to make some money transporting our things? Alternatively, has anyone had a particularly good experience with a specific moving company? Any advice that you can offer would be very much appreciated!

			I browsed the internet for hours but still could not find a comprehensive list of things to do before you leave Switzerland. Therefore I decided to enlist all details of my own experience. I live in Lausanne, hence most of the terms pertaining to official documents will be in French, but I hope that this post will help people living in other parts of Switzerland as well. If you find additional points, please add them in the comments so that the reader sees everything.   
Once you decide to leave Switzerland for good, the first thing you should do is inform your housing agency (gÃ©rance) about the date on which you will give up your apartment. They demand a notice in writing, signed by both spouses/civil partners and sent to them by registered post. They do not recognize phone calls, normal mail and personal visits as proper means of notification. The housing agency will then inform you if about the next steps depending on the remaining duration of your contract. If they ask you to find new tenants, then you should start posting on social websites (and English Forum) or other places that you find suitable. I have heard that some agencies can be very nasty and demanding, hence it is better to give ample time to this aspect. Some ask for notice periods of upto 3-4 months. Please check with yours.   
The next step is to make a list of all the utility services that you use, and binding contracts. Some examples are: 
Bank 
Health insurance 
Electricity 
Cable/fixed line phone 
Mobile service provider 
Internet provider 
Household insurance 
Pension 
Employer 
Etc.   
Draft a letter to each office clearly indicating the date of your final departure from Switzerland. You should also put your new address and email i.d. in the letter so that they can communicate with you if needed. New bank account details should be included in case you are expecting a reimbursement, but do not send them yet.  All of them will demand copies of the Certificate of departure from the Permit office (Controle des habitants). This is the office where you applied for your residence permit upon arrival. This departure certificate cannot be issued more than 30 days before your departure date; hence you can only get it, at most a month before you leave. In Lausanne, they charge 20 chf and give the certificate within a few minutes.    
Once you get the departure certificate, make plenty of copies and append them to the letters that you drafted for cancellation of services and contracts. Most of the companies will not charge any fee or penalty for breaking the contract if you leave the country (that is why they require the departure certificate). All documents must be sent via registered post. If you have the time to go to the office in person, demand a cancellation confirmation.    
It is possible to keep your Swiss bank account running for a few months after your departure from Switzerland. You should contact a bank representative as soon as you have a moving date. This costs some money but is ideal for reimbursements (like pension) that will be faster for a Swiss bank account than a foreign bank account.   
While you are cleaning and emptying your apartment, you may want to either ship the furniture and other ÂstuffÂ to your new residence or sell it/give it away. In either case, you should check out the forum for recommendation in movers and advertising sites. For the household stuff that has to be discarded, there are few options. First, you may take these items to a nearby garbage collection centre (dechetterie) and dump everything there. For using the centre, you need to have a card that is issued free of cost by the canton. For example, in Lausanne, we can apply for the card at :     
Another option is to use the mobile waste collection vans. It is forbidden to throw bulky waste (of any sort) along the dustbins kept in front of each building. But once a month, there are mobile collection centres for all major parts in the city where you can dispose all kinds of waste (furniture, electric appliances, textiles, aluminium, iron, batteries etc.). Each canton should have a schedule for this service. For Lausanne, it can be found at:     
There are fixed garbage collection bins installed at some points in cities where people can routinely segregate and discard waste. A list of these fixed points can also be found in the above links.   
If you want to donate household items, there are some charity organizations like Salvation Army (more can be searched online) that can be contacted and booked for picking up your stuff from home. But these organizations are generally picky about the stuff they take, and should be contacted a few weeks in advance. Please note that they only take items that are not broken or damaged.  If something is unusable, they will not take it. Sometimes, they may be requested for disposing waste material for you, but they will charge you for this service.   
Once your apartment is empty, you need to clean it before handing it over to your housing agency. Sometimes, they are very strict about cleanliness of the house, so you should be very careful. Some people scrub and clean the house themselves, while others prefer to hire a professional for the service. Either way is fine as long as the house is clean enough for the inspecting people. Otherwise they charge you extra money. Some recommendations for cleaners may be found on the forum, but it is also good to ask around at your workplace or in your social circle. Inspection day is quite important. The housing agency makes a bill for the damages done to the apartment during your stay. It can be (partly or completely) reimbursed by the household insurance, so please keep track of all the documents that you receive.   
It is important to go to the post office near your domicile and inform them about the change of your address. They usually charge a fee (depending on the country you will move to) and direct the mail that arrives to your Swiss address to your new address for one year.   
I have tried to include everything that I have done so far. Incase I remember something else, I will post it below in the comments. Special thanks to English Forum and its members who have answered most of my questions during my stay in Switzerland.

			Someone with proper knowledge could probably correct me, but if you are worrying about 16A vs. 10A fuses, you probably not need to. This is because of your appliance takes some Amperes, but it will not need the exceeded ones. It would be different situation if your device takes 16A and grid is only delivering 10A.. Like welding machines etc.. I have usually used a basic rule that if the device will not accept 12V it is useless   Just to make sure that whenever solar power is available I have correct devices   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 53 Times in 30 Posts	Moving to Canada - voltage issue	ElggDK	Posts: 949	3,978	38	Leaving Switzerland

My situation is similar to ""your friends"": I am non-EU, I got an offer from a company in Canada (non-swiss), I sent a letter to the Migrationsamt explaining I wanted to try it out, would like to come back to CH though, that it would be good for the family, kids will learn canadian ... sorry I mean english  , experience abroad, bla bla bla; and they approved my permission for 4 years  .     
Luck? most likely and it definitely felt like it when I received the approval (neighbors could confirm this as they witnessed me yelling in joy).   
The fact that you have own property might actually be a good thing for you.  Just be aware that it took almost one month to get the approval.  Once you have that, you de-register from your Gemeinde, make sure you show your Aufrechterhaltung der Niederlassungsbewilligung when doing this, otherwise you might be de-register for good!   
Good luck

			My understanding is that the quotas made no difference; they simply give you an L permit instead of a B if you really hit the quota, so you can still come and work.   
Anyway, if you de-register, by definiton you are turning in your B permit.   
So, de-register, lose your B permit, go back to the UK and when/if you return for a job simple get another B permit.  If you're British it'll make no difference at all to the company which hires you.  You simply rock up to the canton office with your employment contract and apply for another B permit. The company doesn't have to do anything.   
If you want to keep your B permit, then don't de-register. But then you must have health insurance, will need to file tax returns, and can't cancel any utilities without giving full notice.  It's a stupid thing to do.  You've not really thought this through   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Deregistering: Keeping my B Permit?

			As I'm going through a very simliar process of leaving CH and at about the same time as the original poser, I though I'd contribute my experience so far.   
My gemeinde is Uster, and I went there on behalf of my famliy to deregister about a month before we are going to leave.  All I needed was our B permits, sign a form that needed a new address (for future correspondance), and no fee.   
Then I had to go over to the tax office, and they confirmed that I needed to do a provisionary tax declaration (and payment) for the year that I am leaving.  Unlike the deregistration desk, for taxes I had to give them a new CH address for correspondance.  Since we were leaving CH, I would be forwarding this to a good friend here in CH, and thus they gave me a form that needs to be signed by me and my friend that allows them to send tax related documents to him on my behalf.  This form they told me to send with my provisionary tax return.   
Note: You cannot submit the provisionary tax return online, they need it hand written for some reason.   
We aren't much farther in the process yet, but so far it seems straighforward.

If any of them are high school age and particularly if they are in a gymnasium, then worst case is that they might not be readmitted to the same school at all.  In this situation, negotiating with the school to let them take an 'Auslandjahr' is by far your best option. You will have to present details of the school you plan to enroll them in.    
Is your proposed destination an EU/EFTA country or not? That will also affect your eligibility to receive 'Kinderzulage' assuming you are still paid by an employer here.

			I am in Aargau, but I imagine it is similar. 
I left for 7 months, and was made to deregister, even though I still had my apartment here.   
Essentially you don't give up your permit exactly, you have the permission to come back, and the permit picks up where you left off. 
The only difference it made to me is that my official time in switzerland was reduced by the amount of time I was away (for counting towards C permit etc).    
So basically instead of being in switzerland for 4 years, 8 months, it was 4 years 1 month...  
It made no other difference at all, and they gave my permit back as soon as I got back (well... it took a few weeks...but it had expired while I was away...but still no problem!)

			Hello, 
I have a B permit and I work in Switzerland and my husband, who has a job in India also has a B permit coupled to mine. Obviously he is shuttling between the two countries and so far the longest he was away from Switzerland is 6 months. Since I have a full time job here, the contract for house, electricity and other utilities is on my name. The only thing he has to take care of is his health insurance.   
So I believe that as long as the taxes, insurance, paperwork and contracts are attended to, there should be no problem.   
Hope it helps! 
Cheers.

			Hey there,   
Check out some of the online net salary calculators for Ireland which are generally quite accurate. Here's one from      
I am in Ireland more than Switzerland at the moment and can confirm that a doctor's appointment in most practices costs on average Â40 - Â50 which although not covered by private health insurance, is eligible for    
Check out the   which has a wealth of accurate and up-to-date information on public services, entitlements etc in Ireland.   
If you are renting, you will be entitled to    
If you purchase a property you will have to pay the new    
If you have kids you will be entitled to    
I haven't spent much time in Cork city but have always enjoyed my short visits. It's no metropolis but has everything you need in a big town and I believe it has a kicking social scene to suit all types. There is so many special places to visit in the surrounding areas, and the whole south west of Ireland in general, you will never be bored. While day to day living costs in Ireland are generally on the expensive side compared with most of the EU, I think it is far more competitive than Switzerland with much more opportunities to shop around.   
Wishing you good luck with your decision. Do your homework, weigh up the pros and cons and then go with your gut feelings.   
All the best

You must have them in a bag that is tied off, at least that is the rule here. Preferably one of the specially labeled bags that they leave in your mailbox from time to time, but they aren't terribly picky as long as it's bagged. The pickups near us are always by the Coop and Migros, but are not out 100% of the time. Usually put out about once a month, from what I recall.

			I think that London is a fabulous city and a great place to live in if you're young or rich, preferably both    
There are lots of entertainment possibilities - great pubs, restaurants for virtually every conceivable taste and pocket, great museums (many of them free), clubs, cinemas, IMAX etc. Lots of great parks too. More opportunities for shopping than you can dream of.   
Flights out of London are numerous, direct to most destinations and overall good value.   
Not to mention that the UK itself has lots of things to see and do.   
There are downsides, too. London specific: be prepared to spend large amounts of time in travel (best to live as close as possible to your workplace). Meeting your friends might involve serious planning. On your budget you might flat share and live in a very small place (especially by Swiss standards). London is not car-friendly.   
While most of the city centre and a couple of other (rich) areas are stunningly beautiful, many, many residential areas in London are ugly and feel unsafe. Crime is much higher than in Switzerland.   
London is a very multicultural and racially diverse city (Brits being a minority), which you might like or not, as it has advantages and disadvantages.   
Taxes are high (even for a relatively small wage, and very high for a substantial wage) and paradoxically public services are quite poor. Transport is expensive. Property prices are horrendous, particularly in the better areas. Child care is very expensive (think of Swiss prices on UK wages).   
Personally, I think that living in London - if only for a little bit - is a great experience, particularly when you're young. It's different when you get older and your priorities change.

			Ok, I promise I will stop   Another idea for you is to become a caretaker while you would be in the USA. There is a website I used to subscribe to called the Caretaker's Gazette. Basically, people are looking for people to stay in ther home while they are away for free in exchange for taking care of the property...watering plants, taking care of pets, etc.    
This could be an idea of how you could live on the cheap while you are there. You could possibly get creative with trading your photog skills as well. I guess the major road block is if your child needs to be in school or not during these times. You would need a more permanent set up if so.    
Off the record, if you got the visa you could likely advertise your phyography services and get money for that and no one would be the wiser. You just need to be prepared that you will have 0 health benefits and safety nets while living there. Maybe some Swiss insurance could cover you while overseas? If you could work work work while in Switzerland and then live from that money while in the US it could be doable! You just would have to go into it with the mindset of being an extended vacation rather than assuming you could find work and set up a ""real"" life there.   
Good luck.

			All,   
I found someone who has used Hagenholz. 
Apparently they will take everything....am sure there is a limit, but everything I mentioned he said 'yes' to.   
The car is weighed on the way (weigh  ) in. 
And then on departure again, so you pay by weight.   
He seemed to suggest 40CHF, but that might just be a minimum. 
I will be there on Sat and let you all know.

This post is almost a year old, so hopefully you are still responding. I am in the same situation.  I am moving back to the US, but plan to travel in between for 3 weeks. I got the impression from reading the US customs site (but no clear info) that my stuff couldn't arrive before me.  But it also seems that I can just get a friend to pick it up (if I give them power of attorney).  I was going to just send it all Swiss Post/USPS as it is cheaper and I don't have a lot of stuff.  What was your experience.  Thanks Claire

			Hi,   
We have a Proform PFTL40520 Treadmill (fold-able) to be picked up from us in Riehen for free (apart from some exercise to carry it down 2 floors:-) as soon as possible.    
Note: It is 120V so perfect if you are moving back to US.    
It was used in US for a few years and it is in good shape, but we have not used it in CH since we moved here from US in 2009 and had it instead as a cloth hanger:-)    
Now we need to get rid of it asap as we have no space with a baby coming and thought to try to give it way before we take it to the recycling.   
We will recycle it very soon if we do not get any takers in the next days, so hurry up if interested.   
Best,   
Jonas Fast, Riehen 
+41797736652 or email through forum.

			I recently went through the eurotunnel (in a rented car) with two dogs because that ended up being the best option for us to transport them without flying. I found the following link helpful for detailing out the different transport options for pets:    
I think most of the ferry services do not allow pets with foot passengers unless in some cases they are crated but even in that case they are sometimes not allowed (with exception of service dogs). Goodluck with your travels!

From my experience extra bag is mostly cheaper than shipping. Also less problems with customs as everything crosses the border at the same time (if no lost luggage).

I personally would stick with the terms and conditions because they are, as the name says, the legal terms and conditions for the contractual relatioship between the costumer and the Swiss Post. The other is just an information leaflet. This inconsistency can also be found on the Swiss Post website, that is the reason way I originally looked in the T&C. Anyway, it would be more worrisome if it were the other way round. Best: print out the T&C and to store it in a safe place with the tracking receipt.   
But I think what the postal clerk actually wanted to say is: ""If you need insurance it will cost extra (CHF 2) and covers max. CHF 1500"".  But that statement is only true for domestic parcels.

			yes, your husband will need back dated health insurance.   
for your 2nd pillar, go to the bank administering your funds and fill out a form or at least ask about it, and give them the documents you already have -  your Abmeldung form from your commune, and marriage certificate.  The other information like your Australian bank account and contact details can wait.

			I once got my wallet stolen and had to order a replacement GA card. Two months later before I left the country for a 6 month internship, I went to an SBB office and wanted to get the refunds for the remaining months of the year (amount to 1200 I believe), but the lady wouldn't get me money back, simply cuz I have ordered a replacement card... Their logic might be that I could have given the other GA to friends/family, etc.. so be careful, if you order a replacement card, no refunds are allowed

			A very wise decision and one which I don't think you will regret.  Just be prepared for a culture shock after Zurich ... in a good way!   
We did ship stuff over but I can't remember who we used but will find out.  As you say, the alternative is to hire a van and drive down, taking the ferry from Genoa to Palermo, driving down through Sicily and taking the high speed from Pozzallo to Malta.  You would then need to get the van back though.

			Thanks Kiwigeek but usually they don't ship in reverse and just have an agent or local partner in Switzerland which means you don't get the best rates.  As I'd mentioned in my original post which is probably buried somewhere now, it's better to deal with folks on the ground in Switzerland or interestingly the UK if you're shipping from here to Australia and want the best rates.   
Ok, so I've done a fair bit of research and wanted to pay forward my newly discovered knowledge:   
Post Office - 
Cheapest method i found and reasonably quick is postage 2-3weeks delivery.  The big benefit is that you don't have to pay all the customs, arrivals, storage and quarantine fees this way as its already pre-cleared.   Costs are:   
Deutsch Post - Â123 for 30kg box, dimensions (160cmx60cmx60cm - huge compared to all other post boxes I've looked at).  FYI - The max you can ship to Australia is 31.5kgs.  For English folks the number I found after much searching and talking to Munich and Frankfurt airport post offices is +49 89 97306945.  They are very helpful and confirmed that my online calculation was correct.   
Italian Post is a dark horse as I discovered a price chart online which had a 20kg box shipping as surface for Â89 (it didn't mention box dimensions though which is important to me as my boxes are huge!).  In any case this is very cheap and if you speak Italian or can find an English speaking post office (hint: try airport post offices as they deal with foreigners and may speak English), it could be worth talking to them.   
French La Poste cost just over Â200 for 20kg box via their parcel carrier named Collissimo, but I couldn't find a number to call them directly on (that worked from Switzerland) to see if they offered a different rate at their standard post office.  As they are more expensive than Switzerland I ruled them out of my search.   
Even with a van hire from Allocar vans (40per day on a Tue/Wed) as my extra large boxes won't fit in our SUV, the postal option with Deutsch post is still cheaper than all of the other options I explored.   
Sea freight - 
I would definitely have chosen this method of shipping had I had a larger shipment of goods and furniture.  As it stands, I got 3 quotes from ocean freight companies and the best by far was from movecorp.co.uk.  They quoted Â£625 for my shipment based on a weight of 171kg for my boxes which are 60cm x 45cm x 60cm, or i could choose an unlimited weight option for Â£675.  This quote was Â£400 less expensive than the other two I received and the good thing about this quote was that it included pick-up and delivery so a true end-to-end service.  The obvious negative thing about ocean shipping is that it takes 8-12weeks (or longer) and there's a risk that things may get damaged or broken, so you need to add insurance on top of the costs.   
Unaccompanied air freight - 
Buyer beware with this option as EmiratesCargo, Qantas freight and those I checked into all use external freight forwarders for individuals.  They provide quotes which are ""CPT"" (carriage paid to) to Melbourne airport (or your relevant destination airport in Australia), which means that you have to pay arrival fees on top of your quote such as electronic import terminal arrival charges (based on weight), break bulk and automation fees, customs electronic entry.  In addition you will also need to pay (where applicable) duty taxes/storage fees, quarantine, AQIS inspection, and obviously moving fees if you want a company to do it for you.   
World Freight, Geneva  (EmirateS Cargo) for 178kgs was around CH$1,100 including pick up in Lausanne.  On top of this they quoted AU$425 for handling arrival fees only (quarantine, storage, AQIS and moving we're extra and could be another AU$150-300).   
Sauvin Schmidt cost around CH$1075, including pick up from Lausanne. They do not have a partner in Melbourne to provide arrival fees (charged by the airlines) so you would need to do this yourself or contract somebody locally, and quarantine, storage, AQIS and removal isn't fees would be extra again.   
Anyway, I hope the above information is helpful to others who are assessing different options.

			Use the Swiss post office, best rates for boxes.   
Declare the stuff as used personal belongings, and make a detailed inventory of each box, and stick this in a clear envelope on the outside of each box.

			I learned at university, so it was very intense with all kinds of resources. With German, you are lucky: definitely the best dictionaries. Danes do think along the same lines as Germans, so translation is not a big difficulty.  
It depends how you learn. Taking a class or language exchange is absolute necessary because of oral comprehension and pronunciation. If you like systematic learning, buy a self taught book and enrich it with own readings. Passive understanding of text should be quite easy and rewarding compared to speaking.    
If you are total beginner, google ""Dansk for udlÃ¦ndinge"", there are all kind of books and a couple of websites to explore.

			Used the Swiss Moving COmpany from Switz to the US.   
Crews were all friendly, and logistically everything was on time.   
BUT - things were only wrapped in bubble wrap, no cardboard on the furniture.  So almost every piece of heavy furniture has little dings in the corners, wood chipped off, etc.  I tried to claim insurance, and after much going back and forth, they refuse to pay for the repairs.  For each piece they are offering only $100.  So for a 10,000 bedroom set that is damaged on each corner they offer a few hundred.  They produced some conditions that were in the insurance policy but that I had not seen when I signed with the SMC.

			I have a lot of friends who took a LED TV with them as check in baggage. I think I know of at least 20 tv's which reached India (in 2012) as check in baggage without any breakage. However I dont know if you have space in the check in luggage. 
Since you talk about excess luggage, I assume you dont have space. If it were me, I would ship/post my old clothes and take the TV with me.   
Airlines usually permit only certain dimensions for the box. My friends have taken 40-46 inch ones. No one informed before hand. In fact the one who checked with the airline were told that its not permitted. No such issues when it came to the check-in staff. 
You do have to take care of customs in India. You should carry the purchase receipt. If you carry the original receipt you will attract customs at purchase price else they may levy the customs on price in India.      Yep. TV will usually cost double in India.      Just need the original box. Airlines usually take good care. Plasma tv's require a lot more care as they need to be transported upright.

			We are leaving and I contacted Swisscom, they told me there was a two month penalty for finishing outside of the annual cancellation, but that if I waited until the end of January to give my notice it would be without penalty - and then right at the bottom they said that if I proved with deregistration confirmation that I was leaving Switzerland, there would be no penalty.

			I literally just did this, I finally made it to the states 4 days ago. 
It took us 4-5000$ (lawyer including) and we started in February 2012 with the paperwork. We needed a sponsor so it took a little longer and was a bit more expensive. All docs must be officially translated into English and the amount of paperwork required is simply ridiculous. My friend just got his also and it also took him 8 months (he moved first to the states and did it from there) but remember you are not allowed to work while in the process.    
We were also told that if there is a mistake in the paperwork you go back in line. 2-3 months I would not count on ( more like min 7 months) Dont quit your job or apartment yet (as we did a bit to early.....)    
Best of luck , I would not want to start it all over again

			I have experience in using cleaning companies to do the final clean on flats and would advise against it.   
Speak to the owners of the building and ask them who their partner cleaning company is and use them. Normally more expensive but the will do the job to the satisfaction of the owners.   
Last time i used a company, they couldnt clean it in time and i had to arrange another day to hand over the keys, owners were not happy

			Sidewayz,   
We moved back in August 2012 from Baden. We were quoted on a 43m3 door to door Service (sole 40 ft container). This included all the packing and disassembling of large furniture pieces and vice versa at your destination and all the paper work, customs, quarantine etc. We paid about CHF 16K including new replacement insurance (beware, total loss insurance only pays for total loss, not for individual items damaged during the transport).   
We ended up choosing Kehrli & Oeler which wasn't the cheapest one. However, stay away from them as long as they use Australian Vanlines as their Australian agent. Very poor communication plus they managed to cause considerable damage to our newly laid floorboards during delivery and assembly even though we specifically pointed it out to them. We will drag them before the CTTT (small claims tribunal), it's that bad. Also K&O is less than helpful saying that there's nothing they can do.   
I wish we'd used another shipping company. Make sure you do you homework and check out their credentials, especially the Australian side of things.    
I might be able to find the other quotes. We initially used a quoting website and received even quotes from the UK. This got us started.   
PM me if you need to know more.

			If the insurance company says, you can prolonge the insurance after you left, that should be fine. However, if you want to pay off the lease after 6 months and then take the car with you, it might be subject to UK import taxes. I would clarify this in advance with the UK customs.

			Hi there   
We moved here from the Bahamas and now we will be leaving again to go to South Africa. 
We used a company called Moebel-Transport AG 
They are international movers and very good. 
They will also come to your house and give you a quote for free. 
For us to move with everything, that is we are taking all our furniture and we are a family of 5, it will cost around CHF 22.000 
Shipment will take at least 6 weeks but you can also send part by air fright. 
Just have them come round and give you a quote.   
Hope this helps.

			I'm no expert, so perhaps best to check with the renters associate, ASLOCA, etc.   
But what it appears you have is a subletting situation, even though it seems for only one room.  In such cases the contract between Sandra and Bob would determine what is to be done.  Most subletting contracts have provisions for deposit, final cleaning, and inspection by the renter (Sandra).

			The incentive is two salaries. Alle ist klar.    
Notwithstanding the legal or moral issue, I can see nothing to stop you doing this and getting away with it. I have even heard of someone doing something like this on the RAV. The issue you face is downside risk if you are found out.   
BTW, this is not advice, it is merely observation. I dont want any groans for answering the question directly.

			We used Interdean to bring us from Belgium [Antwerpen] to Evian-les-Bains. The Interdean Belgium packing/stowing team were nothing short of absolutely brilliant - so careful, amenable and friendly. Pleasure to do business with. 
Interdean were badly let down by the Geneva end, where the unpacking team were slapdash and careless, causing damage of Â800+ with the insurance company had to reimburse. If you chose Interdean, then watch this end like hawks. However, having said that, this was 5 years ago and maybe they have fired the father and son team [plus overseer] who delivered our goods. 
If you need more information, feel free to PM us.

			Last time, i went through the de-registration process, I got to keep my permit as a souvenier.   
My understanding is that you are still able to use it as a schengen visa post de-registration. However, you are not allowed to work after the deregistration date. I may be wron on this part though.

			We have hired Pearson's to go to Boston in 4 weeks.  No idea of the service yet, but def the cheapest and reviews looked good.   
Unfortunately they only have a 40 GBP per item/box insurance.  Does anybody have experience getting extra insurance through another company? (Pearson's said we could not through them).  I saw   but not sure if others would recommend such a thing.  This is out first time moving and things are not always clear.

We've been here a week now, and are still unpacking boxes, and trying to find space for our stuff......mainly due to the previous owners being too bl**dy lazy to take thier unwanted bits to the tip (free in this part of France, so no excuse) and us having to move their stuff out before we move ours in.

Now, if he did get sick in another country, depending on how good his insurance is here in Switzerland, he may have to pay a percentage of expected expenses in the host country.  For example, my sis lives here and has worldwide coverage as do her children as they are under her policy with Swica, when she took her son to the hospital in the US, she paid nothing and was billed her percentage through her insurance here.  I have also heard of some people putting a deposit when going to the emergency room with world wide coverage and being reimbursed by the insurance company.   
As for the other thread.  Most people that are in a foreign country with a foreign passport have 90 days they can stay on that passport as a non-resident person, so, if de-registered now, you should be able to stay until Jan 9 2013 as a visitor on your passport without a special visa as Switzerland does not require a special visa to enter, unlike say, places in South Africa.

			Hi!    
For those of us who simply would like to cancel with no insurance claims pending, I am currently in the process of leaving Switzerland and found it quite easy to cancel.    
Just call and ask what the notice period is. Mine is one month. I sent in a registered letter and they even said they would give me back the proportional amount paid for the remaining year      
All is well so far. Hopefully it continues. Good luck!

			There have been many discussions on how to ship stuff to your home country when leaving. You can search EF is you want.   
But in a few words, the best option (cheapest) that keeps coming up is to ship via the  . You can look at their website to get the details (package size, weight/price breaks, delivery time options etc).    
Depending on the size and empty weight of your suitcases (often 4-5 kg already), you might decide that it is cheaper to leave them and box you stuff. If you do, you should use the fiberglass reinforced tape you can buy from Jumbo (Crissier). It will ensure nothing falls out of the box. You can also get the boxes at Jumbo.

			Thanks a lot everybody for your comments and help. I finally managed to convince BCV to accept my old departure notice and my H-1B visa stamp as well as my i797 form as the evidence that I don't live in Switzerland anymore.    
Funny thing was that I sent them the docuemnts with UPS but somehow UPS managed to not to find the bank reporting they have moved! Turns out they could not deliver to PO boxes in Switzerland and all BCV had as mailing address was just a PO box. (A week before that I sent some documents to the same PO box with FedEx with no problem). Anyway, I could track the package and give UPS a street address. Contacted the bank again and they said they have received the documents and are in the process of releasing the funds.

			If it's any help, left-hand drive cars in the UK are not that cheap. They used to be but nowadays there are quite a few dealers specialising in them for Brits with second homes abroad and they're mostly sold as premium-priced. I spoke with a dealer last year and he said they had higher margins than right hand drive cars because it's a specialised market - but he said he sold fewer than he would if he were selling RHD vehicles, so it's swings and roundabouts.

			When you deregister, you will get a letter of confirmation from the Gemeinde. Make a copy of this letter and send it to the insurance company along with a letter saying you want to cancel your insurance (from the date of your deregistration). Ask for written confirmation. Presumably if they have an English helpline you can do the letter in English. Send it as a registered letter.

sadly after 6 wonderful years I am leaving Switzerland at the end of the month. I rented a van from Sixt to move my stuff from ZÃ¼rich to Rome on Thursday 30, and I will travel back with the empty van on Friday 31st (latest dropoff is on Sat 1st at 10am).    
If anyone is interested in   sharing it on the way back, please PM me!    
Please note that it is a small model (Ford Transit 280S) so not everything can be loaded on it!

			Thank you all for the advice.   
I have moved home already and I thought I'd just update on what we did and how it went.   
We first bought the largest box we could find at BAUHAUS but it was a clothes box and though it could fit both car seats in, it felt flimsy. So we returned the box.   
Then we bought a big box (maybe 100 x 50 x 50 cm, meant for lamps and not listed on their website) from Peyer. We used the seats for the drive to the airport, with the box still flat in the car boot (so we saved on car seat rental which would have cost us CHF 130). We packed the seats into the box before returning the rental car. And then we checked in the box. Due to the large size, it had to be checked-in at a different counter. Everything got home safely.

			Seems to be from an energy suplier I've never heard of. 
Shouldn't the bill come from your landlord directly?   
The heating bill only goes back one heating period, newest would be earliest 2010 and you can ask for a detailed bill to see if everything is correct.    
Does it say heating costs or what does it say exactly?

			We have a bed+mattress we really like, and we want to ship it back to the US. The mattress is 200x150x30cm. I don't think post office can accept this demension of package. Is there anyone knows a company that can ship it? 
How much it might cost? Thanks.

			The disposal of furniture, excluding applicances, is subject to a fee. 
If you load up your car or van and take items to one of the recycling centres, you pay basee on weight. You can also purchase stickers from the Gemeinde which can be placed on items for disposal. They can omly be placed outside on designated collection days.   
I haved helped leavers with collecting their items and rehoming them.    
Why not just offer them for free here rather than paying for disposal?   
Unless items are broken or soiled, I just don't see point in throwing them out.

I have a wooden box measuring approx 1.2m x 1.2m x 0.4m which needs bringing back to the UK and wondered if anyone was planning a trip and had some spare capacity? The box is located near Zurich. On a tight budget but happy to collect in the UK to keep costs low.   
Many thanks

			Dear friends, I left CH for Germany last year and I claimed back part of my LPP. But still about one third of LPP was not refunded as ""Part LPP soumises aux restrictions"". Since I am leaving Europe permanently, can I request to withdraw the rest of the LPP?   
one more question is that I claimed OASI (AVH or AVS) back as well when I left CH. but I only got one fourth of my OASI back and made an opposition aganist that. Now it is more than 4 months after my opposition, still no information back so far. i called, called and called, but no clear information. does anyone have this kind of situation and any information can be shared?   
thanks a lot folks!

			i experienced it too. we gave our landlord 1,5 months notice and they said it is ok if we can find a replacement.  We searched for prospective tenants and lots of them applied and fulfilled all the requirements. The landlord choose one applicants, and on a signing contract day, suddenly they changed their mind and refused the tenants without any acceptable reason (he is asian and just arrive in CH, 6 months). That was 5 days before our moving date. So, they said we have to search other prospective tenants and until we find it we have to pay the rent. In the end, we found one, but it was past 2 weeks from our moving date. They forced us to paid half month. We got help from hubby's office and wrote them a letter saying that we are not obligated to pay, because of bla..bla..bla... In the end, they said they will not release our 3 months guarantee money until we paid the half month rent. So, we did it.

			Hi,   
I've search the forums but am still a bit confused. My B permit (non EU) has expired and I've moved back to the UK. I'm coming back to Geneva to ""deregister"" so I can take my 2nd and 3rd pillar.   
What is the document you need to prove you are up to date on taxes etc? Do you require this as a B permit holder given tax is taken at source? If so where do you get it / what is it called?   
If I don't have to do the tax thing do I just show up to the OCP and declare that I want to deregister? Do I need any supporting docs?   
I have an outstanding pour suite to do with my apartment which I am disputing - will this effect my ability to deregister while it is still being resolved? Amt not hugely material, but am fighting it on principal. Regie saying I broke something,  but was actually their tradesman doing a shoddy job of maintaining.   
Many, many thanks.

			It is feasible and it might not be that expensive as you think. Of course it depends also on the dates, and the place where you will return your rental vehicle. Give britishcarhire.com a try and see what rental cars and vans they can supply to Bristol or London or Manchester airport. Where are you going in UK? Wales? England?

			Hi Bookworm,   
I cannot help envy you too even though I understand this is not what you want to (at lest not in the moment). 
-- 
WeÂre flying out (very) soon Â next Thursday in fact. It's back to the  States for us. I donÂt know how many of you manage this every 3 to 5  years! I hope this is my last ever long-distance move. 
--   
I find long distance moves hard too and it takes time to settle in a new place when so much is done differently. On the flip side we get to see the world, meet other cultures and nice people all over the world    
I try to get the best out of it whereever I am. With all the crisis going on in Europe you might be much better off in US i.e. when it comes to job security. I hope you'll end up being very happy back in the States, let us know when you have relocated.   
Will miss you on the threads, take care and wish you all the best   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Aug 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Farewell, good-morrow, good-bye!	Bookworm	Posts: 182	22,107	12	Leaving Switzerland

			They can seek payment through foreign courts, you'll give foreigners a bad name as tax-dodging spongers, and if you ever come back, you'll be arrested. The country's income will have been reduced, so effectively, you'll be stealing from me and everyone else who is honest.    
Pay what you owe.

I emailed France Removals with a detailed description of our belongings, for a move to France ... no response after 6 days, but there were 2 public holidays 
 - called today, a very short conversation.  I said we were moving a largish apartment .. the guy immediately said sorry, we cannot help you. He confirmed our apartment (on no information) was too big. End of conversation.     
I'm not totally sure this is the whole story ... maybe the company is having some problems?!

In the canton of Vaud, electrical installations are supposed to be inspected every 20 years and the chimney sweep is supposed to come round yearly. I would be surprised that there would be any requirement on appartment handover, so if you show the chimney sweep has been in the last 12 months you're probably clear. 
Requirements in other cantons may (and most certainly do) vary.

			Bzz, I might be interested on sharing a return rental, but I can't do it before beg/mid-July because that's when I go home to Brussels and see how much stuff I actually have to move.    
Otherwise someone suggested I rent a van in France (eg near Geneva) and return it somewhere else in France (eg at the very north) as a one-way rental, supposing it might be cheaper to do this in just one country.

			I also thought we had to pay the tax-at-source whenever we withdraw the 3rd pillar when leaving the country. The only difference is one should transfer it to a low-tax canton to minimise the tax to be paid. Never know that one can benefit if one waits for a few years. Do you have some concrete success stories on that?

			Hi 
Have searched the forum and cannot find the answer to this question. Can anyone tell me what I do if I need to sell my imported car that I registered 8 months ago? We are leaving Switzerland earlier then planned. I believe I need to pay import duty on the car since it has not been registered here for the necessary 12 month period. Is this correct and if so, do I just turn up at a zoll office and explain my situation?  
Many thanks

			As said elsewhere - you either settle the lease and then sell the car. Sell the car to a garage and then settle the lease. Or get a garage to sell for you - and then settle the lease.   
If you PM me the new purchase price, deposit, interest rate, months, monthly payment and final payment - I can tell you (approximately) how much is due. If you include the details of the car I'll let you know the approx retail and trade in value.

			Hallo everyone,   
I hope you can give me some advise. I have been living in Ireland since 2000 and am receiving a contributory widow pension from Switzerland. At the end of May 2013, it will be finished.    
How would I go about getting the normal widow pension from Switzerland after that, the none-contributory widow pension? Can anyone advise me on this please?   
Thank you in advance for your help and look forward to hearing from you.

I have never lived in a smaller country (like Switzerland), so I never even had the option of sending something from another country :P But that's good to hear. Thanks.      I'm not sure how to do this... I have also contacted those excess luggage companies and the quotes are about 3 times that of DHL. Which isn't really worth it, in my opinion. I could send it by Swiss Post easily for about 1.5 times of DHL. 
However, returning back to this air freight... How much did it cost you? I don't know how long things can sit in a cargo terminal. If I send the luggage April 17th and show up at the airport on May 20th, I don't know if it will still be there? Naturally I don't have too much time to go to the airport and ask around.   
Since I am not traveling through Zurich on my way home, how would I even contact the same airline for unaccompanied luggage? This process confuses me. If you could give me some more details on it, I'd really appreciate it.

			You would have to check with your pension company, generally it stays in the 'pot' so goes up along with everyone else (or down). You can also transfer your pension to another pension company either here or the uk etc.   
On the flip side, I had a quite large pension in the uk which I kept there, every year since its gone down by about 6k gbp, I'd have been better off sticking the cash in my matress   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Taking pension out of Switzerland	yermiyahu	Posts: 10	19,228	68	Leaving Switzerland

We are in the process of doing this. Works like this (Kt SZ): 
Time frame   
-working in CH till 13.04.2012   
-Tax return for 2011 had to be handed in before we leave CH (end or March2012). They have allready contacted us with a question, so they are working on this allready.   
- Tax return for 2012: Gemeinde wrote a letter telling us to submit 2012 tax return by latest 30.03.2012  . Did not make sense since working till mid April. So went to Gemeinde and queried it, they had no problem at all to extend the 'deadline' and now tax2012 should be completed end of June 2012 (allthough we would file it long before that anyway). basically showed me that they are 'human' and somehow can make mistakes hehehe, but also it was great to get a extention on the tax form.   
- If there is a house sale process involved ie Capital Gains tax: Been told that we would receive a provisional payment request from Tax authorities 2 wks before departure (they receive all the docs from the 'Notar'), and then we must submit final asap.This area is a bit of grey area for me, but I have been phoning the tax authorities and at best, this is what they have told me.

			I had searched this forum, but had not found anything related to de-registering in Kanton Luzern permanently to the US, so here's what I learned today.   
I went to the Einwohnerdienste on Obergrundstrasse and stated that I was leaving Switzerland permanently on 26-May.  I asked the lady what the earliest I could de-register was.  She said, ""We can do it today if you want.  To us it does not matter.  We will put your date of leaving on the printout form.""   
The cost was 12 CHF.   
She asked me for an ID or passport (I used my residence permit) and an address back in the US.  She let me keep my residence permit, saying to return it to the Amt fuer Migration before I leave, or mail it back to them after I get back to the states.   
So there you go.  Apparently no limit to how early you can de-register in Kanton Luzern, and a very reasonable cost.  Keep in mind, this is for permanently leaving heading to the US.  There may be other costs/fees/deadlines if you're de-registering to move to another Kanton or to another country other than the US.

Three weeks is pushing the time a bit, especially since things like our phone contracts would have been difficult to sort out along with all the chaos that goes with moving.

736	22.02.2012, 02:57	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: St. Gallen	"    The most cost efficient way to do this is to contact International moving companies and inquire about spare cargo space in containers. It is very common to have containers of household goods go only partially full. You can find companies that will combine households into a container for a reduced cost over sending your own container.   
I know of a few people who have done this relocating themselves back to the US after their contracts here ended and the company had not guaranteed their repatriation to the US.    
You will be dependent on when they have containers going to your region of the US and such, but if you're flexible on time it's a good option to consider.   
Good luck

			Hi all,   
I've searched the forum and read some of the (slightly scary) posts about how clean the apartment has to be when you leave.     
What I'm wondering is if anyone knows a decent-price cleaning company in the Morges area.  There seem to be tons in here for Bern/Zurich etc... but none for Vaud.   
Any help?

This would not cover car parking.  If you lived in Zone 1, as a single person, would suggest you not to have a car, the public transport would be good enough and you could top up with using Taxi.  When you needed a car, you could hire one.  There are schemes you can join to hire them by the hour.  There is also the TFL Bicycle scheme in Zone 1 that is very reasonable

			They are very nice at city hall. The issue is that the person who has the work contract is the one that has to deregister. So, if you have the contract, then he won't be able to do it. If it is him, then there won't be a problem.

3rd pillar: just in hubby's name, but I think I may have signed the forms too (we were in UBS signing lots of close-out forms, so I'm not sure). Money had some withholding tax applied, and was transferred straight into a regular bank account.   
2nd pillar: just in hubby's name, through his company. His fund had to transferred out of the company scheme within 30 days of leaving the company; there are two choices: 
- move the money into a vested benefit account at a provider of your choice  
- cash out the money direct into a normal bank account.   
The move to a vested benefits account could be done just on my husband's signature. We did this in order to move the money into a canton with better withdrawal tax rates. Then we cashed out the vested benefit fund - this DID require my signature, and the signature had to be officially notarised, they needed copies of both our passports for signature/ID checking, etc.

When we have enquired regarding the disposal of furniture/equipment, it has been the case that the sellers are still wanting way over the odds for what is essentially second-hand stuff. The best bet would be to find someone coming into CH and sell the furniture/equipment to them as a bulk sale. There was a chap advertising in Lausanne on EF and at least he had three responses. Or to post the items under ""Free stuff"" perhaps? That way at least the seller has no transport problems

			I think it boils down to how you want to live in London.   
If you are used to your own pad and that it what you want in London then you will struggle. 
If you are prepared to share then that will be enough for a great time. 
( My son was recently sharing in a flat and could walk into the City and was paying Â£575 - there were 5 of them and the pad was really nice - very trendy!) His flatmates were all earning around the 23k bracket.

I've since renewed my passport, so there is no longer any evidence in my passport that I have ever entered Schengen space.      Did you show your permits when you left Switzerland? We flew to the U.S. in September and didn't get a stamp. And when we returned last week, we also did not get a stamp. When entering and leaving Switzerland, we always present our permits with our passports, as requested by border patrol (experience).   
I'm guessing you're still in the U.S. and am curious to see if there will be some confusion when you return to Switzerland. If there is, hopefully it'll be minor.      If you have a Schengen area passport, the Swiss residence permit is redundant. For those of us without Schengen area passports, the Swiss residence permit is very important when entering/existing the Schengen area.   
Not actually relevant, but partially related, we were unable to do on-line check-in coming back to Switzerland, because the system said that we are required to have return tickets (to go back to the U.S.), per the rules of Switzerland. It had a space for our Swiss permit information, but the system did not cooperate.

			Thanks, I had a look at all those and it makes more sense. It turns out now that my husband is only staying 'resident' and an expat here for a few months longer than me and my daughter and staying at a friends house whilst we go to China first. Apparently just because of the amount if time it will take to get everything sorted in China so we need an address here until that's all sorted so we aren't stuck in limbo. So it won't be a long term thing. So I've read the thread about family members deregistering at different times and that has helped.And then if we do come back here then we'll just have to reapply for the B permit I guess.

			""Im pretty sure if you move outside of the EU/EEA if you can't claim unemployment benefits once you leave...""   
This is from an EU website A & Q - f.i   
 "" 
If you are unemployed, you can move to one or more EU countries to look for work and continue to receive the unemployment benefits you are entitled to in the country where you became unemployed. 
ï§	You can only do this if you are: 
ï§	an EU national 
ï§	wholly unemployed (not partially or intermittently) 
ï§	entitled to receive unemployment benefits in the country where you became unemployed. 
You        would then be paid the same amount as before directly to your bank account in the country where you became unemployed. In principle, you can stay for up to 3 months in another country, but your home job centre might allow you to remain abroad for up to 6 months if you ask. 
Please note that, even if you are an EU national, there may be rules temporarily restricting your right to work in other EU countries if you come from one of the newer EU member countries: 
ï§	temporary restrictions for Czech, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Polish, Slovenian and Slovakian nationals. 
ï§	temporary restrictions for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals. 
Before you leave, you must: 
ï§	have been registered as an unemployed jobseeker for at least 4 weeks(exceptions can be made) in the country where you became unemployed. 
ï§	apply for a U2 form (former E 303 form) - authorisation to export your unemployment benefits -from your national employment services. 
On arrival in your new country, you will need to: 
ï§	register as a jobseeker with the national unemployment services 
ï§	submit your U2 form (former E 303 form) when you register. If you register within7 days of signing off in the country you are leaving, you will receive unemployment benefits from your date of departure 
ï§	agree to any checks made on unemployment benefits claimants in your new country, as if you were receiving unemployment benefits there. 
You are advised to find out about your rights and duties as a jobseeker in your new country. They may be very different from your rights and duties in the country where you became unemployed.""

Kind of short notice for the Swiss firm, but the US firm wanted me after only 2 weeks, I had to negotiate a bit with the folks here and agree to do a bit of part time work via phone to help out.  They already know they can't replace me easily, but they do want to try. Anyway, Thanksgiving at Mom's for me this year!! Love her stuffing!!

			Thanks    
Believe me Ive tried to look at all avenues to stay but there is no logic in it particularly financial, and there is questions as to what may happen in future with unknown disease. Its degenerative nerves but rare. So I have balance issues among others. Thus family begged me to go back home.    
If there was a way to stay I would be staying. And I even tried to come up with all sorts of excuses but it didnt prevail. LOL   
Who knows, perhaps I will be back and able to work again with plenty of questions and posts on here to keep you all busy . haha.    
BTW as far as apartment searching goes, the biggest hangup was all the doorways here are not standard height. Me being 2.05 M doesnt help the situation. Perhaps its the low rental places that have low doorways .    
Tchuss!!

You have to be flexible with dates but it was reasonably priced and the movers were friendly and efficient.

			We had a fairly good move from the US, but the unloading of our household in Zurich was rather strange and pretty much ruined the ""first impression opportunity"" with our neighbors. The container was unloaded in the Netherlands and when it arrived here in our tiny little Privatstrasse, it was carried by not one, not two but THREE trucks! Two of these trucks were the double-trailer kind. Now, we don't have that much furniture, so I'm not sure why it was necessary to spread the load. Of course the arrival was strategically timed on a Wednesday afternoon when everyone was arriving home from work. We are now known as the inconsiderate America family who has way too much furniture.

			Hi, 
I am a B permit holder staying in Zurich for the last 4 years and working in a Multinational IT Company for our banking client. However, as my contract with my client is about to expire and my parent company is unable to find out any new assignment for me, I have been asked to go back to India and start operating from Indian branch. I am a regular payer of Unemployment Insurance premium ever since I am working in Switzerland and my current B permit is tagged with my parent company. In this scenario, could anyone kindly clarify the following ?    
1.	Though I've been asked by my employer to leave Switzerland due to non availability of new assignment in my client area, is there any option of staying back and searching for jobs with the help of RAV ?   
2.	If yes, do I need to leave my present job and surrender my resident permit ?   
3.	Does RAV ( Regional Employment Centres ) help to get any kind of special visa during my job search ?   
4.	Does Unemployment Insurance have any role here to get unemployment stipend ?   
Any help/pointer should be highly appreciated.

2) you are, technically speaking, still employed for the entire time of your gardening leave. Nobody cares if you are physically here, just as nobody cares if you go on a business trip. Keep at least a room in a shared apartment in Switzerland. 
3) If the gardening leave comes to an end and you have for whatever reason not found a job... register for the RAV. Here comes the crucial part: You do not have to go there more than say three weeks before you want to get paid (so all the ""go there ASAP"" posts you find on here are uninformed - I know from personal experience). So while you do not need to go there in the first seven of the eight months... you will need to apply for jobs. At least ten a month -  from the moment on that you know you will get unemployed - basically now. Keep a record of it and show it to the RAV when you go there.   
I know this sounds like a lot of work, but in reality it isn't - pumping out the same electronic CV ten times does not really take a lot of time - even if you aren't looking for a job. So yes, even if you plan to spend the first four months on an adventure trip in Thailand - send some applications. With a little practice you will find ads that sound completely reasonabel for the RAV counsellor who isn't an IT specialist but you know that you won't get invited for an interview...

			I am also leaving on August 31st and my canton (BL) required me to pay the taxes for all three entities prior to issuing the deregistration paper. I did not pay taxes at the source though and this may make a difference.

Yes, it is less corrupt. But I dont mind petty corruption. $1 here and $3 there isnt that bad. I think Victorian homes in Kinshasa (on the water) are cheap. Mainly though we look at farm land and mining concessions etc. Morocco is a great market. I would buy now. We have seen lots of Spanish money run in there and starting to see money from other North African countries come in with the instability. Its turning into Egypt (ten years ago). We own some stuff and wish we would have bought more to be honest.    
Guinea Conakry is also priced cheaply. The old government people dumped their assets to leave the country and its kept prices down.    
The big money though is in flower and greenhouse farming in Ethiopia, believe it or not. The return on investment is amazing! We set up a large project there for a client. They fly the flowers to Amsterdam and the veggies from the greenhouse go straight to Qatar and Mauritius. Farm land in SA is way over valued, mainly because its the least corrupt place to do business. But Iowa is a better investment at this time. Rands collapsing today though! Maybe that will all change when ZAR goes to 12?    
But for civilization, Mozambique and Kenya are probably your best bet. Tanzania isnt bad, but a bit in the bush.

			Dear Pops,    
I'm Russian, so perhaps I can help you here.    
Money-wise I wouldn't recommend you to move your car in Russia, since the duties are very high.    
In your case (used car, older than 5 years, >3000 cc), the duty will be 5.7 Eur/cc = 18240 Eur + ca. 2500 Eur processing fee.    
You can check the link to the official source - though it's in Russian:      
Good news are that decent cars are expensive in Russia, so you can probably  
sell it later at a higher price partly compensating the duties.

			Hello everyone, 
I just need sm useful advice and suggestions...   
I wud be relocating to Munich pretty soon and need to send my stuff from Zurich to my new place in Munich.    
My question is: 
Can anyone here please let me know what is the cheapest way of sending the stuff (i.e. moving boxes) to Munich. I know of  
Die Schweizerische Post service of sending packages. Is there any other similar services e.g. SBB or anything like that which is cheaper and effective.    
Thank you very much for your suggestions.   
regards,   
acase

			Hi,    
Just to make sure you are not spending money for nothing I have one comment:   
At least in my rental papers say that I have to pay certain sum of money per square meter no matter I clean the house or not. I am not sure if this is typical practise in Switzerland, but I wanted to say it anyway.. So if I have to pay 7 chf per sqm, I donÂ´t want to spend too much for cleaning...

I think it helps to look at it as an excuse to have somewhere to travel and visit good friends. It is easy to keep in touch over the internet but visiting somewhere where you have never been and having friends to stay with is a real bonus.

Perhaps should organise a Neuchatel meet up with a picnic by the lake soon- to welcome your arrival. Safe journey and don't hesitate to ask for help.

			So i just spoke with DHL about sending 14 boxes of my books, cd's and personal stuff to England from Switzerland.They confused me somewhat!!!   
Firstly asking about the value and that I would have to pay a certain amount for customs to get it into the UK. Can anyone explain how that works??? 
I was quoted 800 Sfr but if I have to keep paying on top of that, it starts to get expensive.    
My flatmates moved their boxes back to Denmark for a low price and didn't seem to have any of this trouble.   
Please help!!!

			Nil, you have gone through the most emotional experience of giving birth and then gone through the stress of moving , not only house, but country too so of course you will be feeling vulnerable. 
Barcelona is a great place and once you get settled into permanent accomodation and have all your things around you - you will feel 100 times better. 
Remember that you have 2 kiddywinks and they will make the transistion into making new friends sooo much easier - get yourself out and familarise yourself with your area 
Stay strong - know that you can do it and you know that if you have a wobbly hour or so - get back on here and write and tell us about your new life...

			Hi All   
I was wondering if any of you had previous experience with this.   
I left Switzerland a year ago (for the UK) and am currently working on cashing out the non-obligatory portion of my pension.   
As part of the paperwork, one needs to prove their ""civil status"". I know that is pretty easily done in Switzerland - go to Gemeinde, pay some CHFs and voila - a certificate! But as I am in the UK, does anyone know how I could prove that I am single? It's easy enough to prove if I were  married or divorced or widowed, but how on earth do I prove I am  single??     
Any past experiences or ideas would be much appreciated!   
Cheers

			You should give written notice to your utility providers, as soon as you know your leaving date, some need minimum notice others not so. It is in your own interest as otherwise the service will still be in place after you leave and you foot the bill. 
Our ""nebenkosten"" were usually sorted out in July, but I guess that varies. Depends on the type of administration infrastructure your building has too, I suppose.

			We used Interdean for our international move so can only speak from experience. The Bruxelles end were nothing short of superb. They took endless trouble, the packaging was more than adequate and we were totally satisfied. However, the Geneva unpacking team were careless, caused damage and had a ""couldn't care less attitude""; when we pointed out some damage it was ""C'Ã©tÃ© pas nous"" - well who else would it be? It was them and eventually they admitted liability to the tune of over Â800. Whilst we can thoroughly recommend one arm of the organisation, the Swiss end uncharacteristically sadly/badly let the company down.

			I am guessing this would apply after you leave Switzerland, and are once again earning taxable US income.  So your yearly contribution could then come from money once sheltered in a Swiss account.

For that you'd be looking at Bethnal Green, Hackney, Shoreditch, Mile End etc.  I enjoyed living in Bethnal Green and Shoreditch and it's actually possible to cycle right out into the countryside (through Epping Forest).  Personally I'd never live outside the city as I'd hate the commute . . . living within a short bike ride (or even a walk) from work improved my quality of life considerably.  If you want peace and quiet and don't mind the commute then look outside London . . . you should factor transport costs into the cheaper accommodation costs.  Bear in mind that trains in the UK aren't like they are in Switzerland . . .

As far as I am aware- borders are now all completely open and we certainly have never stopped or been asked to stop. The rules for Sweden sound much the same as for the UK, but when you are on mainland Europe I think the rules are different. Good luck anyway

I believe it is taxed differently if you take it out for investing in real estate or independent work, or if you more in a non-EU country. In the second case, it could be based on a ImpÃ´t Ã  la source brackets (and in some cantons these can be quite favorable). Then my additional question is, would that be THEN taxed at the moment of importing it in the other country (in my case, US, where I am not a citizen)?

			Before you buy a used vehicle  in the UK you can check its details to see if it's been stolen, written off or has any finance outstanding against it. You can check online or by telephone using services from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and private vehicle check companies for a small fee.   
Is there such a system or any similar process in Switzerland to check the same ?

			If you want to throw away for recycling by calling the people to door, here are the steps   
First you have to book them before 3 days for pickup. 
You have to keep the things outside the house before 7am. 
The recycling truck comes to crush and clear things with 3 peopleand cost - for first 15mins 86frs then for further 128frs and on 
You would have received free 400kgs coupon from Stadt Entsorgung + Recycling for this year which you can use for those throw away items.

			I think though that after you leave Switzerland there is an extra monthly fee to keep the Swiss account open.  You can get around that if there's someone here you can get the statements sent ""care of"".  I think the post fee is reasonable, but in another thread they said the UBS / CS out of country fee was over 20 a month, which would add up.   
To the OP, do you already have a UK bank account, or no?  Once you have one set up there it's fairly easy to transfer the funds from your Swiss account electronically.

			We did the opposite and came here from HK. I LOVED HK, but for the complete opposite reasons that I love it here.   
It's dirty, smelly, crowded, muggy and constantly noisy. But it's such a vibrant and interesting place. It is a place where you can stay in your expat bubble and live very comfortably, or you can venture more into the oriental experience.   
The pollution is VERY BAD. Don't underestimate it. There are days where the kids are kept inside at school due to pollution. If anyone has asthma or skin problems, then they will be worse in HK. Also, the doctors will prescribe antibiotics and medicines more readily because the humidity and pollution make illnesses worse (I had 6 sinus infections in one year until I listened to my doctor and took medications).   
The expats are very very welcoming - we made friends really easily and quickly, and have lifelong friends from our time there. The chinese are more reserved but if you make the effort you will also get to know some locals. This is easier with the younger generation.   
There are alot of international schools BUT (and it's a big BUT), there are also long waiting lists. HKIS, for example, is one of the best but it is very hard to get into. They firstly give priority to siblings, then corporate debenture holders (ask your company if they're providing this), then private debenture holder (very expensive - can be worth more than Fr.200,000 - but is refundable upon leaving), then children coming from an American system, then AMCHAM members children, then the rest of us. Other schools can be similarly difficult to get into.    
Note that the German Swiss International School might be easier to get into if you're looking at the German stream (they also have an english stream which is also very difficult to get into as it is also one of the best). BTW, alot of schools test kids before accepting them (GSIS does). Even 3 year olds are tested at some schools.   
There are also many ESF schools which are partly private, partly govt funded. They are cheaper than private schools and work like a public school - they have to accept your child if you are native english speakers, live in their catchment area, and they have space. They are mostly good schools, but check on the number of native english speakers. They fill classes with chinese and other nationalities who want their children to have a private education. Some schools have too many non-english speakers, which results in the teachers spending alot of time on the language, and explaining work in simple terms.   
Regarding where to live. There are expats all over the place (although fewer in some parts of the New Territories). Stanley is nice and yes there would be slightly less pollution there than in Central or the Mid-levels, but it's still not good. I would work out schools before deciding where to live. Otherwise your kids could be spending over an hour on the bus. (BTW, not all the pollution comes from China. HK has alot of old trucks and cars that spew out black fumes.)   
We lived in a highrise and I also loved that. I missed the space and backyard, but our high rise (over 300 flats) was like a ready made suburb. We always met people with kids in the common areas and that's how we got to know people so quickly. The building had a big outdoor area (over 200m long) where the kids could meet and ride bikes/scooters, etc, and the parents sat outside chatting. We also had a pool, 2 outdoor playgrounds and one big indoor play area with a climbing jungle. If you have younger kids this is a haven. HK gets alot of rain, combine it with the pollution and heat, and there can be alot of days when you don't want to go out. This was a lifesaver for entertaining the kids on those types of days. We also had a gym, squash court, function rooms (for birthday parties, etc), etc.   
Most people have a live in ""helper"", which is great but it takes some getting used to. Nearly all flats/houses have a separate area/room for the helper.   
I could write so much more as it is a fantastic place, but PM me if you have more questions or want more info.   
Someone asked about Pok Fu Lam.....apart from Cyberport (huge development with lots of new flats and shopping centre, etc) it's a slightly cheaper area of HK as there is a cemetary there and the chinese don't like living near a cemetary. You get more value for your money, but again I would pick a school first. We have a friend in Pok Fu Lam and it takes her 7 year old son over an hour on the bus every day to and from GSIS. He gets on the bus at 6.20am every morning!!!!

			The general advice from me would be to give the school as much notice as possible, and hope that they are able to find another child to take your child's place...if they do that, then they should not 'reasonably' charge you fees as well...   
And yes, you signed the contract, but you may be lucky and find that they make an exception since your visa has not been renewed (I am assuming that is the situation)...   
Is it 'notice' that has to be given by 1 January, or actually withdrawing your child's enrolment ? You might be able to give notice (in writing) by the end of the month (with a registered letter via the post office dated tomorrow).... and that would meet the 'notice' before 1 January.   
I can understand a school's position - if you withdraw your child just a couple of months before the end of the school year, they are very unlikely to be able to fill the place until the new school year begins...but the staff all still need to be paid!

As there were people in line at the Abmeldung counter, I thought I could go to the Steueramt (tax office) directly first. I did, and they gave me a paper to give to the other counter. The lovely gentleman at the Abmeldung counter said that I was very clever to go to the Steueramt first, and had never had anybody else do that before.

			If it's only for one year - have you considered leaving your furniture here and buying cheap Ikea/secondhand stuff in Ireland?  I think that's likely to work out cheaper than moving everything twice.

The landlord has a year to refund your deposit. The walk through is usually done using a pre-printed checklist issued by the Houseowners Association. Generally when you leave the same checklist is used that was filled out when you took over the apartment which makes it easy to see where any deterioration has taken place.   
Normal wear and tear is subjective, however the Houseowners Association also publishes a list of expected lifetimes for appliances, floorings and wall coverings.

			Hi, I would recommend reading your lease to understand what you are obligated.  If you have questions about your specific situation, consult an attorney.  It is worth it, especially if you have a substantial security deposit.

			TEXAS! 
    Yes, I know that it is inconvieniently located in the US, but Texas has everything, and the climate that you are looking for. I do not reccomend the Houston/galveston area, but down towards Corpus Christi, there is: fishing,(deep sea and freshwater), beaches (several including clothing optional) friendly people, A cosmopolitan area nearby, and the hill country with exceptional equestrian activities. (hunting also is very big here if you like that sort of thing) I included the ""Travel Texas"" link.   
Hope to see ya'll here!

			I de-registered yesterday.  Because I will stay on in Switzerland as a ""tourist"" to be able to go to school, I was given my papers and told to give them my permit.  However I told them that until I finish work I must travel alot and require the permit for airport purposes.  They said I could keep it as long as I mail it in to them when I officially finish.

			If someone doesn't provide some conclusive information here, I'd try and de-register from the Basel-Stadt office in town. When I was here for a year under an L-permit back in 2001 I just left (or actually forgot) and tried to talk to the police at Geneva airport to which they weren't interested. Anyway, I've been back for 7 years and not had any issue--although not lived in Basel-Land since (was on a B-permit in BS and now on a C in ZH).   
Don't forget to cancel other items such as television licence, etc. I've heard some nasty stories.

If you live in the city, traffic is not a problem.  The transit system is not what it is in Switzerland, not by a long-shot.  But it's not bad at all by normal standards.  The medical system is fine.  My GP has always been able to see me on quick notice and I've never known anyone to suffer a long wait for anything urgent.  Low salaries?  I guess that depends on what you do for a living, but my sense is that the standard of living is high relative to other large cities.  Winters in Toronto such (although global warming is taking the bite out of them), the mountains are impossibly distant and you can be afflicted with urban stress, true.  But it's a great city.  Not nearly all doom and gloom like this reviewer says.

			April,  what is your nationality ?  If you have a EU passport you shouldn't need major paperwork to enter Spain.  If you don't, make sure you triple-check your country's VISA agreement standing with Spain, as they could very well stop you at the border and have you turn around.  You can leave the country with NO paperwork done at all, except you should always: 
1) De-register 
2) Pay off any and all debts 
3) Remember to cancel all services you have hired (cable, phone, internet, Bilag, insurance, cell phone, etc) 
4) Since you are moving INTO the EU, Spain will require a whole bunch of documents to accept your importing so many household goods.  Chances are that, since they are used and they are your household items, you won't pay any type of tax.  Nonetheless the paperwork needs to be done.  These requirements you should look for in a Spanish website, not on the Swiss end. 
5) Super important if you ever want to go back to Switzerland: give them a forwarding address for them to send you your closing income tax statement.   
Moving company:  I have moved internationally with Grabel once, and with Ward van Lines twice.  I like Ward, but they might be expensive.  If you are seriously thinking about moving on your own, I think I remember Hertz having moving trucks.  About the same size as U-Hauls.   
Hope this helps a bit.

No - not everybody buys new. And not everybody is comfortable living on borrowed money. Second hand market is not big here, unfortunately. I've never seen big furniture sections in thrift stores here. It is so much more interesting to find the odd talking pieces among the thrift store furniture than go shopping new, esthetics that are different, furniture bought very far away that used to matter to somebody else, garage sales, etc...That chic idea didn't pick up here yet. Plus, it is so much greener to recycle.    
I wish Salvation Army here took some normal furniture, I can't stand most of the smelly stiff ugly antique stuff. Most of it has no value, anyways, and is as kitchy as you can get.

			A while ago i was tinkering with almost the same situation as yours.   
From what I understand, in your situation, you have the following choices: 
1. return to your home country and apply for Poland visa 
2. wait for your residence permit      
I am no expert, thus I stand corrected and suggest that you contact the authorities.

			I think a lot of the complaints you are referring to are just regarding minor issues and don't necessarily indicate overall unhappiness. I can't help but feel homesick sometimes,  but I know I want to be here and certainly would never consider quitting and going home. I like the idea of reminders of the positives of living here but also enjoy a bit of harmless moaning.

			You should probably check the Finance section of this forum, as I think this has already been answered.   
A few things to note.   
I don't think you can ""withdraw"" the full amount.   
I believe this applies to pillars 2 and 3, but not 1. 
If you are going to EU, I think it has to stay in the pension. 
Also, it must be a primary residence, and not sure if it works for already purchased property.

you have to fill out the forms here

			We used Luker Brothers moving here, they were very good (and not too pricey - 1000 GBP for an ""austere"" three bed flat) 
They were extremely professional, yet friendly, everything was handled well (only a couple of dents in a cot bed). 
Has anyone used europeremovals.co.uk ?

			Hello, 
I would consider not taking the furniture back with you. Maybe sell the stuff before you leave. Just take your personal bits and pieces. Honestly, the cost and hassle of trying to transport such a small amount of furniture is probably not worth the headache, the time, and the expense.  
Do you know where you are moving into when you get to the UK? A lot of rental places provide fully or partly furnished rooms. 
The cost of replacing the stuff in the UK will not be that much. 
Unless your furniture is valuable or antique or of sentimental value, I would leave it here. 
Good luck with your move!

			I hear you. And that's another landlord who won't rent to foreigners! And the landlords whom he is friends with and so on. Communities are tight here.   
So, it's not just his reputation at stake it's the reputation of a group of people - auslanders, expats, you and me.   
Unlike you, there ae people here who believe that having enjoyed their time in Switzerland they have a responsibility to preserve the acceptance of foreigners by the locals and that it would be very selfish to act in a way that disadvantages their fellow expats.   
As far as I read in the OP, the friend recovered the lost deposit money from the insurance company.    
So if their worst fear does come true and the landlord eats up all the deposit with real or made up repairs then as long as the insurance company has contact details then the money will eventually be returned.   
One thing I will say about last year (actually summer of 2008) is that the price of oil was at it's highest and there will almost certainly be additional nebenkost.    
One last thing. Maybe the OP might want to have the option of returning to CH and rent another apartment!

			i think the OP stated that he can't do it (for whatever reason). 
What are potential options: 
- go to IKEA and ask one of the employees if they'd do it after work in exchange of money. 
- put an ad in any Migros or Coop. 
- ask students (they look for money) in your building, neighbourhood 
- ask the local grocery if he knows someone 
- post an ad in EF: looking for someone to unmount IKEA furniture   
important is that you should be in the apartment when the work is done. 
As you are going to pay, I think it won't be a problem to find someone.

Ever been over a weekend to Geneva ?   Quite different and almost in France   ( + many Maghrebine restaurants)   
Been over a weekend in Lugano / Milano ?   So much of a difference !   
Been over a weekend in the Alsace, with the cities of Colmar and Strassburg ?     
Or to Munich over a weekend ?     
Or take the train to Basel and go per EasyJet for a weekend to Paris    
The advantage of Zurich is its proximity to other places, and so ought to be used.    
And, do you swim ?   the many ""Badis"" on the Lake of Zurich, Lac LÃ©man (Lake of Geneva), or Bodensee (Lake of Constance) are always nice. Two favourites of me are the Badi to get to from the Paquis quarter of Geneva where you while swimming have the fountain in sight !  The other one is in Friedrichshafen just across from Romanshorn, an almost gigantic one with a good restaurant   
and stop comparing London and Zurich. As London is a real world metropolis while Zurich and Geneva are just ""assuming"" regional metropolitan centres.

969	01.03.2010, 22:08	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: geneva	"    Hi Kmacgregor, 
I might want to dwell upon your case here!   
My scenario: Me & my wife are on L Permit (due for renewal by June this year). Its an L-L extension, so I am not foreseeing any major issues with that..fingers crossed  
Since my spouse cannot work on a dependent L , she's planning to leave Zurich for a period of at least 6 months..around July'10 and coming back around Jan '11.   
Would anyone reckon that she de-registers herself, so as not to be troubled while entering Switzerland again in January next year, considering that she would still hold a valid L Permit at that time.   
Additionally - I am not planning to stop her Insurance premium as it might complicate the matters. Its as if she just went out on a vacation for around 6-7months and came back happy .   
The reason for all this is to avoid the lengthy visa process again (if she deregisters) as she would anyways be converted from L-B next year by June 11 and by then she can   look forward to find some work here .   
Any pointers would be well appreciated.   
P.S: I went to my Gemiende and they were of the opinion that you must ask the Immigration authorities about this.

Public transport is very doable with a stroller just dont go anywhere near the tube at rush hour -- it can get very jammed. My wife went to kiddie events and markets all over London with no prob.

One of the neighbours called the police. We went to the police station (with a friend to interpret). They explained that the local law stated you were only allowed to put out the paper from 18:00 the night before collection. I asked whether it would be alright if we collected the paper and cardboard that evening, and the following evening put it back. The police officer agreed that we could do that. He said if we did, then we probably wouldn't get a fine. I got the impression he considered the neighbours' complaint to be rather a waste of time. Everyone in the police station found our suggestion highly amusing.   
The neighbours who'd made the complaint looked on smugly while we collected the paper, carefully seperating out what wasn't ours, and put it into the back of our car. They looked so sick when we returned the next day and unloaded it all...    
On the night we visited the cop shop, there had been a break-in at a local jewellers. Police were unable to attend as they were dealing with a serious littering incident.   
So - do check with your local police whether it's ok to leave it out early. Some communities are fine with it.

I am a masters student in Basel, and have been here for more than a year now. My program is coming to an end early next year, and i intend to leave here by March 2010.    
I have some things which i would like to send home to Banjul, The Gambia, and i was wondering if someone on the forum can help with information regarding this. I would most prefer to put my stuff in someone's container, if there is space for about 3 boxes. Also, if someone knows a Gambian who ships things to Gambia, can you please link me up with him or her? thank you!

			helloÂ¨ I am new to the forum so not quite sure how it works yet! 
my husband and I are leaving Switzerland early March but as yet do not have a clue what we need to do to leave.  We have just been told that the day that we sign and leave our apartment we will no longer have any insurance for medical or anything.  is this right?  We do not yet have an address to go to in UK.  We will be homeless until we can find something, and that is not easy just before Christmas.   
Has anyone any idea what we should do? We have also been told that we have to give up the car straight away (how do we actually leave then?)   
We need a starting point! 
any tips gratefully received.

			What about your pension? When you deregister you can claim it back in cash! Cause if you skipped the country your not likely to get it...

Keeping in touch, Well frankly speaking I only know 2 Singaporeans well in Switzerland. But now that I have more free time handing my work over, I am starting to find out more. I am in Sg at the end of this month, and I have an empty suitcase coming back. So if anyone is interested....?

			As land is scarce in Singapore, you may want to check out the rental market as part of your consideration.    provides pictures of apartments' interior and you will have some idea of what you can get for your price range.  Most private apartments come with swimming pool, gym and tennis courts (you should not have to pay extra for their usage as it is part of rental).  And they come furnished.   
Food is very cheap - 5 CHF gets you a bowl of wanton noodles plus drinks (soft drinks/fruit juices).

			Speaking as a European citizen, I had to wait until ""a certain age"" before applying and being subsequently awarded my small pension. Had to fill in pages and pages of information [natch] accompanied by copies of relevant documentation and the original grey AHV booklet. But after a few weeks of procrastination, they finally started to pay the month after my birthday. Don't know whether this helps you in your situation, but it may help others.

			Try Bridging Cultures Relocation (if you Google that you should find them).  They offer departure services to help people out who are leaving.

			Oh dear....(at the village life bit.)  Cazz makes a mental note not to settle in one...   (we plan to move to CH in the next year or two - once economies start picking up basically.)   
Both hubby and I  speak German (we lived in Germany for 10 years) and husband is from Kosovo so we will need to pick somewhere to settle wisely methinks.  Am a wee bit worried about the general sentiment towards Yugoslavians in general but I guess this is one downside of CH that we will need to come to terms with.  Thinking about it, those kind of attitudes towards foreigners are not that much different to the UK really and hubby has done well here and has been accepted into the fold by his  colleagues so I should have a little more faith in mankind I suppose.

			Thanks for the help, i have read most of the information from the link you provided, plus other links i found in that thread.  However, i don't think i have a clear answer.  Allow me to expand a bit.   
I am a Canadian, i have been living and employed in CH for 4 years now. 2 years on an L permit, and 2 on a B permit (albeit, i have had a BVG account for only the past 2 years...  don't ask) so the value in the BVG account is not very much.  Myself and employer have only been paying in the minimum amount per month. (ca. 170 CHF each)   
I will be leaving CH, and moving to the UK. (yes, and EU state, but i am NOT an EU citizen).  In the UK, i will be going to University full time. So there is not a new BVG style account to transfer my current one to. Remember, i will not be a permanent resident of the UK either.   
Bottom line: what can i do with the 2 years of contributions to my CH BVG account?  Can i get the money? should i transfer it to a vested account? should i do that in Schwyz Canton? (for tax reasons) ???

			I got both my health insurance and car insurance re-imbursed when I sent them a letter that I was leaving the country a few years back.   
Now that I'm looking into moving back to CH, I got a bunch of quotes through these guys:    
Moving out: all depends on your contract. Moving dates could be anything from 3 dates a year to any last day of the month. Notice period is usually 3 months. If you can move out on any end of month and you give notice today, you will pay rent until 30.06.09.   
Deposit: tricky one. In theory, you should get your deposit back minus any expenses the landlord has to make for repairs over and above wear and tear. There's been books written about this and you can find plenty of threads to help (or scare) you.   
Good luck!   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Finally time to leave..	Brady	Posts: 6	2,048	2	Leaving Switzerland

			Thank you so much for the advise. I certainly think that i will try and get another accountant to look at my books and try and reduce the amount. Its been abit of a kick in the balls moving to switzerland financially but i am happy to be moving back to somewhere i understand so its not all bad. 
Thanks once again.

1010	11.01.2008, 12:46	Member	Thanked 14 Times in 12 Posts	Location: Finland	"    It is indeed a good question and the answer... Yes you can as a quirk of the Swiss system - if you do this when you leave and not 6 months down the line. I will go and try and find the relevant law text at some point over the weekend...
