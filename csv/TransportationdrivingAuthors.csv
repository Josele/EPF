			Insurance for the drive from England to Switzerland was by my current Swiss insurer, die Mobiliar. I already had one car insured with them, as well as my home contents.    
I literally just phoned up the agent, told him what I was doing, and he organised the temporary cover.    
I did need to provide all information about the car; make, model, colour, build date, engine, VIN, etc, they emailed a confirmation that afternoon that the car was insured for the drive.   
Mind you, I didn't ask them,  , maybe that makes a difference.

			I have asked out converting US driver's license, however was told it's not possible since it's expired before I got here.    
Will it be just a driving test or with theory as well? I do intend to get a tutor to have a better feel of how the test will go.

			One point worth making is that describing the SBB as the Swiss railway network is a little misleading and can cause confusion. While the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways) has by far the largest rail network and is regarded as Switzerland's national railway operator, there are a multitude of other operators both large and small. You'll especially find that if you venture onto the mountain railways they're all private operators, as are light rail operators like the Forchbahn (Zürich's S18 line). Some of these operators have extensive networks, such as the combined network of the Matterhorn-Gotthard-Bahn and the Rhätische Bahn - most famous as the route of the Glacier Express.   
However - don't worry about it! With a very few exceptions your half-fare card or GA is valid on pretty much anything that runs on rails. Just don't be put off or confused when you find yourself looking at a train or a station that doesn't have SBB branding.

			Could anyone tell me when the Abgastest should be done?   
I moved my car from Luxembourg to Switzerland last weekend. I have paid the Zoll, arranged insurance and now need to go to the STVA to present my paperwork and get a date for the inspection.   
Do I need to have the Abgastest done first?   
With many thanks for your help!

			Why is it that when someone asks an honest question on this forum, there's so much $ bashing ? Is there some subliminal pi$$ing contest going on here ? This guy wants a bit of information (possibly some consolation) and people are taking the mickey because he had a nice car ? Sounds really unpleasant. 
I was asked a question about my rental budget and got a similar reply ""you'll do ok on your xxxk CHF a year salary"". 
Personally I feel sorry for anyone who has an accident (scary), loses their means of transport (inconvenient), and has to deal with a nasty legal situation afterwards. 
Anyone here heard of compassion? Sympathy? Or are you all just weighing your personal wealth against each other? 
GET A GRIP! 
To the guy who posted this to his 'friends on the forum', I hope you're ok. Don't grieve over the material stuff (replaceable), and try not to fret over the legal business. If they're going to fine you, they will. Glad you're in one piece ...

			The other week I forgot to purchase my ticket when I was on the train for the add on part of my journey (I have a ZVV Bonus pass but live 2 stops outside of the zone) and didn't do it until I had passed the station.   I was told by the conductor that as I hadn't bought it before it left the station (first station of the add on section) then I was liable for a fine.  She let me off this time but said the ticket does show as invalid on their system.

			Marktkauf is right on the border.  The tram stop going there is in Germany, the tram stop coming back is in Switzerland.   
A few weeks ago the rules change, and the GA is no longer valid once the tram leaves Switzerland.  So you either need to buy a ticket for one stop, or just risk it on the way out.  On the way back your GA is fine.   
I don't know what type of ticket you need to buy as I've never had a GA.  For people without a GA it's a 2-zone ticket (half-tax valid); you need something called a Connecting Ticket for Fr.2.70.  If you were going right into Weil, the price would be the same but on the way back you'd need to buy a one-zone RVL ticket to get you back to the border where your GA would then take over.

			Law regarding admission to traffic for any vehicle is SR 741.41   (no English version, you can change language in the following links at top right to French and Italian if that helps)

They are classified as Motorfahrräder (Motor bicycles). The classification is important for traffic rules. 
They may have up to 2kW (that is 2000 Watt), a top speed of driven on its own of 20 km/h, or may give electro support up to 25 km/h.   
Special traffic rules that apply to them (apart from the normal, like priority from the right, red lights, etc.)

The rules for Belgium are here :-     
Many people will have renewed a UK license whilst living abroad, because they have an 'address', the renewal would have been fraudulently obtained as they are not resident at the address although they declare they are. It could turn nasty if anyone ever investigated.

			I actually just exchanged GB license for CH one last week.  I went down the police MFK office last Thursday.  They took by GB license and gave me a stamped sheet of paper saying I could drive in CH for the rest of the week (until 7th).  They mentioned that I could only drive in CH.   
I received my new CH license in the post on Monday or Tuesday.   
I assume you would be fine, only issue I could see is if you have an accident and the insurance try to claim you are between licenses and as such are not covered.

			Nubat,   
In your situation I would have handed the plates back the second I was unable to use the bike, thus stopping the charges and any requests for tests. Many bikers hand in their plates for the winter months as they have no intention of using the bike.   
I have ""switch"" plates, that can be freely swapped between two cars. I use an old Rover during Winter and switch the plates to my Lotus, which I only drive on dry roads when there's no salt. That saves quite a lot of money each year, both in road taxes and insurance.   
Of course, the unplated vehicle has to be kept off the road but most places have underground garages. But don't forget to put the plates back on the car you're about to drive, as both I and my wife have done on a few occasions. Luckily we haven't been caught (yet!)

You can control the RPM in each gear. You control when you want to change it and not the car. You can even reduce from 4th to 2nd gear if you want to (hopefully you know what are you doing when doing this kind of reductions in a car).

No frills such as coffee or a waiting room, no spare car while yours is being fixed, but we've always found him to be honest, reasonably priced and as he's always very busy it's clear that others think so too.

			Hello everyone, I have been stalking on this forum for a few years and have gleaned lots of good information; thanks for that. I would like to give back by providing recent information about my experience importing a used car into Switzerland.   
In summary, I would say it is not worth importing a used car unless it is in tip-top shape and you got a really good deal on it, or it is perhaps a very pricey car that is close to new and selling for a good price. You need to do all the research on import costs and consider the extra hassle and decide if the savings is worth that hassle. There are definite risks of importing an older car: it may not pass a smog (Abgas) test or it may not pass inspection (MFK), resulting in repairs which may be too costly to fix, leaving you stuck with a customs bill and no legal car.   
This post,  , has some good information but was originated several years ago, so I thought I would update with my experience.   
My friend in Germany wanted to sell his mother's car (she is too old to be driving), a 1998 Audi A4. That's right, I said 1998! It was banged up a little bit because her driving skills had degraded to an almost dangerous point. However, it had passed the German fitness test within the past year and my friends had made sure it was functionally taken care of (regardless of the remaining body dings!), and it had winter tires included. I spent some time evaluating whether it would even be worth it to import it since there would be additional effort and cost. In my observation, Swiss used cars are reasonably priced and you can get them with MFK, snow tires, etc. so you can avoid extra hassles.   
What made me go with the buying the Audi is that they only were charging 500. I did a preliminary cost estimate as follows: 
Car: 500 
Certificate of Conformity:  100 
Import Tax 12%: 60 
Import Duty (12-15 chf per 100kg): 120 
Swiss Import Administration fee: 20 
MFK & Emissions test: 150 
Total Estimate: 950 
I used euros for simplification even when the figures came in CHF. It was only an estimate and the exchange rate was not far from parity at the time.   
Some facts in my favor: I was allowed by my friend to take the car with the owner's German plates and was covered by their insurance during the import process. Normally, the buyer may have to obtain temporary export plates from Germany at an additional cost. If you do so, allow plenty of time of plate duration, say 3-4 weeks for the entire process. Temporary insurance would also be then required. I thought originally that I might need it, but my Swiss agent could not help me obtain any. I stopped looking for it when I found I would be covered with the car's German insurance. I also had to consider the export process out of Germany, and my research showed if the car was 500 or less and less than 1,000 kg I would be exempt from a written declaration. My German language skills are at the beginner level so I decided to have my German friend check. He was told by customs that no paperwork is required when a car is exported as a result of a private sale.   
For the Certificate of Conformity, I picked up this site,  , from this forum. However my German friend researched and found out I could go directly to VW (controls Audi now) to get the CoC for a lower cost. I went to that site and ordered the CoC - and it was free! I could only speculate why...perhaps because it was an older car.   
Next, we tried to get a EUR.1 certificate, which exempts us from the import duty, but we gave up after hitting dead ends. Perhaps this is where a dealer can do a better job.   
Also an import declaration is required. This must be done electronically at   which is not available  in English. I used Google Chrome to help me translate. If you abhor forms, you may want to skip this part and use a customs broker. I am not sure how to find one and I have heard they can cost 150 and up even for a simple import. I was able to fill out the form with the required info but their system would not accept it. However, their car import process video explained it could be done onsite, so I decided to do that.   
Finally we were ready to take the car across the border. We chose Waldshut/Koblenz as the car was coming from that area and that is a well-staffed border. It was a little tricky finding the right place to take the car to, but we finally got there. It helped that my wife speaks good German. We then went to the customs desk, armed with these papers: 
- Contract of Sale (found one online in German) 
- Certificate of Conformity 
- Import Declaration filled out, but not yet certified 
- German vehicle registration (2 different documents, a small and a large) 
- Personal identification   
Since the import declaration had not been certified, they directed us to a computer down the hallway that we could use. I went through the same process I had done online but could not get the darn thing to go through! My wife grabbed a customs guy in the hallway, and explained to him that we were having trouble. He quickly looked at it, fiddled with it, and also could not get the system to accept it. He was going on a break, so he asked one of his co-workers to help. He also struggled with it (mentioning in the meantime that they are not required to help us) and finally figured out the system did not like such a low sales value for a car! He was suspicious of the value also, even though we explained it was old and dinged up. ""Doesn't matter"", he said. He did some more machinations on the form and voila, it went through. Then they printed it out. We still needed one  more thing, a stamp from German customs (just across the hallway) indicating we had indeed exported the car. Got that, then the administrative processor also questioned the value of the car (they like higher, of course) but her supervisor said that it was not unreasonable given the age of the car. Paperwork got finished, then on to pay tax and duties. Tax was as expected but duties were much higher because I made an error on the weight of the car (info from the wrong box of the German registration). The extra cost of duties was balanced out by the free CoC. First major step done! The car now was fully imported.   
Next, we needed to get a smog (Abgas) test. The price varies widely, per my research. Likely because this need is fading, with newer cars using On-board diagnostics for real-time emissions monitoring, acceptable by the Swiss in lieu of an Abgas test. I found a place that would do it for $75, which matched my research. It turned out to be $125 because they claimed the older cars like mine go through a two stage test, plus they had to get a new Agbas test booklet, which my car never needed before, not ever being Swiss. I paid and was happy that part was successful.   
Last was the MFK test. I was able to arrange the appointment after uploading some required documents online to Strassenverkehrsamt Zurich. I was given an appointment for about one week after. I was really nervous about this one. After reading forum posts here with horror stories of clean cars claimed to be dirty and nitpicking inspectors with bad moods, I was expecting the worst. We cleaned up the car inside and out best that we could, and there were no fluid leaks to raise a red flag. We drove in 10 minutes ahead of the appointed time, and they took us right away. They put us on the lift, banged around underneath and swiveled the steering back and forth. Then it was on to the shaking machine and the light testing room. After that, the tester took over the driving and I got in the back seat. He quickly mentioned, in German, that he noticed alot of rust but nothing was rusted through, and he would likely pass the car. He then drove the car on their test track like a bat out of hell and then slammed on the brakes. We were still alive, so I guess we passed that part! He finally worked up the last of the paperwork, mentioning that in his opinion the car may not make it through another test in 2 years or so. Overall he was not as thorough as I expected him to be, though I was glad the car was ready. We took all the paperwork to the exit desk, signed a release on the German plates (since we were giving them back directly to the original owner) and were given a new Swiss registration document. I had kept the plates from my last car and brought them with me to complete the changeover. However, the plate holders on the car were for German plates, which are a different size. No problem, just put the Swiss plates in the window, they tell me. Drove away all done and happy that nothing major got in the way.   
In the end, costs came in close enough to my estimate, although I still don't have confirmation on the MFK test cost, done a few weeks ago. I am not sure I would go through all this again, but as I said before the car was cheap and good enough so I think it was worth it in this instance. If I had a regular day job, I definitely would not have attempted it regardless. Happy to answer any related questions.

So green is not so green when you look at the big picture. 
Anyway, it is not relevant for the OP until you can buy hydrogen and oxygen at a Landi filling station.

I'm aware of financial implications of such service. Even though i'm technically quite capable, i have no garage neither tools to do it myself.  
Replacement gearbox (new one) is insanely expensive.  
Buying a different used car with gearbox most likely worn off the same way is not an option too.

Main dealers avoid it by ""offset"", basically 1 Ferrari would be equivalent to 30 Fiat 500's, so the the tax for main dealers is carefully avoided. Cute, screw the private dealers, hence why you find so many cars avaialble in Germany with few km and all 6-7 months old.   
Extended warranty, all cars sold in EU come with 2 years i beleive, you can always add on additional  manufacturers warranty for payment, once again, for mine, 2 extra years was around Chf 2k

			Really really bad: the VW / Porsche garage in Thalwil. After a service my beautiful green car looked all smudgy and had pale/whitish spots and pale/whitish water trail marks. Much like you sometimes see with non-metallic red cars that have been out in the sun too much. Garage polished it free of charge but spots returned after a week. About two years later I traded it in for my current car.

And my mate's E-Type is also pretty noisy but not unpleasantly so, I lack the technical lingo to describe it but I guess it's like the difference between a well-rounded single malt whisky and Four Roses. The sound from an Aston or a Maserati is just more ""rounded"" and typically more of a grumble from a big dog that doesn't need to bark to be impressive.    
Meanwhile, the typical ultra-modified Fiat Punto / Audi A1 / BMW (older models, as you can't mess around with leased cars too much) that are driving around in noisy circle in Oerlikon remind me of a yappy dog that go hold of a megaphone. You can hear how every last inch of power is squeezed out to make up for... whatever. Lawnmowers on steroids spring to mind. It's just sad.    
And then there are the F-Types and the new Lambos, whose sole purpose seems to be to annoy the flip out of everyone around you - which is a shame for the former, 'tis a nice-looking car. Mind you, I'm not sure the whole ""you are just boring and jealous, these cars just make that much noise"" thing is valid. I have two close neighbours with new Lamborghinis but I have only ever heard one of them, he insists on accelerating out of his garage at full pelt and then gunning up the 30 zone street. You always know when he comes home too, same noisy procedure backwards, even at 3 am on a weekday. I only just spotted the other guy a few weeks ago, cruising along in relative quiet, and mentioned it to another neighbour. He laughed and said ""yeah, he's the best known sports car driver - the local police are amazed at how considerate his driving is, it makes him stand out more than all the others with their idiotic showboating"".

			You'd also have the expense of getting winter tyres for it and possibly Daylight Running Lights as well which are obligatory here.  Buy a good used car here and you should be able to get both with some negotiation on the tyres.   
Yes, it'll take a while to get used to having the stick shift on the other side, but it's doable and a lot easier than having to get out of the car in the rain/snow/sleet to get a ticket at an outdoor car park or having to get out to put the paid one into the machine on the way out.  Did that a few years ago in reverse - hubby was in hospital in the UK and there was no way I could reach the ticket machines from the driver's side in our Swiss Qashqai so was always having to hop in and out when entering/leaving the car park.  And yes I did get wet a couple of times when it was raining.

			Pity you got the wrong engine type....   
After carefull study I ordered a bike with a motor on the crank for my GF (for engine, see  )   
I'm building an electric bike at home for myself, in the course of this I did some calculations. Too get a bit more technical, it turns out that    
Power_losses / Power_delivered is proportional to 1 / engine_speed^2   
So, for a certain delivered power level the losses reduce with the engine speed squared.    
Going uphill the rear-wheel engine of your stromer runs at a low speed, losses are high. At high speed all is OK as this greatly reduces the losses (at 30 kmh the losses are only 1/9 of those when you go uphill at 10kmh, assuming same delivered power)   
With the engine at the crank however there driver will always select a gear where the crank rotates at around 60 to 80 rpm, independent of the actual road speed. This means the engine can be optimised much easier, the range of speeds it works at is small. Because of the selected gear engine speed will always be high, also for going uphill.   
This was comfirmed by the bike shop where we ordered my GF's bike. They went up the Uetliberg with similar bikes, one with the BionX wheel engine and another with the Bosch crank engine. The range of the BionX was much smaller than of the Bosch engine (even though battery capacity is very similar). Indicative of power_loss, the BionX engine got very warm while the Bosch engine stays cool. The difference in efficiency is so big that the regeneration of energy as performed by the BionX did not compensate for its low efficiency (the Bosch crank engine has no regeneration).

			Regardless of the logistics, I can suggest bringing the car over. We brought our car over from London and the process was not that painful. (I can't remember the exact process, but something like: import it, which involved some paperwork and a guy checking the chassis number and then the MFK, which we initially failed, but the points were easy to rectify and then we got the plates) We arranged insurance, which wasn't affected by the RHD status and off we went. Remember to swap your license within 12 months, which again is pretty simple and you're done. Regarding RHD, we drove ours for 4 years here with few issues. Sure, at parking barriers you need to clamber or get one of those grabber things and if you want to sell the thing, you might as well push it in the lake, but if it's paid off and you need a car for shopping and the odd trip, hold onto it. The alternative is selling it in the UK (Assume you get 38 pence) and buy a car here. (Assume slightly more than 38 pence) Don't let people scare you, it's not that complicated. Check on the headlights though. We had a BMW, where we could adjust the headlights from RHD to LHD. You may need to swap yours out.

Yup, I know all the possibilities around there with public transport, my parents live still in my home village of Münchenbuchsee, and we already talked about that.

Only 2 weeks into her working there, they already had an attempted robbery to deal with......   
Another way would be via Biel-Bern-Ittigen Papiermühle and then the bus up to Chappelisacher, but then she would have to trudge through any weather for a further 30 minutes to get to work and not to mention the time on public transport.    
And there is also the possibilty to go with public transport via the Farmers University   Rüti, but this is still quite some way away.   
Ah well, it is only this coming winter where the problem exists, as soon as she gets her drivers license, she'll buy a cheap, small  car.    
This is  exactly why I forewent anything and everything to allow her and her sisters to save up for just an occasion like this.   
It is no skin of my nose to swap my kitchen apron for a chauffeurs livery     "	null	null	null	Tips for driving 125ccm Motor Scooter in Winter	guest	null

			Just in case anyone interested. Called Allianz, then made quite a few calls to Hertz, sent them some more details and eventually they managed to find that French lady, called her and she confirmed the collision. Finally Allianz told me that they will settle the bill now. Phew...   
Thanks everyone for advice.

			What the guy wants to do, I think, is have the car checked over and any faults identified now so he can claim for the repair on the warranty which expires soon.  I don't think he ever asked ""should I extend the warranty"", even if it might be a good idea.   
If there are no error codes showing up and the car is running fine, I seriously doubt any garage will find something for which the warranty will pay out on, even if they do an oil analysis.  Tearing down the engine just to have a look also wouldn't be cost effective, unless they did in fact find something, but the car would already be telling you that.   
I'd google for common problems on this model and decide what to do about warranty extension then.  Beware though, I did it for my E46 and it only made me feel sick.  I think the newer models have fewer problems.

			Hi   
I just wanted to drop by again and thank you all for your input here. We survived our first big road trip and ferry (I say that as one of the kids was scared stiff and convinced we would all die at sea when we first mentioned it &#128563  and it was thankfully a great success.   
Unfortunately the hotels in Luxembourg recommended above both had maximum room occupancy of 3, including kids. So we ended up staying at the Novotel Metz Hauconcourt on the journey north. Dated, basic, with a mediocre restaurant, but relatively cheap and functional, gated parking and important for us: family rooms to sleep 4 and very easy to get to just off the motorway. For anyone wanting a swimming pool, it also has one, but outdoors, so save that for summer.   
The drive back from Zeebrugge to Zurich we did in one day and took us 10 hours on the nose, with a stop for lunch at the big services just before leaving Luxembourg and a couple short toilet stops after that.    
I'm not sure I'd want to do that drive up to the ferry in one stretch, especially to Zeebrugge which leaves earlier than the Rotterdam ferry, but maybe we're just not seasoned road trippers yet 😉

144	08.10.2016, 18:24	Forum Legend	Thanked 4,135 Times in 2,105 Posts	Location: Ostschweiz	"    Your explanations and background info are most welcome, it's exactly what I'm looking for so I get an idea of what I'm doing and where the pitfalls are. Thank you all very much.   
The tyres have a remark of ""615 kg max load"" on them, which covers the Fahrzeugausweis entry (448kg max load). They're indeed marked 91V.   
I'd prefer to not change the diameter of the tyre as otherwise I'd need to adapt to differing speedo readings, it already shows considerably more than the actual speed. Assuming possible/available, would it make sense to change to 195/55 R16 (resulting in a slightly lower speedo reading? that amount would be ok) to increase pressure on the contact area to shorten braking distance?   
Is there any info missing to determine rim specs? Or does it make little sense to do so as I'll be calling some garages in the coming days in the hope of getting OEM rims to avoid COC issues?

			Quite simply if you're not properly equipped for prevailing conditions, then you are deemed guilty by default if you have an accident, both by the police for blame determination and the insurance company for payments   
Not having proper and adequate tires in cold or snowy conditions is considered as not being properly equipped.

			This Forum was set up to aid expats and serves as a database for innumerable problems that people encounter in their everyday life.    
If you notice I posted the links about properly reporting an accident, after the insurance had agreed to settle. The reason was to discourage anyone in future from simply leaving their mobile number on a piece of paper.    
The law says the owner of the damaged property must be informed ""immediately"" which is why you have to hang around for a bit in case he was on a short local errand, and then it can't be ""immediate"" any longer, can it?

There is an option of taking the test in English. And I would pick that option, if I get the study materials in English.  
I would be very grateful if someone gives a suggestion.

			I've seen a really appealing ad with a Renault V6 3.0dCi engine, namely this one:    
Price seems to be good. I'd really like the engine, but this is the newer renault-nissan V9X diesel and I hardly am able to find any reliability stats about it. Spritmonitor has exactly 2 of these cars listed.   
Any traps with larger diesel engines (that don't come with the smaller 2.0 ones)? Basic insurance does not really get more expensive, road tax rises by about 200 CHF yearly.   
Maybe the kind gearheads in the forum could help dig up something. Also, I'm abroad until the 6th Oct, if someone in the area would help me check out this car (without buying it first  ).

Anything else cannot be used fraudently against her, but if she is nervous, she could block out her name and address, as this is not relevant to the car's specification.    
How are customers going to visit the car if she doesn't give a name and address? Personally I would be suspicious if asked to meet the seller in a car park....

On this website   you can look up timetables. 
Best is to choose non-rush-hour, such as Sunday morning at 10h, when not so many people are out and about. 
After you've entered the departure and destination, etc., click on ""find a connection"". 
Choose the option with the least number of changes. 
Now scroll down and you will see, below the timetable, the option ""barrier-free travel"".  If you click on that, you will be guided towards pavement-level trains, trams and buses, so that you can move easily.   
Good idea to strap the mattress up, cover it well with plastic (just in case it rains) and then bind the whole thing to a trolley, so you can just wheel it into and out of the public transport.   
If you smile at people waiting at the stop - well before the tram arrives or well before you reach your stop - and ask them for their help, you will most likely find that people will gladly assist you in your enterprise.

""Anschliessen"" means you cannot use a four zone extension to travel from Rolle to Nyon if you have Zone 11/12 as your home zone. There must allways be a way back to your home zone through at most four zones.   
In your case you need a 6 zone eextension. This is good for the travel to Romainmotier in Zone 112 and also covers the second trip to Chexbres in Zone 64/71.   
At the machine it is simple: Select extension ticket, 6 Zones, whole day, demi or full tarif, pay, take ticket and change.

It's doubly aggravating because Aussie friends of ours swapped theirs and got their Oz licences back with a sticker on them saying not valid in CH.   
UK insurers also view a  CH licence as an international one, because EEA, making it even harder to get insurance. Mind you, some of the ones I called were initially adamant that CH was in the EU until I got a couple of sheepish calls back. I tried the Schengen and same land mass as France and Germany approach: nothing.   My last ditch  ""but Switzerland is in Eurovision"" argument fell on stoney ground too.

			I have an electric RC plane that requires the rather hefty 400g lipo battery to be secured to the the fuselage using the included velcro straps. One day I was so busy chatting with a spectator on the field that I forgot to properly secure it.       
Take off and all was well, so decided to do a lazy loop and just as I was pulling out of the loop the unsecured battery worked its way loose, flopped out of the fuselage and plummeted towards earth.    
With no power, and tail heavy (thanks to the departed battery) the plane was effectively an expensive rock. It was at that moment that I muttered 'Oh Cock!' or words to that effect, because there is something quite poetic about seeing the fruits of your stupidity unfold in front of your eyes, in this case a model plane that took several weekends to build, tail spinning towards the ground for what seemed like an eternity.

In the end, I still find it worth my while. There also the practical side to it (never having to buy tickets + living over a train station = leaving home at the very last minute and do a lot of spontaneous trips) and the treasury side; once it's paid, it's paid, no bitching about costs on months when we travel a lot.    
The GA is expensive, but having a 1/2 Takst when your partner has a GA and is the type to go to Ticino for lunch is very expensive and unpractical. Because of course, he has no understanding of people having to fumble with the ticket machines and make it to a particular train.    
Plus again, to be accurate I should calculate the price of the monthly ZVV pass on top of all those trips. And the partner discount is very interesting.

			With a ""grey import"" waranties can be only 2 years as opposed to 3 years, but if the car is relatively new you can buy additional years of guarantee at reasonable prices, to give an idea, i paid 1700 for 2 extra years on a car that new costs around Chf 180k.   
It is very easy to import yourself, you can check cars/prices very easily, in English on     Main dealers are here so this lessens the risk of getting screwed over.   
At the border, you get the German VAT (19%) deducted, you pay 8% Swiss VAT + 4% Car tax, with these papers and the Certificate of Conformity you go to your vehicle test center who give you an appointment and perform a prefunctory test and issue a Swiss grey card. One thing they do check on carefully is that the wheels are correct size for the car.   
If the car is less than 6 months old, as determiend by first registration, then you pay a CO2 tax that can be quite chunky, depending on the vehicle.   
For a small car, it's probably not worth bothering unless you are prepared to buy unseen and just go up to pick it up, for a larger car, it's certainly worth it.   
It really is, exceedingly easy and uncomplicated to do yourself !

			Similarish thing happened to me.  It should now be his insurance company writing to your daughter.  Absolutely not him trying to do a further form.   
I was parked for a minute and the car opposite reversed out and hit me.   
The other driver and I filled out an accident form.  I kept one copy and he took  the other.  I also took photos for my use of the location of the cars and the damage.     
A few days later his insurance contacted me by letter to ask if we wanted to make a claim.  (we didn`t as luckily our car was not damaged).

Form duly stamped, then off to the Zurich equivalent of DVLA for the swap.   
Thanks for the help and advice, all.

			Without getting into what has already been said....   
Usually at the end of official letters it will say something like 'you have 30 days to appeal.' Then they list who you need to contact.   
Do your letters have that? If so, Did you contact the right people for your appeal?

			Hi All,   
Thanks a lot for your comments.   
Is the full ""end of lease"" inspection done by the dealer, a service which is included in the admin fees? Or does it need to be paid separately as an additional service they provide?   
Based on the figures above, what would be the amount to be paid at the end of the lease? My calculation says around 3000CHF. Is that correct? I took into consideration that the car will be worth 1/3 less of what is worth now (i will check this with the dealer, but would like to have an idea before hand).

The reason for this is that there is no Regulation at all, yet, of the Uber market.  Therefore, each driver does what he or she thinks is fine.  The Uber driver should not, of course, accept a child passenger without a booster seat - but having the seat (or not) is not the Uber driver's responsibility.   
With a real taxi company, you can order a taxi with a booster seat, and they will bring one along.   
If I were going to the airport with a child, I would not want to risk having a driver turn up without a booster seat.  And with an Uber driver, you definitely have no recourse, as in, no authority to which to complain.

			Swiss dealers aren't the best for offering discounts, so the best tact is knowing the markets - what are similar cars going for? their spec? winter wheels etc   
At least look informed when you speak to them - for example know the cost of wheels/tyres from Reifendirekt will give you a good base position to negotiate to on winter wheels

240	11.01.2012, 23:39	Senior Member	Thanked 183 Times in 105 Posts	Location: Pully	"    The philosophy you mentioned is right (not slow down traffic and keep up with the flow of traffic).    
I am not sure if ""slightly above speed limit"" is really OK especially in an exam  but 10km/h down is certainly acceptable.  My teacher has 30 years+ teaching experience in all kind of driving related stuff --theory, classroom and practical.  According to what he says, speed limit is the maximum limit and not supposed to be over at anytime.  There's (as most people know) no minimum speed as such.  If there's no traffic at all in the road or even with normal traffic, a 10km/h down is acceptable in a 60km/h road (i asked him this exact question when i was driving on a 60km/h road!).   
I will be very careful about the "" keeping up with traffic flow"". I still remember I drove for almost 2km in a pretty normal road which composes of both country side & forest. It was a 40km/h though.  I was driving at 30-35km/h as there are quite a bit of turns and at one point (when we reach a wider & straight road), there're 3-4 cars behind me and gradually overtook me in a rough way (as if i was driving too slow), which makes me believe that I drove too slow & might be reading the speed sign wrongly/overlook change of speed sign, until i saw the 'end of 40km/h' sign.

I'm not familiar with that particular engine, but I would guess more than 1l too much. It is probably black because by lifting the front you only got a portion of the old oil out.   
Measure how much oil you drained and compare that to how much fresh oil you added. This will give you an accurate enough measure of how much too much. Go to the building center and get some plastic tubing of a small enough diameter that it will fit into the dipstick tube and siphon that much off. Alternately, use the drain plug but this is a bit tricky to extract a specific amount. It would appear to be a cartridge filter, so you don't need to account for the oil contained in the old filter.   
Do NOT run the engine until you have the oil level at or slightly below the ""full"" marking.    
I hate to say this, but it may already be too late and you've the blown seals out of the top end - this will be more expensive to rectify than having a mechanic change your oil would have been in the first place.

			not sure the euro discount still is in force. it was introduced a few years ago when the cars in EU were a lot cheaper as per EUR - CHF exchange rate.    
So this 14% is the 'standard' discount you get? I have a corporate discount of 15% which now seems like nothing if I could have had it as a standard as well..

- Cars here are very efficient as compared to many cars in the States   
- Our cars get inspected every 3 years to make sure they are running efficiently (which is why you rarely see poorly functioning cars here)   
- The Swiss love Skoda Octavias and VW Golfs, which are both quite efficient.

What is mentioned is that, if a resident is abroad for at least 12 months and gets a foreign license during that time, this license is accepted and changed into a local one. Such a requirement would probably be mentioned on the form, just like other durations are mentioned e.g. the requirement to have it exchanged within 12 months.   
I think that you'll be able to exchange your license without any issues.

Funnily enough the car previously passed with the same bumper in cantons Luzern and Aargau, looks like Zug is tougher or I got a tough inspector (he was actually looking on the internet at pictures of the car to see if the stock one looks like mine). The test itself was also different than other cantons, here you hand over the keys and he comes back a while later, previously I sat in the car and drove it through.   
To be somewhat on topic I wanted to mention that the results paper I got also contained some percentages for the suspension front and back, I guess those reflect how ""good"" they assess it to be?

			The 185 days is per year but if you're making a permanent change of residency then you become UK resident immediately.  You're not really exchanging a foreign licence - you're getting your old UK licence back.  You can apply to get a copy and reason for not having one being you gave it up when you were abroad.

You should really know your residency status. Don't count on the competency of border guards. You can count that in doubt they'll just do the safest thing for their asses - stop you at the border for clarifications. Do you really want to get stuck at the border, desperately looking for closest available lawyer?      Just the plate (country of registration) matter as far as cars go. As long you drive EU plated car in EU, and CH plated car in CH, you should fine and it doesn't matter who owns/drives it then (as long as by permission). Questions will be raised once you cross border into a customs region which considers you its resident - from their point of view you may be importing a foreign car.      I really wouldn't count on that. Ask a lawyer if your situation is as complicated as you describe - a simple preventive consultation will be far cheaper than a potential court case about smuggling. If you have legal insurance, it might even cover such consulation.

			Hello everyone,   
Thank you all so much for your replies, tips and comments. I'm regretting to tell you that I have sold the car anyway. I simply can't invest the time in fixing it up, as I'm finishing up my masters at the moment.. Also, I don't want to have to spend my spare time on doing so because I want to be able to focus fully on my new job, and rest when I'm not at work..   
I'll get a car in Switzerland in a while... Or I might import a better example.   
Anyway, I have lots of questions regarding tuning cars in CH, but I'll create a different topic for that, if the questions are yet to be answered in this forum.   
Best regards,   
Jochem

			The CFF couldn't care less who's using the day cards. They aren't nominative and you don't show any ID when the cards are being checked. 
However, the commune may impose limitations on who they will make them available to. Some communes limit them to their own inhabitants (which is what the CFF would like them to do), whilst others will make them more freely available. I've certainly got some from neighbouring communes in the past when my own didn't have any left. 
However, once you've got the cards, I can't see how anyone could care who you give them to. I suspect you may upset people if you try and resell them, so don't put them on ebay or ricardo.

			Thanks everyone for excellent suggestions. I ended up in buying Qashqai (Teckna 1.2 DIG-T) with around view monitor and panoramic roof. So far, I have driven it for continuous 3 hour ride, which I found a lot of fun.   
The around view monitor did help a lot in parking in my very cramped parking lot (had a pillar on one side, and a minivan on the other side). Reverse parking seems to do the trick for now.

			If you would like to take over a lease on a Ford Focus, I would be willing to part with one of our cars. It was originally from another English Forum member, who moved back to the UK. I took it over for our sons, but they have not managed to learn Manual Transmission, so it is seldom used. There is only one more year to go, until June 2017, so it might fit your needs perfectly.      
The actual Kilometer count is around 30,000. (I'm at work so I cannot look). It is great car, with plenty of space and enjoyable to drive. It would be a question of transferring the lease to you. No Money down with a  monthly payment of 340 (ooh, must check this Detail on my revolving payment...) At the end of the lease, you simply give the car back.     
Ford can give you a confirmation of it's current condition, so there is no risk for damage.

The entire atmosphere of that place is awesome, people mill around, come up, help out, give their input. He's got everything, although I still bring my own socket set since I'm partial to it, but it's really a phenomenal shop.   
Honestly, when he let me take his car to drive 30min to BMW to get new bolts, it was out of this world. If you ever go to him, please bring as much glass Feldschlossen as your arms can carry.   
Phenomenal. Thank you Don Molina, you really saved me a huge amount of stress and pain.

			Hello, I own an A limited license (good for 35 kW) and would like to buy a Triumph Street Triple. The 2008 model (which I am interested in)  has a power of 80 kW.  
I know that in the EU with the A2 license, it is not possible to restrict a motorcycle with more than double the limit (35 kW * 2 = 70 kW). The new Street Triple are also sold on a 70 kW variant to accommodate for this rule.  
My question is: would it be possible to restrict an 80 kW motorcycle to 35 kw and use it with an A limited license? I searched in Triumph's website and couldn't find any info regarding a 35 kw kit for this particular bike.  
I know for certain that with the old rules, there was no such limit on power and saw lots of big bikes restricted to 25 kW, such as the Kawasaki Z800 and ninja 636. On Kawasaki's website, I also found   page which lists the available bikes to restrict on the A limited license. The list includes the Ninja ZX-6R 636, which has an unrestricted power of 96,4 kW. Does this mean that in Switzerland there is no such rule about the maximum unrestricted power, and it would be possible to restrict the bike from 80 to 35 kW? 
Thanks in advance.

			Well, that's one of the routes they take. Having the pleasure of doing my driving test twice, you also have the option of going on to the motorway and then exiting for Uetikon-Waldegg - beware of the Rechtsvortritt right at the beginning of the village - and then back into town via the winding old road down to Albisrieden. Not sure if the Kontrollfahrt is as strict as the actual exam but you WILL have to parallel park, possibly even on a hill. You cannot use one of those automatic parking assistance thingies either. They also tend to talk to you a lot and this includes asking questions about your knowledge of the various traffic rules.     
I agree though, practice Manesseplatz (bonus points for doing it on a Friday around 17.00), the general area around the STVA, don't forget to turn off the engine if you happen to arrive and have to stop for the train going through on Uetlibergstrasse, in the little side roads it's all about the Rechtsvortritt, don't be lazy about changing gear and using the clutch on roundabouts (a friend got failed for keeping the clutch down while going around a roundabout). I'm not sure how specific that stuff is to Switzerland, since I learned to drive here.

			If you whacked a wheel enough to bend it, you may need to have the car competently realigned as well. The bent wheel may also not run straight and true, balancing won't cure that, only replacing or fixing may.    
You may have a combination of faults giving you the chase around, bushings, bearings, etc. Hopefully you have a competent Mini or BMW garage. If you are trying to save money by going to independents, if they aren't competent with Minis it might cost you more in the long run.

318	19.04.2015, 19:04	Newbie	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Schwyz	"    A new E-class station wagon with the right extras is usually at the 100k mark or over. 
Two years down the line, it's half of that, sometimes less. 
Unfortunately, a lot of car-owners seem to spend money on absolutely useless optical enhancements (AMD styling without an actual AMG engine - WTF?) instead of stuff like DISTRONIC, dead-spot-assistant, break-assistant etc.pp that can actually prevent accidents.   
I'm not going to swallow a 50k deprecation on a 100k car in two years. No. Chance. Ever. 
One might argue that even buying a 50k car is nonsense because after all insurance for a Dacia Duster is less than half of what it costs for an E-class SW plus you don't need to bother with Vollkasko there anyway. 
BTW: Out of curiosity, I recently checked and insurance for e.g. a Lamborghini Huracan is apparently only about 50% more expensive than for an E-class SW....   
I don't work at a big company, so no discount.   
I hate the concept of leasing. You pay for it every month and still don't own it at the end. I might take out a 1.9% loan - but even that is questionable, as I don't really invest the money I would pay cash otherwise and as such it's an ""investment"" with a 1.9% negative interest plus the depreciation of the car... 
Owning a paid-off car is expensive enough, with insurance, tax, liquids, tires, maintenance and repairs.

Similar to all the wire wheels with eared knockoffs you see on the road. They are illegal here, which is possibly related to the fact that you never see the eared ones when the car is in for the MFK. Mind you, it does mean that the KOs get removed every 5 years, as opposed to self tightening themselves into oblivion.

But in my case, Although I stopped after looking at the red light and started to wait (10 s), and then out of the blue when I looked up again, I saw the green light corresponding to another street and crossed (Both the traffic lights are like really next to each other). I feel this is purely my mistake and the only thing that can save me in the non existence of the camera  .

Visible form all directions. Still a bit of a gimmick imo.   
Wireless ones are total cr*p, usually made by cheapo companies, therefore unreliable on so many different levels... (loss of signal, clunky controls, short battery life and so on)      If you really want to increase your visibility get a pair of NON blinking lights on the trailer, and a decent hi-vis jacket that has a lot of reflective material on the sleeves. Then indicate your turns properly with your hands.   
this is visible:     
this isnt:     
Stay safe!

Is it worth looking into leasing used cars and maybe go for something little higher priced? 
What is the timetable for that?

			Thanks Tom, I did not know the insurance was included in the registration process. The information on the web site of our local ""dmv"" just said you needed insurance. I still do not know how I obtain a permis de circulation (carte grise) for my e-bike which the website lists as required too - but wasn't delivered with my bike (as I bought it in Germany).   
For anyone interested here is a list of the dmv (office cantonale des voitures - ocv) with links to their websites for each and every canton:      "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Nov 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	How to register an E-Bike (45km/h)	DJD	Posts: 23

According to him, he can already sense when shaking hands with the owner of the car if the car will pass the test or not. And he (sadly) has to fail a handful of cars every day.    
Being Zurich, he also has customers that drive premium brands and if the car doesn't pass the MFK on the first attempt due to a minor failure, they'll ask when the next test is (usually within a few weeks), and then think out loud: ""OK, don't bother, I'll just sell it and buy a new one"".

			Hi Tinkiwinki,   
Thanks for your input. I will fly to the NL and drive the car myself from the Netherlands to Basel. I called the CH Zoll and a company which is an expert on this field. I found out that:   
- T1 document is allowed to have for private individuals. It exempts me from any EU VAT/Tax. The T1 document needs to be announced by the dealer/export company to the German zoll. Then if i show them the T1 doc, they will register and put a stamp on it.    
- The e-dec document needs to be filled in, otherwise the CH zoll won't cooperate. You can do this either upfront (online via the URL mentioned in my initial post), or you can go to a customs-agency which are present on the border. They can help you with this for a fee (don't know how much they charge).   
Sounds like I'm good so far   I'll let you know about the outcome    
Cheers, 
Paul

			You could make a collision claim (admitting it was you that caused the damage by hitting a pole or something similar) but then the deductible applies and that's usually at least CHF 500 or 1000, depending on the policy. 
Have you had separate parking damage insurance you'd be abe to 'pin' it on someone else and not pay any deductible.

But anyway, why not change it to a Swiss one? It only takes a quick visit and exchange of a few bank notes to do so.   
Edit: I was assuming your original licence would be acceptable, as an EU one would be,  but I see you're from Vietnam, so you'd need to check that out yourself.

			ive got a VTR firestorm,   
been back int he country for about 11 weeks now an i was stopped with my bike i brought back here thats a UK spec bike, twice in 1 day to be honest for the same thing. i will explain how this went so it can give you an idea on the problems but also good thing that will help you get sorted.   
so i live in laax travelled to Pfafikon to meet friends as i was arriving near the station there was a police control (still got UK plates on btw) a cop on a bike followed me didnt say much due to i was going 30kph so bike was just roling on idle. went out around the mountings had a good day on the way back into Pfafikon the same cop was in a park place watching cars n bikes heard mine coming down the hill on the overrun popping alittle, 97.8DB with no killers in on my bike which i legal in the UK,  he followed me again and then pulled me, asked me to follow him tot he test center to doa check on my bike. now here is where you need to learn something new and whats important in switzerland     
in the UK all bikes cars the lot 98db plus 2 is 100 max or 105 on the racetrack at certain rev's 
my VIN says my bike is legal for 90DB plus they give you 5 so max for my bike here is 95DB so im over by call it 3 BUT also when you fit cans here you get a paper that says its legally changed and approved. UK thats never gonna happen as its not needed so get an email from where you got your cans from saying there are legal in the UK and all is well.   
BUT another things is this, ALL bike cars the lot are different here check the VIN plate. 1299 Ducati is 100 + the 5 so legal is 105 same with harley is different and so forth.   
i DIDNT get a fine nothing at all as i have allthe paperwork from the company i got the cans for and the swiss let it role as its an import

			Hi,   
Sorry for reviving this really old thread. If have the same problem now. In my case it's a 2006 Nissan Murano that I imported back in 2008 (!!). Back then I had it inspected and it passed. I also had another inspection in 2014 where it passed.   
It's now in 2016 where they discovered that I don't have the washers nor the levelers. They admitted that the past 2 inspections they must have overseen this. However I am expected to get this fixed now.   
What did you end up doing here?   
ciao,

Charlie,     
By the time you add up the price of renting a space suitable to do the work yourself, the cost of tools to do anything other than the most basic maintenance, and the cost of shipping and importing parts, taking your car to an independent garage turns out to save a fair bit of money.     
I am currently renting a Garage space, as well as a ""Bastel Keller"" for a complete resto, despite having free access to a fully equipped professional garage. For what I have spent on rent for the space alone I could have bought a car which had already been restored. If I factor in the tools, material, shipping and VAT I could have bought a significantly more expensive car.     
Being a gearhead isn't about being rational.

Zoe,     
Haven't been in a long time. It was regular, but pretty informal (in the sense that there aren't any registrations, or judged competitions. Just a bunch of people with old cars turning up to show their stuff). No burnout competitions or such, but usually an impromptu run to a nice restaurant happens.     
No Parts sales, but it would be an ""In"" to the community if your marque or model happened to be there.

			UPDATE:   
Coming back to update on my original query:   
Finally, went to the Porsche garage in Thalwil who rebalanced all the wheels again but told me that the tires I have are more suited for off-road and hence there will be some shake at higher speeds. So, till the next set of city-driving summer tires, I have to stay below 130. Not a bad thing that!   
Thank you for all the suggestions earlier.

			The plus side of driving through France to Luxembourg is the light  traffic, but the autoroute stops, ouside are very dirty. There are also 2  tolls, about 23 altogether. Despite these drawbacks this is my  preferred route.    
Keep away from Bruxelles, always heavy traffic.    
When coming back from UK we stop in Luxembourg, 
at a cheap hotel near the autobahn,          ‎ 
Rue de Turi 
3378 Livange, Luxembourg 
+352 26 52 01    
The plus side of driving through Germany is in theory the faster roads,  but in the summer there are many long roadworks, and the traffic around  Köln, Dortmund, etc can be VERY heavy. If you have an intelligent  navigator this might be the best route, but be prepared to leave the  autobahn and take the diversion.    
On German Autobahn exits there are small blue plates displayed, with a  white number. If you follow this sign posted number (Default is always  straight on) the signed route will take you back onto the next entrance  to the same autobahn, which you had previously left.

Can only assume it's been resprayed, at least in that area. I don't think any damage would have been to the sill/rocker panel otherwise they'd have surely noticed those runs.  It's shocking what comes out of some body shops.  Someone at home in their own garage probably could do better.  I know when I bought my car they insisted on spraying the bonnet because of a few paint chips.  I said OK but I don't want to see runs and overspray etc.  They were a bit insulted but then when I picked up the car there was primer overspray under the bonnet and nasty ridges.  Anyone inspecting that car might have thought it's been in an accident.  Was just as bad when it was in for a service once and they damaged it, repaired the damage but left a pink line of primer all along one side of the car. 
The car you're looking at might have only had some key scratches on the door or it might have had a side impact.  I guess the first thing the seller will do is get those runs taken out.

			Update.  That was nice and easy.  Went down to OCN this afternoon, had to wait about 10 minutes while a few people in front of me were processed and then I just handed over the form and photo, said it was for a change of nationality and showed my permit and passport.  She took my old driver's licence, processed the photo and form and in a few minutes I had my nice new shiny driver's licence with GB on it.    Didn't expect to get it straightaway, I thought I'd get it in the post in a few days time along with the invoice.  But no, handed over and directed to the cashier's booth to give them 40 francs and it was all done.

			I believe that the ""not for ebikes"" thing is just that ebikes are generally heavier than normal bikes (around the 20kg mark, with battery) - they aren't that fundamentally different. Most bike racks have a per-bike limit (usually 15 - 20 kg) and a total limit (say 60kg)   
It is possible to remove the battery on most - then the eBike is just a fairly heavy bike that should be ok for the weight limit.    
Towbar isn't really an option - i'd be looking at 1500 chf all in (inc. towbar fitting, the carrier etc), which is bit much for moving 2 bikes once or twice per year...

			Dear Fatmanfilms and any other that can help.. 
You mention below that flat Headlamps are totally legal.  is there some information or rules that can prove this is so?  I am out of principal getting rather frustrated.  I recently moved to CH and prior to coming called the testing station and was told Flat was ok.  Now I am here and completely helpless they are saying it is not ok and it is going to cost several thousand CHF to change the lights.  I am trying to find out if they miss informed me the first time or simply being difficult and wanting to ""just cause trouble"".   
Would be very grateful if anyone can confirm?

			Do you have a car too? and will you be using both the car and Motorhome at the same time? In Switzerland, one reason why so many have camping-cars is that they can have an interchangeable set of number plates- and only pay one tax, providing both vehicles at never used at the same time. Enquire with the insurer, that applies there too + a small surcharge.

Worse part was, I didn't even know I had to do the 2 courses because I got no information about it (big mess up at the city hall where I got it changed) - I almost lost it. It was solved, but a friend lost her driving license because of this little joke. She'll have to repeat both theoretical and practical exams here in Switzerland, even though she still has a valid driving license in Portugal...   
So I rather send the information to the people to check about the 2 courses, because better prevent than be sorry.

Boxster is pretty nice, and I've seen more ladies in 911s than in Boxsters in CH. 
S2000 is too focused if you want a casual roadster and early ones are more annoying than fun to the average driver. Later models are somewhat more liveable (they at least have a freaking clock) but are lots of money. 
SLK can be a hairdresser's car, but let's not forget there is an AMG version that can make up for the stigma (still wouldn't buy one) 
Z4s are pretty damn nice, I'd go for a facelift 3.0si previous model and enjoy topless motoring in CH. The shortcomings will not matter one bit to 99% of the people getting one, and there is always the //M version for the rest(less).   
MX-5 are always the answer (see Jalopnik) but for some people it's small, so to each their own.   
If I was recommending one to a friend, I would recommend a Z4 or a MX-5 and I'm an S2000 owner with friends owning or have owned pretty much all of the above.

i paid 70 chf for everything (including balancing) in garage in Regensdorf (which is just few km's from my home in Seebach... ). They accepted my own tyres without problem. (and this is where i did not try to save, i bought  expensive ones, but also as cheap as possible)   
it was in April, and the car runs fine. didn't experience any problems. 
service was done in about 2 hours.   
yet another example that you CAN pay much less in switzerland for many things (not everything...) if you want to.

			According SVG Art. 43 paragraph 1;  
* it is generally forbidden to use paths by bicycles or motorized   vehicles, which are obviously not suitable for or obviously not made for   (mountain) bicycles or motorized vehicles, such as foot paths   (Fusspfade) or hiking paths (Wanderwege).  
* This is a general prohibition. 
* It is valid Switzerland-wide. 
* It must not be explicitly indicated (but it can of course).   
Er,  now we all know. Where did the translation come from? 
I love the 'obviously not suitable for...' 
And I don't know about other cyclists, but I've been on plenty of designated cycle tracks and cycle lanes which were obviously not  suitable for me and my bike! And judging by Mr. Longbyt's remarks at the time, they were obviously not suitable for him either. So where are we know?

			My conclusion was no there is no easy way to get back the C1 once it's surrendered. I gave mine up but not without me knowing about it, i.e. when I handed in my UK license and got back my CH version the C1 was not there although I didn't realise it until those 8yrs later when I needed it....   
The only way now is to actually take the C1 test in German, French or Italian language.   
The other think worth knowing is that C1 vehicles are much more expensive to insure, which was something that put me off going down that route. I have had to stick to 3.5t vehicles since which has positives and negatives.

			Was a bit of ""something"" for the locals here to go ogle at. 
We drove thru under the bridge yesterday - so it was not damaged as was suspected. 
I think maybe the ""50 injured"" was because an equiped ""hospital bus"" for 50 patients was immediately sent to the scene.  But not required.  Also were 3 Rega helicopters.  
I guess hearing two trains had collided assumes the worst - there could be many injured.  The 5 were ""not seriously"" injured.  The driver of the one train was serious and air-lifted.   
I was amazed how quickly the wrecks were cleared!  Especially with rain and snow on Saturday evening.

458	13.05.2016, 17:08	Junior Member	Thanked 17 Times in 5 Posts	Location: Location, Location, Location	"    Filing in person is recommended, if you file by (e)mail they'll most probably have questions anyway. Expect for things to take more than just a few minutes, half to a full hour perhaps. Some stations are staffed on saturdays, perhaps that's most convenient for you, though some of these are by appointment only.    
Personally I'd talk to the company first. Not to some infodesk clerk, but to top management, ideally to the owner. Perhaps print the stuff and hand it over. If the reply is in a reasonable tone I'd leave it at that as a first step, and repeat when necessary (when, not if, as people are used to their parking style so it won't fully work on the first go). The higher the rank of the person I speak to the more I'd not mention police (or only in passing), this option is a given and always open.   
If however the people I'd talk to were getting abusive or were not open to my complaint I'd involve the police immediately.    
Talking to the company first would also allow to make sure what Teverus describes doesn't apply. I think in every case a 'real' sidewalk has demarcations both on the street side and on the side where the private area is. If however what looks like a sidewalk is actually private property there should be no demarcation separating it from the private area.

Most car insurance doesn't cover you to take paying passengers, and what about liability cover, or for the owner, who covers the costs if I throw up in the back of the car etc etc   
I have to say I HATE these kind of companies, they take none of the risks or responsibilities and wash there hand of it when things go titsup (yes ebay, paypal and shiply I'm looking at you)

Both guys looked very German complete with broom-end style moustaches.  Neither masked off any areas or anything, just spraying on brake backplates and hence also the balljoints, brake lines etc. On the Merc it was definitely black.  I guess next time I'll pay closer attention.  I think both had come straight from the TÜV.  The Merc guy also adjusted his fog lamps but at 6 feet off the ground without any reference lines.

			MOABMAN,   
UDAMAN! Thanks for all the great info, and do you ever sleep? I am in the States today, so late posts are early for me.   
I will ask a couple more until you tell me to take a hike! BTW, I will happily buy you and your wife drinks or dinner once I make it over. Any jeep meets or clubs? If your are ever in the states looking for some serious offroad mudding, I have some Tennessee River Bottom land you would love.    
Fog lights in the front, my vehicle is not equipped, are the mandatory? Something I can add here no problem.    
Already arranged to ship back the aftermarket bumpers.   
Sounds like it will be worth the hassell, as long I understand there will be a hassel. With my price point, I should still be under 25,000 CHF, which by US standards is highway robbery, but a steal in Switzerland. Also, as a 2nd vehicle, it should be ok to be tied up in the process. In about 2-3 years, do you think I would have any problems selling since it came from the US?

			Thank you both.  I did see the linked thread and clicked through the posts suggested.    
I guess I was wondering about any experience in Basel with MB dealers, vs outside mechanic, vs going over the river to Germany.  (My German is extremely rudimentary).   
My friend from MB is actually relocating to Stuttgart, and I think some of his info was more EU specific rather than CH. (read tail lights seem to be ok according to some threads.  The radio/gps seems to be more of a convenience issue rather than compliance?   
Speedometer dial is mph, but can have center digital readout in kph. It seems this is acceptable, but also seems to depend on the inspector?

			With the new Swiss pass you can start with a 1/2 fare then add extras to the card. This means that once you know your regular journey you can add a point to point monthly subscription to that card to further reduce your commute cost.

			But is it really willy-nilly when there are 6 other vespas on my street all parked on the sidewalk? The open air parking spot that management offered me is often taken up by cars, probably belonging to a gf/bf of a resident. Next year I'll pay them for spring/summer parking, I guess for now I'm just going to leave my scooter at uni covered parking. The management is responsible for the covered garages (only fits one car each, not an open underground parking, so they can't offer me one). I was just wondering whether the lady really had the right to ask me to move it, when it's not in an area belonging to her!           "	null	null	null	Motorbike Parking	guest	null

			Hi,   
I would like my car's aircon system inspected, pressure checked and filled properly, which means with the right volume and mix of r134a, oil and whatever else goes in there. My first thoughts are ""I need a German"".   
I would like to know if there is somewhere on the border in Germany where I can go tomorrow and probably get this done tomorrow, assuming I give them a call later.   
Does anyone have a recommendation?   
Thanks,

Nomad,     
The simplest route is to get a local independent Garage to handle it for you. You   do everything (except the Exhaust gas testing) yourself, but the local garage will make it easier, if a bit more expensive. That way he will have a look at it and be able to judge fairly well if anything needs done to get through the test, and he will also have garage plates to handle getting the car to and from the Mfk. If the car is in good nick it doesn't necessarily have to be a garage specialising in US cars.     
If he suggests just washing it then going to the MFK test that would be a sign that he is NOT trying to charge you for any work that isn't necessary.

			Hi, last year an impressive 40% of newly registered cars in Switzerland were 4WD, in Q1 of this year even 43%. In Graubünden even 74%. Soon 1 in 2 new cars will have 4WD. But of course, the average age of a car being about 7 years old, AWD are still not so common on Swiss roads. But still probably the highest percentage in Europe. Can you explain that?    
Of course a 2WD will do perfectly fine in most conditions, but AWD undeniably contributes to greater personal/road safety, just like wearing a helmet when biking/skiing, airbags, winter tires, having sufficient power/torque -- 
none of which is in the Swiss law.

485	09.08.2015, 12:01	Forum Veteran	Thanked 687 Times in 341 Posts	Location: Glatt	"    I've been buying tickets on my mobile for a year now,mand I can guarantee you that it will take longer to control people. Since the validity date no longer appears on the card, they will have to scan every single card like they do with the mobile tickets. It takes quite a bit of time, especially when the train ride is bumpy. The controller has to take out his phone, get the scanner on, scan your card (while not moving), put back his phone if the next ticket is a paper ticket, then take it out again for next Swisspass, and so on... Not exactly time-saving for the employees on the train.   
But they'll be saving on plastic, since you keep the same card for 5 years and can switch between 1/2 Takst and GA without changing card. Possibly even have other type of fare cards.   
For me as a user, I'm pretty happy I went from 1/2 Takst to GA a week ago, just early enough to get te old card. I don't really see what's in it for me at this point in time, I don't use Mobility or any other services where Swisspass is supposed to be useful. Trollefar got his Swisspass yesterday, he's not so happy about it.   
We don't really mind the automatic renewal though; as long as you don't need to send a hand-written letter signed with your blood by recommended mail delivered by a unicorn (like trying to cancel anything in France) I find it rather practical.

			You will get +/- the 20 Tagessätze (if lucky just on Bewährung/Propation) plus a fine (which may be in the range of CHF 600 to CHF 1200) plus a bill for the court fees.   
As you live in Germany (first time I see a German call his country German. Good you did not say a German living in Swiss  ) you only get a 3 month driving ban for Switzerland and you can keep your license (unless Germany has a similiar system as Switzerland). There will be an additional fee for the ban.     
The Swiss sytem: If a forign authoroty issues a ban to a Swiss resident, the ban can be extended and the license confiscated. But only as long as the forign ban is in force.

			Okay, maybe no one has bought theirs from Argos, but I thought it worth posting just in case.   
High Street chain Argos is recalling five car seat models made by the nursery products brand Mamas & Papas.    
It has told parents to stop using the seats ""immediately"" over safety fears.   
It is feared the models may not protect children in the event of a crash, with their shells cracking under impact.   
The affected models are Mamas & Papas Mercury Group 1 Black, Mercury Group 1 Grey, Mercury Group 1-2-3 Black, Mercury Group 1, 2, 3 Grey, Mercury Group 2-3 Black and Grey.   
Mamas & Papas said no incident had been reported to it related to any of the recalled car seats, which it makes solely for Argos.   
In a statement Mamas & Papas added: ""We continue to work closely with Argos to determine the exact nature of the issue.   
""All Mamas & Papas car seats are tested, certified and approved under the European regulations R44/04 by independent accredited bodies.""       
Argos said in a statement: ""We have identified a potential safety concern.   
""In the event of an accident the car seat shell may crack and therefore not provide the intended level of protection to the user.""   
It said that any customers who had bought one of the seats ""should immediately stop using the product"" and return it to an Argos store for a full refund.   
""We wish to thank you for your co-operation and apologise for any inconvenience caused by this recall.""   
The Argos catalogue numbers of the affected car seat models are 297/7526, 411/9100, 305/6037, 397/9530, and 245/4829.   
Jim Holder is the editorial director at Haymarket Automotive, which publishes WhatCar and AutoCar magazines.   
He said that child seats were like crash helmets, in that ""once it's damaged... the integrity of that seat is pretty much finished, so any slight damage is to be avoided"".

			highsandlows,      TCS may be a good option if seller agrees to give it for a test (please verify beforehand).   
Normally if you buy a second hand car you do not have a breakdown assistance. You have it usually with new cars (my Nissan dealer offers it) or if you have it as a part of an insurance.   
If you do not have it covered with insurance or with your garage you may find TCS a helpful option. I would go for it if I'd have a second hand car. You will have assistance and some discounts on TCS services. It varies from canton to canton, for example in Vaud I find useful to do the climatisation service at TCS - it is cheaper than the alternative.   
Also, if anyone in your family going to pass for driving test, the two-phase courses may be costly and TCS offers discount also to family members.

First aid course booked, eye test done, provisional licence and theory likely in mid June. 
 Looking to get lessons pre booked in block to (hopefully) pass test by end July / 1st week Aug - maybe overambitious, but travel limits summer hols time in Zurich for my 18 year old, who can aleady drive well on private land, but obviously no real road time.   
Anyone with recent experience or recommendations ? (did search first) 
number of lessons,  
waiting time for a test date,  
known flexible instructors in Zurich to Stafa , East coast of the lake region (German or English) 
Experience of fast tracking the Swiss process.   
So far no real help or encouragement other than ""call back when you have all steps complete and in hand, then we take it week by week etc""   
Thanks in advance

			Hi all,  
Sorry to dig up an old thread but I wanted to add some valuable info for the community.   
Yesterday I got a notification of a speeding fine for being 6kph over the 50kph limit (after they removed the 5kph for margin of error it was only 51kph but the Swiss like their rules!).  The bill was 40CHF from the Police in Neuchatel. 
I was immediately suspicious as I have never heard of the place I was supposed to have been caught in as well as it being in a different canton some miles away from me.  I looked it up on Google maps and indeed it was a mystery.  I checked my location history on Google Maps too (amazing service, use it people!).  I was safely tucked up in bed at 05:47 that morning...   
So I did some research on EF and found this thread as well as a couple more giving valuable info. 
I took the advice and called the Police this morning.  A very friendly lady took the matter seriously and said she would go and check the photo with her superior.  She called me back 30 minutes later and confirmed that it was indeed an error because the numberplate was not clearly visible on the car in question.  As such, she cancelled the fine and apologized for the inconvenience.  She is sending me a confirmation letter stating that the fine is no longer valid (by B post, how quaint).     
So people, if you get a ticket and you are sure it was not you, don't despair.  These systems are not infallible and the Police do seem to be reasonable about it, in canton NE at least.  Do your research, check where you were (use Google Location History if you use an Android phone), call the people up and be humble.  I didn't go in all guns blazing and it seemed to work very well indeed.   
I was convinced last night that I was being stitched up but I am so relieved today that my name stays off 'the list'.  You all know about that list that the Swiss keep of all naughty foreigners, right....?

Btw, do you know if such a case would fall under criminal fraud? If it's a ""mere"" administrative thing where the leasing company forces the naughty person to immediately hand the car back then the potential downside is not any bigger than handing the car back before leaving.   
Put differently, if the worst that can happen is that they force you to end the contract, you might as well attempt to be naughty because you won't risk anything worse than what you already face.

			Yes, it's a bit complicated as we need to pick up one car which we have purchased and straight from there return a car to Bern which we lease (but is registered on our personal plates)    
To do this I have added the new car to another car we have (so can use the plates for the collection) but as we need to drive both at the weekend I need to transfer the plates from the lease car to the new car as soon as we get back.   
Looking online this can be done by post, and I think I'm permitted to transfer the plates to the new car as soon as the papers are sent.   
I hope this makes sense, seems a complicated solution but it all needs to be done on Friday in one hit.

And I lived in the US till 2007, in Pittsburgh, PA, Boston, DC, chapel Hill, NC, Nj near NYC, and I've driven in the Midwest (WI) and California - mostly LA and San Francisco.    
I liked driving in NJ. NC was horrible - construction and crazy people. I love Pittsburgh, but the roads are awful - narrow, full of holes/under construction and really bad on and off ramps. Boston is....unique - but that's where I learned to drive a stick shift. Midwest is fine, polite drivers, and CA - too much of everything.    
For me, the most difficult rule here is to give way to the person on the right if your road hasn't got right of way (the orange diamond). Roads aren't always well marked.    
 But otherwise, driving here is pretty easy - i have no problem driving through Zurich if i have to, and the highways are just so much better.

			So I bought this from Castro on here, a few days into using it and I'm really enjoying it.        
The eye test is valid for two years so all I needed to do was fill in a form and drop it at the STVA. I'm riding with an L plate and will get booked in for the course in a few weeks.    
A 125 was definitely the right choice, it's so much more useable than a 50 although being able to use cycle lanes to dodge jams would be handy    
Thanks for all the help and advice!

			Gavin Nathan,      The same was for me. If you are from non-EU, you have to pass a practical test in order to convert your license into swiss one.   
In canton VD the rules are:   
1. You need to pass the practical test with-in 1 year since the day of arrival   
2. You are given one chance only. If you fail the test, you need to start over to get the swiss driver license   
In your canton the rules may be different. Please check. I solved this problem in the following way:   
1. Did some research to see the differences of driving rules between CH and my country   
2. Bought a car and drove it for 10 months   
3. Applied for 3 lessons with swiss driver instructor to help me adjust and prepare me for the test   
4. Passed the test and converted the license

			Hi all,   
This is not so much an advertisement of a driving school as something rather useful for anyone who wants to get their A1 (roller/scooter) or A license (motorcycle).     
If anyone wants to get one of those licenses, you will need to get a permit and then take either 8 or 12 hours of a Grundkurs in 4 months so that the full A1 is granted or the A permit is extended for 12 months.   
I decided to get my A license, and imagine my surprise when I found out that I would need to rent my own motorcycle.....  You do not want to know the terms of the rental - the price is not too bad, but if you damage the bike - you are out 1500 CHF regardless of whether it was your fault or not.  You also have a problem with the fact that you have to get that rental motorcycle through the city to the driving school for your course. 
I can guarantee that this would be ""a lot of fun"" if you've never been on a motorcycle before.   
And there were no motorcycle schools out there, which have their own motorcycles or scooters to rent - I could not find any in Basel.   
Well, now there is one: Fahrschule Sunna.   
The school has scooters, motorcycles and gear (helmets, jackets, boots, gloves) for rent - the prices are better than at the motorcycle rental places and if you drop the bike you will not be charged if it happens while taking the course.   
The owner (Oktay) is a pretty good instructor and speaks great English. 
I finished my Grundkurs with him without any incidents      
The season has started!   If anyone wanted to learn how to ride or to figure out if you would like it but this whole ""have to have your own scooter/motorcycle and gear bit"" was stopping you, it no longer has to    
Cheers

			If it has no fault codes it will do it on its own when it gets up to temp and you are on the highway  ....but once it gets so blocked that the dpf light comes on it will not do it any more, there as some pressure thresholds in the ECU which if it exceeds then it stops regen for fear of overheating the dpf.  You can see/test these in the diagnostic tool. If it is over 35mbar at idle or 75mbar at 2000rpm it will not play along.    
If you are lucky when you get the thermostats replaced and take a long drive it might clear it enough to reduce the back pressure to allow auto regen. .....if not there is a slightly dodgy method you can find if you google to force it. As other manufacturers such as VW do not have a regen cycle they rely on ""normal"" driving to regen theirs.

			Guys thanks to all of you for the answer. 
Currently the noise is not drastic, simply I recognize that engine works a bit louder (like 20-30%?). But it is nothing unspecific, like noise of scratching or ringing, simply engine noise, but louder. Also the power loss is not significant. I believe that it is not a very critical problem as for example both symptoms were not recocgnized by my wife (so it is not even so noticeable). 
As far I ve googled the problem, it is something related to the poor oil quality or poor gasoline quality which could cause sump filter dirting, anyway I believe that it is initial phase of it, which could be actually not noticeable by 50% of car users. Of course I am keen to check this stuff as soon as possible (in 1-2 weeks) but I believe (I hope!!!) engine is far from damage (by computer diagnostic it has been heared/inspected a bit also by the mechanic) Simply avoiding reaction yet can cause long-term problems

			Unless it has absolutely the full spec you really really want - I'd walk away.   
For the same price you can get a 2015 model (1.2TSi) from an AMAG dealer. 
2k more gets you a 2015 1.6TDi from an AMAG dealer.   
In other words - I don't think the deal represents good value.

550	02.02.2016, 07:59	Junior Member	Thanked 13 Times in 12 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    You what???? If the car is sold in Switzerland its airbags will have to reach Swiss standard - which will be the same as the EU - which means smaller, slower inflating - and safer airbags.       The Volvo V70XC was also released in 1997 so that title is dubious. The low centre of gravity benefits of a flat4 are moot in a raised suspension crossover based vehicle. You need to drive a proper car if you think the Forester hugs the road      Why? What possible relevance does that have? Any car that goes from 0-100 around 9-10 seconds will feel the same - 8.8s doesn't feel much quicker than 10.2s in the real world. I'd trade 1s in that sprint for better spread gears and a better 80-110kmh sprint.      The more torque the more likely it is that it will overwhelm the limits of traction causing ASP to kick in.   
Do you actually have any idea what you are talking about?

They probably simply want you to repeat what you told them in writing, so that they have a paper trail/something to fall back on. Perhaps a simple ""As mentioned at my appointment on April 1st at ..., I would like to do my test in English. Please let me know if this is possible by contacting me at... Thank you"" will do?

Day one of my CH experience, driving into ""my"" parking space under the temporary apt.  I very easily could have wedged it in there.   Turn too soon and the roof gets it.  Turn too late, and the front end won't clear the cars parked at the end of the ramp.  Sweet spot turned out to be a 6-7  point turn to get the alignment just right.  (think Austin Powers buggy scene)

No it's not an assumption due to one costing more - I can confirm it.      
The battery/motor combination is superior both in capacity and power, and as the Ochsner bike has a Bosch motor (arguably market leader in this sector) the motor can be considered better too. Furthermore the Bosch control centre for the e-assistance is better developed.     
The Ochsner bike also has Magura hydraulic brakes, where the Otto bike has cable V-Brakes. The Maguras are way better than V-Brakes: after one too many near misses on V-Brakes I changed mine to the HS-11 kit on the Ochsner bike and have never looked back. Way better braking in all weather conditions. They're easier to maintain / adjust too.      
Hope this helps.

Such as         
Or look for anything with a surplus power over traction.     
On the TT front - I do fancy an early one (225 or V6) - not because they are particularly engaging to drive but because they have aged well. The proportions of the more sporty models sit right - there is a purity to the interior design, they are built well and go nicely.   
I went to look at an R8 on Saturday - the look of the car has grown on me and there are lots of things to tempt me into one (the epically long warranty makes supercar owning cheap). Shame the front boot wouldn't even fit my race-bag. The Exige has more space!   
One of the best all round cars (IMHO) is the BMW 530XD Estate - it does everything you could possibly want - right up until you try to engage with it on the twisties - at which point no manner of nifty BMW M engineering can keep the weight transfer in check (unless electronic dampers are specced and turned round to sport plus mode).  The pendulum effect after a 1 or 2 corners means that progress is only ever rapid, never engaging.

I think about 60 days before hand is the average cheapest price for European flights, though for Christmas you should probably book earlier, just not 9 months.    
The bottom line is that all European national carriers are crap for short haul flights. Best book with easyjet, you get the same level of service for a cheaper price and without the arrogance. KLM/Air France being the worst culprits.    
Swiss are probably the best, though the prices can be ridiculous. Any route where they have no competition they just charge what they want. They also made no friends when they introduced the new pricing structure. The average ""light"" fare was the same as the previous ""normal"" fare, only without luggage, seat allocation etc.

To drive the car you would need a license plate. To get the license plate you need a vehicle liability insurance coverage first, then you have to register a holder at the StVA. (The holder is liable for tax, road worthiness, insurance details, and minor traffic tickets).    
Best ask the relevant authority if you could register yourself as a holder: 
StVA Luzern :    
Considering you stay less then 90 days in Switzerland, I doubt you could register yourself as a holder. And if you could, getting an insurance may be a challenge.  
But you will never know if you never ask.

			school parking lots for turning and stuff, rural roads (in the fields) outside the city for faster driving and how to change speeds and learning to give precedence to the right which is the basis of everything. 
this area looks rich in large parking lots for example but it seems to me there are good places all around geneva:         by learner license i think he means the restricted 3 years license that you get in the beginning.     
Regarding accidents, be sure to be able to stop the car with the handbrake from the passenger seat.   
I also suggest taking a weekend to explore rural switzerland for some intensive driving lessons, this way you can learn the more technical side without worrying about the traffic, then you can instead focus on the city traffic, there's nothing worse as people having technical doubts or being unsure (like forgetting what speed they're in) in the middle of traffic.

If you buy from ANY car dealer, you don't have to pay the taxes PROVIDED you are TAX-EXEMPT by the Swiss authorities.      
In fact, it goes for any country in the world. It's the authorities that collect taxes, and not the car dealers.       And what does this link tell you? Precisely what I was telling you from the start - it's available to people who live temporarily in Switzerland, hence are tax exempt by the Swiss authorities.

Something tells me you want an automatic something. Diesel is good for the highway (if there are any such roads in Switzerland. Most are congested stop and go). They do cost more to maintain and I wouldnt get a VW. Hopefully no other company is rigging its numbers and tests. Personally, I stayed away from diesels and got my self a CNG (erdgas) car. About as cheap as diesel to run. Also on many cars the automatics also eat gas. Some do do better however (if you believe the numbers).

			okay - I know this thread has been dormant for a while but desperation means I'm going to throw this question out there. I badly need to find a VKU in English and so far have turned up zero in Zug or Zurich - neither of the below who used to offer this now offer it any longer (have personally checked with them both in the past 48 hours)         
So I am now getting desperate to find a course as I am ready to take my practical test and badly need the license for work    
So I am willing to travel the length and breadth of Switzerland to find a darn VKU course being offered in English so that I can get on with my life    
So if anyone has been down the same painful road as me and can help I would be eternally grateful

			We recently bought a C250cdi 2nd hand from the local Mercedes dealer, low kms local car which was better priced than imports for similar spec cars. We pushed them on our trade in price and the next service is completely free (4yr/60km) we have the Swiss integral thing which is still not cheap. So there are good local deals if you are in the right place at the right time. I drove a C300cdi (6cyl) which was sweet but the 250cdi is a bit more economical and later generation. Lastly 5kms from the garage we had a flat tyre, tyre could not be repaired so they replaced a pair, no questions asked. I was in your position so I went to the local Merc dealer just to get a starting point for change over but they had a car coming in off lease so I think they did a good deal to sell it before it hit the lot.   
PS I would avoid Mercedes Seefeld I have had some bad experiences there.

			You might want to consider bringing the bike insurance documents.  For ""import permission"" when you cross the border you'll also need an export certificate which you can get from German customs.  For putting onto Swiss plates later you'll need also a certificate of conformity.  All the stuff is available online if you search for it.

Take the car to CH for 90 days, figure out whether or not I need it. 
If I don't drive it back, give it back, take the hit on the contract termination (but 1/ it should be less of a hit, as I will be further in the contract and 2/ at least I will have had 3 more months' use out of it)    
If I decide to keep it, buy it, and be done with it.

The person wants to get a license, stated their age and also asked if they could ride one of the bikes which do happen to be around 50cc. All of these are valid questions.   
Your response seems to imply they want to ride a 1300cc Hayabusa or something. And then you go on to lecture them about responsibility etc. when what they just did by asking the question is show responsibility.

You may want to ask the guys at Schilters if the gearbox will be an issue. It must have a new crossmember to fit the TH700, which may be a red flag for the MFK. (otherwise I doubt they'd notice - but a modern tuubular crossmember might stand out)

LEGALLY the tires need to be 1.6mm   
PRACTICALLY for SNOW performance you'd like to have more than 4mm, BUT my Nokians just this season went under 4mm and I had no problem with ice or snow at Val Thorens and elsewhere, handling more than 400Nm of torque and 280BHP. So it's all relative when it comes to PRACTICAL information.   
Also, good all seasons are not as good as good winters, BUT good all season like the afformentioned ones, are MUCH better than chinese no-name winters that I see increasingly being fitted to many cars running around ZH...

			Dear all 
Two months ago, we changed our apartment and our address in the post office from old to new. Post office sent us a letter with few offers for new house, offers from ikea etc. one was from SBB, bon de reduction around 400.- for annual abonnement. I have lost that somewhere. Now, I badly need that as I'm planning to make annual abonnment. I requested post again for new offers, they sent me again but without SBB.    
Is there any way that I can get similar reduction voucher from SBB? Any similar experience or advise please. Thanks

			I'm really starting to wonder what I have misunderstood with these people... 
Today I went to see two motorcycles from two different sellers in Geneva, and I had specifically asked them both if I could do a test drive. However, when I got to the first one, the bike didn't have licence plates!  
So I asked him politely: 
- ""Well then it is not possible to do a test drive?""  
- ""No.""    
And guess what happened at the next one? The very same thing!    
Good thing train rides aren't expensive in Switzerland, since I'm going all over it for nothing..       Yes I always ask them to at least start them, but as you say, it makes me walk away for the least sign of trouble when I can't test it and see if there is in fact a problem. From my search for insurance prices these bikes are not expensive to insure, so I don't get why they cancel the insurance ASAP? 20fr for an extra month would let them sell their bike much more easily... (if it works like it should)   
I notice you say ""working order"". What do they actually test when it comes to the engine, transmission, brakes and suspension of a motorcycle in the MFK? As far as I've heard they only check things like oil leaks, brake wear, smoke and noise, whereas the engine could be utter shite at some rpms, and the gearbox could have been fixed by Mr. Wormwood.   
PS. I am still very grateful for your replies, you're a helpful bunch   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2015	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Test driving not common in Switzerland?	sigrm	Posts: 14

			It's about some things that are affecting performance, emissions, handling, etc.   
For example putting spacers at the wheels needs a DTC paper (or whatever) if the track width changes more than 2%. 
Or putting exhausts, having drilled discs when the OEM ones are not drilled, etc.   
With the braided brake hoses the argument is that the ABS behaves differently, and that's why they need some kind of certification.   
They even say that they ""police"" re-flashing of the engine ECU but how they can do it when a well hidden parallel, or a reflash, cannot even be detected at dealerships is beyond me.   
In any case, if you want to make sure you won't have any problems don't go crazy Samco-blue fancy, and you'll be fine. They won't even notice.   
They also don't care if it's not strictly OEM sourced as long as it is OEM spec. So you don't need to get brake pads from the dealer, you can even run crazy race spec pads, but then they'll probably bust your balls about them screeching like crazy   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Feb 2015	Groaned at 5 Times in 4 Posts	Another MFK & OEM parts parts question	mek	Posts: 51

This.  You reapply to the DVLA and the send you your licence.  Based upon the conversations I had the other week with the DVLA and the Swiss equivalent (MFK) it's very likely that you'll get your actual one back as the MFK send it to the DVLA once you've surrendered it.       
Do you mean you never had a UK licence?  It's the same process - there's a reciprocal EU/EAA thing going on, I think.   Or are you asking something else?

- If you go for a motorbike with 50cc & without speed limitation (=cat. A1), you would need to attend a course of 8h (driving it, behind the instructor with in a group). Until you have done the course you would need to ride it with a ""L""-plate - and applying for a ""L""earner's-license. Then I personally would directly go for a 125cc one (instead of a 50cc > 45km/h) as the 125cc belong to the same category (A1).

And it's NOT that one cannot drive a foreign-plated vehicle in the country that you are resident, it's that you can't drive it without declaring it to customs, as it is a customs offense, not a legal offense.    
And the Italians are MUCH more strict about applying the law than the Swiss. The mayor of Muralto had her car confiscated for a year when she lent it to her son who was living and going to school in Italy!

			Hi,  
Try calling the SBB and they might reduce the fine if you explain the circumstances.  I do think they should have signs on transport explaining this fine for tourists. I have never heard of other countries with this.

			Based on personal experience, if you're looking to buy from a limited production run then you'll be able to register interest, place a refundable deposit (if required) and place a provisional order - reserving production numbers.   
You just won't be signing any sales contract on the day.    
In general you can get down and dirty (talking list prices, reserving a build slot etc) with the more exclusive manufacturers - which doesn't mean BMW/Mercedes/Audi.

			If you can't stop and/or slide and hit someone/something there's more than a reasonable chance you'll be held responsible no matter what tyres you have.  If someone hit's you there's also more than reasonable chance that you won't.    
Those are simply your recommendations, and are likely also to be recommendations of motoring bodies but the law is more lenient.  In Austria (and other countries) your recommendations wouldn't be legal.

			OK, I talked with out landlord. 
They were not very enthusiastic as the minimum rent period that they write a contract for is 1 year and all that talk. However, I convinced them that it is a favor for a friend of mine and after negotiating the renting fee, they agreed on 160 CHF down from 200 CHF.

			The Swiss car is clear (Art. 51 Abs3 Swiss Traffic Code  ).    
If you demage a third party property (car, fence, tree, animal, ...) you have to inform the rightful owner, and if the owner can not be reachd you have to call the police.    
A note under the wiper is no o.k.

			The beginning and end of a blue zone is marked on the street itself with a blue/white bar across the street. If the white part is closer to you before you cross you're about to enter a blue zone.    
You're allowed to park in a blue zone for an unlimited time if you buy a  special sticker, but these are reserved for residents only. For mere mortals it's 60-89 minutes: Say you arrive between 09:00 and 09:29, you set the blue disk to 09:30 and are allowed to stay until 10:30. See these  . For general info on parking and additional regulations  .   
Other than that you need to check which paragraph you acted against. As has been said, that's noted on the fine slip.   
For completeness' sake (I think this is quite unlikely to apply, but still):  
The disc itself must follow certain  regulations, which changed about ten years ago. This also shold be noted on the fine slip; in such a case get one from your car insurer or buy a replacement at a gas station shop of your choice.

a) is the motor home a ""leichter Personenwagen""? (less than 3.5 tons of _allowed_ overall weight) 
b) does it actually _fit_ into the blue box indicated on the road? Overall width of the vehicle might be a problem.   
If the answer to both questions is yes, then buy a Tagesbewilligung and be merry.   
A motor home in the true sense will probably kill you on both points, while a camping van based on the ever so popular Fiat Ducato might get you there.

I reckon it probably saves two hours door to door as the entry and exit are on the motorway rather than in the town, and the loading/unloading process are much quicker than a boat.   
If you're late they just put you on another train, and as there's one every 20 mins or so there isn't normally too much hanging around.  Massively less chance of weather disruption too.   
However, if you want a really low quality full English breakfast, to consume in the company of a load of booze cruisers drinking pints at 8am then the boat is your only option.

Get a sturdy cardboard box from your local bike shop and pack the bike. Dispose on the other end, then do the same when you're leaving.   
If its out of season most of the shops will pack the bike for a reasonable fee as well. Just make sure you have tools to reasemble it on the other side.   
Another option - soft bike bag. I flew my bikes countless times in the simple soft bag. you pack the wheels on both sides of the frame, and thus protect it. Aluminum frames will be fine. Never tried it on carbon (and posibly never will  )

Kindly note that during the transition phase, no SWISS  flights (including codeshare) can be booked or modified online or over  the phone.

So perhaps a better idea is to park in Annemasse and take the tram.

			In Zh the online service for buying a resident's permit is looking in the ZH STVA and sees the address the car is registered at.   
If you are using a car that is not yours long term, you can go with the car's papers and something that says that the car has been loaned to you (like a letter from your friend) and go to the actual office that is administering the permits (which for ZH is near the library, keep forgetting the address). That's what I was told from that office I should do with my Greek car but I needed to translate the car papers and it was just easier (although much more expensive) to get a spot in my building garage for some months.   
Try visiting the respective office and Basel (or call them) and see what they have to say. In ZH there are also provisions for replacement cars from a garage while yours is in for repairs, and can also be given for extended periods of time with help from the garage. So I guess a permit could be given, but not for a very long time.

I've never seen one like that in orange.  The exclamation mark  usually means ""BRAKES!!!!""  It could still well be, as the fluid gets low the light starts to flicker at first and when the fluid is really low the light stays on all the time.  I'd check that first if I were you before you drive the car again.   
The pad warning lights are normally orange and like (O) but the bracket parts have a gap in the middle of them.  Usually once they're on they're on until they're reset but it could be different with Audis.   
Consult your handbook!

			Personally I wouldn't buy it as it may have taken damage standing around   for a full year (Standschäden), and I lack the knowledge to even think   about identifying them.    
However, I'd expect any professional to have that knowledge, so you should be able to sell it without much ado.   
Another point: 
You'll need to bring it to the buyer for him to inspect the car,  towing may be not worth the cost. I think you can get a temporary permit  (valid for three days perhaps) so you can drive the car yourself, but  I'm not sure about the details. I'm sure Tom or somebody else can  explain.

On long flights the price difference between classes is batshit, it's better to suffer for 10 hours and buy a new laptop/smartphone or something.

			The laws are the same Swiss wide.   
I learnt this from the head of BL DMV when I had some problems importing a bike from Italy.   
After some phone calls and faxes, he told me everything was in order, but I should try the TI guys one last time, and if it didn't go there, he would do it in BL.   
However, it did go after that, though for weird reasons that I won't get into.   
Any more questions, PM me.

My instructor was a somewhat grump elderly guy who never even tried to be friendly while instructing but could spread deadly fear simply through his silence. Outside the car though, and especially in the theory lessons he was most amenable and would entertain the class with all sorts of absurd stories.  He was proud, however, of the fact that none of his pupils had ever failed a test and this meant he took extra time (costing extra money) to make sure you'd understood everything 100%.

The license is yours, at least as long as you do not do a major traffic infraction. Once you move aboard you would exchange the Swiss license for a license of the country you moved to, at least as long as Switzerland is not part of the EU. Depending on the law of the country you move to you have approx 6 to 12 months to exchange the license. After that period the Swiss license may be void in your new contry of residence.

			i have attended several of their courses a few years ago. i was new to the sport at the time, so the things they taught me were all new to me and i saw a good improvements in lap times on the circuits. on the road, they can make you a more confident rider, i.e. one of the days i had it was chucking it down, and i was on dry weather tyres, but learnt to trust the tyres with the bike lent over.   
their class structure is quite good. class room session focusing on one or two areas, followed by a track session to practice what was learnt. then repeat. about 5 or 6 class/track sessions in the day. when out on track, there is 1 instructor for about 2-4 people, so feedback that you get is pretty good.

			Just something you may want to consider: written notes from parents and children's IDs. I was once with a group of kids on the way to the cirque du soleil and on the train, a police officer was suspicious whether they were skipping school, or *as I later found out* I was abducting them. We called each kid's parents one by one so it was fine. I know you may not run into any problems since you are likely only a short train or tram ride away from the cinema, but I thought I'd mention it just in case.

I don't want to do anything. Beyond telling any of my friends and clients who care about such things, or who have a need to know (being persons with a US/UK/CH connection) how to deal with a situation which may have no obvious solution.   
Or perhaps I want to mention something in one of the law review articles I write. Why should it matter? I talk and write about cross-border anomalies. Not least about FATCA and PFIC, which are virtually impossible for any US Person in Switzerland (or Canada or anywhere else) to comply with and live a normal life.   
(Thus my conversation with the Swiss consul yesterday about what to do when a married couple can get one original only, and no certified copies whatsoever, of a marriage certificate (acte de mariage). In England no less, under the provisions relating to marriage of Jews under the Marriage Act 1949. I posted his remarks to the forum yesterday.)   
What I didn't include in my summary was what the law is when you bring your UK (or US for that matter) car to France or Switzerland and it gets wrecked on the road. Or needs repairs and the cost of repairs is more than it's worth.   
Both have happened to me. I know the answers, and so does my insurance company. (Who else's insurance company, having agreed compensation, would ring back twice: once to say that they notice I have personal property cover and didn't I lose anything in the accident that they should replace under my ""new for old"" cover? And then to say that, bringing the car back to the UK they discovered it was untaxed as diplomatic: and never mind, they would still pay the agreed amount.)   
Perhaps the forum is inappropriate.

			Hi,   
I just purchased a couple of the duo-tagekarte (double day passes, two for one)... from the post shop.   
They posted them to me the next day!   
Link is here:      
They come with a 'bonus' offer which is a discounted two month 'halbtax' card for 33chf. Very helpful for when the grandma comes to visit next month.   
The travelpasses must be used before 17th January, but the 'catch' is that the  extra halbtax offer must be purchased before 27th December...Since grandma only arrives at the beginning of January, we're going to have a chat with our friendly local SBB ticket salesman and see if they will still be able to issue it using one of our local Swiss ID's...but with her details...will let you know how that goes...    
The travelpasses have to be used by at least one person who already has a half-fare card. So if you need a half-tax as well, they have obviously made that easier with their special offer. But that's no problem, the rest of the family already have half-fare cards, and since it's a 'duo' offer at least one of us will travel with her...    
Oh, and either way, if anyone needs a 'short term' halbtax for a guest in the next week, I am happy to post the voucher to you for no charge...

			Better relocate to zurich, you save taxes, time and money for the sbb ticket. 
When you need a ticket for the sbb , a good option will be the monthly ticket 
for the halftax (cost is 410 sfr), so you can travel all over switzerland in your free time. 
The parking ticket for a day is available at the green ticket machines from the BVB, for a month can be purchased by the ""Kundenzentrum basel Stadt "" at the  
Spiegelgasse.

			Mofa is short for  tor hrrad, motorized bicycle.    
The traditional meaning is a bicycle-like one-seated vehicle with pedals and a combustion engine of 50cm3 capacity with a 30km/h speed limit. A permit category M is required for these (minimum age 14 years).   
However, things have changed over the last 10-20 years, partially due to the increased useability of electric motors. There are multiple additional categories these days, including scooters (up to 50cm3 but higher speed limit, driver license category A1u).   
If you opt for an electric motor   gives a good overview, including required permits.

766	07.12.2015, 21:23	Member	Thanked 70 Times in 37 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    A fine may be issued aside from the Strafbefehl, perhaps this depends on whether you take it to court or not. If you want a reliable answer ask the authorities that sent you the Strafbefehl.   
Withdrawal of driving license for a limited period may follow. You seem to have been more than ""a few"" km too fast (probably more than 15km/h above the limit), otherwise there wouldn't be a Strafbefehl but just an ordinary fine.   
=====================================   
As for translation of Strafbefehl: There's none AFAIK.    
Strafbefehl is kind of a shortened trial where the prosecuting attorney issues the verdict, i.e. no judge gets involved. This only happens in minor cases where the verdict would be quite clear if actually taken to court. The idea is to take work load off the courts.   
Edit:    That will happen after the Strafbefehl has become ""rechtskräftig"" (legally valid).

			Dear folks ,   
so a week ago my old Xevo 250 overheated on the motorway and according to the mechanic the engine is seized....   
So since I recently passed the driving test I thought I'll upgrade to a 25kW model and hopefully not encounter the dreaded blown cylinder head gasket problem. I do about 20,000 kms per year and can do some basic maintenance myself (oil , filters etc.)   
I found two bikes on autoscout at reasonable cost quite a distance away but after having read a bit about difficulties with ITalian imports (I'd normally prefer the Italian one) I thought I'd let the clever people at EF choose which one I should get.    
In the left corner - Xevo 400 from Koln - 17000 kms on the clock  for 2100 euro , private sale :    
In the right corner - Xevo 400 from dealer in Venice ITaly - 9750 kms for 2300 :    
Thanks as always.

			Major service areas from Calais down as far as Dole are:   
de Rely, de Souchez, Barelle, d'Urvilles, Mont de Nizy, Reims-Champagne, Soummesous, Troyes, Chateauvillain, Langres-Perrogney, Dijon-Brognon, de Pont. All of these have fuel, food, toilets, etc.  Can't advise beyond there as we get off the motorway and head across country at Dole.  That takes us about 6.5 hours including filling up at the Total (10 minutes), lunch (25 minutes), and a short break later (10-15 minutes).   
There's a cheap Total petrol station off the next roundabout after you leave the ferry port.  The address is here:   
Z.I. Marcel Doret - 585, rue Costes et Bellonte, 62100 Calais, France   
Diesel was 1.11 for their Premier brand in September, petrol's 15 or so centimes more - this compared to motorway prices of between 1.23 and 1.27 for diesel.  Not sure if it's open 24/7 though, even being a truck stop.

			As both your children are 4 years and over they can use a booster seat. They are reasonably price and do not take up too much space.   
Trying to use one car seat is a great idea!    
I would never just go without a carseat to pick up someone elses child or a short trip. Statics show that you are more likely to have an accident when on a short trip or within five miles of your home after a long trip! I had the most horrific car accident four years ago (not in CH) when my children were 13 months old and 6 years respectively and I was only collecting them from school, wasn't rushing around and I am convinced they survived the crash due to being in the correct car seats! My daughter is now 10 years old and still using a car seat. Accidents happen when you least expect them.   
I hope this helps - good luck!

It's more an electric shock she needs than a buzzer .. Also for speed cameras, her 5th minor speeding fine arrived yesterday..    
FWIW .. The booster has been on charge since yesterday and pressing the little button today to see it's charge, the needle goes off the scale, past 14v. So charging the charger was probably a good call .. We'll see later if it works, once i've got time to go drive it for an hour - if it starts.

			Are you sure what Trev intends is legal?    
If it was his car (owned abroad for a certain amount of time, 12 months if memory serves) AFAIK what you are talking about would be ok.   
But it's his dad's car. I may be wrong of course, but AFAIK residents must not drive foreign plated cars in CH (a few exceptions apply, none matches here).    
So if Trev registered residency here and drove his dad's foreign plated car (with or without change in ownership) it would be illegal. OTOH driving it here without him registering his residency would be legal. No?      "	null	null	null	Temporarily using a car on foreign plates...	guest	null

			I would however take a note here that driving culture in Ticino is a different game to that of Zurich. I myself as not so seasoned driver looked at the traffic in Ticino for a while and went for extra lessons just to get a hang of it. Maybe you do your license in Zurich but then take few extra lessons in Ticino.   
Lot of people cross the border from Italy every day and bring with them the italian flair on the roads, add the narrow streets and hills and anyone who is used to ""orderly"" Swiss driving will feel bit threatened at first. This applies to cities mostly...and of course if you are a good driver it might not feel like that but as I was definitely not used to it I felt a lot better taking lessons.

In that case you would pay the purchase price (which is excluding VAT) plus the Swiss VAT plus 4%. You still are liable for the Swiss VAT at import of course.   
The VAT status is determined when the car is bought new. It gets either VAT status as a VAT registered business buys it or not in case a private person buys it.

			Hello, I would like to say at this time of year, book the Train / Shuttle and not the ferry.The delays are quite long in case of  bad weather. If you are caught up in the traffic on the road to Calais, you have no chance for refreshments.(or even toilet facilities).So make sure you pack a drink /snack. 
I use the Pay /Toll roads from Metz to calais (via Reims) as there is never major traffic congestion, and the roads are in good condition. Point to note though,in France, between the toll points, your time is measured and if you have been speeding,you will get a fine. (or at least a warning). 
Safe Journey to you all,

Starters use anything from 100 amps to 200+ amps depending on the engine size. These thin cables tend to have a large voltage loss and get hot quickly - they may work on a small petrol car, in summer, but not on a diesel or in winter.   
Also the crocodile clips tend to be crap, so more voltage wasted and they're not safe if they come off and drop into the engine bay.

			You can do it all online. From this site, and others:       
You buy credits, and go through an online course. Each question costs one credit, about 10 questions/frank IIRC   
Its the same format as you'll use to take the actual test.

I've checked the autoscout website and the prices indicated there don't seem a lot different to the official Ford price list published on the ford website so I have feeling that the dealers may be the most competitive at the moment given the economical climate and the difficulty to shift units.

you can also have the person buy an additional insurance so that if they crash or damage the car, it's not down to your policy.  But this is usually an addition to a car insurance policy....so they might not need your car....!

			In the latest TCS magazine (December 2015) they have an article about potential ""problems"" with the Mobility Car insurance program.   
The standard deductible in case of an accident (or any damage to the car) is   (or more for young and new drivers). So in the case of an accident (if you are even partially at fault), you will be on the hook for the first CHF 2'500. Also if you take the car without noticing some previous damage (that you can not prove was there), you are liable for the first CHF 2'500 of damage.       You have to ask for this option as it is not offered directly. If you rent only from time to time, you can pay CHF 20 per rental.   
Both of these premiums are per person so if you are two people in the family who rent you both have to pay.   
The TCS also recommends that you take photos of the car (any visible damage outside/inside) before you drive off so you have proof that it was there from the previous driver. You should also take photos when you return the car.    
Also as a bit of a plug for their insurance program, they also recommend you have a Livret ETI if you drive outside of CH with a Mobility car.

It probably depends on which platform you're using. Being a Nokia app. it's optimised for Lumia (Windows phone). Under settings there is an option to "" "" - not a full list of everything interesting, but things more related to driving and basic needs (petrol, car parks, cashpoints, hospitals, etc).

			Few months back, I used minivan to transport sofa (3 seater in 3 pieces). Back seats folds flat & it is easy to load if your boxes are not too big.   
Another occasion used for 4 door wardrobe (dismantled), around 7-8ft height. it was slightly difficult but I could manage.   
Could have hired transport van. I usually drive small car, so was afraid of handling it, during reverse/parking etc.

The post-facelift version with the 6 speed Getrag box (or any diesel or Cooper S) is much stronger, the old Rover box in the early One and Cooper can grenade itself in as little as 40k KM.   
Fiat 500 is OK, we had one in 2008 (one of the first batch to arrive in the UK)  to replace a 2004 Panda.  I actually preferred the Panda to drive but obviously it isn't as nice a place to sit in so depends on priorities.   
CR-V is a good option, they seem to be extremely reliable and are good to drive too.  I've had one of these as well (a 1997 auto) which was bought as a winter hack in the UK but quickly became my main car because it was so good.   
Old 5er or E Class, I wouldn't personally.  You're basically buying a high mileage old car and unless you're minded to tinker yourself there are likely to be a few niggles which will annoy you, and even if you find a really good one there will be a lot of bits which are coming towards the end of their life at 15-20 years and 200k KM old (bushes, rubber seals, hoses etc).   
Passat is just an automotive brown cardigan.  Very functional but with a few exceptions it's the dullest thing in the world.  Buy a Skoda Superb if you want a cheap big car - same oily bits at a lower price.

			I bought a Peuogeot 308 SW this past february. 5 years old, excellent condition (large company car so most probably well serviced), 34k km. List price new around 35k new, I paid 9k.    
I think it was a bargain, would expect to pay perhaps 1/3 of list price. But anyway if you buy a 3-5 year old car you avoid most of the writeoff yet the car is still in a (very) reliable state.

			Update on my old thread for whoever might need the info..   
I have a class C  CDL from the US. To get my swiss CDL I had to:   
- fill out form from STVA and wait for response 
- send in my US license with one of the forms that they sent 
- get a medical exam and give the other form they sent to the doctor to sign     and mail 
- wait for another response, with a scheduled time for the written exam (not available in English)  
- take the written exam. multiple choice on a computer, given at the STVA.  
- provide proof that you have had your auslander CDL for more than 2 years, if not evident on the actual license/card   
They sent it out quickly, I go it a few days later after all said and done, along with my US license. I had taken the Kat. C test. They gave me on my Swiss license Kat. B, C, D1, BE, CE, and D1E.   
Total cost CHF 140-150, plus 120 for the med. check. Process took about a month.   
Study materials for written exam available online    
Note that for goods transport and people transport of over 8 people you now need a fähigkeitsausweis/ qualification card which requires a five day course, a written test, a spoken test, and a road test - all at a cost of many thousand CHF. You may be exempt from the tests if you were issued your CDL before 9.2008, but still need to take the course every 5 years.   
It didn't matter that I'd waited a while after arriving to transfer it, though it was no longer valid in CH (but still was in the US).    
This was in Luzern.   YMMV.   
Hope that helps someone...

			Well here we are some weeks later, so time to post an update.   
I was detected speeding on the 20th of September, doing 108 in a 80 zone via a police speed trap.   
The fine arrived in the post on the 21st of October (Was hoping they had lost the data :-) ) and the fine broke down to ;   
CHF 320 for the fine and CHF 330 for the admin cost/court cost. 
Also I was given the option (So the person who read the letter for me said) the option to go to prison for 4 days rather than pay the fine ???   
This week 2nd November I got a rambling letter that was translated for me (person who read it and Swiss , said it was a badly written letter) saying I now had a warning and this applied for 2 years and If caught again in 2 years I would get a 1 month ban. It also went on to say that speeding a little bit was ok ??? i.e. If I got caught and fined for doing 16 above limit in a town, 21 above limit on a rural road or 26 above limit on a motorway  <--- Above would trigger a violation of Warning. 
It also mentioned drink driving would trigger a violation in the 2 year warning period (Not an issue because I stopped drinking alcohol back in 2007 for health reasons).   
I will now presume I will get a bill for the Warning letter.   
This is my second speeding fine in 35 years of driving. 
Both fines in the previous 8 months. 
The first one was a camera when I exit a tunnel and the speed limit went down from 80 to 60. I was flashed doing 71. I missed the speed reduction ....my error.   
I now drive at limit minus 10% and if the person behind don't like ...tough !     
Q: Just curious - If you got a ban for say 1 month or 3 months + and you were returning to the UK during the ban period, i presume you can't drive in the UK and convert your Swiss license into a UK one until the ban was expired ? 
(Not that i intend to be in that position).

			Hey EF!    
Perhaps someone can help me out.  
While i understand perfectly well how to count Zone Upgrades, I am having a hard time understanding where this Zone Upgrade starts from.    
For example, I currently have the yearly Zone 110 abo, and, let's say for a specific strip I also have to buy a ticket from Pfaffikon ZS to Lachen (regular ticket). If I have a 4 Zone Upgrade for that day anyway, can I use this Zone Upgrade from Zone 110 and onward   from Pfaffikon to +4 zones from there (since I have a regular ticket from Pfaffikon to Lachen anyway)? Or, is this zone upgrade only valid from Zone 110?    
If any experts have any insight into that, it would be much appreciated.    
Thanks!

			Hi Nelita, 
Thanks, I had completely forgotten about the dialect  
So yeah, good one.  
Another reason to know how much it cost.   
And also thank you for letting me know how to say that in German. 
I was preparing a whole speech (via google translate) - what to say and how to order it hahaha, so yeah, your version is definitely shorter.   
Pfffew, I was really worrying about holding up the line in the bus, early in the morning and now, deep sigh, I don't have to worry about that anymore    
At the moment, I have no half tax card, once I have a job, I would be able to pay for all this and get a yearly card.   
Thanks and have a good day!

downside was that when my parents realised it was a flat rate to travel for the day, they wanted to maximise the use of it! and so we travelled a LOT.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Oct 2009	Groaned at 246 Times in 157 Posts	SBB travel card	Phil_MCR	Posts: 11,547

			Hi everybody. I plan to buy a flight ticket and leave home for Xmas. Does anyone drive to Bergamo Airport on 23.Dec. morning? I would share a car, need 2 places. I have already checked blabla/mitfahrer  
I live in SZ, but can get anywhere what has a sense. Using public transport seems to be complicated in this case.

			I suggest you have a look at this summary of the key theory and if anything is unfamiliar you should probably swot up.     
Also remember on the motorway it's double shoulder check before changing lane and on slip roads.  It's not unusual to do a stretch on the motorway between Baden/wettingen and spreitenbach.     
Don't bother downloading maps but get out on your bike as much as possible around the test center.  Your instructor should be giving you tips on test routes, needless to say up towards boppelsen is one, back roads between wettingen and otelfingen, oetwil an der limmat etc   
Be clear on your priority from the right and show bremsbereitschaft (readiness to brake by covering the brake) as you approach priority from the right situations.   
Looks like you have the order on turning correct but don't forget einspuren (positioning in anticipation of turn) as well.  The examiners are hot on this.   
If in doubt try and squeeze in another lesson.  You'll be glad of it. 
Best of luck

			The MT09 and the Speedmaster.....they're not that similar are they?  Two different riding positions completely......I'd take the MT09 but if you talk Street or Speed Triple then Street yes and Speed maybe (it's a bit long in the tooth).   
I assume you are coming from an R1 or something given your basic summary?  If you're doing long miles and squaring off the tyres at 120kph then think about wind protection and luggage options too.

			Can I assume, as you have UK as your base, that you are flying to Basel on a 3 day visit, during which you will drive to Neuschwanstein Castle?   
Weil am Rhein is a large German town right next to Basel airport. You could easily find a German car hire there. Use   for a good price.

Alternatively fly to southern Germany and drive to Neuschwanstein Castle and you might even have time to visit Linderhof Palace

			Apologies for digging up an old thread...but... What??? Give up my UK licence?   
I have a home in the UK, and a car. Which I use to commute to the airport, to come out to Zurich Monday to Friday. I might stay here occasional weekends, when the lovely wife will come out to see me.   
I've no plans to get a car here, but we have an office pool car I can borrow.   
How does the licence thing work for me then? 4.5 days here, 2.5 at home.

As it's said above the thing you really need is the certificate of conformity.  I got sent mine for free.  I believe modifications need to be notified and you need *Swiss* approval for them, but there might be some general exceptions. This applies to wheels too. My car's on slightly lowered Eibach springs which are dark grey in colour and the MFK didn't say a thing because it still looks more or less stock.   Doesn't sound like that would be your case though. I also modified the lights to LHD and ""activated"" the rear fog lamp on the other side.   
For the Japanese car, you might be able to get away with a cert of partial conformity and then make the relevant mods to meet the european spec, using genuine european parts, but this being Switzerland you probably can't and/or it will be stupid expensive.   
Not that it's legal but quite a few folk drive around with UK plates for years (here in Basel where there are always French and German cars around) without ever having any problems.  Similarly they retain their UK licences but I think in most cases these people still have a home in the UK and hope to argue that they're ""on holiday"" or something should anything happen.  The police have basically admitted that it's not something they actively check.

I thought it strange too as the Swiss licence has ""permis de conduire"" on the front but the back where it says ""name"" is in German so I guess completely non-understandable to a Frenchperson ;-)  Apparently the rental car company insist on it so she has to get one. We all know rental companies often have their own rules although I don't think they offered her one at inflated prices, or maybe they did, or maybe they do that for the poor suckers who turn up without one.

			Hi all,    
I was an a diplomatic dependent permit till a few months ago. I recently turned 24 and can no longer be considered dependent on my parents. I changed my permit according to where I work now. I have a foreign license and used to drive around on that early. I was not required to change it because of the type of permit I was on. 
My current drivers license does not warrant a direct conversion to a Swiss License. 
Will I be given another year to change my permit or will I to change it immediately?

			Dear fellow members,   
As my older boy started to move faster than wind with his micro trotinette / kickboard, I am considering to buy myself a similar transport for the free time we spend outrunning each other.    
As I've never been on the market for one of them, have little clue on brands or what matters outside the ubiquitous Micro, like these:          
Are there other brands I should take a look at?  
Tips on what to pay for and what to disregard as pure marketing gimmicks? 
If you own one - what do you like or dislike about your model?   
Thank you!

Is this a ""known"" problem - IE one that you (or the vehicle owner or the son) has been aware of prior to failure? What exactly has failed? What is the 1000chf quote based on?   
A ""cheap"" garage is still going to charge >100chf per hour, which may sound expensive in GBP, but that low price hasn't changed from 20 years ago, a time when a local mecahnic was charging £45 per hour.    
If the car doesn't drive the mechanic my be quoting on collecting the car and towing it down to the garage and then fixing the problem.   
The question that may effect people most on here though is whether it is a CH registered car - if not, and it is being used for extended periods in Switzerland I would question whether the insurance is valid.

			Technically, you can only have what's listed in the registration certificate and/or certificate of conformity, and that might well say you can have whatever you want but it might also limit your choices (which it probably won't).  I say that because my CoC is very restrictive, even limiting the brand of tyres.  As far as OEM wheels go, I'm only allowed to have one of the two different types of wheels that were available when the car was new.     
Generally speaking though, you only have to worry about the set of wheels your car will be on when you go through the MFK.

			Border control can choose to accept driving licence or other photo id, or not. Should they feel suspicious (and they don't have to give explanation) they can insist on Passport or Identity card + of course driving licence and insurance, etc - and escort you home if you haven't got the relevant docs with you.

It really depends how far you live from the train stations, I am unlucky in the fact that my bus is not in sync with S24 train so I wait 10 minutes at the station everytime. More if there's a delay which usually there is.

			@thewandererreturns: Thanks a lot!  Apparently it works with Basel St. Johann, but I haven't found the same offer for Basel SBB (while the former is not a direct connection and the latter is   ). Also, I did indeed write them asking about this stuff, so let's see what they'll answer.   
@Medea Fleecestealer: I'm a EU citizen, so I think I shouldn't have any issues relocating in France. This is probably another issue to figure out, but honestly right now I'm more concerned with the transport. If that fails, everything else fails.   
@Ace1: Mulhouse could be an option but so could any other town or city (I don't have a fixed plan yet). Right now I just wanna check this option in general and I'm pretty uncertain about the whole plan. The only thing I know is that I visited Basel and didn't feel at ease there.

			So back at the end of June I bought (another) car - without an MFK. Well, technically the MFK was from Jan 2014, and the car is from 2008, so it has an MFK just not a fresh one.   
The only reason this happened is the dealer discovered the rear brakes needed doing and didn't then have time to do the test. The dealer is happy to cover all the costs and so this morning I emailed him the ausweiss and he populated the ""online form"" - I kind of feel bad that I didn't do it, but then I spent 4 hours cleaning 2 of the winter wheels and I suspect, despite asking, they won't get the other 2 perfectly clean either!   
Back to the plot, he submitted the request around 0745 - I received a time and date around 0755 (for next week). I   the STVA back asking for early time but I was easy about te date. By 0815 I had an earlier time and the appointment booked for later next week.   
There was no special premium rate helpline - just a guy at Albisgutli checking a group mailbox, reading requests and actioning them promptly! What sort of madness is that?   "	null	null	null	STVA MFK Booking Service	guest	null

			Went on a battery hunt last night.   
Landi had only two batteries, price was great (the more expensive of the two was 79chf), but could see no listing for what cars they would fit.   
Jumbo has 20% off Varta and Pilot batteries but as usual (checked them last time we needed a battery) they don't have the one we need (Subaru Legacy & Impreza so not anything special).   
Coop has 30/33% off at the moment and have at least 3 batteries for the Legacy. Battery we need is 146chf before discount.   
Was on the Bike last night so will return tonight with the car to Coop for the battery.

I think it depends a lot on who you get. I haven't done this in several years but I've been told that there are some red flags to avoid getting closer looks. For example, if you have non-standard wheels, swap them out for the originals. Borrow them if you have to. Original air cleaners and other cosmetic mods also ring the alarm bells. I've been told - never tried it - that TCS will do a 'pre-inspection' to give you a list of things to adapt but I don't know if that is true or a rumor.

Which means, assuming your car will need a service and MFK before being sold by a dealer, would mean you'd be offered around 2-2.5k.   
The vast majority of Vectras of that age in Switzerland either have stellar KMs and are looking to exported (usually ex-mobile engineer cars) or already have exported.

			Monster is definitely bi-posto, but the turning circle is a joke and no experienced rider I know recommended one for taking the exam.

@bigfujitsu: 
you're a brave one, ain't ya?   Supersports with their riding characteristics and (especially) their gearing are the worst thing possible for a beginner rider I think.

Since then I had few problems with it and all have been managed by Hyundai garage in CH (3 times) within a warranty.    
I can't compare it with the same model which could be available in Switzerland so don't know about the finishing and parts. For me it was 10'000 cheaper than same model+specs available in the Hyundai garage at that time.

			Don't know how old your younger brother is but I know on my policy there is a restriction on under 25s driving regularly (""regularly"" is not precisely defined).  I had to pay extra when the minis were younger than that.

			Wear and tear on engine is function not just of kilometres driven, but also number of starts (more wear is done in first second after cold starting when minimal oil lubricates the engine than in several minutes of warm highway driving) and frequency of maintenance.  Also, things like window switches, rubber seals around car, lamps, cloth or leather seats, etc are function of time and weather exposure than kilometres driven. 
So, a garaged 4 year old car with 200k Km but with documented regular service record and driven mostly on smooth highway for extended periods would be my strong choice over a 8 year old car with 100k, with no service record, used only on short in-town jaunts by a guy who lives on a rutted road with lots of potholes. 
Good luck on your decision!

			There are several old threads about the problem of parking outside of paid parking lots in Lausanne.  I just found out some valuable (to me anyway) info on how it works.  Please pardon my incorrect french spelling and other descriptive mistakes. 
1.  In ""Sauf Autorization"" areas you can park for one hour using the blue arrival time indicators (sorry don't know of hand what these are called).  At 19:00 you can set it and then in an hour reset it to 8:00am.  That gives you overnight parking but you must move your car before 9:00am.  This works Mon-Sat.  Saturday you can leave it until Monday morning. 
2.  If you are visiting for more than a day you can go to the ""Hotel du Police"" and get scratch cards (for a daily fee) that will cover 24 hours.  It is currently 15CHF for non-city-center parking (Cartes périphérie du centre).  The catch is that you have to go there with the resident you are staying with. Perhaps some hotels already have these.

			My recommendation since I am not a legal person is that someone who has real proof post the evidence that a person with a CH license is not allowed to drive a rental car from EU in CH. Have done this a number of times and shown my CH pass to police and customs and never ever had even a question asked.   
This sounds silly and the reasons given don't make sense.   
To import something you need to have ownership and the right to import it - rental cars are owned by the rental company and you are required to return them to the rental company so how could someone driving a rental car even think they are allowed to export the car. I would expect customs would look at you and think and ask for proof that you are even allowed to import the car which you will not be able to prove.   
Maybe the people suggesting this is a problem demonstrate how one imports a rental car that one doesn't have a legal right to import before posting lots of information that suggests heaps of people are breaking the law.

			Its 32f per way, not 35. If you want to save money, get the free ticket from the airport to Geneva main station, that saves you 4f.  
If you want to save even more, try to buy supersaver tickets. These are valid for a specific train, so you have to take that exact train. They are up to 50% cheaper, so depending on the time, it could go down to 16f per way

			I seem to remember cases where folk, although they knew the train was running late,  had had to purchase their tickets before official leaving time.  However, because of the delay, the ticket (with a time limit on it) was no longer valid to the end of their journey. This might well be one of the main reasons for the change.

			Surely if the OP is paying for a parking place, then it is up to the landlord/letting company to help with this problem. I would write to them company to complain formally. I would include the threat to reduce rent payment for every time you are inconvenienced.

			Just wanted to share my experiences in case it helps anyone. Went to the Strassenverkehrsamt in Zurich yesterday for an appointment at  9.07 (!) for the car to be tested. I explained to the man that I had been told the night before by a friend that I should have had my engine steam cleaned in advance but that by the time I 'd heard this it was too late.   
He told me not to worry and said as long as it wasn't really, really filthy it should be ok. In fact I'm pleased to say that it was ok and the car passed straight away. I'm now glad I hadn't gone to the trouble and expense of arranging an appointment for the engine to be cleaned.   
It was all very organised at the Strassenverhkehrsamt and they were very friendly and helpful and it all went like clockwork! You didn't even have to pay on the spot as they send you the bill in the post.

I've always fancied buying a vespa and briefly owned one in the UK. I never acquired a full bike license in the UK simply relying on the CBT.     
What is the requirement here in Switz? Is there a CBT Equiv? Do I need anything special on my Driving license in order to get insured and use a 125? Is there an engine size which I don't need to get a license for?

Here is a useful thread on how to import UK car to Switzerland       
Something else to compare the price difference on cars between Switzerland & UK, i.e. some brands would be considerable more expensive in Switzerland to UK   
I believe you are allowed to keep a car on UK number plates for up to a year, providing you have valid MOT, Road Tax and insurance.  However international insurance for the year you would probably find very high.  Possible better to import, but then you will need international insurance for the time you are traveling.  Think most UK Insurance include a month, some maybe 2 or 3 months, that is not as high at the International Insurance for 1 year.   
Something else to think about, if you will need 4 wheel drive?   
Not relevant to the import, but so you know, most people in Switzerland, have a set Summer & set of Winter wheels for their car.   
Good luck in your search

			You can lower the price so that you sell quicker. 
Just make sure that yours is the cheapest one on autoscout compared to its peers.

			Hi all,   
I recently imported my european car into switzerland. 
It has a european license plate holder, which i am about to take off.  
But I was wondering where the swiss front license plate needs to be.   
Does it need to be in the centre or can it be on the side? 
Any height requirements? I was thinking of putting it on the grill instead on my bumper.   
Google didn't show me answers.   
Thanks a lot for your help!

			I've done trips between various places in the Netherlands and Pays de Gex or Valais many times now, both via France and via Germany and there are advantages and disadvantages to both routes.   
France has a nice long area of relatively cheap peage (around 20 EUR), which is a nice road to drive on as it's rather quiet (between Dole and Nancy), just set the cruise control to 130 and go. The pass through the Jura mountains near the Pays de Gex is quite beautiful, but might not be nice to drive in the winter with snow. Luxembourg has cheap gas. But the roads outside the peage and the Belgian highway aren't that great.   
The German route has the advantage of large swaths of highway with no speed limit. Going up to 160+ can save you quite some time, if you drive outside rush hours. The roadside facilities are a bit nicer in Germany than in France. But there are a lot of ""baustellen"" (construction works) that cause slowdowns or traffic jams. And the highways around large cities can be very crowded in rush hour.   
For us, the decission is now primarily made based upon our destination in NL (or departure point). The more west that is, the more likely we are to choose the French route.

			You could take it to Garage Storrer in Cornaux for them to have a look at. They are very helpful and friendly and won't rip you off. They'll tell you if it's roadworthy.   
You should really have got it checked or at least got a guarantee before buying it but hindsight is a wonderful thing.

			I hope you have done enough research, I thought you could only get Swiss plates if you actually live here, and the car has been imported.    
For breakdown recovery, as per the AA in London, you can join the Swiss TCS without a specified car, and buy European breakdown cover,

			In every city it is the Stadtpolizei that keep the law and order, and issue parking tickets. Why not ask them where to safely park? (NOT the cantonal police)    
Between 4 pm and 9 am you shouldn't really have a problem parking on most quiet roads, as the blue parking disc will allow you to park for free, and the parking wardens go off duty at 4 pm but start working the streets around 9 am.

			The article;     
Says that new law is specifically aimed at Segway and motorised single wheels.   
Here is a translation of the most pertinent paragraph;   
""Jusquà il y a quelques mois, un flou législatif entourait lutilisation  de ces engins. Mais depuis le 1er juin, lOffice fédéral des routes  (Ofrou) a décidé de cantonner ces monoroues et leur cousin à deux roues,  le Segway, aux routes et aux pistes cyclables. Terminé le slalom sur  les trottoirs et les zones piétonnes"".   
=""Up until a few months ago a there was a grey area around the use of these objects. But since the 1st of June the Federal office for Roads (OFROU) has decided do push mono-wheels and their two-wheeled cousin the Segway onto the roads and cycle paths. Finished the slaloming on paths and in piedestrian zones"".    
A motorised vehicle of any sort capable of over 20 kilometres an hour (  10 as you cite) is a menace on a crowded pavement, with a lot of riders expected pedestrians to give way to them;assuming they have priority because they're simply faster.   
If those riders had been less pushy in the first place a new rule might not have been considered necessary.   
I agree that a busy main road is maybe not the ideal place for them, but I see no reason at all why they shouldn't be using the ton of cycle paths around.

			As i posted in Portuguese forum budget (low cost) airlines and legacy has different airlines models.   
Low cost models are point to point flights. For example if you buy flight from Spain to France and France to Poland if the former get delayed the latter will not wait and no compensation.   
So depends on what your needs are.

			you all have to use some common sense. If some repair work would be allowed then it would be difficult to spell out what chemicals are allowed and what not, due to flammable risks and toxic fumes. So they write that now work allowed because most work does create some mess and smells.   
if you do work on your vehicle you must be very clean, organized and chemical smell free.    
Obviously it will be a problem if you have 20 cans of smelly flammable stuff all around and people get irritated by any of the stuff. Its a community garage. However it is not a problem if you are somewhat hidden and keep your tools and chemicals well organized and smell free.

			The car rental company will charge you for their efforts of forwarding the whole thing to you. Not sure, but you may be able to avoid that by contacting the police of the Kanton you were speeding in, perhaps phone them and ask (email if you don't speak the local language).

1) I should go and ask to Stadt Polizei, see if they advise anything on that. 
2) Try to negotiate with the guy, what ever I can bite off  
3) Pay the bill, then fuel up with whiskey and smoke to forget about it. Lesson learned, never ever do that again.

			Perhaps it's that the guest spaces are meant for just that... your guests. 
You might be allowed to use a space for a day or two in exceptional circumstances, but for two weeks?   
It's quite possible one of your neighbours has complained, or that the person responsible for 'policing' the parking area has noticed that you're a resident and not really entitled to park there. 
Ask your concierge/caretaker about the parking spaces and the tickets, if they're not sure check your contract and with the regie/letting agency.   
Out of curiosity, where are you intending to park once you have bought the car?

			The policeman comes to the kindergarten where I work every year to teach the kids to cross the road.   
They very deliberately teach the children to wait until the car is fully stopped before crossing,    
They definitely need an awareness programme for drivers because many do slow and stop miles before the crossing, rather than coming normally to the crossing and making a full stop.   
In Australia, you must stop no further back than something like 1 metre, but not over the crossing paint, and you must come to a complete stop...crawling to avoid having to completely stop the vehicle is not OK.    
Anyway, makes sense to me, but having observed many many children trying to cross the road using the 'policeman's rules'....there are a large percentage of drivers who either fail to stop, slow down but do not come to a full stop, or stop miles back from the crossing....both driver and child become quite confused.   
If you have not come to a full stop and applied your brakes, you are not in control of your vehicle, so please come to a full stop so the little kids can cross safely...thank you!!

The instructions are on the blue disc you (need to) have in your car.   
As in all parking cases, there could be a sign saying something specific. I've mainly seen this in very busy areas (shorter times allowed) or more rural areas obviously designed for walkers (longer times allowed).

			In case anyone is wondering the VAT scam is alive and operational throughout Europe. Had it happen in Vienna yesterday, where a rather dumb shop assistant insisted I show a boarding pass, claiming it would be impossible to complete the sale otherwise, and was incapable of answering questions  relating to VAT, security of the data scanned. 
The same has happened to me in any case in Frankfurt and Munich (and possibly other places, though I don't remember). 
What annoys me the most is their calling the shops ""duty-free"" which is a load of bs. 
Conclusion - this isn't a UK problem, the scam exists all over the place. If the shops wanted to be honest, they would deduct the VAT from travellers with boarding passes travelling outside the EU (like returning to Switzerland) rather than just putting it into their pockets.

The longest a German licence will be valid until will be 2033.       So a UK licence will be valid up to a maximum of 10 years after you move to Switzerland ( if it was renewed immediately before you kept the UK). 
There is no obligation to update the address on a UK licence if you are resident outside the UK so the licence will only expire once the expiry date us reached.

			Same question as BM, which address did you use? This is clearly illegal. Even if you used a UK address, you can't legally have both a Swiss and a UK licence- believe me, we tried- as I had kept my car at our property in the UK and wanted to insure it- but couldn't.   
But yes, if we go back to UK, we can exchange our licences again as UK DVLA is holding our old ones. However, with OH being 70 early next year- what happens then, he we return to UK to live. Would he have to take his licence again? (he got his in 1964!).

			Thanks for all the replies.  I'm looking into aftermarket sunroofs now, the Mini Cooper style that slides up and out of the car to avoid losing headroom.  The trouble with looking for a feature like this is it limits so many other options.  I want 5L/100km, so it's probably going to need to be a manual gearbox diesel.  I want a smaller car so my wife can park it easily but with enough legroom in front and back for family trips.  So it looks like the sunroof is a pipe dream unless I just get it done later.  I hear they're pretty good.

			FYI I just wanted to post a few more details here:   
There is a new CO2 tax for cars less than 6 months old (where ""old"" means the date from the first registration).  Its huge.  On my M4 sportscar, its something like 24k CHF if I did it myself, or 7k CHF if I went through a dealer.   
I will also have to pay customs and VAT, because I have not owned the car for 6 months.  This ends up being roughly 12 percent of the value of the car.   
Shipping costs were something around 5k but this includes marine insurance for the full value of the car in USD.   
Conversion costs for the car, just to bring it up to ""legal"" standards in Switzerland were quoted at roughly 7k CHF by two garages (autociel and autolassung).   
So bringing this car over is roughly a 30k CHF proposition with CO2 tax, or a 23(ish)k CHF proposition without it.   
Either way, believe it or not, its still cheaper than buying the car new, in Switzerland... but not by much.   
Ultimately I have decided to ship the car a bit later and avoid the CO2 tax.     
I'll let you know how it goes.

			fyi, I went via the Loetschberg tunnel anyway and it was quite quick, except, as mentioned before, the slow & windy access roads, especially on the north side.   
Ironically, the wait time for train was much less at peak time (13 mins, Friday evening 1800) than at off-peak (28 mins, 0800 Tuesday). This is because at peak times, they run a service every 10 mins or so, while off-peak it is 30 mins apart.   
On an unrelated side note, the St.Niklaus-Jungen cable-car offered spectacular views down the Matterhorn valley in the late afternoon.

			A late thanks for all the replies - after many months it is finally done so I would like to post an update in case it helps anyone else. Here are the steps I went through to temporarily import the car for 2 years.   
1. One problem was that when we entered and registered with the Zoll we were not given a 13.20 form with Stammnummer. This I had to corect by going to Strassenverkehrsamt and they gave me an empty form and a new Stammnummer.   
2. Finding an insurance that will insure a foreign plates car temporarily - This was a difficult step. In the end ""Zurich Connect"" referred us to ""Zurich"" which does this and we had to meet up in person to do this.   
3. With the insurance I went back to SVA and we were able to get an appointment for MFK.   
4. After 1.5 months we went through the MFK, after passing it (on 2nd appointment because some things had to be done) we were given the new license plate (ZHxxxxZ as a temporary plate) and Swiss registration document on the spot and gave our old license plate back to SVA to send to NL.   
5. We had to send back to NL ourselves our old registration documents for them to unregister the car in NL so we don't have to pay road taxes there and cancelled NL insurance.

Yeah - 4,000 CHF for ONLY the compressor is crazy. We're trading the car in September for a new one (not a Nissan) and the new car dealer is only giving us 7,000 CHF for the car - would absolutely suck to have to pour 5k into it and then give it back.    
The parts arrived by DHL today so at least I have them in hand. I'm aware of the customs bill, but no matter how you look at it the numbers are still cheaper to do it this way, crazy shipping, customs and all.

			If you have photo copies or left them at home, the fines are only Fr 20 for the car paper and Fr 20 for the driving license.    
BUT, you then have to be able to identify yourself, and then enable the police may call their office and establish the facts.    
With no identity at all, you might be marched to the police station and someone will have to bring you the original documents.    
I never carry the original car papers, only the copy. But you should carry the originals on your person when driving.

			It's back to factory specs which are sometimes  good and sometimes not.    
 However I have never had lopsided wear.....    
My car for example the factory specs wear the inside of the tyres due to an increased camber, however it gives a sharper steering feel.     
My guy in UK rewrote the specs  and had results from about 150 cars so wear and handling is absolutely  perfect.       
He asks all sorts of questions type of driving,  single or multiple passengers etc.  He even goes as far as adding weights in the passenger foot well  to simulate.   
Any idiot can turn a nut or bolt until.the arrow  goes in the green  range but it's knowing  what else to adjust  when you can't get it in the green  so it does come in the green range.

			This is an old thread but recently I got a flyer in our letterbox from a recycling centre not far from our home and I noticed the price to recycle a car was very inexpensive. chf 50 if the registration was cancelled, chf 100 if it was not.     
Here is the link to their website.           
They are located in Etzgen, PLZ 5275. Kanton Aargau.

			Thanks so so much.    
Have told them to do one. Only problem is they left the summer tires here when they tried to have a go so they'll have to pick them up if they want them. That might be nice.  I love the fact that they couldn't possibly come and get the car the first time due to little kids etc but they raced here in 20mins over some rims.    
Argh I was only so bloody helpful to do this quick & they've wasted time I haven't got.    
Thanks again. Taking back to dealer next time. Lesson learnt!

			+2 to HappyCreature   
I'm not sure about the direct consequences if you failed the shortened driving test. But sooner or later you'll be relegated to getting your license the ordinary way (theory test, emergency aid course, driving under instructor supervision, and whatever else may be necessary these days), which will cost multiple thousand CHF (my impression is, 3000-5000 CHF is a reasonable range these days), and that doesn't even include the time it takes to get you there. So you probably want to invest more what's absolutely necessary in driving lessons.    
Personally, I'd also do as if I took a theory test, online courses and tests abound (make sure they use the official questions, e.g.  ). If that lets you avoid even one accident, it will pay for itself manyfold. And it will help avoid driving mistakes, not just while practicing.   
Additionally, you may want to ask the Strassenverkehrsamt if you can legally drive private cars somehow, for instance under supervision of a friend with an ordinary drivers license (that's how ""ordinary"" learners get most of their practice).

			There aren't many fixed nor mobile radars set up in Italy, usually one is quite safe - have been highwaying back and forth for the last 30 yrs with no problem, 4 to 5 times a year. 
However, I can confirm that once a fine IS issued, it makes its way slooooowly toward Switzerland - this is new since about 5 years, not sure what changed. One used to be able to park anywhere, and just rip apart the fines before going home   with no long term consequences, but now you get your fine home about 6 months later, nicely doubled for nominative research and the like.    
Moral of the story - watch out.

			So today I had to got to ZH for a dental appointment, and I normally just buy the day pass as I do other stuff. Today was an in and home job, so check the SBB app and worked out the train connections and had 3 that I could catch after the dentist, so the 2 hour individual ticket was plenty..... noooo   
1- Train 8 mins late, so missed the next train and had to wait, 
2 - Dentist running 15 mins late 
3 - My treatment took 45 mins not the 15 booked 
4 - Missed the trains at HB, so had to catch a later 1   
I didn't really think anything of it, until the ticket guy appeared and said ""your ticket expired 15 mins ago"".... arghhh. As best I could with a jaw full of anaesthetic I explained the situation, showed him my appointment card etc, and he stood there shaking his head, and told me the fine was CHF75 . He then went on to explain how much he hates dentist, hates he always has to wait, and really hates the bill... so patted me on the shoulder and said ""you have enough pain for 1 day"" wished me well and walked off.   
So, happy days and thanks to the understanding inspector on the 16.04 out of Zürich HB

			Unfortunately it seems our car (bought second hand a couple of years ago) is one of the ones affected by the known BMW N47 Motor Timing chain issue.   
My girlfriend received a call from the local BMW garage and had the issue explained to her. She was phoned as I ask too many questions and he thought it would be quicker speaking to her instead of me  As she asked no questions on the phone i got her to get an email for me to investigate a little.   
Having read things such as the 2 links below i have informed myself on the issue and the fact that it is really a lot a work. The Timing Chain needs replacing on our BMW motor - this is done for free by BMW confirmed in writing in the email we received. They also recommend ""Zylinderkopf Planschleifen und Reinigen @ 900chf"" - i am guessing as a non car man that this is a general workover and clean of the cylinders.         
We have decided to undertake the extra work (let us know if you disagree) 
I ask my questions here on ef instead of the BMW forum as I want to ask the following (and I can't offer anything back to help others on BMW forums!): 
(1)We can presumably expected good service from a Swiss BMW garage and therefore we should not be overly concerned with issues in the future with them taking the motor out of the car etc correct? 
(2) Should we expect the additional cylinder work to also be covered at all by BMW (my understanding is that it is partly caused by the timing chain issue - or is it totally separate and it gets done once in a while and is worth doing down as the motor is already out of the car) - is it worth negotiating to try and get the extra stuff done for free?

For a clean, antiseptic fragrance, you could put a toilet freshener in the glove compartment. This is also useful for disguising the smell of old, damp carpets resulting, say, from failing window or door seals.

			My wife is looking for a new bike at present and is open minded to her next choice up.   
I have been to BMW and Harley so far things to note would be 400chf for registration so far across board.   
When asking for Euro reduction the % varied. When the bike arrives new in the box some work is required to finish as you know, well Harley pass on a cool 375chf to do this work - unbelievable to me.   
Finally expressing my unhappiness to this another 2% came off the price so answers the question of negotiation.   
When trying the demo bike becareful for what is standard and what is not I was surprised what I missed trying to take it all in. Both dealers got me on this. I said the BMW was a very smooth ride afterwards. I then found out it had electronic suspension fitted as an extra and setting was on soft.   
Was loving the sound of the Harley but didnt realise the exhausts were not standard and the ones fitted were a cool 1500chf extra.   
Hope this may help.

			Ace1,   
Thanks, I just looked through some sites and realized that the best option is the below:   
The other option is the one-month Half Fare card for CHF 110. It works in exactly the same way as the longer-lasting cards but doesn't involve application forms or passport photos. That makes it perfect for guests visiting from abroad (my sister bought one on her last trip here), or if you just want a stay-cation exploring Switzerland. You can buy one at most railway stations and start using it straight away. Even better for families is that buying the one-month card entitles you to the free Family Card, meaning that children aged 615 travel everywhere for free if accompanied by at least one parent.

			I always go through Germany because of the lack of speed limits and the whole toll business - money etc. If you time it right to avoid the rush hour round Brussels it can go pretty quickly even though it is longer in distance. Also if you get tired you can stop and have a couple of hours sleep at German service stations more safely than in France.

			Hello all,   
I recently moved to Morges and I am looking for an  English or Spanish speaking driving instructor. I would like to take  some lessons before doing the practical test to convert my driving  license (from Costa Rica) to a Swiss one.    
I searched using the  ,  but couldn't find an English speaking instructor in Morges. I guess I  will have to try in Lausanne (I tried contacting the instructor  mentioned in   but no answer so far).   
Also, is there a driving manual or similar were I can read about the traffic rules in Switzerland?   
Any advice will be highly welcomed. Thanks in advance.

			Let's be reasonable here, I haven't even seen my car for a good 5-6 days. If someone is waiting for me there, they've been waiting for long, that's for sure.   
People calling the police because they touched happens all the time in the Zurich ring road, and is causing unmeasurable pain to the rest of the people trying to get to work/home. I've seen it too many times, no big damage, cars easily driveable somewhere safe, and people just stand there doing nothing other than waiting for the cops to do nothing else than issue fines because why the hell not?   
And if someone hits a parked car in a busy narrow road, should the rest of the neighbourhood just wait for the cops to show for whatever reason? Call the insurance, tell them you had a fender bender and give them the license plate. They should be able to at least reach the other insurer and notify them, so the owner can then by notified in turn.   
All official and documented/logged, all done, no reason to waste any more time.

			As usual, no one can give a logical answer, I asked the same question some time ago and got the same answers. Yet another totally illogical Swiss way of making money. You use one number plate on 2 vehicles and stick the vignette on the number plate, unless you have perfected a way of driving 2 vehicles at once. No you cannot do that because the authorities loose money that way. Thank goodness I now live most of the year in Aus where most rules seem logical.

			I have a U-Abo card since March. I have always been buying my monthly ticket from the ticketing machine. However, for July, I received a bunch of orange slips for the rest of the year's payment. My question is: can I ignore the orange slips and just keep buying from the machine? I find it more convenient. If I understood it correctly, even if I pay using the orange slip online, I still have to have my receipt stamped. Therefore, I need to visit the TNW office to get this (or pay the orange slip at the post office).   
Any advice? I will be flying out of the country today and when I come back it's already July and I want to be able to use my U-abo ticket to travel back home from the airport.    
Thanks.

			Anyone know if I can buy half-price cards for my parents? They live in the UK, but come and visit us and gad about Switzerland several times a year, and it would really keep their holiday travel costs down.   
I recall when I got my first one, I went to the station with my passport, a photo and my letter of attestation (still waiting for the permit at that points); like others have said, I got a paper one and the real card turned up a few days later.   
My parents are coming over in January so we can easily toddle along to a station with their passports, buy the cards and have them posted to my address ready for their next visit, but obviously they don't have Swiss permits or anything with a Swiss address themselves.   
Has anyone managed to do this? Or does Rule 3.7b Subsection 34 state that only Swiss residents can have these?

its also an excellent way for bmw to keep your car in there dealer network, most people take there car elsewhere for servicing etc once the warantee runs out, which is just when those expensive parts main dealers love to overcharge for start to wear out. So yes the service is 'free' but any repairs arn't and that will be main dealer repair prices and main dealer hourly rates.   
As for fluids, Smart charged us over £50 per litre for mobil 1 at its service, not a bad mark up when you can get it at halfords for about £10 a litre.

			Yes you can pop in any garage and ask about the test. Anything far north of CHF 60 is just a rip off.   
Oh, I see the initial document is another ~CHF 40.       
At this place  
It is CHF 50 for the test plus CHF 40 for the initial document (if you have an OBD then they can do all on place).   
Edit: Just bring all the documents, better have to many then one left at home. Including car manuals, CoC, customs forms, and all Spanish registration documents.

Anyway, does anybody here ""highly"" recommend a Volvo garage?  My dealer in Winterthur is more on the neutral side, I don't dislike them but don't like them enough either to recommend.     
I'm also open for suggestion of Volvo indys when my car gets out of warranty.

Be careful with megs pads also as they changed the backing pad size so the edges rip apart at higher speeds or after some use...

			Although they have cunningly disguised it in their press release ( ), from 23rd June Swiss will be introducing separate fees for baggage within their cheapest fares, thus adopting the same system as Easyjet, Ryanair et al.     
Given how this works everywhere else, if you're travelling with baggage get your fare booked before 23 June.     
""The next major step will follow on 23 June (and at a later date for the further airlines of the Lufthansa Group) through the adoption of a new modular and flexible fare concept for travel within Europe, with tailored fare packages and further add-on services. The new concept with its new Light, Classic and Flex Economy Class fares enables customers to choose precisely the fare package that meets their specific travel needs and, in doing so, pay only for the services that they actually require.""

			We were told that they have a preference for 'oriental' cars so the Japanese and Korean ones are often attacked, something to do with the composition of the rubber used in the tubing.   
Spiky mats under the engine when the car is parked and those smelly magic tree air fresheners act as a pretty good deterrent we've found although fortunately we've not had a problem with them here.

Water collects in closed profiles *inside* bodywork elements. The rust that you see outside is often already much deeper than you could possibly expect. A quick patch is barely a cosmetic fix which will last for some months, a year if you are lucky. A proper fix is much more throughout and not just a 50 CHF paint job.

			Just a headsup, if you do import it make sure you buy a set of oem wheels in the USA (for winter tires) and tires, and lots of spares etc etc and fill the car up with them before you ship it, parts, even normal service parts, and many mutiple times more expensive here, eg just paid 32chf for an oil filter here that costs about 5chf in the UK.

			The privately imported BMW prices are for sure cheaper than the swiss dealers based cars. Because you will not get 10 years/100.000km free of service (laborship). I would not bring the car to a BMW official delaer for a service, they would charge as high as possible.

Taking the car to a workshop in Poland or Germany might be a reasonable option if the chassis is still true and you have contacts there.

			look at the economics of it. If it adds up do it. I did and do not regret it. 
If you import a car bring a European car. Stay away from US (unless sold here) or Japanese/Korean. 
Shipping has gotten much cheaper..RO/RO is the cheapest. I brought my bimmer from Chicago. 
Only negative: 
 radio frequency is still US based so I do not pick up all stations here in Europe(Friendly Kiwi has promised to help me out with this...months ago )   
Dollar is going downhill so it will become even more attractive to bring upper class rides from US. It is worth it and not complicated at all.

			Hello everyone,   
I'm writing here hoping that someone else had a similar issue and was able to solve it somehow.   
I've just bought a car from a german official dealer near Munich. They confirmed that I can get the tax (19%) back after the import into Switzerland.   
All good with the import on the Swiss side, I paid the Swiss taxes (4% + 8%) and then returned the import papers to the dealer but the dealer is refusing to return the German tax because of a missing stamp on a specific paper.   
They asked me to a also get a stamp on a paper called ""Gelagensnachweiß"" (specific dealer paper). But, Swiss customs refused to stamp this paper by keep telling that that paper is not needed and they will not stamp it, and the clearance documents of the import should be fine for the dealer.   
Did anyone experienced something similar? Is that ""Gelagensnachweiß"" a must for the tax return process, or is the dealer wrong and just doesn't want to return it? 
What can I do in this situation?     
Thanks in advance for your answers!

If it were down to the Schiffahrtskontrolle, they'd recognise licences perfectly willingly, they know exactly what a Yachtmaster ticket entails - and it's a far higher level than the Hochseeschein. But the powers-that-be dictate these things. I gather the reason for the tightening up of mutual recognition was down to that weasel word ""mutual"". The Swiss decided they weren't going to recognise tickets from nations that didn't recognise their tickets in return.   
FWIW whilst the regulations regarding the storm lights haven't changed (slow = start making your way home, fast = get off the water now, do not pass go, do not collect £200), the criteria for their use changed last year. Under the old system they used to be switched on when a storm was expected within the next 2-3 hours (or thereabouts) (slow) or within the next hour-ish (fast). As of spring 2014 that has now changed to a more logical slow = winds of 25-33 kt expected, fast = winds of over 33 kt expected. It seems to have led to a much more accurate reflection of what's going to happen, making the system more reliable. Interestingly, although only two speeds of flash are advertised (slow = 40/min, fast = 90/min), going my observations there is in fact a third speed that seems to be at 120/min. Whenever I've seen that, it's usually really meant it.

Nobody is forced to accept credit cards... it is a choice.   
I am not sure how you thought credit cards work but simply put: Every shop or cafe pays Amex/Visa/Mastercard for every single transaction. Usually in the lower one digit percentage between 3-5% of the total.    
Amex is notorious for being the most expensive one. I am an avid user of their card as it gives me the best benefits... at the costs of the merchants. Merchants are not allowed to charge extra for the CC usage, otherwise it would be nice and transparent. So here you go: a company that accepts credit cards of course calculates the average fees when they come up with their prices. If anyone in this system is penalized is it not the taxi drivers, but the people who pay cash and unknowingly cover for the fees of the credit card users...

(Big dealer will tend to pre-offer your PX to local used car dealers before they offer you a price.)   
HOWEVER I'd be wary of buying anything from them - a dealer prepped car commands a chunky premium - so why aren't the dealer doing the work? And if you find something do you ""know"" how much it will cost to get repaired relatively quickly.   
Spending 500chf on a disposable car at auction is one thing - spending 15k on a car that retails at 25k - but may well cost 8-9k to get right is another.

			I've probably hired cars 80-100 times during my time here. Registration has probably been 60% VD, 40% AI (at one time, they all seemed to be VD, recently more seem to be AI - taxes, eh?).    
I have to say, it's never made any difference at border control.   
I (and every other hire car I've seen) always get stopped at the border for a full search and interrogation (oddly, strip searches are less likely with a VD car).   
My solution is to temporarily buy a car with SZ plates, because no tourist has ever visited Schwiez, and it also confuses the guards, because they assume it stands for ""Schweitzer""; they're selected for their loyalty to SVP, rather than any signs of intelligence.   
You can sell the car afterward on Englishforum for a tidy profit (rule of thumb is ""Autoscout plus 30%"").

			I bought my wife a car over the border in Germany. The dealership in Waldshut saw to all the formality, save the vignette. We ordered it, put down the deposit, waited until it arrived, paid the rest, drove over to get it, where it already had the Swiss plate and vehicle ID card, and drove back over. Simple as that.    
Net - saved about 5kCHF on a 40kCHF car. This was in the 1 EUR = 1.2 CHF era, though.

			OK so if i read this right, as long as you have lived in Switzerland for 12 months, plus owned the car for at least 6 months, when you move your residence to France no tax is payable so long as you list the car on the customs declaration within 4 months of entry and keep the car for at least 12 months, right?   
And you need to take a Certificate of Conformity (CofC) and get a Control Technique done to get it registered within 12 months of moving to France.    
Can anyone who has actually done this let me know did i miss anything important?    
Any further advice?

			It is how you say above:   
1. Get insurance. 
2. Go to STVA and get license plates. 
3. Ride.     
For step 2 you need the cancelled grey card from the previous owner. At the STVA you complete the required form and they will give you a new grey card + plate.   
Have fun

Whether you can exchange the licence directly, need to to a control test or take lessons here really depends on what licence you have and how long you've had it for.

			Hi EF members 
I start to use the app to buy ticket and found that It could sell wrong ticket. Assume that there is 4 zones A - B - C - D next to each other. If I need to go from A to C, I need to buy a 3 zone ticket, that is normal. However when using the CFF app, it may suggest me to go A->B->C or A->D->C . If I want to go with the later option, I need a 4 zone ticket however the app will still sell me the 3 zone ticket without warning. I came on to the bus and the driver said I can not go to D ! Imagine if I got in the train I could have received a fine for this !

			Hi, 
I don´t know if this may be a useful tip, or whether it applies to you as you will probably be in transit, but last time at Heathrow at the security checks I was only allowed to take one piece of hand luggage through the security - it was a bit ridiculous really as I had my handbag and a plastic bag with some magazines inside but the ""advisors"" insisted I could only take one bag through...and had to find a way to stuff everything in one bag.

			And maximum 45 degree angle tilted upward.   
The reflector is usually built into the tail light, and has nothing to do with the plate.    
On the bikes I have with no integral reflector, I attach it to the plate holder.   
One has a led plate light, which you will certainly need if the plate is not near the tail light.   
Why can't you mount the plate below the light at an angle?

			For as long the contract is valid, whenever the vehicle (car or bike) has plates, you will have that insurance.   
You can cancel only at the end of the contract with 3 or 4 month notice (don't remember), or after a claim (I think).   
The contract is also cancelled when you take your registration grey card to the STVA for cancellation so someone else can register the vehicle on their name.   
Best choice is to transfer the vehicle to friend/wife/someone, and then insure it with you as the main driver. Who owns, who is the insurance policy holder and registered person on the grey card, and who drives the vehicle/bike, can be 3 different people respectively.   
If you declare to the insurance company who is the main driver then you are 100% legally covered   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	2 Motorcycle insurance change/cancelation.	juisjuis	Posts: 13

Strangely, in the canton of Zurich, a day-ticket for a bicycle within the ZVV (cantonal tarif network) can be more expensive than that for the SBB (national train network). 
The latter costs Fr. 12 for the bike, if the passenger has a Half-Price-Ticket or a GA (year card).  Fortunately, the ZVV slot machine even tells me so!

			Thought I had the same problem with after market rims. Porsche's on-board computer monitoring goes up to 20"". I have 21"" installed and when I went to my local Strassenverkehrsamt for the check-up. Boy did they take it through rigorous testing. They were measuring anything and everything that is measurable around the rims i.e. size of nuts and bolts, size of holes etc. Eventually I was given the all clear and I drove out of there like a bat out of hell as soon as I got my papers. Didn't want to give them a moment to reconsider. I now use Pirelli or Michelin depending on what is readily available at good prices.

			There is a reason why they are stereotypes. take a joke , you'll get by much easier.... .    
And if the car is the same price in CH after import well then it is not that big of a loss (Do keep in mind an import goes for less when selling..... .)    
So keep the plates Italian for a year and then import it. The value will have drastically gone down and so will the cost to import it. And you get to drive a year cheaply with Italian roadtax and insurance. So in the end you will save a bit here and there.

			Hi everybody,    
Time for some slight rust removal and applying of wax/oil protection on the underside of the car. I've been looking around at where to do a ""hohlraumbehandlung"" and a ""unterbodenbehandlung"" in Zurich but it seems like there are no specialized garages for this?    
I found   but they haven't responded to my email I sent two weeks ago and no one picks up the phone. I found another on the other side of the border but it's quite a stretch as it is past Stuttgart..    
Does anyone have recommendation in the Zurich/Winterthur larger area for this? Would be highly appreciated.   "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Dec 2011	Groaned at 26 Times in 18 Posts	Rust protection for car in ZH?	xandeo	Posts: 272

			My advice also for the buses in Lausanne: download the app for your telephone   . You can buy your tickets directly with an sms, there are options for the normal ticket 1 hour, 1/2 price with your 1/2 price card, daily ticket, etc.    
I don't use the galaxy cards anymore, every time I buy one, it seems like the machine always steals a franc or two...So I've been using cash or the app with ticket by sms.  If you're taking the bus daily, better to get the montly/yearly pass.   
And you can't buy tickets on the bus (or metro), you need to have your pass, or buy a ticket from a machine or sms.

1290	30.05.2012, 10:43	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Neuchatel	"    Most car speedometers read about 5% high - a deliberate setting from the manufacturer. Different tyre & wheel combinations can change the true speed from the reported speed so they build in some leeway. The police then apply a margin of error on the reading they take - usually 2 to 3km per hour upto 100 kph and then 3% above that (It's a few months since my last bill so I don't remember exactly). If you were doing an indicated 70 then your real speed would have been about 66 to 67 and they'd then knock 2 or 3 kph off for their margin for error - so you should just get lucky and scrape in at about 15 kph over the limit.   
Good luck.

			Yes, like two days when you have Form 15.25. Or you may get Form 15.30 which gives you a longer time if you meet certain conditions.   
Both forms must be acquired at the very first border crossing, otherwise you will do a tax and/or duty violation.  If caught you will be liable for any tax and duty due PLUS up to 5 times the tax and duty as penalty.    
Art. 118 Swiss Customs Law.     
Considering tax for a car is 4% + 8% = 12.32%, you may have to pay up to a total of 73.92% of the cars value (and more if duty is due)

Can you recomment one in the Zurich area that does this well based on your experience?   
I have asked my local dealership for a quote too. They will do it well, but will be the most expensive option.     
Thanks,   
Andy

			Holiday. Well, we are expecting it to be traffic that's why we're leaving that early. We're not taking the train because it's more expensive.  
I've read about that ZTL thing. We are going to be parked in a hotel 20 minutes away from the center and take the public transport to go around the city. Hopefully it wouldn't be too traffic!    
We will try to avoid Milan and probably take the Turin route. Thanks!

			Hi there,   
Is your Dodge registered under a type-approval or as a non-type-approval vehicle?   
See vehicles grey card item 24.  Look into it and please state the number/letter.   
Then we can plan the next steps.

Can sometimes be sorted just by spraying   in through the air inlet (having disconnected filter).      Yes, plugs should be cleaned too, but while replacing the fuel won't do any harm and may help flush out any residue in the tank or fuel filter, the fuel itself should be fine. The idea that it can ""go off"" is a myth, albeit one frequently believed and repeated.    
Largely it's based on the idea that some of the petrol components are more volatile than others and will evaporate sooner, leaving a less easily combustible mixture, but in fact the volatility variance is very little, so it would take years in an unsealed container for the mixture to change significantly. What can and does happen is that evaporation will cause deposits to build up in the fuel lines, carbs, etc. so flushing the who;e system out often makes it appear like the fuel was itself the problem.

			If you want to sell a car privately and do so quickly - go to autoscout, search for similar cars, price yours 500chf lower and wait for the phone to ring.   
Whatever you do don't overprice it from the start - be realistic - accept that every CHF above 5,000 is a win - and taking 6,000chf after 1 week is likely to be better than taking 6,000chf after 3 months.

			Hello everybody,   
I recently went to Germany to buy clothes and stamped my receipts in the German border, Singen, and gave those receipts to global blue refund counter as soon as I arrivedto Zurich HBF.   
However I received a registered letter form the customs in Schaffhausen saying that they received a copy of the receipts from the customs in Singen. They demand that I submit my import declaration from (what is this?) with the receipts and the payment of the taxes of 8% or, if not, they might initiate criminal proceedings.    
I did not know about this. I have no problem with paying the 8% tax but I do not have the receipts anymore, and I do not know where or how to pay.    
Shall I go to the customs in Schaffhausen and talk to the officer or what would be the best solution?   
Thanks in advance!

			I recommend to go via Munich. You will have autobahn almost all the way to Budapest.    
My 2 cents worth of experience:   Your driving time could be anything between 8 -12 hours. There are too many factors over 1'000 kms, but I normally do it in 9 hours. Strangely I find that driving back is always faster...

			you can drive everywhere in Europe with swiss licence 
you don't need to speak or write any of the swiss languages to take the written test. the test can also be taken in English. 
you need patience to ignore a lot of stupid posts in EF. for most people the primary purpose of posting is time passing and not providing information. but stick around and you will get answers...but that's hard work.

			A great resource on all things train-travel related, with all the dos and donts. I've found it to be of immeasurable value.       
For international timtebale connections I prefer the DB site. It's slightly better at finding trains than the SBB site. For bookings I tend to go the national sites of the relevant railways as there are often special deals and things that SBB don't know about. For example in Spain if you buy a return ticket it will cost less than two singles. Even if you buy a single and later buy the return leg, just showing the first leg will get you the discount on the second so that the tozal price will be that of a return. SBB don't seem to know anything about that and will sell you two unconnected singles even when you ask for a return.

In fact, there's no discount in the monthly/yearly passes for having a Halb-tax.   
Sharing the number just means that if you get a new card you don't need to give them your details and picture all over again - they already have them. I had a yearly pass long before I got a halb-tax, and when I bought a halb-tax they just took the number to get the picture and personal details.

Also, to most people the refinement will be perfectly adequate, no worse than a 5 year old volume car.  Of course a 3 year old X3 is a nicer car, but will have done over 100k km and has the potential to throw some big bills at you while the Dacia will still be under warranty.

			If the OP refers to WAB1 and WAB2, AFAIK, these courses can be taken up to 3 years from when your probationary license was issued.  If you look at your probationary license, there is written there the ""end date"" off this license, so you must complete both WAB course before this date.

			Hi,   
Not sure about prices for the boats and all but as for how it works:   
you would need one type of card for the boats. The company is CGN. I'm not familiar with the system.   
in Lausanne, you can get a Mobilis card for Lausanne (2 zones, 11 and 12) which allows you to take buses, metro and train between Lausanne and Renens (so all ways of getting to EPFL) (   )   
Hope that helps!

			yes it's treated like a permament license, at least in italy, but there they don't have a probationary license. anyway what matters is what is on the license, and it was harmonized by the council of europe, probationary license does not exist that's just internal rules. 
be careful that in some countries there are limitations to newly licensed, like 0 alcohol, power limitation (first year in italy for example).

			Hello Ladies and Gentelmen,   
I'm learningn to drive and I thought it could be helpful to give a bit of info about the process.   
-First I did the Nothelfer Kurs, in english in sanarena, you only have to assist the two days and they will give to you the certificate. 
-Then the eye test (I just search the closest place near my home and asked if it was valid for the driving license) 
-Then I bought the fuhrerschein cd and studied the content for about 3 months (no rush) when I saw that I was doing 97% questions correct I did the test (in english). 
	You can choose the language of the test when you start the test, but the reservation process for the date and the papers are the same if you are doing it in english german or another language. 
-Less than a week later I received my temporary student driving license and started practising.   
The first hours I practised at a company's parking lot (I don't know if it's allowed because I dont work for that company but I went always after 7p.m. an it was almost always empty) The coordinates of the parking lot are: 47.339889, 8.517879 (you can just search them in google maps) 
When I could break, use the gear and felt a bit more confident I went to a place near my work (47.359188, 7.970602) there you have long roads without interceptions To be more specific Industriestrasse -> Güterstrasse -> Aarefelstrasse (you can do a circle with this tree streets) 
Now I'm practising again in zurich in Birmensdorf (not a lot of traffic) 
Oh and by the way, I'm practising with my husband, when he considers I'm driving perfectly, I'll do the verkehrskundekurs and then a couple of hours with a professional just to be sure and then the test.       
Lets see how it goes (sorry for the bad english)

			In the past, even recent- asking for discounts for cars and bartering was just not the done thing. But with the recent hike in CHF- car dealers are saying that they just have to accept to sell for 15 to 20% less- and that people are indeed haggling at the mo.

			You can have the red blinkers these days. As a matter of fact many of the requirements seem to have dropped.... . Im bringing my old tahoe over here(1999) shipped for free   and I have to make NO modifications (foglight, orange blinkers etc)   
fyi I am importing to Belgium and driving it here on USA plates till I am required to import. also keep in mind that there is a HUGE delay for shipping out opf california. I have been waiting 3.5 months now....all our belongings are in said truck also which is really annoying

			This is the Zurich fare zone system -  
This gives you a good idea of all the tickets available -    
If you are free and just want to use the ticket for roaming around Zurich and nearby areas, get the 9 o'clock one. Only requirement, you can only use it after 9 am.    
If you need to go out of the zones for which you have the ticket, you can buy extensions from every machine. The machines give info in a lot of languages.   
Cycling is quite possible as the city is small. you just need a map.    
Welcome to Switzerland. I hope you have a nice time.

			It depends which boat you catch. Some of them go direct, others make a few stops but all on the Thalwil side of the lake so your ticket is still OK, and others zigzag back and forth to the Küsnacht side which would mean you'd need an extra ticket for that zone.   
Best way to find out is to check the  . Enter Zürich Bürkliplatz and Thalwil ZSG, then go to ""advanced search"" and select only boats as your means of travel... this weeds out all those pesky tram-and-rail options.   
Now, for whichever boat you're considering, click ""Show intermediate stops"". Your ticket needs to cover all the zones where those stops are located.       
FWIW Zürich is actually the   end of the lake (the Limmat flows out, not in). The term ""upper lake"" or ""Obersee"" does exist, but it refers to the bit at the other end, past Rapperswil and Pfäffikon.

If the ABS is fried - and the dealer is talking big money to repair - this is really the only likely cause. Hydraulics or sensors aren't expensive to replace

			Unless its an EU D permit its not likely you can do a straight swap..  
worldwide the exchange of driver lisc. are for personal vehicles CAR/BIKE

is more strict..      
Good Luck but I doubt it..

			Hi, 
Need some more advise.   
what is the easiest way to find the whole of wine yard route starting at Thann and ending at Marleinheim on the navigation.   
the plan is to start at Thann, cover half the route, then a stopover in Colmar overnight and then continue to Marlenheim the next day.   
i can put these destinations in the navigation but i have to be sure that it is taking me through the wine route and not in any other route still going to the destination.   
Thanks in advance 
Happycreature

			Hi guys, I was wondering about something. I have a B permit as an ETH student, but now I got offered a 6mo contract in a company and with that I guess I'm going to be offered a new L permit since the student permit allows me to work for 40% or 100% for an internship.     
Given that I do get an L then, I guess I will have to communicate that change to my car insurance company. I also guess that the L is going to be up until contract expiration (i.e. end of August), and since until then my thesis will definitely not be done, I will probably get a new student B permit. So the L permit is just a temporary patch.     
If they do have to recalculate my premiums given that the L permit is a short-term permit compared to a B, I guess that I could also break the contract early citing change of premiums? Has anyone been in a similar situation?   
Thanks in advance      
PS EU citizen

			Just wanted to update this thread in case someone would be in a similar situation.   
I got the eye test sorted out for 20CHF, filled out the form, got my picture taken at one of those photobooths for 8CHF, a week later and after the official expiry of my Residence permit B (02.03.2015), I went to Office des Autos in Carouge. I got my swiss driver's license card(with no expiry) in less than 10 minutes after paying 150CHF. They also said that they will send my FIN license back to Finland so now I only have the swiss one.   
So from a FIN to CH license in 10 less than 10 minutes. No more waiting for a week.   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Jul 2013	Groaned at 7 Times in 6 Posts	Non-EU with EU Driver's License Conversion	jesuisuntouriste	Posts: 240

1378	09.06.2010, 18:49	Junior Member	Thanked 18 Times in 10 Posts	Location: zurich	"    You will struggle to find a good car there - and if you do you'll have to do all the paperwork/running around/registration/MFK yourself. Unless you are absolutely sure you are getting a bargain - I would steer clear.   
I see the Swiss market as:      - popular - bought on lease from main dealers. Big Swiss companies will have a fleet policy that private individuals can use to get a discount.     - typically 4 years old and younger. Ex-lease. Part exchanged for another car at the dealership. Usually found at main dealers.      - pile em high - sell em cheap places. (Auto Discount Uster) - good deals of new or newish cars - average specification - bugger all service - and you are best advised going with cash.      - traditional car dealer. Cars around 4-10 years old. Some very good - some tired. Good examples near Zurich are F+G and Gfenn - both in Dubendorf. Service can be good or poor depending on who you speak to. Cars should come with a fresh MFK.      - more often used for exporting cars - with odd bargain. Avoid unless you absolutely know what you are looking for     - A lot of mechanics will also sell a few cars. They are often in very good mechanical condition (because the mechanic has done the work). If not they'll advise on the costs.    
And finally notes on what to buy. 
High mileage immaculate condition cars aren't liked in Switzerland. If you buy one, no matter how good it is, you'll struggle to sell for a good price. I got stung on this when my wife insisted I sell a car - I didn't want to - but she thought she knew best - as it transpired - she didn't.   
Cars in colour combinations you might like - the market won't like!

He also promised to send assessment by e-mail (we mailed in advance), and also promised to do it ASAP when we actually brought the car and never did too. Because of this we brought too little money, and as the place is located in the middle of nowhere, we had a lot of trouble finding ATM. He also suggests to rent a car from him to go home, and it wasn't that cheap (well, we haven't done proper research on how much train tickets would cost), but that's how it is. Be careful: the closest customs doesn't have clear schedule of working, so we couldn't report taxes immediately, and as we did some food shopping, that was not the best surprise.

			Yep... I've fallen for this a few times in France just short of the Allschwil border.  In retrospect it was daft to stop.. they're not in 'uniforms' and the French police would never stand 'by the side of the lane/road'. I've seen them when they do want to check cars and they stand, en masse, at the actual border in the middle of the road. Plus.. of course.. the beggars (and that's what they are) are in France but flagging down cars going into Switzerland.. I'm sure the police can check 'exiting' cars.. but I've only ever seen the police check 'entering' cars... i.e. on the other side of the road !

Insurance is about 800/yr.      plus 4x30 for tire changes plus 100 for a new tire that I popped (don't ask). I have not yet paid to have my parking light changed after the wires were eaten by one of those creatures. They say it will cost about 40F. Granted this is a local no name garage, not the dealer.    
So, including insurance I pay around 1200 a year plus about 3000 in petrol and let's say about 200 in fines. I won't get into parking costs as that's difficult to estimate. I don't pay for parking at home.

			Hi,    
I'd like to recommend the garage where we bought our used car and went for tiny repairs.   
We bought a car from Solero Automobile in Fehraltorf last April and felt the guy was very correct (Mr Solero himself, the son, we didn't speak much to the father) and he gave us a discount when we just asked if he could make an effort (we probably could've asked for more but didn't). And he delivered the car to our home.   
Today, I go to him to change the lightbulbs of the lights in front, and check out some noise in the front and remove the hanger thing for caravans at the back. All in all about 45min work, and 50chf. I think that's a fair price.   
He's friendly and speaks alright english and doesn't try to sell you stuff you don't need.

			No the first link is the automobile tax, you pay that for having your car in circulation. 
The sticker is for the autobahn/autostrade, you can buy it in any shop or at border control and it's only 40 CHF, this is not mandatory if you don't use those roads.

			1. problem   
there is no link to the european conformity number which starts with an e and that is the main source for them to make sense of it. Your document is referring to a conformity number which is not attached.    
Best thing to do is visit the centre de expertise and ask them. Thats what I have done every time I had an import. Even if you think it is okay it is better to have their confirmation before you buy the car. You may also be able to register it without the CoC but with it is a lot easier.

here are some details: 
2005 CBF 600N (naked) with ABS, 43000 km 
inc. windshield, handlebar heater, sw-motech crashbars   
This was my first bike. Bought it from the Honda dealer last April.  Very easy to ride, very forgiving.  A great commuting bike but not for fun. I am thinking to move to Honda Hornet 600.   
I can offer it now for 2500 euro. Actually I would like to wait for a season.   
P.S. I am asking in euros because I am thinking to buy Hornet from Italy.

			We must have been frightfully lucky. We checked in at around 07:00 am for a nine o'clock flight - I suddenly remembered that we were flying on a Saturday in the ski season, and that even all things being equal, the airport was likely to be busy. I don't normally turn up that early. 
In any case all was fine for us, we even pushed back a few minutes early and I only discovered about the mess on arrival.

			Hello Anushka,      Normally this would cost around 2500 - 3000 CHF in Lausanne with all charges (medical courses, books, learning with instructor, etc). I went through this with my wife recently and most of the driving instructors in Lausanne charge you around 100 CHF per academical hour (50 min). They would recomend around 20 to 40 hours of practicing.   
Of course, you can try to do this with your boyfriend of husband, but the practical exams are quite strict in canton VD and I doubt that driving with non professional instructor will make you pass. It will be helpful for sure, but the devil is in details, so ... Some people seem to pass just with 6 - 8 hours of practicing, however as they say ""hope for the best, plan for the worst"". You need to plan the worst case scenario. That means that once you started the process you will wish to finish it since this is costly. In that sense it is better to plan ahead and make sure you will have enough money to continue learning.

			Hello all,   
Next March I'm moving from Adliswil to Zurich (Binz). I have a car and a permit for parking in a blue zone park place day and night (for this I pay around 400CHF/year). 
My questions are:   
1 - Where should I go to switch the blue zone to Zurich?    
2 - Is the price the same as in Adliswil or does it vary?   
3 - As I am moving only in March, is it possible to switch by then?    
4- Here I pay always two bills the Nachtparkbewilligung and Parkkarte   
thank you very much

			in UK now most autofactors only supply spares based on the registration number or VIN number of the car which allows their systems to make sure that they are a precise match to the car version. it is common. Just send them the VIN number off the car registration plate, many cars now even have it on a clear pannel you can see from the outside of the car through the windscreen to allow the police to check if the number plates have been stolen

1424	08.02.2015, 14:56	Junior Member	Thanked 73 Times in 36 Posts	Location: Valais	"    I brought the issue up not by way of complaint but because it caught a few people by surprise and being forewarned is good. Only some European countries require renewal (and/or testing) of senior drivers.    
This is not the only anomaly that has caught me out: I had a UK-reg car in Switzerland stored in my closed garage. There is an EU law that states a car not taxed (or equivalent) in its home EU Member State can not be driven in any other. It could be driven (under specific conditions, including non-residence) in Switzerland but not in France. It could be driven from Dover to London (or anywhere in the UK) if there was a pre-scheduled MOT. How to get it to Dover other than (1) towing, (2) freight on the back of a lorry, (3) dealer plates (not possible in the UK as transport plates can only be placed on a car owned by the dealer: this makes little sense to me but it's what DLVA told me, perhaps incorrectly; BBC Radio 4 had a programme on transporters (""trade plate"" drivers):   ).    
(In the end we junked the car. Possible in Switzerland (we gave it to a dealer), but not in France: I wrecked a UK car once (tire blowout) and it had to be towed back to the UK for junking. So my insurer said; and surprisingly they were nice to me when they discovered it was diplomatic and not taxed or duty-paid anywhere. But that was years ago.)     
Returning to the over-70s medical: I linked to the Génération article (on line for 15 days from the posting) because it has new information. And BTW the medical can be taken 2 months before, or with permission 1 month after, the 70th birthday. So what if one is on a long holiday in Canada? (Fortunately I have a Québec licence too. But not everybody does.)   
Again: this is not a complaint. As forum posts are searchable forever on Google and other search engines, it's intended for anyone who cares to know. Usually I link to legal references but European Law (search for ""Driving Licence Directive"" and ""Directives and regulations - motor vehicles"") and Swiss law on vehicles and licensing are easy enough to find.   
The fact is that people get away with a lot of stuff. The Swiss cantons will send a letter to the last known address of driver licence holders approaching age 70. There is a penalty for failure to submit to a medical test or turn in one's licence. In the EU a person living in another Member State is not obliged to exchange his or her licence, or even notify of a change in address to another country, until age 70. At that point the UK (and perhaps other countries) require a foreign EU licence to be exchanged and the driver's health self-certified. No penalty for not -- unless you get caught driving. And with the abolition of tax discs and CCTVs (including portables) everywhere, and the collating of vehicle and driver information (Chris Huhne, pay attention) there is a high risk of getting caught, eventually.   
A significant percentage of drivers whose licences are suspended or cancelled drive anyway. More's the pity: in some countries (USA) that invalidates their insurance. In other countries the insurer (or the country's Motor Insurance Bureau) has to pay, but can in principle sue their policyholder. (Indeed the Bureau has to pay even if the registration number plates are fake or stolen, so long as they are from another Green Card country. (Good luck collecting from some countries, but that's another story.))   
Who knows this stuff? Who cares?   
And, hey, who are ""normal"" people? Especially on this forum, given it's intended for those with a foreign connection.

			Hi,   
 Sometimes it depends what kind of car do you want to get . 
Some of the dealer like mercedes and bmw or Hyundai that have banks and they can give you a best leasing offer .Sometimes they can give you with 2-3 % interests . 
If you use other leasing company they will change you at least 5-6 % . 
Or like the other member said before you can try to take a credit from MIGROS bank .     
Cheers ,

If he is just coming here as a tourist he can drive it around in Switzerland on his Slovenian plates for limited period until he either goes home with it or he becomes resident in which case he will need to do the import paperwork.      But make sure that it is properly insured for driving outside Slovenia for a prolonged period of time.

You're supposed to use public transport (train and/or bus) to do the bulk of the travel and use the vehicle just for the last bit. Or else if you live in town and don't need a car for every day use, but occasionally have to out to IKEA or something similar.

			I agree, 
but the labor is charged separately on the bill and I do not object against the labor price. I just object against the price of the part which is indeed 200% of the retail price. I do not have even guarantee, that they fitted new pump there. My main question was, whether it is possible to handle the price with the garage after it was put on the bill or whether there is any legal tool to protect/defend myself if I see they used hugely overpriced item without asking me beforehand.

So the steps are: day-cards bought individually, day-cards bought in a multipack as explained above, then the next jump is a month-card, then a year-card.   
I guess it depends how long you're going to be living here and doing this commute.  In some cases, a year-card is so very much cheaper than 12x a month-card, that being away for a few weeks, now and again, still makes it worth it.

			I am also searching around for a cheap car at the moment something less thirsty for some regular commuting.  A quick comparison reveals very little price difference between Germany and Switzerland - within a tolerable radius of where I am.   
Sure I can save a few hundred chf going to Germany - but that would be chewed up in times/costs to view/collect/test.

We can only guess what is being used. A forward facing car seat usually isn't called a booster seat, and you'd be shocked how many DO use a booster seat early on. The stage 2 you mention above is 9 months + that means putting a 9 month old forward facing, which means in an accident this is very unsafe. They are trying to change this as a 9 month old just hasn't the neck strength to be forward facing.

I am not sure if the tyre space in the trunk is large enough to house a summer tire (winter tyres are on now). Maybe if I deflated that would work.

			Looking at the above, the price of a new X5 has just dropped 23%, that's a 16% Euro discount and a 7% dealer discount. (Maybe the dealer discount was always there anyway?).   
Therefore the OP's actual discount is only 7% compared to Joe Public.   
The second hand forecourt prices have not dropped as yet, hence the narrowness of the first comparison, 10k difference over two years. They will drop, but given the ridiculous secondhand asking prices in general for cars here, they will drag their feet. 
Maybe the BMW dealers won't drop them for a while hoping to promote new car sales? Or immediately offer a discount if anyone shows any interest, but keep the sticker price the same?   
If you want the new X5 and can afford it, get it, but the depreciation hit is still there, just 7% less painful than if I bought one.

It's not the LEDs themselves that are the problem, but the controller circuitry driving them.  LEDs have a minimum wattage needed to drive them, below which they flicker rapidly on/off.  These are the only ones ""rated"" for 6V and even these flicker a bit at idle.

			For under 5,000chf you can either get very lucky - or badly burned. Finding a fresk service/mfk vehicle is key - and then stick to the known high-KM cars. These are the ones that can be resold in Switzerland.   
Generally the order for that is: Merc, Audi, Volvo, VW, Saab, BMW. I was told at the weekend they'd rather try to sell a 250k Saab than a 175k BMW    
None of that takes into account age - but the same is true, stick to the solid/premium makes and things tend to run well. This means components are well made. Stuff can, and certainly will go wrong, but less frequently than on older makes - and a 15 year old car from one of the above is still a good piece of kit that will happily cross a continent.   
Saying all that: 
1) Avoid the Merc A-class it is woeful. 
2) The old Merc 2.9 diesel found better use in the Sprinter. It is neither powerfull nor fuel efficient 
3) 11l/100km is what a petrol Merc will drink (assuming mixed driving) - whether it is 4 or 6 cylinder!! 
4) Do not buy a FWD Audi with the Multitronic gearbox. 
5) High KM Audis litter the Export dealers - make sure when they say ""with MFK"" they mean freash one!! 
6) Audi A2 is a bargain used - around 4-7k will get you the 1.4TDi or 1.6FSI model. A lot are well specced inside 
7) The S60/V70/S80 D5 (163ps pre-particulate filter) is the one to have 
8) VW 1.9 TDI  engines are gruff and noisey - but arguably the most fuel efficient engine of the era 
9) The 2.3 engine in the 9-5 is the pick of the bunch - Saab engineered through and through and no thirstier than the 2.0. The 3.0TiD has known oil level, cylinder liner and EGR issues. 
10) The BMW M20 engines sound very nice (late 80s) but are moving into collectors status.  
11) The M52B28 in 3er and 5er is one of BMWs absolutely best engines - expect around 9.5l/100km for mostly motorway driving. 
12) The 3.0d is very reliable and infinitely smoother than the 25tds engine that came before it.

The company I shipped with puts 3 cars in a 40 ft container and it is the cheapest that way. You need the original title, registration and sales contract. If you owned the car more than 6 months prior to moving here and declared the car on your 13.20 import form you can avoid VAT and customs. If not add about 12% to your purchase price, which is not so bad. If interested Send me a PM and I will give you my contact. Shipping was a bit over 2000 door to door in the container from Tampa to Basel and these guys ship cars usually every month to CH so can find you a container that already has 2 cars in it.

			So here is my wife and my experiences in converting our US licenses (state of Missouri) to Swiss licenses in Zurich Kanton.   
Completed the eye exams at our local optician (optiker) office.  Cost was 15-20 sfr.  My exam was actually completed in Zug Kanton so the Kanton doesn't matter.  The tests took 10-15 minutes and were a basic read the chart and peripheral vison tests.     
We then visit the strassenvehrkehrsamt with the following item: 
-completed application (with eye test information) 
-resident permit ID card  
-existing US drivers license 
-ID photo from one of the photo booths   
It turns out my wife and my situations were different as we both had Missouri licenses but issued at different times as we were married in 2013 and she changed her name requiring a new license    
- my missouri license had no issue date, only an expiration date (2017).  Initially this was going to be a problem and would have required a letter from the state of Missouri showing the issue date.  Fortunately the lady helping us asked her supervisor who found a letter from another Missouri driver in the past stating the issue date was six years before the expiration.  With the letter they had my documents were complete.     
-my wife's Missouri license was a new version and actually had an issue and expiration date.  Unfortunately the issue date was July 2013 (name change in June due to marriage).  Her date of entry to switzerland was in June 2014.  When they processed her license application it provided her a learners license which requires 2 driving classes (about 900 sfr) in the next year.  However, the lady helping us instructed that if my wife can show evidence of a license for just one additional month she will be issued a full license without the learners requirement.  Thankfully my wife did have a license longer so once we receive proof of this using picture of old license or letter from state we can email it to the strassenvehrkehrsamt amt referencing her PIN number and her license will be updated.   
We will both receive our licenses in the post in about a week.  I'm sure they will be accompanied with the invoice as well.

1465	03.08.2012, 14:04	Senior Member	Thanked 353 Times in 135 Posts	Location: Geneva	"    In your position I'd be looking for a large estate car, not a wannabee off-roader such as you list above. Sure, some of the above give a little more interior height than their road-based cousins, but in nearly all cases the usable, i.e. flat, load space is greater in a normal-height estate car.   
So I'd be looking at Audi A6, rather than Q7, at Volvo V70 (or possibly XC70 if you like the image) rather than XC90, and so on. Ride quality is nearly always going to be much better in the lower cars and accessibility, e.g. lifting a stroller into the load area, will be much easier.   
They'll also generally be cheaper to buy and more economical to run than the SUV versions, which may be a factor too. Other cars you might consider would include the VW Passat, BMW 5-series tourer, or even the Ford Mondeo estate, which I'm assured is a great car (but I couldn't do it myself).

You are perfectly correct.      This is not quite correct. This is important.    
It must be a ticket   of your   that is being called by your chosen train  within your valid zones !   
Consider this: You are actually travelling with two tickets: 1. Your ticket/abonnement/travel card for   (or all) of the fare network's  , and 2. a ticket for a destination outside of your fare network's borders.   
If you now take a particular train  , then you would theoretically to get off at the last stop this particular train calls   fare network's ticket/abonnement (can be your start point), and then buy there a ticket to your final destination (outside of the fare network's border)!   
Again, this rule is irrelevant as long as you chose a destination within your original (combined/shared) fare network.   
---------   
Again, this should be consistent with   (see especially the last part of the message).   
Is it now understandable, or are you now even more puzzeled?   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Nov 2014	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Travelling outside my train pass zone	derk	Posts: 8

And anyway his family isn't in Geneva, they're based in France so an even longer journey time.      Wrong.  It matters very much what type of permit you have.    As said, if he's non-EU and has a G permit, meaning he must return to his home in France at least once a week, then he cannot transfer that permit to Zurich because Zurich is not in a border zone.  Nor for that matter could he move it to Basel because he doesn't live in a zone that borders it.  However, if he's EU then he can still keep his G permit and work in Zurich because he's allowed to work anywhere in Switzerland and is not restricted by the various border zone treaties.       
If he has a non-EU B permit which is tied to his employer he's supposed to live in the same canton as his workplace, but it is possible to live in another canton  .  Only if you're a non-EU and have an ""open"" B permit which isn't tied to an employer can you live where you want.  Or if you're married to a Swiss/EU national and have either a B or C permit of course.

The soft backpacks from the big group of international scouts that shared our flight seemed to fare much better... They rolled down the conveyor...

			to add to the problem It is against the law to have a car registered without (third party) insurance. The Dutch authorities do a database comparison (plates against insurance) and you will be fined 400 euro.    
Try to get the insurance starting the date you cancelled it otherwise the database police will find you

yes the small sign under the main sign indicates that it only applies to the category of vehicle depicted in that small sign, aka M4 signs.

As to why there were no such corresponding ""small sign"" at the end of that zone, I'm pretty sure there usually is, but can't remember for sure.

			Usually when there are blue or white painted parking spaces, there are restrictions.    
Typically during working hours, six days a week, the first hour of parking costs nothing; then you must move your car to another street.    
To avoid moving the car every hour, you can buy a permit from the city police ""Stadtpolizei"" which costs about CHF 200,-- per year. If the car is not registered in your name, they won't sell you a permit.    
Usually every street has a notice on a pole about parking, you   read the notice for the restrictions or otherwise, for permit holders.

			GVA only really gets crowded at security on Saturdays (and to a lesser extent Sundays) during the ski season. It also depends if you are checking in luggage or not. Without luggage turning up 1 hour before the flight is plenty and will give you a little reserve. 
If you've got bags you need 10-15 minutes more (and even more with Easyjet). There's no difference between short-haul and long-haul flights.

			The only examples I can think of are night trains (marked as such in the timetable, i.e. not every train that runs at night is a night train) and certain touristic trains (for which a reservation is recommendable anyway, and the reservation fee typically includes the surcharge, so nothing else to worry about).

Parents will visit for a week and they plan to be on the road most of the days (bus and trains). They are < 60 so no discount for seniors.   
What's the best option to buy them a travelcard to cover all their trips in Switzerland?    
The only thing I found that resembles what I want is the ""Swiss Saver 4 days"" but I can't understand if it covers both people with 245 chf or if both need to buy one so 490chf.

			Yes, though likely to be a knock on effect until some time tomorrow.   
Aviation journalist David Learmount said the IT problem would cause ""major disruption"" but would be resolved by Saturday.   
""This impacts not just people within the UK, it impacts flights heading here from anywhere - anything heading this way will be told some of them can't be accepted, and they will have to go back to where they flew from or consider diverting to other countries,"" he told the BBC.   
With aircraft out of position, or flight crews out of hours, there are likely to be knock-on problems for many flights.

			When being tail-gated, lifting your foot off the pedal is legal, but heavy breaking is not. But don't forget on the Autobahn there is a minimum speed limit of 60 km/h.    
I would expect the woman worked at an Embassy in the city and was excused prosecutions, if someone drove like that every day they would soon be ""taken out"". If you see her again get her number!    
It is just possible to ""undertake"" when a single lane merges with a dual carriageway. If there is a solid white line on your side and a broken line on hers, it is a legal manoeuvre.

			In CH number plates are considered an attribute (so to say) of the  owner, as opposed to some other countries where they're considered  attribute of the car. Thus no need for new plates when changing the car.   
Your initial point b), namely selling the car allows you to cancel your existing insurance, is correct. But you need another insurance (Versicherungsnachweis, proof of insurance) before you're allowed to drive the new car with your number plates.   
Proof of insurance simply means the acknowledgement by the insurance that they're willing to insure the new car. If you want to cancel you most probably need to do that before bringing your new car into circulation, and the sooner the better. If you can do a few days without a car it's probably best to wait for acknowledgment of cancellation before signing the new contract.   
The new insurance company wants to bind you as long as possible, there's no need for you to accept that - demand shorter minimal duration and threaten to walk away if they refuse. Presumably the sales agent is paid by premium volume generated so he  personally has an interest in those 5 years minimum duration. OTOH you can always transfer car ownership to whomever you like and cancel your then-current insurance, doesn't matter if those 5 years have passed or not.   
One more thing:  
Your old insurance may make you a better offer if you talk to them  
Maybe the new insurance simply gives you a better rebate. And of course, less expensive doesn't mean better (except, I think, for 3rd party liability which may be the same for every company).

			I went from Basel to Paris and back. It was very nice. They had a special over the summer so 1st class was actually cheaper than 2nd. I bought my tickets on the SBB website and picked them up at the train station. We had two stops in France, both close to the Swiss border. Coming back I think there was only one stop.   
Pros: the snack was tasty. The views were beautiful. No long airport waits.   
Cons: I have long legs so the seats were a little cramped. (My short niece was fine).  Plus, going to Paris the bathroom was nasty. The floor was always wet and it smelled like a men's room. Coming back it was clean.

Ended up speaking with the Basel guy on the phone, he had me fax him all the papers I had, told me everything was in order and to try again in TI, and if there were still problems that I could do it in Basel.   
Fortunately, the next time it was OK so I didn't have to head up to Basel.   
Also, he also mentioned that the rules are the same for all cantons when importing, so if it was OK for him it had to be OK in TI as well.

			Hello,   
No, in lausanne you can do the test only in french unfortunately. You can ask them for permition to do the test in bern or neuchatel where you can do that in english. This is not a problem since i know already some people that did it in bern. Just call them

			Really would not take the chance of buying at the port for peak holidays, like Christmas and New Year though. EuroTunnel are not flexible about times unless it is the train before or after- charges for missing your choice of slots can be huge. You can buy a Flexiticket, but they are much more expensive..   
Some ferries have many crossings, others not. We've twice arrived much earlier than expected, then had to sit in the car for 2 hours anyhow because there was no earlier crossing!

			You ought to also be aware that there are currently road works between Basel and Baden, that could also create problems.   
If you take the Baden West exit (the one by the Kantonspital) you run into the Mellingerstrasse Stau (caused by the junction at Lindenplatz -  a horribly complicated thing with something like 8-10 phases and all the lights up the hill slaved to it) which can easily add 10-15 minutes to your journey.    
Personally I'd take the train, there are 2 fast trains an hour at xx14 and xx40. The fastest train takes 47 minutes.

What also needs to be taken into consideration is whether you have a parking spot where you live. Living centrally can mean limited or no parking. If you have not checked this out, I would do so before even considering buying a car.

			Good day to you all, 
We are moving to Zug in early February and have the option for a company car or what seems to be a fairly generous car allowance. 
I have a few questions for the group.     
Is it easy as an new expat to buy a car or get a personal lease? 
Are there any companies that offer this service to expats that i can look at to see what my allowance will get me? 
What additional costs should i consider if buying? e.g. road tax, MOT etc? 
Any personal experience advice on company vs. private lease car?   
ps. Not sure what the company car will be yet and I am a bit of a petrol head.   
Thanks

			Hello all,   
Next March (we're in December now) I'm moving from Adliswil to Zurich (Binz). I have a car and a permit for parking in a blue zone park place day and night (for this I pay around 400CHF/year). 
My questions are:   
1 - Where should I go to switch the blue zone to Zurich? (here in Adliswil I had to go to the Police Station)   
2 - Is the price the same as in Adliswil or does it vary?   
3 - As I am moving only in March, is it possible to switch by then?    
thank you very much

			Hi, I am thinking of using this official VW garage in Rüti:       
anybody has had any experience of taking the car here? 
I know being an official VW will be a bit more expensive, but having no reference of other garages to take my VW Polo, I am willing to go to the official one.   
Alternatively, if anybody can recommend another garage in the area of Hinwil/Rüti/Wetzikon for a service (and to convert the car from English to Swiss), that will be great.   
Thanks!

1550	null	null	null	null	"    Because economists compare a standardised product basket which makes very little sense - this produce basket might not include taxi rides but does typically include a 100 sqm three bedroom one family house and a mid sized car - two things which are a luxury in Singapore. I am currently thinking of buying a Mazda 3 and they cost around 80k CHF new (!).   
Most of those economists happen to be American or European and therefore define a product basket based on what a typical European lives like and buys in a supermarket. In other parts of the world are many of these products rather exotic and therefore expensive... or to make the story short: if you live an European life is Singapore as expensive as Zurich. If you live a more local life is it WAY cheaper. A package of imported cheese or yoghurt in an expat-oriented super market is more expensive than a decent local dinner. Swiss people on the other hand put owning a car over using taxi services... so act the same or get switzerlanded for your in Swiss eyes luxurious demands.    
Bottom line: When in Rome...

			As a motorbiker with a lot more vulnerability, in the short time I have been here I have had to completely adapt my whole driving style on roundabouts.   
A definate more firm approach with positioning, making move towards exit junction sooner and always having a B plan has helped.

Die Reifen müssen auf der ganzen Lauffläche mindestens 1,6 mm tiefe Profilrillen aufweisen. (Bei Winterreifen empfiehlt sich eine Mindestprofiltiefe von 4 mm).      
So 1.6mm tread Summer 4mm Winter. I think you must check your insurance documents because some where talking about not paying out if you didnt have winter tyres on.    
If you have ever been stuck behind people with summer tyres on in the midle of a snow storm you will understand why you need them.

			Don't know if this  will be too late for you, Butters, but McOptik on Gundelingerstrasse (vaguely opposite the Migros, tram stop Solothurnerstrasse on the no. 16) do the sight test for licence conversion.   
When I went in, the optometrist guy spoke good English and seemed ready to do the test then & there but, sadly, couldn't since I 'fessed up to my right eye being classified as 'no recordable sight'.  So I'm off to an opthalmologist for my test but a colleague had his test done at McOptik - he didn't tell me what it cost but I bet it was cheaper than the opthalmologist  will turn out to be.   
The McOptik guy impressed me because I brought my current prescription in  and he could've gone ahead with the test, charged me and failed me but he quickly questioned the numbers on my right eye and advised seeing  an opthalmologist.

			Seat Alhambra. 
Top-spec'ed units with 4x4 sell at around 40k. 
I'd get a warranty-extension, as the output-quality from that factory in Portugal (where both VW Sharan and Seat Alhambra are built) seems to vary a bit.   
I think the Q7 could get very expensive to maintain, once the various stuff starts failing.   
I heard that Dodge et.al. have improved over their bottom-of-the-barrel quality a couple of years ago - but I have no information to back this up and IIRC, that in itself wouldn't be a big achievement, given the level they were on...   
I'd start reading a forum where owners of the cars that interest you congregate. 
Of course, it might make you weary of buying any car, but at least you learn to take the glossy ads and lofty promises from the manufacturers not so seriously...

			Hi all,    
Just wanted to happily add my 2 cents.... 
I exceed my timeline by close to 5 years (2 months to 5 years to be exact) and I was completely freaking out when I realised I needed to have this done within the 1st year of arriving in Switzerland. (I didn't think to do it as I don't drive here). Obviously I didn't want to take another driving test as I might not pass...   
Well I took the risk and braved my application, I had my eyes tested, documents verified and played out a whole script in my head as to how innocent I am, how I will act out some puppy looking eyes when I got to the driving licence renewal centre blah blah arrived at the centre and the woman didn't even bat a eyelid - had a quick look at my papers and said everything was fine.    
Just a bit of hope for all those who have missed the 1 year of arrival into Switzerland deadline!   
Best regards 
Lisa

Oh, no!  I don't plan on bringing the car over from America until it's completely restored!  It's going to stay in my brother's driveway and I'm in charge of giving him the money needed/ordering specific parts.  I refuse to get my hands dirty with this car (literally)!  Lol!

			thanks guys.. from the details above it makes it way cheaper to buy a car here in zurich and leave my car in ireland to rust until i get someone to buy it (tell me about the irish monies!!).. my insurance here in ireland says no to more than 30 days and its extremely expensive already with a well known big insurer (to protect my asset) and even though i offered to pay more, they said NO!   
as for temp Z plate - that is dangerous even though i wont have to pay duties again when i return, its still dodgy enough for an average joe to put my self in it..   
as for the part leaser, they do not mind the car outside but for certain period and i think they will be happy if i put more guarantees on it, however, they are very not happy with the idea of temp plates and that will alarm them and they will use the ""car should be mainly used on irish land"" clause in the contract which will get me into huge hassle despite of me sticking to the loan rules and putting guarantees.. they also want to make sure that Im subscribed to ""return the car"" policy where it can be returned anytime from any country to ireland without paying for that service in case of accident or breaking the contract.   
the total monies i already paid (over 80k) in less than a year for it kill me.. i cant just through the money and not at least try...   
anybody suggests or knows any irish insurance company who would be welling to cover that full year abroad?

			Sorry for not reporting back earlier...   
Uber refunded the extra charge above what I usually would pay for this particular route (which is kind of in the middle of their estimated range).  The process was very easy - I wrote to them using the contact form and within 3 days I got a refund.     
I continue therefore being a happy customer with Uber.

			Regarding the cooperative membership the mobility website says:   
10% on a volume of more than CHF 600 
20% on a volume of more than CHF 2000   
Do I only get a 10% discount on the hourly/KM rates from 601-2000 and then a 20% discount on the hourly/KM rates once I exceed 2,000?   
So for example I would only receive a 10% discount (CHF10), if I accumulated a total CHF650 of fees in one year.

			Tinkiwinki, thank you for the advice. The wear was exactly why I'm worried about Honda - the gear stick completely lost colour on one side, some wear on pedals too. But the seats were fine, no noise when driving either. The car is very quiet and has relatively good reaction actually. I might be too suspicious, so prefer to check with a specialist.       Yes, it does  But Honda was not too bad and you get winter tyres and 1 year guaranty, with Volvo you get only Volvo.

The sourcing garage only needs to be involved if the lease is being terminated. If the lease is being paid off from the proceeds of a sale they don't.     
Ending the lease, returning the car to the garage, paying any penalty charges (or receiving any over payment). This effects your credit score.     
Garages can do this. You may find there is a difference between the offer and the outstanding lease amount which you would have to pay to the leasing company. No penalty charges. No effect on your credit score.   
I have saved many many thousands by Terminating because in each case the cars were immaculate but the lease company had over estimated the residual values.

Good idea.   
OP you could ask your shipping line, whether they have an agent in Switzerland, or you can ask the Agent in whatever port your car/container arrives in Europe if they have an Agent in Switzerland.   
alternatively, put into your search engine, Shipping Car/Container USA to Switzerland & see what quotes you get.   
I did know a shipping line that had Agents in Switzerland years ago, but they no longer do, but hopefully there is another shipping line that does.

If so, a switch to 98 will stop/reduce the knocking.  Cleanliness, consumption will remain unchanged. 
mixing will not matter, unless you are trying to reduce knocking.  But again: modern engine management can usually adjust the ignition timing to compensate for knocking, so you probably dont have a knocking problem to begin with.

I used Alufelgenboerse in Dubendorf to do mine - repair and complete respray - and they came back looking (better) than new. Not cheap though - but worth the cost IMHO.   
The wheels on the Disco are FUBAR thanks to the previous owner towing a lot and not bothering to clean off the wheels. AFB shook their heads when they saw them - and proved how well bonded the dust is (only scrapes off with a lot of force!!!).

			The formula is still there on the website.   
For me, it's quite pricey- car weighs 1570 kg and has a 235 kW petrol engine. 
0.15 CHF per kilo, up to 2000 kg 
2 CHF for each kW, up to 100 kW; plus 3 CHF/kW above that   
so 235.50 (weight) + (200 + (235 x 3)) = 840.50 CHF to tax my car in VD.   
Glad I live in Basel land, where tax is based on weight, based on a multiplier of that weight- around 680 CHF per year (still pricey!)

			From 01.01.2014, the 50% reduction in road tax for the vehicles with particulate filter installed  NO LONGER APPLIES . The only way to get a discount (50%) is to have the car registered before this date, or to buy a hybrid, electric car or a car with very small engine (75%). The emission mustn't exceed 120 g of CO2 per kilometer traveled.   
Since nobody on this forum have informed me about this fact before I bought diesel, I will leave this information for future buyers.   
Can it be sticked mr/mrs/ms admin?

			IF you get a Betreibung, and you pay, it is noted that you paid, that is all. You are still listed as once having a bad debt.    
IF you are reported as having a bad debt with a private credit agency, you hope they will remove your name...

			I imported two cars from France this year. No issues at all if the car is in good technical condition. But be ware, the Swiss inspection can be tough on even small dents in the body-work, e.g. a cracked plastic bumper would not pass here (that's usually no problem in France).    
We also came from Paris and there you can\t abvoid people denting your car, so if there are loads of cosmetic/mechanical issues you will probably have to add to the cost to get those fixed in time for the inspection. And if you need to fix it, do so in France. It is  a lot cheaper than here (really, a lot).   
I would also only import the car if it has use value to you, as older cars (especially with high mileage) are next to worthless on the Swiss used car market, so you might get a bit more for your car in France if you sell it. The choice really depends on what you would buy instead (and where).

			I realized this potential problem with the SBB app tickets and even online tickets quite early, so I created an SBB account for both my wife and myself, even though both accounts are linked to the same credit card. So now her phone has her app with her login for the cases where she needs to buy her tickets while travelling on her own.   
For situations where I am buying tickets for both of us with the app, I have the option to enter her name and date of birth during the booking process. A pro-tip here is to add your partner's contact details in full in your phone's Contacts/Phonebook app, especially including the date of birth. This makes importing the contact into the SBB app during the ticket booking process very simple.

You may stop and unload and deliver or pick up, but you may not park there. You must be near the vehicle all the time. You might just avoid a ticket after 5 pm, but it's not a guarantee.

			Why shouldn't it be allowed? You are taking an SBB trolley onto an SBB train and off to an SBB station.    
My tip is to catch one of the big red trains from St Gallen to Bern via Zurich city, as they have wide doors and no pillars.    
Would a ticket inspector charge you for a bicycle fee? He can only throw you off at the next stop, which is where you want to go....

			You can park on the road, but if it's something you're going to do longterm,  I think you need to register your car with the Gemeinde and pay something like Fr 30 per month. They do check to see which vehicles are parked regularly on the streets.

			I read the French version and I still think they are not right:   
Pour un AG en abonnement, le permis de séjour B doit être valable jusquà quatre mois après le premier jour de validité de lAG. Pour un AG payé par facture annuelle, le permis de séjour B (lors de la signature du contrat, domicilié/e en Suisse depuis au moins six mois) doit être valable le premier jour de validité de lAG   
It makes a clear distinction between monthly GA and GA with yearly bill and the six month restriction applies only to latter. Actually I have found that station staff, at least in Bern, is rather incompetent in the matters related to foreigners. Because now I was told that I am not entitled also to HalbTax card, I am not entitled to anything. I did not have enough time for a lengthy discussion, but will have next week and I will report the results.   
Or I will write to SBB and ask for a written explanation.

Dodgyken, thank you for the reference. I used to live in London so i´m quite aware of the costs. In any case your arguments are all valid, and as i said to Confloozed, I should have just mentioned is too expensive FOR ME right NOW.

Yeah. this is pretty spot on. I try to commute all year round to Geneve from near Nyon... it is a 37km commute and two thirds is on the auto route. The number of days I have to take public transport really varies. Last year it was possible to ride everyday, but the year before there were about 20 days I could not ride because of snow and/or ice. Other years it has been just 5 days that I could not ride. This season will be interesting as I am now using a mix of motorcycle and bicycle.   
Make sure you wrap up warm, and watch out for cars and coaches disguised as mobile igloos. They tend to lose snow on bends and can make a dry road pretty treacherous for 2 wheel riders. At the same time, enjoy the ride and take pride in the fact that only true hardcore badass rides in temps below zero.

In all seriousness, you can put any drive car, with any power in a ditch. Shit happens.   
In a ""modern"" car with traction/stability control and ABS, fitted with new(ish) modern designed winter tyres, driving at speeds suitable for the conditions, the chances of you ending in a ditch are minimal - no matter where the power is going.   
The fact she mentioned this was in a 4wd BMW is even stranger. Having had a couple, and deliberately provoked them on snow/ice - I know just how difficult it is to get the car to mis-behave.   
Anyway, back to the OPs original post: 
- 325d from 2009 has the much improved 3.0 engine - which delivers superb economy.

			Hi,   
I am hoping to get some advice on which is the best ticket to cover local travel in the city of Zurich.   
I need to be mostly in zone 1 for the 5 days for meetings. and to cover airport travel to and from zone one would be the following ticket the best solution?   
3 zones ticket for 6 days for fr 71,20?   
Does this mean unlimited travel within 3 zones for any 6 days ?      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2014	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	a week in Zurich - best option for public transport	Desertlord	Posts: 34

We brought both our (diesel) cars here with us from Belgium but as I now only do short trips and not the long journeys up the E411 I regularly did in Belgium I have recently swapped my diesel car for a petrol one. Diesel is more expensive here but Diesel engines are more economical so it doesn't save me any money having a petrol engine rather than diesel. 
I have no experience at all concerning hybrids but there have been a lot of 'charging points' popping up recently so I guess it's becoming a more popular option here.

			You are at the right place ...   
What you normally do with any car related stuff (tyres included), you double the price and advertise it in the relevant section of the EF. Good luck mate! It's a good fashioned way of selling stuff here and perhaps emptying needed corners of the house.

			In the end, you're buying a car that has been run rotten - this can be good and it can be bad.  What I'd do it buy it and then be happy if I get a year out of it.  Anything beyond that will be a bonus and it will be going to eastern Europe afterwards.   
I'm planning something similar next year but not quite so near EOL.

			Hey, 
I have used 2 moving companies to bring things from NI. First time in 2007 my company used 'baxters' (i think) to move my things. They did a really good job. think their main base was in the UK. I returned to switzerland last year and the company had a new supplier... interdean. they were also good and fast, however they forgot some things back in NI which has been a real pain. no matter who you use, make sure to check the list when they pack and tick it off when it arrives   
Goodluck

It's possible that you live and drive in areas where speed traps, cameras and etc are just not that prevalent.   
We don't budget per se, but in a given year, we could get 5 between the two of us. When we first moved to kt zrh, we averaged one a month....now it's been ages. In Bern we got parking tickets sometimes too.

I think I don't really get the noise around a desperate mom in an emergency situ, it happened to me probably once when my kid was really really small, it's easier to plan ahead when they grow a little. It's rare, vast majority of people are respectful both to privacy of their baby and fellow passengers. I'd take that any time over a person doing her nails on a train and putting 3 coats of evil smelling varnish on right in front of me and my little kid.

			I complete on my Swiss ski resort holiday apartment next month and am allowed to import a vehicle or two tax free for the first two years if ownership, but must have owned them 6 months.   
Am thinking of buying a quad bike an taking it to Switzerland as I need to take a lorry there anyway for a renovation.   
Any advice on not falling foul on the vehicle inspection. UK has agricultural quads which are unregistered with DVLA. Agricultural which are registered with DVLA aNd can only be driven on roads a few miles around a farm and lastly ones 100% set up for roads with indicators and brake lights etc.   
Any tips on what to buy from experienced hands? What do I need to drive on the roads in ski resort alone?   
Many thanks

			Hi All,    
Thanks for tips above.  
We took the pass in the end.    
We exited the A2 at Watson & went into Andermatt for a quick nosey then on up to Hospenthal and Airolo.    
A really nice trip and there was one Road works where we waited 2 minutes or so. Appreciate it could have been much worse because it was indeed an alternate traffic set up.    
So thanks again.

			What's the situation with LPG in CH these days ?   
An ex-GF's family lived on the German border with the Netherlands and used to nip over the border to fill up with very cheap LPG - was somewhat interested in this LPG option when I later moved to CH but was told there were restrictions on LPG cars being parked in many underground and multi-story car parks so didn't pursue it - is this genuinely (and still) the case ?

			I was driving my particularly loud and highly torqued Landrover Defender down a 30km/h slope around that speed. There was this dude walking downhill in front of me and I was going in the same direction, giving him plenty of room. He got all animated and spitting venom and telling me aggressively that it was 30... 
There was no way he could have judged my speed, walking away from me for one, and the fact he turned around in the last few seconds to have a dig. 
I told him to go forth and multiply, he scooted away rather quickly and that was now a while back... 
Not heard a bleat...

			Regarding the tourist visa i don't know, better ask the strassverkehrsamt, they probably don't care much but regarding insurance better read the contract and ask your insurance broker. 
For sure don't drive it abroad because foreign customs might confiscate it and even charge you with contraband if it's worth a lot, especially in the country where you will be resident. If you still have the swiss driving license maybe not because they will think you are swiss-resident, but that's at your own risk. 
If it's parked for the season you better deregister it and save  insurance money, then maybe export it to wherever you go living. 
If you give it to your swiss-resident friend, you can only drive it in switzerland for the same reasons above.

The way you answered the question, and indeed the question itself, is making a huge level of assumption. Only if you have an accident that was clearly your fault and clearly related to your driving too fast (or whatever) for winter conditions, which might have been OK if you had winter tyres fitted, would any such action be considered.   
So you're perfectly fine to drive all year on summer tyres, and at no risk of prosecution or insurance problems, as long as you drive appropriately for the conditions. Which might mean, for example, driving much more slowly, avoiding certain roads at certain times, using chains if there's snow on the roads, or whatever else may be considered normal and sensible.    
Lack of winter tyres may be a factor to be considered in the event of an accident investigation, but no more than anything else. Having bald tyres, faulty brakes, no windscreen washer fluid or broken light bulbs may also have just as much an effect on the outcome, as would being too tired, having drunk too much, driving without prescribed spectacles or under the influence of medication. All of these, and much more, could be taken into consideration in just the same way.

			You can see all the possible places to buy them in Alsace here...         
You can only buy 1 ticket on the bus at regular price... 
When you go to the bus stop, there's usually a little sign that shows you where the bus line goes and provides more info about the ticket prices available on the bus.   
On the website, you'll find more info about the different ticket prices available.   
If you're looking for a U-abo that includes the French buses and Swiss trams, you can get a monthly or yearly pass in Basel.

			One way rentals with vans/trucks are very difficult to find in Europe.  It works OK with a car, but not with anything resembling a utility vehicle.  There's just not enough demand to keep them moving back-and-forth to merit the business.   
You're much better off looking for a part-load to share (or a friendly member of EF who is making a one-way trip in the other direction).

My husband and I just bought a car from auto park zuri, which is also an import lot. After finding the car we wanted there, we went to the Renault dealership to see how much the same car, with the same specs (goodies) would be if we bought it direct from them.  The difference we were quoted was 5000 chf more, and that was AFTER almost 5000 chf in ""discounts"".   
Needless to say, we went back to azw to buy the car at the lower price.  
And the car has the original manufacturer's warranty for 2 years, which is valid in all of Europe.    
As for repairs: The insurance companies did not care that our car was from an import lot and not the direct dealership, and everything is covered as normal. (Which is good, since 5 days after we bought the car it was caught out in that nasty hail storm, and will now be repaired.   ) And when we brought our car to the Renault service center, they also didn't seem to care that it was not bought from their dealership in Zurich.

			I'm sorry but I also can't tell you about prices.   
Mine was all part of a relocation package from work.   
I only had to deal with them directly and the company paid the bills.   
All I can say is that the Packimpex people were easy to deal with, even when something went missing, they were straight on it, and kept me informed up until it arrived in Switzerland.... can't help mistakes, but it's how you deal with the situation (and the client) that counts for me.   
The Crown relocation people were also very helpful. It maybe worth just giving them a call. I'm sure they can help indicate a few prices for you.

			I had one with Nationale Suisse: a dime-sized door ding with no damage to the paint and had absolutely no issues to have the claim settled. 
I had to make just two calls: one to the garage to have a cost estimate (CHF 300 as no painting was involved) and another to NS to obtain the claim #. Then off I went to the garage and it took them 45 minutes to fix (including a routine oil change and a visual inspection on the brakes).

			Most tuners in CH don't have homologated maps. Even those that do have them, have them only for some engines. It's simply too expensive for them to bother getting homologated, so they don't do it.   
On the other hand, reputable tuners allow you to switch maps yourself (e.g. some device you insert into the diagnostics port or even from existing stalks). Not for STVA (though it comes in handy there as well), but maybe to have different settings for summer/winter, high/low altitude etc

Often there`s a bike propped up/lying next to our garden wall on the street side, after a few days its gone again.   
My grand-daughter had her bike ""stolen"" from their house one night (not locked, but in a shed in the back garden) - next day it was returned - a friend of hers needed to get somewhere fast and just took it.

			Hi EFers   
Here's the situation. The Mrs and I have full NWT passes covering all public transport in the NW of Switzerland.     
We also have the Junior Karte for 3 of our 4 children. The 4th is still too young to require one. As an aside, in case you didn't know, the 3rd (Junior Karte!) is free if you have two already... I'm hoping the 4th will be too, but let's see.   
Anyway, back on topic, our children will increasingly need to travel independently, but I'm not particularly keen on forking out the 45 CHF/month required, especially as at the moment the majority is ""free"" on the Junior-Karte.   
Are there any (legal) tricks that we are missing that you know of?   
Or is it simply the case getting a Mehrfahrtenkarte  (snigger) and they use it as and when needed, if they can't bum a lift on the Junior-Karte? And if so is a U-abo worthwhile?   
Thanks for sharing!

			This happened to me many years ago in UK with annual ticket, it was before the photo card part of the ticket.  With relevant ID I was issued with new ticket marked duplicate.  I cannot remember if admin charge, but I was advised no pro rata refund would have been possible if I later chose to cancel it.   
I imagine Swiss system something similar, probably with a small admin charge.   
You did remind me humourously, once when I was living with sibling same sex but completely different colour hair.  That sibling one day took my travel card by mistake and no-one questioned.  I paid for my fare that day.  No problem long time ago, again UK.

			I'd wait and see what Yamaha does with its new 3-inline 850cc from the MT-09. Rumors are that we'll see a small FJR and/or a revised TDM. 
From the bikes you listed I'd definitely go for the Super Tenere, but as you might have noticed I'm sort of a Yamaha-guy...   
You also have the Aprilia Caponord which has a lower price till the end of this month.   
Happy shopping!

			the price actually seems very good compared to others in autoscout, the engine isn't particularly engaging nor economous as the TSI but it's cheaper so i guess it's worth it unless you do a lot of kilometers per annum. 
This thing with the tires is wrong though, you should not have different tires or differently consumed tires on the two axles, especially never two winter tires in the front and two summer in the back which is completely useless since it's the back tires keeping you on the road on a wet winter night.

			From your village to somewhere around the Gubrist you'll hit incoming traffic to Zurich. Once past that you might be going against traffic. Same with the return. Winti to Dietlikon should be ok , then you'll hit everyone going to the airport, Bern etc. Sometimes the split right after Wallisellen sucks (in the direction of Zurich) if you're going on the highway toward the Gubrist.    
 However, there's construction around Wallisellen where the highway splits and sometimes right around Glatt Zentrum, the highway becomes as mess. There is also construction right past the Winti Toss exit, and often a big traffic jam.    
I'd do a test drive at different times to see how you feel about it.  Personally, I'd stick to the train though.    
 On a good day, the drive from Winti to Oerlikon take 20 minutes. On a bad day, it takes an hour.   
It also depends on where you're going in Winti.  Sometimes traffic is backed up between the Toss highway exit, all along the Zurichstrasse past the city center.

			I think the debate between the ""start on a 50cc rat bike"" and ""start on a cheap 600-800cc bike that you'll actually like"" will not end. I found the most important characteristics of a beginners bike are:   
 - Low center of gravity 
 - Low weight 
 - Smooth and forgiving throttle 
 - Upright seating position   
Low center of gravity and low weight will make the bike feel more agile and easier to turn. A smooth throttle is important because the last thing you want is a jerky throttle that delivers power too fast or in an uneven fashion. Finally, an upright seating position will make you feel more secure on your first rides. When you are still putting your feet down all the time, the last thing you want is a body position that effectively forces you to lie down face forward like on sport bikes.   
I don't subscribe to the notion that you must buy a weak engined bike because you are a muppet and won't resist the temptation of going full throttle on your second ride. If you are a responsible adult and will use the throttle responsibly, it does not matter that the top speed of the bike is 200+. You'll simply stay out of that range until you have your license and are ready to take it to a circuit or the autobahn. Besides, I don't find going fast in a straight line exciting at all. Much better to do some twisties (of which we have no shortage in CH) and for most of them you will be in the 30-80 range for a while.

			I could only comment on the PSI-Zurich route by transportation.   
The SBB offers what is called ""Point to Point GA"", which can be used only on a specified route. Minimum subscription is 3 months. So if you say your friend is staying for a couple of months it could be worth asking about it. 
Depending on the route, sometimes the point to point ""limited"" GA is more expensive than an unlimited ""GA"", so check the price of both.

Don't get a Targa, it squeaks and leaks if the seals are not perfect.   
Also don't get a F1 transmission: 
a) it's just something waiting to go horribly wrong 
b) if you can have a gated shifter Ferrari you go for it. And the F1 is not even that good to justify the move. 
c) since you're thinking about the reselling of the car, a manual car will be more desireable

			Remember though, if the car is on French plates it will have to have French insurance - and your French insurance company many not be so keen to do that.   
To reduce import duty you can put the car on Z-plates for 2 years - it means it can be insured/taxed in Switzerland but isn't officially imported. After 2 years you will be pay whatever duty is due at that time. This should be less than now.

pay 5, and you receive it by post, after maybe 14 days.    
1. Scan the Swiss grey/beige car document ( ) into your computer   
2. click on the ( ) link:   (   Thanks Tom) 
3. Complete the questionnaire/ form online  
4. Attach the scanned document, Browse & Send.....   
5. Then transfer ,  5 to the account shown, with    
IBAN:  , SWIFT-BIC:    
The Cologne office will post the ""  / Umweltsplakette"" to you. (About 14 days)    
There are different groups, depending on the vehicles catalytic converter / particle filter.         
. 
I had to send Cologne (Köln) a reminder, but I have at last received the (Green) sticker for the windscreen.

			RHD cars do sell in Switzerland at a substantial lower price than the LHD.     
  Look at        or similar and you will find.   
  But your car is still UK Registered, so would not sell. 
  If your question was is it worth the import to sell almost immediately, then the answer would be no, continue to UK to sell.   
  This is a very good thread re import of UK card, the first posting is enough to read

			Also good to know that you can apply for a learner's permit twice. So if you don't want to pay for Grundkurse, or don't want to go for the exam and just ride for 4 or 16 months only in CH, you can do it once, and the next time you have to go all the way. I read that in a driving instructor's webpage (I think it was Florin), so take it with a grain of salt, but it does make some sense.

			Where I lived in Zurich, they had two underground bays in which to wash your car.  I'd do a wash and wax in there quite often.....   
For major servicing, I do it when I'm in the UK.  For the cambelt on my car, it paid for itself doing it in the UK.  I've also had parts of the suspension replaced and as the wheels were off, pads were £35 or something.  It takes 30 minutes to do pads if you're slow.....with a trolley lift and the right tools, I'd say 10 minutes.

It has relatively high KMs (120,000), has had a hard life (boat club) but has had a new engine, gearbox control unit and a great deal of suspension components.   
In my hands the left exhaust gas recirculation valve is a little sticky (but is technically covered by warranty) which puts the car into limp mode - which a restart corrects (even at 130kmh - neutral - ignition off and back on - drive  ). Fuel economy is 11l/100km in mixed driving - which isn't exactly great for a diesel - albeir breathed on to 223ps/550nm   
Saying all that, it is however a magnificent piece of machinery. It is utterly regal and relaxing on the motorway - up to sensible cruising speeds. It will tow huge loads without breaking sweat. The interior feels bulletproof (except for the stereo buttons - known Disco and RRSS issue). The seats are excellent and the stereo (Harman Kardon Pro Logic) exceptional. It is roomy for 5 but as Carlos says not great for luggage space 7 up. Equipment levels are very good and the leather feels like leather. It also feels reassuringly British    
Despite the issues I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. And comparing against a friends experience with 2 XC90s - I wouldn't call the Disco unreliable!!

			Is there a road up to Wengen? Zermatt is also car free but there is a narrow road and you can apply for a permit to drive up for the day if you are moving etc etc. I would think Wengen would be similar. Contact the cantonal police, they would issue any permit.

			I recently imported my motor scooter from Malta, which was fully serviced prior to leaving Malta - an Italian brand Malaguti 125cc and it worked fine for the first couple of days, but then it suddenly died on me and I went to the only motor scooter shop I knew of in Kloten and the very helpful owner there, came to where it was and picked it up in his vehicle and checked it out, and told me there was an electrical fault which he unfortunately doesn't deal with. Does anybody know of a motor bike electrician in Kloten please who may be able to help me with this?

			My experience of this as at August 2014, Kanton ZH:   
1. Lost gray card (fahrzeugausweis) 
2. called the Strassenverkehrsamt ( ) 
3. they directed me to the form/formulare page     
the form is at the very top of the list and is called ""Gesuch am Ausstellung eines Fahrzeugausweis-Duplikats""   
Fill it in and mail, fax or email  a scan (info@stva.zh.ch)   
Cost is CHF15 (as I understood).   
if you have a copy of an old one, the Stammnumber is a 9 digit code e.g. xxx.xxx.xxx and you will need to know the number on the license plates (schild).   
All done in 10 mins, I assume i get a mail and grey card in the mail soon. 
hope this helps...

			Jessops, the group including the camera shops/retail outlets was bought last year by entrepreneur Peter Jones (one of the Dragons on UK TV) and is doing rather well now especially with the resurgence of SLR wet photography and diversification within to embrace the digital age.   
Regarding number plates, I have also wanted to find a VD number plate for my xflow engined Lotus 7 to replace the UK one (L7 XFL).    
The links above will be very useful

			We could both go to Germany, soon, & rent a car or van, for hire in say 4 weeks time (When sharing a car, both drivers must sign the rental agreement)    
Then in September I drive it to London, help you load the furniture into the car or van, and you drive it back to Basel, unload and then return it to Germany.    
You pay for the rental. I pay for my ferry and my fuel, I drive there via Dunkirk and DFDS ferries.    
You could save some money by offering to take EF stuff to London.   
My local garage has a weekly rental van for Fr 500 plus, about Fr 500 for 1'000 Km    
see HiAce van on page 2,    
See page 1 for ""Older cars"" @  Fr 250 per week... how big is the chest of drawers?  
The distance between the wheel covers in the boot will be limiting, or can it be lifted up higher?

			I can communicate in French or German, just leaving this as a last resort because it is mentally demanding when I talk in either of them (structuring the vocab and sentences etc.. in my head) which could be a little distracting to me if driving. That is why ideally I would prefer an English speaking instructor.    
By the way, written tests can be taken in English in some cantons.

Lost my plate a few years back in Italy, made a report at the Carabinieri, mad a cardboard plate, and had no problems.   
Also, you will need the police report to get a new plate, which will be a new number as your old number will be blocked for 7 years (bummer if you paid 10k for it).   
I also forgot my plate once, but was able to sneak back into CH without being stopped.

			For decades we used to have our own emission and noise regulations, independent of the EU. Only with the arrival of bilateral agreements were we ""persuaded"" to go EU. In the pre EU days (1980s to 90s) motorbikes couldn't reach Swiss noise regulations imposed by the green-meanies unless drastically reduced in output power and ""overdrive"" gear ratios.  
Don't worry, probably not a single one of these bikes run as certified. Restrictions in exhaust and intake were removed and ignition boxes replaced with German ones. It cost you between CHF 300 and 400 to have such a bike (illegally) ""opened"". The bikes type registration papers can only show the legal output at the time of model's type certification.

In dry conditions it's not too bad and you can just ride over them, but I found that it helps to just evade them reflexively whenever safe to do so.

As for the instructor recommendation, I went with this guy:   The website is in german but he speaks perfect english and is very-very good! When I did the ground course it was with just two other people and the whole thing was in english. He goes to great lengths to teach you all the stuff, but will also try and make the whole learning experience an adventure and fun (with safety in mind). He does not hesitate to point out mistakes that people make, but in a manner such that you don't lose confidence.

			Just to add a little more detail...   
A UK (or other non-neighbouring country) qualification (ICC with CEVNI) is valid here if 
a) you are a tourist and not resident in CH and 
b) technically for the first 12 months you live here (analagous to the driving licence) 
[Having said that, I don't know of any boat rental outlets that will rent out boats without a Swiss ticket]   
It is NOT valid if you take it after you became resident in CH - the same goes for any other country's qualification - even the neighbouring country qualifications can only be swapped for a Swiss ticket if you acquired them before you moved to CH or while you were resident in that country for a minimum of 12 months.   
It's why I had to do my D-Schein from scratch despite holding a commercial Yachtmaster ticket and instructor ticket.

			On   you can usually buy online only international tickets originating or ending in Germany. For Basel-London you could try Basel Bad Bf - Bruxelles-Central - the prices of only a few connections will show up, some of them being 'Sparangebote' (discounted tickets). Then you can try Brussels-London on eurostar.com. Alternatively you could try to find two seperate discounted tickets connecting Basel to Koeln or Frankfurt and then Koeln/Frankfurt to London on bahn.de. Alternatively you could go for Basel SBB - Paris - London for which you could check discounted tickets for the whole journey on   There you can even book tickets for a direct train Strasbourg - Moscow   (although not discounted, for this you could try to go to bahn.de for Basel-Warsaw and try to book Warsaw-Moscow through some Polish travel agent e.g.  ).

I am aware that the difference between Swiss petrol and LPG prices is tiny, yet I reckon LPG is going to be interesting for me in my road trips through France. I love that car and selling really is not an option. Maybe I am being too fussy. Who cares? With a ""Swiss"" salary, I'll just have to work for two weeks to earn my emissions certificate.    
Does anyone know about the intricacies of having an LPG-vehicle registered in France?

Parking your bike just next to Langstrasse or Hardstrasse is not recommended. Too many foolish drunkards.

fixing high emissions on a modern car (post 1996) is truly a nightmare

			Another follow-up.   
Went to the Strassenverkehramt this morning to get the paperwork checked. They kindly told me to go to the Fahrzeugprüfung building next door to get the paperwork checked.   
Handed all the documents to the them then waited 10 minutes for them to check the documents. Everything was ok. An appointment was made right away. (Actually, they asked if I'd like to have the car tested right away or this afternoon but I had a meeting at work so they kindly booked a new time for me next week).   
Process is pretty straight forward so far.

			The region Grosse Scheidegg to Murren is well worth visiting!    
The Jungfraubahn railway is a private company. The trains are very  
crowded, expensive, and much of the ride to the top is in a tunnel,  
so for sometime you see nothing but anxious Asian tourists.    
The Jungfrau company does not recognise national rail passes and so   
the national railways do not accept theirs.        
Personally I would go to the top of the Schilthorn instead, and use the money  
you save for trips on scenic railways in the east and south of Switzerland.                         get a seat on the south side of the carriage!       - hundred valleys            "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2014	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Train Passes Question	pschaefer04	Posts: 5

			Good news for us U-Abo customers, looks like we can use the no. 8 both there and back without having to buy cross-border tickets. Should make my trips to Marktkauf a little less arduous when carrying a backpack and a shopping bag in each hand...   
All starts in mid-December 2014, with tests runs from Sept. 29th onwards.   
""U-subscription *: 73 CHF for individuals who  
have their tax residence in the TNW area, 98 CHF for all other  
* The U-pass is valid in cross-border traffic exclusively on the tram line 8""   
Now, why can't they do that for France and the 38 bus to Whylen (Gleusen stop for Hiebers) ?

			Going all the way up to st.moritz is covered by the GA.   
Here is a map for your GA with explanations , where you can travel for free and where you get 50% discount (and pay the other 50 %)       
If the line (any colour) is dotted(for example from Wengen to Jungfraujoch) you have to pay 50% of the normal fare(your GA is not valid on this route)  plus have 
the GA (to go to Wengen).

			Hey y'all!    
Let me quickly introduce myself: my name is Pim, 24 years old and originally from The Netherlands. Having lived in the USA and Germany, I got a job now in Basel, Switzerland.    
Having driven a Honda CBF600 the last 5 years, I recently bought a Honda CBR600F from 2011.    
Anyone out here in the Basel region interested in driving together?  
Maybe there's enough interest to make a nice group!    
Cheers,-

			Just wanted to give all of you the exciting conclusion to this adventure!   
The passes arrived in the mail today, which is exactly when they said they would.  That was good.  From here though, things went a little bit to pieces.   
The nice lady at the BLT said I should be able to hold up my pass to the machine and I would be able to pay at any green tram ticket thing. I did that.  The amount came up - it was wrong.  The price it wanted me to pay was 30 CHF more than what was on the pay slip - it wasn't taking into consideration my 30CHF new resident discount.  I'm thinking now that the 30CHF discount is just a skill test - can you actually work your way through the system and get the discount?  Read on!   
So I marched up to the Post Office, went in, got my number, waited.  They told me I could pay this annual pass slip there but not with my American debit card.  I had to get cash.  Ok.     
Out I go to the cash machine.  In I come back, get my number, wait.  Here is where it gets hard.   
The guy at the Binningen Post Finance takes my pay stub and tells me it is wrong and puts a big, fat stamp on it saying it's the wrong price for a tram pass, voiding my hard-earned payment slip.  Rats!  I say but wait, it's the right amount! He says, no, it is too much.  They are making you pay a full year but it only a half year.  No matter what I say, he won't let me pay it.  Ironic, yes?  So he tells me I have to go to Heuwegge to sort it all out.   
Off I go to the tram.  Get off at Heuwegge.  Wait in line behind a shed load of Aussies all on field trip of some sort, all wanting some kind of weekly pass.  Wait.   
Again, have I mentioned that they are super nice and helpful at this office?  The lady takes one look at my voided, special price ticket, asks which post office did this and hops on the phone.  It's vigilante justice, Swiss style!  She explains to me that this is a special price and now the dimwad (she had a cool word, I wish I remembered it) at Binnigen post had ruined it all for me.  Ruined it!  But she was going to ruin him for being such a twat.   
Needless to say, after first telling me that she wouldn't be able to help me because the guy had wrecked my discount pay slip, she got it to work!  I wish I knew how to say ""I love you for kicking ass and getting this done for me!"" in Swiss Deutsch.  She was awesome.     
And, at the end of it all, I have my annual, pro-rated, discounted Tram pass!  Watch out Basel!  Here I come!

			Hi,   
We're moving from the UK (London) to Switzerland (Zurich) beginning of September. Is anybody moving from Switzerland to the UK at that time and wants to share the van? We're flexible with the dates. Any date between 01.09.2014 and 08.09.2014 would work. The van we're after is something in a size of a Sprinter.   
Happy to hear from you!   
Best,

In another thread, the environment sticker for driving into town centers of Germany.  
Similarly in Milan you need an ECO pass, to drive in the center.    AREA C (A pollution charge, formerly Eco-pass) is levied in the centre of Milan.  Charges    apply Mon-Fri and generally from 7.30am until 7.30pm.  Drivers must purchase an eco-   pass before entering the restricted zone.     Tariffs vary according to the emissions of the vehicle   . Mopeds and motorcycles are exempt.

			I recently sold my motorcycle to someone in France and the process was straightforward enough.   
Had the vehicle documents, Certificate of Conformity but I checked out the following website;       
Link at the top of the paragraph for a pdf which explains the export from Switzerland for you.   
The only thing I didn't realise for France was that the buyer needed to be present at the border to collect it, I was not allowed to 'deliver' it. I had to get a letter of authority from him allowing me to deliver the bike to him and of course pay the all important taxes on the motorcycle.   
I'm not sure if there is a similar issue with Austria but maybe worth checking. For the export/import part I used one of the freight forwarding type companies at the border and they handled all the paperwork.   
Hope this helps.   
EDIT: I had an issue with regards to the valuation. The bike was not worth much but they didn't believe the valuation I gave - the French side just had a booklet with average prices and I would have had to pay taxes based on their value. If you feel that your car is under valued (more than usual km's) then I would suggest that you get a valuation from a garage so you don't have any dispute over it!

			New and used prices in Switzerland are steep - but importing won't save you much money due to duties.   
The best bet is for them to rent in an EU country for the length of their visa. A rental has backup should something go wrong.

There was no change. The GA/AG  valid between Basel Bad. Bhf and Lörrach. You need to buy a separate ticket but you will get a 25% discount.   
It is valid on Brig/Briga - Domodossola - Locarno route as the railroad sections between Simplontunnel, Iselle, Domodossola and Ribellasca (VB) / Camedo (TI) are technically part of SBB-CFF network and are thus maintained by Switzerland.

It's really not complicated & most advertisements state no guarantee. Some dealers will sell a guarantee, however it's only insurance for some items, so I have never bothered to pay for one. 
In CH the definition of an accident is probably not what you think, it may have extensive accident repair work & be accident free. Best look at panel gaps which is a huge give away. Very few 3 year old cars for sake will never have had any scratches or superficial damage repaired in any case. So just look for high quality repair work.

			depends how big the cropper is doesn't it?   a friend lost his keys to his U lock  some abus "" top of range"" thing with a 10 security rating      
we had it off in under a minute with big  42"" croppers, U locks are case hardened which is good at stopping a saw etc but when cropped it shatters making life easier.     
this was in the centre of Zurich  and no one said a word btw.      
but anyway if someone is serious about stealing a bike with a U lock they use a porta power hydraulic jack unit or as most posts etc here are bolted to the ground just unbolt the pole  or bike rack and dump it in a van for later.      
pay your money and take your chances at end of the day.

If you book online even if only a day in advance it will be cheaper.  If you book in advance a week or 2 usually one can find a much cheaper price, depending on time of day/night.   
We prefer the route Dover-Dunkirk & like the relaxing 2 hour sailing in nice comfortable ship good views.  Some times of day it might be more crowded. Late ferries not usually crowded.       
Shopping on the ferries is expensive, usually cheaper in France, but wonder around it & maybe get a newspaper.   
There is a restaurant and one or two separate coffee/bar areas with snacks   
have both Calais & Dunkirk on their website

I once realized that I took the truck nozzle because I couldn't fit it into the fill pipe. Since I had already paid (self service), I couldn't change the nozzle, I had no other choice than pressing the nozzle very hard against the filler neck and squeeze the trigger lightly.

			Hi all!   
So I just ordered a scooter (125ccm) from Germany, that is being delivered to   in Weil am Rhein.  Do I need temporary tags/license plates in order to declare it (and pay the fees) at the border and to drive it home?  I did google info on temporary exporting plates from Germany (which brought me to these websites:   and  ), but these are dealing with cars and not scooters.  Can anyone of you, with experience in this matter, point me in the right direction?  Thanks so much!

			We got the Swiss drivers license!!!   
California was useless as we called the Dept. of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and waited on a 2-hour hold before being told we'd need to come in person to get a driver's record with an original issue date. When I explained we were out of the country, the rep provided a special phone line that ended up being a non-working number.   
I ended up going to the Strassenverkehrsamt and pleaded my case that my wife has been driving for 20 years. I brought an older license that showed an issue date of 2 years and 3 months ago. They must have took pity on me as they agreed to issue the license without any testing or classes.   
The whole process, once I found the proper counter, must have taken all of 15 minutes -- a hell of a lot better any any time I've ever visited the California DMV.

I was in Switzerland about a year ago and I had a 1/2-Tax and Gleis 7 travel card. I'm soon returning to Zürich and would like to get them again. The problem is that I turn 25 just before arriving.

			I have prepared several cars here in Switzerland myself, this is the first bike. The engine and forks are completely oil tight. Hub seals as well too. It is only dust covers on the forks, and the numerous dust covers you get on an enduro, but perhaps not on a normal road bike.   
I am wondering if I need to pull the split dust covers off the forks, and bin them, just leave it bare (no dust covers)? The seals underneath the fork gaitors are intact.   
The tyres have a very itzy super shallow surface cracks starting at the base of treads. This is minor and would be regarded as cosmetic in the UK.

			it will either come, or it won't. Maybe they have a threshold to avoid having too much work from people appealing the fines, maybe the thing takes a pic only of the front of the car and it didn't see the plate, maybe it will come in 2 months, or 2 weeks.    
No need to stress about it, especially since you're in the fault. Just keep 250 CHF in the bank if you're counting pennies.

			My experience with AZW was on the whole positive. They are very much no frills, no nonsense with paper-thin margins and brusque sales staff,  so go in with a thick skin and you should be fine. The basics in terms of warranty will be adequately handled, but things like test drives will need to be arranged in advance, especially on busy days.  
Don't bother trying to haggle since they will just wave your offer aside, they know they are the cheapest.

And it is valid for all single tickets on the TNW/BVB network.   
And it concerns only singele tickets, aka one way rickets, aka short time restricted tickets.    
Any day ticket or 24h ticket is anyhow valid for the valid zones the entire time of the valid time period ;-)   
And no, it is not about casual and laid back attitutes, but based on the old concept of a single ticket from train journeys (and still valid for trains). The TNW/BVB network introduced the zone concept only recently!

			Ok, I have found a potential scooter... Seller speaks no English and I no German but Google translate is helping. He says the scooter has no licence plates (""Wie holst Du den Roller ab? Fahren darfst Du nicht, da kein Nummernschild daran ist. ""). From reading around I understand that this is normal. So it seems that I will need an insurance certificate and some paperwork from the seller. Can anyone point me in the direction of exactly what this paperwork is? I obviously want to make sure that he gives me the correct thing and that he really owns what he's selling. Any links explaining the process would be great.   
I have proposed to the seller that we meet at the vehicle place and do the sale there.   
Thanks in advance!

			I'm afraid this is the case- you can drive in Switzerland, but not go over the border. We didn't know this, and I often lent my car to sil and daughter when over from UK. I've asked about it to the customs' officers, and they said it was OK as they know me and the car, so they didn't stop them. They told me to always warn them in advance, in case there is a new officer at  the border- and to always tell sil and daughter to speak to the Senior officer on duty if ever. Our other daughter used my car for 3 months over the border practically every day, on her UL licence- but again she only got away with it as every officer knew the car and who she was (and one of them really fancied her, lol).

A look at all the gaps between panels, this  will tell you a huge amount about a car, if they are all fit perfectly it means if any repair work has been done it's been done to a very high standard.

			I would avoid the metro with heavy bags (especially if you have more than 1).  Almost got a nice gentleman ""helping"" me with one suitcase, while getting a second one through those awful ticket barriers. And by helping, I did mean ""attempting to nick""!  You will be okay at Gare du Nord, but not sure about Gare de Lyon (where I think the train from Basel arrives).  Worth taking a taxi perhaps, but that will just add to your costs.     
Why not take Easyjet from Basel to Gatwick where, you can always have a big bag for irregular items (trekking poles, etc) and a normal size suitcase.  Then train it from Gatwick to Southampton.  Or get someone to pick you up at Gatwick ;o)

			Hi everyone. 
I'm moving a lot of my stuff to Vienna this weekend (Friday June 27 until the following Monday) and am looking into finding a transporter or van. Rental companies normally charge by kilometer for such vans (especially if you take it for more than a two-day weekend), which makes that cost-prohibitive for me.    
However, I see hundreds of vans/trucks/trailers driving around the streets. Does one of these belong to you? (Basel area) If so, and if you'd be interested in renting it to me Fri-Sun, I'd love to hear from you.    
Otherwise, perhaps someone knows a place where I could rent a kilometer-free van in France/Germany/Basel area?   
Btw, I'm moving one room of stuff, not a whole house, so I don't need a huge moving van, just something manageable.    
Thanks for your ideas!

			As an insulin dependant diabetic I had to be certified OK to drive every few years in the UK. Now with a Swiss license I have to get a form filled in by my doctor every year to confirm I am still fit to drive. This is never a problem, just time for the appointment, cost for the doctor's time (which, since it is a medical exam I would get done twice a year anyway so the insurance pays) and CHF100 to the Kanton (Zürich in my case) to pay for the admin. May be different in Vaud of course.   
Initially when I filled in the form to exchange the UK license for a Swiss one, I had to admit to the medical condition and was sent straight off to my doctor with a form. x years left on your UK license doesn't count and UK doctors won't be accepted by the Kanton to fill in the form anyway (here in German).   
It's not too much of an issue if you are fit to drive, just takes some time & effort. The only annoying part is that as soon as they agree you are fit, they send you the form for the next year which needs to be filed and remembered!

			I travel regularly first class from Basel to Luzern and back and I've never had any trouble. I tend to take the slower train that just does Basel<->Luzern, so I avoid the annoying folk on the Basel-> back of beyond service.   
I don't know about being rich - it's 56CHF return (with 1/2 tax) which seems not unreasonable. It means I really can work on the train.   
So my guess is that it's just the route you're using.

			well, the 150 CHF is the reifendirekt price for goodyear eagle assymmetrics. they're only a couple of months old, so, if i had to buy, i thought it would make sense to get the same one. (well, i didn't get the reifendirekt.ch insurance, which apparently pays for overnight shipment of a new tyre and its replacement)   
the tyre was losing air, so, had to be fixed. i popped up at my usual garage, and they kindly took it and fixed in half an hour's time (without appointment). though, funny thing, just after i got into my car and turned the key, the dashboard started signaling 'change engine oil'   now that can happen obviously (and it did pop up at 31K kms before, and another ~31K has passed since), but, maybe i am just too cynical at times ;-) another few hundred bucks to be transferred to some other hardworking people soon, i guess...

			The process with a bike should be the same as with a car. When I sold my car, as soon as we had agreed the sale, I took my plates back to the local driving place and handed them back. The new owner gave me a deposit, took the grey card and got himself a set of plates from his canton and wired me the rest of the cash. He then came back, put the new plates on the car and drove it away.   
Unless you have access to a trailer, this approach seems a lot easier to me.

			If it was easyjet, then don't hold your breath. Forget about getting the 250 euro compensation too, as there are way too many loopholes. And I hope that you have the world's most accurate expense receipts to submit if you need to claim additional expenses.   
I'm speaking from bitter experience. easyjet  cancelled my flight back to Basel in March, which required an overnight stay in a hotel, food, a different flight to Zurich and train home from there. After 6 months of arguing and general incompetence, I got money back for the flight, train and food; but not drink (could not prove it wasn't alcohol, not that it was and not that it should matter), and only 60% of our hotel bill (even though this was the only hotel we could stay at).   
OP- don't get your hopes up about any compensation- it won't be worth the time and expense to try and justify it.

The guy who did the work from a garage at his home sucked his teeth, chewed his pencil and spent ages pondering if he could fit us in.     
In the end, it cost 300 Zloty (about 90 chfs) and his work was first class.

When I was over at Easter, my mum had rented the car for me online with her credit card. I picked it up with my (Swiss) licence and they used my credit card for the returnable 80 quid deposit but the cost of the rental was paid for with a credit card from a different person with a different name who wasn't there at the time of pick up.   
Having said that, it's never a good idea to chance it, just make sure you've got all your documents in line.

I wanted to give my old car to my mother and had to give up, it wouldn't have been a ""gift"" at all unless I also offered to pay about 3000 euro in taxes. We thought that economically, it didn't make any sense, my mother had already a car anyway.  
So I had to sell my beloved car here, for 5500 chf, a really low price for what was worth it because it was still a good car, but such is life.

			Hi,   
So I'm looking for a reasonably priced rental car company in the ZH area to rent cars for my company. So far we were renting them in Italy and driving to TI, but that is no longer an option and we want to invoice to the Swiss company we have created, so I want a local company.   
Hertz, Avis, Europcar have high prices for what I am looking for (30-day rentals).   
I have found   for the french part and    for Basel area, but twingos are too crappy, haha.   
There must be something between the super cheap twingos and the 1800CHF/month of Europcar and equivalent.   
Some e-companies with good prices ( ) are based in Ireland and do NOT issue invoices (seriously, I've tried everything with them with no success). It's like Easyjet, try to get an invoice with VAT details from them... impossible.   
Any info will be greatly appreciated.

			Hi, all.   
I'm thinking about relocating to Switzerland due to a job opportunity in Zurich. (I've recently posted in other fora on this site under the name NomadLawyer but English Forum made me remove the ""lawyer"".)    
I need to buy a left-hand-side drive car. (I'll leave my right-hand-side drive here in Ireland or the UK. It's on its last legs anyway.)    
Is there any benefit to trying to buy a car in a surrounding country and bring it into Switzerland or do tax penalties negate that?    
If buying inside Switzerland is the best choice, is there any particular canton that is better for buying a car, be it used or new?   
Incidentally, I typically try to buy a used car with low mileage from a reputable dealer. I prefer off-roaders like Land Rover Discovery, 4-Runners because I love doing road trips comfortably with the wife and kids. I also like the safety aspect of having a heavy vehicle. But most importantly, I like value for money (which, admittedly, is not great with 4x4 off-roaders), especially as I doubt I'll bring the thing back with me to the States when/if I move back, so I'm open to a sedan or whatever. Budget is up to CHF 40,000.   
Any insights on car buying in Switzerland are much appreciated. Thanks!

The website you need is   - or  .  it says you can get a 7 day ticket, valid for the whole of the TNW region, for 40.40CHF. You should also check the single ticket prices  , which if you're doing only a few journeys might be more cost-effective. You can buy   cards which gives you 6 one-way trips with a 10% discount.

			Yes, when it comes to train tickets and passes you can't take what jrspet says as the correct, official response.

			The crew should ensure (they're usually too lazy) that everyone has their seat upright during the meal service.   
Cathay used to have seats (I'm talking economy) that were in a kind of cocoon whereby ""reclining"" actually slid the lower half of the seat a bit forward and the top half down into a kind of ""slouching"" position I suppose - there was no movement of the shell it was inside so had no impact on the passengers behind.       
I thought it was a fantastic idea (trying to get out to the toilet from a window seat when the row in front are all fully reclined can be difficult!) but it seems more people disliked than liked them, so they've been replaced.

			A squeeling/howling noise affected by movement of the clutch pedal could also be caused by a loose belt (say alternator belt) which would also be much cheaper to fix. A slight change in the engine load (as in engaging/disengaging the cluch) can cause a loose belt to slip.   
According to the garage estimate, the remaining work (highlighted in yellow) is: 
Brake fluid 
Pollen filter 
Tie rods     
Koppelstänge: (tie rods) are a steering and not a gearbox component.   
Someone has also written ""Lambdasonde"" (Lamda / exhaust gas sensor) on the estimate. That could be relevant for the MFK.   
There is no mention of a catalytic converter. The brake fluid and pollen filter are probably not relevant for the MFK.     
If you are not a mechanic and you have an old car which is called up for an MFK test, you have a number of options: 
1. Ask the your garage (or a number of garages) for an estimate of the costs of preparing it for an MFK. 
2. Take it to the MFK first and if it fails, request estimates for fixing the problems according to the failure list. 
3. Simply ask a garage to prepare it and take it through the MFK for you. But only if you trust the garage and your car is in reasonable condition. This is what I used to do but I don't necessarily recommend it.     
If the car is not in reasonable condition, you may find it is not worth the cost of taking it through the MFK.   
Did you ask the garage for an estimate for getting it through the MFK or simply an estimate for a normal service because the items on the estimate appear to be mostly normal service items ?

From what you've said that still sounds like the best way to me. Get in touch with them and ask, they speak English and are very helpful.     
Zürich airport to Bad Ragaz will be about an hour and a half by taxi (way longer than the half hour someone else mentioned) and I shudder to think what it's going to cost. Your call though.

			I'm on the same boat as you, also doing my motorcycle and car license at the moment. Also looking for an English motorcycle instructor in Schaffhausen. I don't know how old you are, but if like me you're over 25 you need:    
-  The first aid course (I've already completed this, there are a few people who offer it in English in Zurich)   
-  Theorietest (when you apply for the Lernerfahrausweis tell them you need English and you can do it in Winterthur)   
After those two you get your L plates which are valid for 4 months   
-  Vehrkehrskunde course      
- 12 hours riding lessons (this extends your L license to 12 months)   
Within the 12 months you can take the test. I want to do it ASAP so I can ride outside the country.    
If you're over 25 you can get a 750cc right away, even on L plates. Let me know if you have other questions.   
edit: If you already have a car license you can get a motorcycle learner license right away and don't have to do anything besides the riding lessons before you're allowed to take the riding test.

			I only tried to buy one car once from autohaus otelfingen, but the experience was very lame. Engine was knocking, I checked the dipstick: no oil. Went back, the guy put some oil from a random unlabeled can in  , it was still knocking, then he tried to convince me ""they all sound like that"". I could literally hear it knocking from the cabin with the AC full on!   
In the end, even though I didn't really want to buy it, I was just curious if he'd budge on the (pretty high) price on account of the engine noise. Zero success: neither lower price, nor options nor some free warranty were an option for him.

			I am under an impression that it does not matter where car owner residence is? 
What matters is where the car is registered at(which country's plates it have), which was the case here I suppose?   
In that case you will pay  
a) import tax- if any  
b) yearly taxes 
c) minimum mandatory liability insurance (this can also be from any insurance  company that insures french cars ...). In theory can also be from Swiss company, well at least an Eu one.

			I would say as you are moving to Switzerland  , get the 18.44 at the border. Even if you plan to get rid of it later, it may be easier if asked about it if you're pulled over.   
I got the 18.44 form when I first moved to Switzerland even though I was on an L (temp) permit. The border guy said I didn't need to do it with an L, but as I wanted to get a parking permit, Basel-Strassenverksamt said I had to. A few months later I was involved in an accident in Germany and the car was a write off. I never told anyone in Switzerland.   
Not a definitive answer, but maybe help you decide.

			Here's a new idea for parking at Geneva airport. Last Sunday I needed to be REALLY creative. I turned up at 13:00 in plenty of time for my flight at 15:00. Except ... it was the last day of the Motor Show and every car-mad Harry in the region was looking for somewhere to park. It took 30 minutes to cover the last kilometer to the entrance to car park 1, which was full, as was 51, with a chap waving people away from the entrance.   
So, after some desperate creative thinking, I hit on the Mövenpick hotel & ICC underground carpark. Entrance is round the back, after the hotel entrance. Only 5 minutes on foot from Car park 51. They had 1,304 free places! Maximum fee is 20CHF per day. How good is that?   
Apparently there is a bus that takes you straight to the airport, or you can walk to 51 and get the free rental car drop-off shuttle.   
If there is a catch, I didn't find it. Worked perfectly for my two day trip.

			You could take it back, do the MOT and sell it there. Nobody wants a RHD car here, they are available but difficult to sell, due to insurance for any driver, and as you now know the MOT problems. Importing it is just not worth it unless it is very exotic.

			Blinking lights are good for (a) saving battery (b) being noticed and (c) letting car drivers know it's a bicycle.     
Blinking lights are bad for (a) letting people judge distance to you and (b) appearing to be part of legitimate road traffic.   
Personally, I use a steady light, but having a flashing light in addition is good.  Also OK for city cycling (i.e. where the roads are lit).

			Hello everyone,   
I'm living in Zurich since last November, and since my contract was recently prolonged until the end of August, I would like to take my motorbike here for the summer period  .   
Thus, I was wondering if there is some bureaucratic procedure to do this.   
I'm holding an L residence permit valid until the end of August, and I'm moving to another apartment in the coming days. 
I have an Italian driving license (A3 + B), and I'm the only owner of the motorbike. The insurance is an Italian insurance and I am the owner of it as well.   
Do you know if I need to do something special before taking the motorbike here, or is it sufficient to register it when I will cross the Swiss border?   
And, since it is not the newest motorbike in the world, I was thinking to park it outside...do you think it is safe? Consider that in Rome (which is far worst than Zurich in terms of stolen motorbikes/scooter) I already park in on the street with a steel chain and a lock......   
Thanks to everyone helping me!

			More comments, will try not to overload you! 
- Reliability differences between major brands much less an issue over past 5 years; go with the used car with best documented service records versus a particular brand (but I'd still stay away from French makes, and lean towards Japanese if you aren't the vigilant type on maintenance intervals)  
- Don't bother doing import, get CH certified car (price differences and extra time aren't worth it.)  Go petrol, savings from diesel for your needs are minimal 
- Look with autoscout24.ch or autoricardo.ch; I'd avoid the super dealers (like the one west of Uster)  If you do go to these, make double sure (in writing) that auto has ""Unfallfrei"" history 
- Even though you want to stay under SFr 10k price (very doable), spend extra SFr 100 to have independent mechanic look at it for obvious engine issues (esp. leaks if recently cleaned), brakes and linkages, frame or repaint work, etc. and make passing this check a condition of buying the car 
- Maybe be flexible on the sliding door, if not needed for handicap access?  We did just fine with baby seats and small children with wide rear doors on crossovers/small SUVs. 
Good luck, buying cars can be a fun process!

			2 lease cars returned in the last year - both times charge of damage = ZERO   
Scratches, dents, tree sap and any other damage is acceptable to be charged. Watch for leather damage, interior scratches, missing trim.   
It is worth working on the relationship with the dealer before the handback.   
Excessive tyre wear should not be charged.

			Hi guys! 
I need to find a good school which will prepare me for the practical exam. I was having driving lessons before but it was just 12 hours of pleasure driving with no information what to expect during the exam.  
I'm looking for a school located close to Strassenverkehsamt Zurich as they will probably know best how to prepare people. Teachers speaking English would be preferable but it's not a requirement. 
Thanks for any suggestions!

			When you arrive from geneve at zurich , it will arrive most likely Terminal A, the 
flights to the non schengen countries like thailand leave from Terminal E or D 
(more often from Terminal E), so you have to change terminals and go through security and passportcontrol , but the security is not so crowded as starting your journey here in zurich, because the security will be at a transfer point to 
the departure area.

			If it's any consolation I don't think that many drivers get through their driving careers without having a major smash at some point. The most important thing here is that nobody was hurt.   
I've had a couple of write offs that weren't my fault, and a couple of minor smashes that were. After the initial shock wears off, and the anger that you're now without a car subsides, you get over it pretty quick.   
It does sound as if you hit the brakes, the wheels locked and then you ended up possibly aquaplaning. The truth is you were too close, but what I will say in your defense is that the majority of drivers do not know how close too close is, and even if you do know and stick to it on a motorway then some other driver will probably jump into the space you've left - you can't win.   
If you drive an older car without all the modern assistive technology (in fact even if you do drive a modern car) then it really can pay to take a days skid pan training where you'll learn some valuable techniques in terms of how to handle a car in the wet, and how to identify when it's out of shape and what to do about it. Some of the things you'll learn are not immediately obvious at all, but when used correctly can really make a difference. It's also bloody good fun    
Anyway I hope you can soon put this experience behind you.

			I do believe prices in Germany are also still quite lower than in Switzerland. At least at last time I checked that was the case; since the Franc appreciated from roughly 1.5 per Euro to 1.2 per Euro they did not adjust the prices, and things are way cheaper in the Euro zone. Plays hell with the value of used cars here in CH.   
That said, I believe Denmark has the cheapest prices for LHD cars in the EU (without taxes), or at least it used to--I remember seeing an article about it. Long drive on the Autobahn for you...   
The UK, with the massive devaluation of the pound, is probably even cheaper. But cars there of course have the steering wheel on the funny side...motorcycles are another matter.   
In the US, last time I checked prices were still as if the Euro was US$ 0.82, so you could order a BMW in the US, pick it up at the factory in Munich, and pay about 1/2 the price of the same car in Switzerland. Of course BMW wants to rip off Swiss customers and make them pay inflated rates...and was fined about half a billion bucks for doing so, since as a member of the EFTA Swiss customers legally have the right to buy the cars wherever they want.   
One question--I want to buy an old, beat up car that my two small children can destroy, and the market for used cars in Germany is much bigger than that in Switzerland. What is required to do so? I need to get temporary plates and insurance to drive it back to CH, then pay duty at the border and register it here? Is it possible to bring Swiss plates with you and drive it back? I already have a car here, I just need a family car, so I do the ""wechselschilder"" (where I just put the plates on the car I want and drive it, and only need one insurance and registration). I spoke with my insurance and they said sure, no problem, I don't even need to deal with the Strassenverkehrsamt they do it all...so can I buy the car in Germany, bring my plates, and drive it back with that insurance? Well, I'll ask the insurance guys too  , but any help here is appreciated

			This would only apply for those that live in border areas and order from the neighbouring countries sites.   
I ordered a few items  from the de site for delivery in de as it was a lot cheaper in total inc fitting than ch- approx 120chf!    
I ordered 1 set of car tyres 1 set of bike tyres and 1 set of inner tubes .    
Reifen direkt has charged this as 5 seperate transactions rather than a single transaction so I had 5 seperate conversion fees.   
I still saved but its something to be aware of!   Same applies in ch,  each item is billed separately.

			I occasionally have over long loads and enquired at the local police station who were very helpful. You require a red flag if it extends more than 1 meter past the back of the car. I would ask there. There are load weight ratings for roof racks but I am not so sure they take into account the wind load so try and load it with more down force than up force when driving. If you want to be extra careful use a soft ratchet strap onto the grab handles above the rear seats, fit this with the doors open and they should close okay. Lastly with the straps, if you put 1 twist in them it will stop them humming when you drive.

Just a thought, how long am I allowed (I'm a british resident) to leave a car out there for whilst still on British plates? Because, I could drive it out at the beginning of the season and then drive it back at the end? That way it could be MOTd and registered in the UK, might be a lot easier... I read somewhere 6 months, and somewhere else that you could get the insurance for a year, but you had to go back to the UK for an MOT?   
Just some thoughts, what do you think  ??

			Hi guys, 
I really regret not buying the voie 7 when I first bought my half-fare card as I'm taking a lot of trains in the night time. My card is more than half-way through its life and I was wondering if I bought a voie 7, would it be at a discount price since it'd be expire at the same time as my half-fare card? I highly doubt it - they'll probably make me pay the full price and have it expire along with the card... but I figured it's worth asking.    
I assumed that the info desks at the train station are closed today so I thought I'd post it here. Thank you.

Get a bike that is suitable for your needs and fits you (comfortable to ride) get it serviced at least once a year and it will be an absolute pleasure .... Oh and get a decent lock as bike theft is a real pain here ..

Some bloke in France was trying to barge me off the road years ago but I a) could not pull in as there was traffic there and b) the cars in front were holding me up.   
Once the cars moved over for me, the car behind was 400m back. His once-clean BMW did not go as fast as my less fashionable Saab    
But BRAKING is simply irresponsible and illegal.  If you brake-test me on the highway and fail, I will use my onboard video to ensure you are prosecuted and you do pay for the repairs.   
So, OP, maybe you want to rethink your approach.  Care less about what is behind you and more about what is in front.

In South Africa we always have an indication on the road or a sign if you need to stop or yield at an intersection.  But in this case you could think you are on the main road (since it is bigger than the intersecting roads, and you are going straight, not turning) but you have to yield to the right.  That is strange if you are not used to it.  In short, in an intersection when the road from the right does not have a stop line or these triangles indicating they have to yield, you have to wait for cars from the right.     
I suppose the more official way to know whether to yield or not is to see all 'Main Road' (yellow and black sqaure on its side) and 'no longer Main Road' signs and know when you are the Main Road or not.  But since you can miss them, I looked at the road markings of intersecting roads.   
Good luck.

			As I mentioned above, if you take the 0.75 CHF /km and multiply with the amount of Km she expects do do for work you can very easily find out if it is good or not.   
If she will do more than 1000 km per month she would be better off getting no allowance and instead write all her km to her expense report. You have to check the Spesenreglement for the company though to know if this is possible.   
I suspect the 750 CHF is given because this will most likely give you little issues with the tax authorities. Any larger and the additional amount would simply be added to your income as normal income in the eyes of the tax authorities.   
But if she will in fact be making more km for work purposes, she should definitely discuss the level with the employer. It is possible to have the tax authorities approve higher amounts but depending on where you live you may have to prove this.

			Hello everyone!  
My uncle and aunt will be visiting us in August as part of their motorbike tour of Europe. We live in Lausanne city centre and have no parking attached to our building. Does anyone know the rules about using the motorbike parking bays in the street, for example outside Hug Musique? Are permits required and would you consider these bays to be safe? Otherwise, would it be possible for them to park their bike in one of the undercover carparks?

The problem with Switzerland's road network is that once you're outside of a city you have just autobahns and rural roads - there are no real what you would call A roads as you have in the UK. This means that when an autobahn is closed then traffic gets routed down narrow single carriageway roads which go directly through every village and town in the area - there are no bypasses. Chaos then ensues.

			Early sunny morning on the A12 direction Fribourg near the motel de Gryere, 120kmh on George (cruise control) I started yawning and than I saw either an eagle or hawk, dark brown color with white flying diagonally through the motorway passing my windshield at no more than 5cm distance    
The bubba was BIG, the wingspan was just tiny little smaller than my windscreen (Toyota RAV4)    
It continued on through the other lane where I saw some cars braking as they could see him coming, me it just appeared from my corner literally out of nowhere.    
Brown pants moments folks. I am glad I didn't kill the gorgeous bird but I am more glad those 2-3 kilo of combined over 200 kmh didn't end up on my windscreen.    
I do wonder what kind of bird it was.    
Well, can't complain really. 5 years here and over 250,000 km done on the motorways this is the scariest moment I've had on the road in Swizerland. It's kind a boring.

Carfix, Widegasse 4 in 5413 Birmenstorf AG (right after the Baregg tunnel)

Also available on Saturdays and in the evenings (appointment via phone). However, I am not sure how good his English is, to be tried out. ;-)       And just a comment about US cars and oil Change. It is true that in the past the oil changes were required much more often for us cars in the US which has to main reasons:   1. They use very cheap oil, e. g. 5w/10w/20 and that not even full synthetic (saves also money for the car producers when selling the cars)   2. They oil there is very cheap to buy, so better be on the save side as car company and with that get the customers more regularly to the garages        In the meanwhile it is also common there for the newer cars to have 15000km or 1 year oil intervals, although for some it just changed since 2010, example for the Ford Mustang.

			Hi everyone, sorry for not updating this thread on time but this is my experience:   
After about 50 days of the failed ticket purchase the money was back to my credit card. It appears that the amount was not ""charged"", but was ""on hold"", and after a certain number of days (check with your bank), it will automatically be released back.   
Hope that helps!

			Just FYI, if you have a folding bicycle, it travels for free. I have a nippy little Dahon Mu SL as a commuter bike, which has paid for itself three times over so far. (No I don't have bottle-bottom glasses and a waterproof map case hanging from a string round my necK.)  
The wife, with her overdeveloped sense of cool calls me ""King of the Noobs"", but funnily enough, a lot of Swiss have come up and made appreciative comments, asked how much it cost and asked highly technical questions about it (e.g.: Which magnesium alloy is the frame made of?) that I have no clue how to answer.   
Cheers   
Jim

Rotkreuz is not in a Passepartout zone, and Gisikon-Root is not in a Zuger Pass zone. So between these two stations you would be ""illegal"", even if you used the S-Bahn rather than the fast train.

			I think that of you go to any sbb office they can look you up on the system and issue you new one on the spot. I know when we go to our local ticket office to renew ours, they were able to print off a paper one with the exact same info and reference number, and the photo one is posted out a few days later.   
Obviously, you won't be able to sort it from the Italian side. I know for a fact that their ticketing systems are poorly integrated, having just had that explained to me by the ticket staff at Zurich....

If you think you would go into the city more like 3 times a week, check out the 9 Uhr / o'clock pass.  It gives you included transport in Zurich city and all the zones that touch Zurich after 9am on weekdays and all day on weekends for 81 a month (cheaper if you get a year, but who can plan?)

			Hello everyone,   
I have an L temporary permit until the end of May, and I was thinking on taking my car here in Zurich since spring is likely to come.   
Do you know if there is any special thing I need to do at the borders?   
And, additionally, do you know if or how I can get a parking permit for parking the car?    
Thank you

			OK, I am able to report back on the whole thing now I've done it both ways.   
The cabins are very reasonable - Club 5 gives you two sets of bunks and a single bed/sofa running between the bunks.   
The room's about 4m x 4m.   
You have two windows, coffee-making facilities, a lightly-stocked minibar and a small flatscreen TV.  It has HDMI on it, I don't know if you can switch to that source if you bring your own player.   
Your bathroom is a wetroom with basin, shower and WC.   
You can tell how long it is since renovated because you still use keys on these ferries (I used both).   
Onboard you have the usual things - top level (blue) has a quieter bar plus the cinema - middle level (red) has the bar, disco, shopping - lower level (green) has the two restaurants and a children's play area.   
It's all reasonable, clean, staffed with decent people.   
The Zeebrugge/Hull route is quiet, I've been on Rotterdam/Hull crossings with lots more people and lots more cars and trucks.   
It was also about £200 cheaper than the corresponding crossing from Rotterdam.   
I can offer two Club experiences from Rotterdam crossings to compare with.  The simpler cabin takes 5 people but has a double bed with a bunk above plus a pair of bunks on the opposite wall - the cabin's about the same size on both ships.   
The best Club experience I've had was a corner suite (Rotterdam) with lots of space - a living room, a bedroom and an entry hall (plus of course bathroom).  If I knew how to book this again, I would.....!  I think they're called Club Suites and they're only 2 bed though.....

			It's not automatic, you have to go to the Strassenverkehrsamt in your new canton. I think you take your new insurance documents (as you have changed address) and the title deeds of the car. Then you take your old plates off, exchange them for new plates. I think they make a new title deed for the car.  Pay lots of money for this 5 minute service, go out put your new plates on the car and off you go!  That's my recollection from about 3 years ago when we moved ZH to ZG.

			No I do not have the reduced liability, unfortunately. :-( Unfortunately, i hit the pole with the back side of the car. So the bumper is not even scratch, but the metal sheet between the heck-door and the rear passenger door is bent (also not scratched) and the left rear light has broken cover. Well, the pole is hit and scratched from all possible sides, so I was not the only one, who met it on his way. I also suspect that it is in-operative, because somebody bumped it before me. Anyway, I have sent en e-mail with all the photos to mobility and wait for the reply.

And, at the medical, the doctor threw in a couple of other tests (at cost) for cholesterol etc so a health check up every five years isn't such a bad thing.   
And driving a lorry is fun!

Luckily I had my original (expired) license from when I took the tests in BC, so I wrote them a letter explaining the expiry deal and provided a copy of my original license. They reissued me my Swiss license with the dates backdated to my original tests in Canada. So if you have or can obtain your original license you might have luck that way.

			Dear new_Switzerland,   
You can drive here in Switzerland with Indian licence provided its in english for one year from the date of your arrival here.   
After a year you cannot drive here. However you can go to Polizei and they will take your indian licence and will give you a temp. licence for three months during which you have to give a practical exam to get a swiss licence.   
On the basis of temporary licence you can drive anywhere in Switzerland so no worries. Hope it helps

			Hey everyone, before I post it to the popular carpooling sites, I thought I might find some interested folks here. Hopefully I'm not in the wrong forum section    
I'm commuting to Baden daily for work, and I was thinking to use the car. Trips take me 30 min from Bucheggplatz through Wenthalerstrasse, onto the highway. Public transport would be something around the hour-mark and is not much cheaper to justify the hassle for me.   
Time is parking to parking, and traffic is on the other way around, so not an issue. Return time is somewhere around 6pm, but negotiable. 
Thursdays morning I'll be leaving Zurich at about 10 or 12 due to other engagement (ETH).   
I usually leave a little earlier than 8am and reach Baden HB at 8.20-ish.   
I'm guessing participation cost something like 80-100CHF/mo (depending of how many people will come along) and I have 3 spots.   
The car is a big Lexus, very comfy, and the driver speaks English, Greek, and would like to practice his awful German.     
Any takers?   "	null	null	null	Carpooling - Oerlikon to Baden	guest	null

			Are you talking about this same car Nick wants to import? How much were the same cars in the same condition in Switzerland?    
If it was the same car we are talking about, even adding CHF1,200 (what's the tax rate? 8%?) could be well worth it. Not sure about dealing with the military plates thing though.

			Usually, yes.  Check with the hotel if you're not sure.  You'll be paying a city tax of around 2 or 3 CHF/night.  When you get to the hotel they'll give you a public transport pass to cover your entire stay with them.

Excellent service, as one would expect.

There is a huge flow as the motorways merge at Glatt - and that doesn't let up until after the Westkreuz - and even then it can be slow moving.   
If you can get through BEFORE 0700 you are OK - 0715 at a push.   
There is not going to a quick route to drive to Baden at that time of day.

			Well the deed is done .. Turned out the grey card for the new car was stamped, i just couldn't see on the photo copy..    
So the whole process to change insurance, cancel my grey card and register the new one in the service des auto took less than one minute!

2227	24.02.2014, 22:57	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: US	"    Nearly all of the trams in the Zurich network (the exceptions being the #10 and #12 to the Airport) stay within the city limit and can be accessed using the ""1-2 Zone"" fare.  So a day pass (assuming you don't have a 1/2-fare card) will set you back CHF 8.40.  As others have noted, there is no 1st class section on the tram -- so you only need a 2nd class ticket if you are planning on staying on the trams/buses.   
It's worth pointing out that parts of Zollikon are easily walkable from the last stop on the #4 tram (Bahnhof Tiefenbrunnen), but other parts are not.  So check and make sure that where you are going is walkable from there -- otherwise there are buses and trains that can take you further into Zollikon, but you will need a 3-zone ticket to do that (CHF 13.20).

			Hi,    
I am sure for a new car it is worth going to a Ford garage.  
You need to have it serviced with Original Ford parts at the minimum to maintain the factory warranty.  
It will make it easier warranty wise to have the service done at Ford. 
Actually my car until now was serviced at Ernst and König in Lorrach. 
They are nice people and certainly cheaper then here in CH.    
Point is my car now 6 years old and has 187'000km on it and there is little point in schlepping back to Lorrach for a minor service.  
There is a good independent garage on Zurlindenstr. in ZH that will do me a minor service oil change etc for ca. CHF 225.- 
This time its more convinient for me to do the service here. 
Maybe for a big service I will return to Germany.   
Rgds   
Eli

			Depends on the dealer - they don't really negotiate too much on price - BUT instead knock big chunks off after 6 months - until 3 years later the car sells    
In my experience getting the car for the ""right"" price is more important - and this is dependent on how much you trust the salesman/mechanic.   
I'd recommend ODUS in Matzingen and Pennella in Chur - both from whom I have bought older cars - which were delivered in exceptional condition - having had thorough services. In both instances I was happy NOT to negotiate the price.

			Hi!   
Our Seat Cordoba has pretty big problems (the spring and also the bearing are destroyed), and is at the moment in a Seat garage in Thalwil (about 10 km from Zürich). 
Just 2 weeks ago we spent a lot of money at the same garage, which is about 35% of the value of the car, and now we have got an offer which would cost even more - so it is really not worth in case of an old car like ours. 
The biggest problem is, that it is a big risk to drive the car in this condition, that's why we are looking for someone in Thalwil or in the neighborhood. 
If you could recommend someone, I would really-really appreciate it! 
Thank you very much in advance and have a nice weekend!

When you move you have to tell the council so that you can stop paying council tax. When we left the country they asked us for our new address, I guess to make are that your are not avoiding council tax. It's not de-registering as in Switzerland, but you do have to inform them.

			Yes. It has no effect on how you pay for the ticket.   
I think the yearly fee for the card & halbtax gets charged to the card itself though, so you will still get at least 1 bill/year from them.

			I changed mine over recently, including having my nsw one renewed because it as expired.   
It was all handled via the website and email, and remarkably efficient (less than a week from when the request was sent).    
I suggest you have a really good hunt on the Queensland website and see if you can work out how to request it online,    
For the licence renewal in Australia I had it sent to my australian address, where my parents duly posts it forward by registered post. For the statement with the date of issue, I'm pretty sure the rta faxed it at my request direct to the driving department in Zurich, then posted the original.    
Either way, the piece of information they need is the date when you first passed your driving test, which is not printed on the licence but can easily be requested.   
Good luck.   
My nsw gold licence was returned promptly once they received the statement from Australia, with a cute 'not valid in Switzerland' sticker attached...

			Hi Guys,   
I have an annual 9 o'clock pass for all ZVV zones. I was wondering If I wanted to commute with the train before 9AM, would I have to buy a completely new full ticket for the zones that I am travelling through or can I just buy some supplement that upgrades or complete my 9 o'clock pass?   
Does anyone have info about this? There is nothing written about it on the ZVV website. I honestly, think it is ridiculous as it is just a reduced price pass, why would I need to repay the whole amount.

			Hi! No problem driving the rental car in Poland on Your Swiss license and I find it strange that You would not be able to drive a rental car into Switzerland. I have driven my Polish car twice into CH.. Even if I was moving here with it, I would be able to drive it for up to a year.   
Driving in Poland can be aggressive, so be careful. Speeding is very common, as is overtaking vehicles even when cars approach from the opposite direction. It is understood that the shoulder should be used in order to facilitate speeding vehicles to pass. Police controls are beginning to be exchanged for speeding cameras, but if they do have check points, they can usually be found just outside the city limits (behind some hill, so once You see them it is already too late to slow down). Many drivers will signal with their headlights that there is a check point up ahead..

			As far as I know, you need to have lived in the country where you obtained your license with a primary residence for at least 12 months. If you have a full license (and are over 18 years old), you can then obtain a full Swiss license.    
Your girlfriend should double check why she received a learner's license if she and a full license already.

			Well now your car is running, go and buy a decent battery, if you wait until it stops again, then the Ford garage will fleece you. Your battery is 5 years old, it is a decent age and should be replaced soon.    
As I half explained, the electrodes in a modern battery is not a lead plate, but a paste of lead powder pushed into a frame. Over several years the paste falls down to the bottom and shorts out the cell. When the car moves, the vibration may cause the pile of silt to move, but it is very certain the battery will fail again very soon.  
A) Look in the car handbook for the battery rating Ampère/Hour Ah.  
B) Look also which way the battery is connected, draw a sketch for where the red and black terminals are.  
C) Look at how the battery is bolted to the car frame, often the black plastic has a ""foot"" which the clamp uses to keep the battery in one place.  
The above will help you choose the correct battery.    
Maybe just take the car to a small local independent garage, and ask them to fit a good make of battery.

			I also came from London, now work in Zurich and live in a small town outside of Zug. (Walchwil) My door to door commute is about an hour. One aspect that no-one has mentioned though is the quality of the journey. My journey is comfortable and efficient and feels like no time at all when compared to my journey (About the same time) in London. Zug is a nice place to live and because there are so many expats, integration is much easier and you can grow a group of friends really quickly. Best of luck in your move.

Insurance runs from the date you first need it to the same date next year.       I didn't find it so. The aerosol spray ones you just screw onto the filler cap and push the button until it stops hissing. The liquid ones are more common on larger-wheeled cars, which come with a compressor to reinflate the tyre, and are slightly more difficult, as you need to remove the valve and replace with the new one supplied, but that's not at all difficult either.

Then you accompany the owner of your future car to the centre des automobiles, and get the carte grise registered to your name. Which is possible only if the insurance has sent a confirmation that you are indeed on contract with them (they normally send the attestation straight to the centre des autos).    
A dealership deals with all those formalities himself, so you spare time and hassle.

If you're got kids then the ferry makes the journey a bit more of an adventure - and they get to burn off some energy.   
We've found over the years that the most relaxing way of doing the trip now there's two of us driving is to set off around 04:00am.   
You miss the traffic, the kids doze in the car for the first few hours.  We usually stop for lunch around Reims (kids are hungry by then) and get an early afternoon ferry (usually an earlier one than the one we've booked).

			Hi All,   
After being on hold for 6 months, the Zurich job is back on! I would like to resurect this thread to see if anyone wishes to share views on commuting between London and Zurich. I will be flying back to London Friday afternoons and back again to Zurich on the latest Sunday night flight. I have the family house in London and will look to rent very centrally in Zurich so i can walk to finance district.   
I would really appreciate hearing from people who do this commute or have had previous experience of doing so

			Hi, 
         I have tried to search the site for recommendations for a reasonable garage near Zurich without much luck. Most of the threads are quite old and I don't seem to be able to get in touch with any of the garages mentioned. I need to get my Citroen serviced (standard annual service but possibly also changing brakes and inspecting and potentially replacing the timing belt). The last time I went to a garage was when I first bought the car and it had a problem which meant I needed a new clutch cable for which they charged me 500SFr. Based on this I'm almost afraid to go back to the same place with the above list for fear of what they will charge me! I'm happy to go to Germany, but just some links or names that I could google would be great!   
Thanks very much, 
Cathal

When we were living in Basel, and I got a job in Zürich I went to get a 1st class GA and had a 3 year halbtax with about 6 months left on it. They deducted the cost of the remaining months on the HT from the cost of the GA. Also in the same sketch (of interest to Basel residents) at the BVB shop on Barfüsserplatz I was able to trade in my TNW U-Abo which also had a few months left on it.   
It may be you have to show a valid reason for wanting to trade in - e.g. you want to have a different ticket.   
Cheers, 
Nick

2339	10.09.2013, 19:15	A singular modality	Thanked 8,973 Times in 4,007 Posts	Location: Engelberg & near Basel	"    I imagine that the absolute nature of the offence, that is not giving priority to a pedestrian, was to remove the possible defence for the motorist that the pedestrian ""did not signal his intention to cross the road"" and where proof either way would be more or less impossible.   
As a pedestrian, I have, incidentally, witnessed two potentially nasty incidents on a pedestrian crossing in Thun in the last few years where the car driver was seriously at fault.   
Incident 1 
It was evening and there was a crossing by a roundabout. A driver approaching the roundabout stopped for my wife and I, and we crossed to the middle Island. There was another car approaching the opposite end of the roundabout at some speed, but we reasoned there would have been enough time to cross the second section of the crossing comfortably, so we began crossing. To my horror, it became clear that the driver of this second car, an older woman, had  not even seen the roundabout, let alone the crossing,  and was driving as if it were a straight road. So we were forced to run to complete the crossing in safety, watching as her car was thrown up into the air as it mounted the raised central island of the roundabout landing more or less on the part of the crossing which we had just vacated. It took another 60 meters before she brought her car under control.   
Incident 2 
On an another occasion, this time in broad day light, again my wife wanted to use a crossing, one with no island in the middle. There was a car coming on our left, quite fast, but we still had plenty of time so began to cross. Now, from the other end of the crossing, a father carrying one child and with another small child by his side started to cross and we all neared each other more or less 2/3 of the way into the crossing. The car driver made no attempt to slow down, probably reasoning he would have plenty of time to cross the section that my wife and I had just vacated before the father would get anywhere close. However, the small child previously at her father's side (and who the car driver had probably not previously noticed) suddenly ran between my wife an I into the section of the crossing which the car was just about to enter. The father ran and dragged her back just as the car was speeding by with maybe one or two seconds to spare.

			If you pre-book a taxi with child seats you may want to factor in some delay in arriving at Zurich when scheduling the pickup time. Monday mornings tend to be busy in the air as well. 
Alternatively, clear it with the cab company that the meter isn't running from your scheduled arrival time onwards.

			Volver,   
Save your money for Zurich, since the public transport system at Zurich airport is excellent: there are trains to Zurich main station nearly every 10-15 minutes (train ride is only about 10 minutes).  
From the belt where you pick up your luggage all the way to the train track  so no carrying of heavy luggage. Most of the trains leaving from ZH-airport have low floors (direct junction to the track). A piece of cake!

			I know that you shouldn't get used to the high standards of Swiss public transport and then find fault with other places, but let me pass on this Xmas anecdote -   
A friend had a coach ticket from Nottingham to London.  We arrived at the coach station in plenty of time, and a large display in the waiting hall was showing all departures.  All seemed well except for one thing - the display showed departure time/destination/bay number for all departures except the London coach which had no bay number.  This was a day when storms had disrupted travel in the south of England, and my friend said ok, there must be a delay and that's why they didn't allocate a bay number yet.  Well it seemed reasonable to me too.   
Time gets closer to the departure time.  Still no bay number, also no announcement.  So we go to the ticket office, queue up for service, and manage to get served just before the scheduled departure time.  My friend asks why there is no bay number for the London coach.  'Oh' says the agent, 'that's a different coach company and we don't put the bay numbers on the display, but you want bay X'.  Got to bay X about 15 seconds after the coach had departed.  Now you might say that this is at least a bit understandable if the bay numbers change from day-to-day and would require someone to do daily entry of the information.  But it seemed pretty clear from the agent and from the timetables posted at the bay that bay X was the regular pick-up point for the London coach.  It's just that no-one wanted to put it on the main display in the waiting hall.   
And that is why I think the Swiss should run the world's public transport...

Did you know the farmers? It must be tough for them if they depended on the animals to generate most of their income, because even though the animals are alive, they need a place to stay and the farmers are probably under extreme stress. Not to mention the shock...

How can they flag a car and then filter for it? Even if it´s flagged, how should the information reach the border official in real-time when crossing? I never saw that they have an in-ear device?   
The second crossing was in Konstanz at 22h00. The time between passing anything that looks like a camera which could have an automatic numberplate reader (is that it???) and the official took ~5-10 seconds...   
I always try to be polite&charming - it usually helps    
On a second note: During the Vignette-incident the official never asked for my ID. So all he could possibly have is the numberplate. As I told him (and was obvious from corresponding stickers) it´s a rental car. So if the guard would have wanted to flag anything, he should have flagged me as a person, and not the car which is with someone else by now?!

			Forclaz will be fine, it's not snowed for 24 hours, no snow tomorrow & it's open. 
It will be mainly cleared but snow (winter) tyres or summer  tyres with chains are fine.  I cross it very often, if it's open it's fine, I never used chains when driving rear wheel drive cars, it's an easy pass to cross. 
The Chamonix site says snow tyres OR chains, but that's for today! It says the same for Chamonix to Argentiere ! Tomorrow it may say normal traffic , who knows.

			No need to be sorry Retired... I agree. But as much as I love the Alps, I also love the softer side of the Jura mountains- and being born and bred here, know some of its secret places. Of course, the views of the Alps from the Jura are just amazing- although if I remember rightly you were quite unfortunate with the weather when you last visited.   
There is a Via Ferrata at the amazing limestone circle of the Creux-du-Van- but with restrictive times for opening due to wall creepers (the wonderful bright pink and grey tichodrome échelette, peregrines and other rare species).   
Hey I could take some of the Neuch EFers to the B&B, La Grande Peur dans la Montagne (the young owners, Patrick and Madeleine are locals, but speak excellent English and are really fun and friendly) in Evolène some time- your favourite place in the Alps if I remember rightly- with walks to the glacier in Ferpècle or Arolla- and a trip to Nax for fabulous views of the rest of Switzerland   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Dec 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Arriving in Geneva and need to get to Neuchatel	jullee	Posts: 37

			That's an excellent deal, it's a shame you are not in a situation where you can really make the most of it. I get a similar thing from my employer, although the amount is less.    
In your place, and if your circumstances allow it, I would splurge on a GA and spend a year of weekends discovering the country by public transport… otherwise get an annual Streckenabo for the two days a week where you travel to work, even though you probably won't be using the 900 CHF to the full.

			The 3-series is a relatively compact touring - so won't offer a huge increase in space over an A3. RWD brings a reduction in rear legroom.   
The trade off is that it handles and rides considerably better than the Audi offering - especially if you can move off RunFlatTyres.   
The double bubble dashboard isn't to everyones taste - but considering the latest ""tablet on a dock"" design that is proliferated through Audi, Merc and BMW it isn't that bad. Post 2009 models get a very slick iDrive. The 330XD is perhaps one of the best cars money can buy - especially in 245ps guise.   
On the Audi front - the 3.0TDi are excellent - but prices remain firm.   
There is an A6 Avant on EF for sale which looks ""nice"".

			Most of the taxis at Geneva airport are under     
(that particular page talks about bigger vehicles and I have seen that they do have people movers). I understand that the taxis have children seats available, though I don't know whether they have to be ordered in advance. There is a contact form on their website so you might want to send them your questions in advance. 
You don't say where you want to go to, Geneva itself, into the canton de Vaud, France, or rather further afield, in which case other solutions might be more appropriate. Note regular taxis in Geneva aren't cheap, a ride into the city is going to set you back 35-40 CHFs minimum

			My car is not the newest. In fact it is a VW Golf which is not far off 17 Years old. Often, when I return to it after say doing some shopping, I find that an eager potential purchaser has left a card under a windscreenwiper. Currently, I don't want to sell the car but I have recently taken to collecting these cards. Who knows. One day I might be glad of an interested purchaser. Now as a service to the EF members who are currently attempting to sell their cars, I am publishing my card collection. Naturally, I cannot vouch for the soundness of these businesses or guarantee that you really will get a best price, but anyway here you go . . .

			Please be aware that on the second Sunday in December the SBB, & all the railways, make small adjustments to the timetables.  
If you travel regularly it might be worth checking the timetable as new times and routes may be created,         
On 15th December the new changes will be made, there are big improvements at St Gallen,

			If you buy the car the sole trips after you paid for the car should be: From dealer to your place. Then from your place to the mechanic. Do not use it for your daily commute until it is fixed.   
A Totalschaden will not be in the paper. It is just a financial term which means ""reapir cost > cars value (before accident)"". Someone's Totalschaden can be someone else's bargain.   
Misaligement may not be detected by a simple test drive. I had a car which was visible missaligend but I did not feel anything unusal while driving.   
Police, accident and MFK, here is the law:    The police will inform the StVA/SAN if a car suffered sever damage in an accident or sees major defect during a control. From that, I do not see anything that it has to be in the cars paperwork. But when it is you know at least what you are up to.

			To add to this a little more:   
-   would have been bought from the finance company for between 3,500 and 4,500chf. When I last spoke with a dealer they were offering a MAX of 3,800chf 
- Fresh service (although one was last done in March), fresh MFK and Guarantee - the costs of which would be around 600chf, 100chf and 700chf   
So, it has cost the dealer around 5-6k chf. This gives you an indication of the margin dealers are running on cars.   
(It won't sell at this price - the dealer   get 9,000chf. Saabs, despite being really great cars, aren't loved in the market at the moment - and the dealer is ""brave"" taking it in)

			Even with the slightly higher diesel price compared to benzin you will still be well ahead due to the economy that diesel will give you. If you are doing around 20k a year then diesel will win out overall easily. The extra bit you pay per tank on diesel will likely give you 300-400kms more on a autobahn run when compared to benzin

			The SBB know there is a problem with the special day tickets ""After 9 am""    
These tickets are valid for ""one day all of Switzerland after 9 am travel tickets"", but can only be used on WEEKDAY trains after 9 am. The tickets issued by the SBB machines are correct, and the Internet shop tickets are correct. BUT! The smart phone app allows users to buy them for a Saturday or a Sunday, which is not allowed. So be careful when buying the after 9 am day tickets.

			Lidl has a special on   this week.  . If you are in a ski resort and the police say you need chains to get down the mountain, you will pay over CHF 150 for the same thing in the local garage!   
They have (the offer started today so don't wait for the weekend) sizes 70, 80, 90, 100. Each of these sizes correspond to a number of tire sizes (i.e. 205/55/16). You need to look at your winter tires for the number that is written on the side then look at the different boxes to find the one you need.   
And at the same time, they have a special on  for  . Easy to find a second car to boost you but best to have your own cables (and a smile).

			That sounds mighty expensive.   
However, I went to my local Ford dealer for some winter tyres (235/40 R18 95) and they quoted me a minimum of CHF1,900 for a like-for-like tyre. That was just for the tyres only, no fitting.   
The guy there offered me a deal for some 17"" rims and tyres for CHF1,600. He said the inch size reduction would not effect the performance noticably (unless I was thrashing the car around, in CH, unlikely), and come the Spring, not need to pay for swapping the rim from tyre to tyre.   
My dealer's based in Baar/Zug, so no idea if it's worth your travel, but there must be some mainstream dealer nearby wherever you are. They could be worth a try. Lots of mainstream dealers seem to have ""Winter Deals"" on.

			You guys are forgetting one of the most important components in the question about future CH fuel prices.   
Drum-roll please: BERN   
The Federal government sees the driving public as one of its major ""milk cows"". They are going after drivers via the highway sticker (vignette) and next they plan to hike the tax per litre to take up any of the slack that the   (driven by a lower US$ and lower world demand) and   (new cars in the mix) have in their revenue stream.   
So, if you are thinking about a gas guzzler, you will want to do your calculations on more like   than on anything under that range. Then, you will not be surprised when it happens.

			You may want to check with the ferry operator as we came back using the Hull to Zebrugge ferry this summer when I was about 20 weeks pregnant and I was told that they don't allow you to sail if you're over 34 weeks pregnant.  Same logic as flying as they don't have full medical services on board and its a 12-14 hour sailing.  You may be best taking the car on the Channel Tunnel.   
If you do take the ferry I'd recommend paying the extra for a club cabin so you have a proper bed - fold down bunk beds wouldn't be fun that pregnant!

			(somewhat) Related question: got a parking fine in Loerrach. I parked on a street where the meter was broken (covered up even) and there were no other meters on adjacent streets. Came back 2hrs later to a street where every car had a card under the wipers   Interestingly, the card isn't a fine per-se, but informed me that I'd commited a traffic offense and I'll get the fine by post as it wasn't possible for them to issue it on the spot because of technical reasons.

			Taking your question at face value, for used cars, it is pretty close. But first of all, if you live in Switzerland, you MUST import your car and get Swiss plates within 12 months. I am presently driving a German-plated car in Switzerland, but the lease expires in less than 12 months, so I am getting away with it. I still get abused on the streets, though.   
 If you buy from a German dealership near the border, you will probably save a little money and more to choose from, and they should be able to handle the import formalities for you. Buying a Swiss used car makes it much easier to buy privately, since you aren't importing them. On the whole, it's not a very clear-cut decision, but I would lean to buying a Swiss car, having my service in my country, and just fewer headaches all around.

Do you have a receipt for your recent purchase?   
when you first apply for Insurance on the vehicle you will not have a number plate, so the insurance will give you a temporary insurance using the number on the chasis. after you get the Number plates, you tell the insurance and they will update the documents   
there are different rules for vehicle over 10 years to vehicles under 10 years old.   
I presume you will also need to get UK MOT on it & again this will be listed by the chasis number, the DVLA will send you updated version of MOT with the number plate listed on it.   
I would suggest you get a Certificate of Conformity from the Manufacturer. 
as in our first case it was a pain to find who to contact at that time in Toyota, in the end we visited their Head Office in UK as got satisfaction by email or phone. I would suggest you find out who to contact for your manufacturer as soon as possible, as may take time or may be straight forward   
we had to have this for both importing a car into UK and the same for Switzerland.  at the border for Switzerland, the COC was most helpful, can not remember now, some question asked, had no clue, but answer was on the COC.   
Do you have a UK Driving Licence, if not, not sure what the rules are.   
found this         
we started the process for the car import to UK after arriving UK.  Once the process was started, had to have the car off the UK roads, so we got the MOT first & had off road parking.  If you need to do this, then if you do not have off street parking, then you can either rent a garage or you can rent someone private driveway.  a number of people rent their garage/driveway by the hour/day/week/month - there are various websites advertising and prices vary depending on area/location & might be negotiable.   
DVLA is the UK Department that deals with road vehicles.   
sorry do not know the link for UK Customs Import clearance.

			So, to finish off the story we decided to go with the easiest option. We borrowed a set of garage plates (the one with the U that can be put on any vehicle to move it from point A to B) and last Friday we drove up to Aargau to see the car.    
The car checked out so we went with the owner to the AG vehicle services centre (very nice by the way). There we signed the sales contract we had prepared, paid the CHF and he then cancelled the grey card on the car and gave it to us. The card is stamped cancelled. He kept the plates as they were also used for a second vehicle.   
We then dropped him off at his office and took the plates off the car (in CH, once you cancel the grey card, you have until midnight to get the car where you need it to go). We then put on the garage plates and drove the car home and parked it (important that if a car does not have plates it must be on private property or you will be fined). We returned the garage plates to the garage.   
Then we organized the insurance on the car (the insurance person enters the details in the VD vehicle service system so they have them when you arrive). We went to the local centre in Lausanne and cancelled the plates on the old car and transferred them (on paper) to the new car.    
A reminder, if we had had the old car with us (we did not) we would have been able to drive it home with the cancelled gray card and plates (until midnight same day). We left there with a grey card for the new car. The whole thing took 10 minutes of waiting and 5 minutes with the paperwork. At the same time they automatically cancelled the upcoming inspection on the old car.   
Since the old plate was the square version, we decided at the same time to order new plates - front and back (long version). In VD, it costs CHF 30 per plate to get new ones. It takes about 2-3 weeks. They mail them to you and you mail or drop off the old ones.   
Then we were left with the old vehicle (without plates) that we sold ""as is"" to an exporter.    
The new car goes in for a service on Monday so we know it is ready for the winter.   
Thank you all again for your input.

			Ok this might be way too train-nerd for EF, but over the last couple of days there have been NEW TRAINS on the S4 SZU line to Adliswil. Exciting stuff! I must admit they are slightly confusing though - painted red, like the Sihtalbahn, but with Uetliberg written on the side. Anyone got any thoughts on whether they're just testing them for replacing future Uetliberg trains, or did someone use the wrong stencil when painting them?   
Either way, they're nice to travel on and seem quieter than the old full-size trains.

			If youre considering to take your drivers license in Switzerland (specifically in Lausanne), I would recommend you read the below    
Personally, I dont speak a word of French or German, so I was very concerned if I would manage to take my drivers license here in Lausanne.    
I finally managed to get my license a few weeks ago! It was a fun journey! So now I want to share my experience and hopefully guide you in the right direction.    
The biggest advice I can give to you is to make sure you have a very good instructor, who is there with you from the beginning to the end. Its extremely important! You dont want to be switching instructors, and finding an English speaking instructor in Lausanne is difficult enough    
I can very highly recommend the instructor I had. His name is Jean-Marie Porchet and works for Ecole du Midi in Lausanne. Hes an outstanding and professional instructor that really cares about your development. He always takes his time to genuinely teach you and hes very fun to have too! Hes positive, helpful and hes there for you from the beginning to the end! Without his help and guidance, I would never have managed to get my license that smoothly.    
Also, hes very flexible when it comes to your schedule. I work in Geneva so he really made an effort to accommodate my schedule. Either we would drive evenings after work, or even on the weekends if my schedule didnt permit. He speaks excellent English, French, Italian and German, so youre basically set     
So if youre looking to take your drivers license here, I really recommend you give him a call! You can find his name and contact details on the Ecole du Midi website, but just in case his mobile is: 076 824 70 04    
Good luck and if you have any questions, just write me back!

			Parking can be a bitch in St Moritz so make sure you got that sorted out first. Parking tickets are expensive and the rental company will charge you for sure.   
If you are staying in a hotel ask if they got a deal on train tickets type snow and rail and stuff like that.

			ozone in french is l'ozone   
I went to Rentokil as they used one in a house I rented in which the last tenants had kept animals and made the place smell. They moved it round the house over a couple of days and it seemed to help remove the smell (after the floorboards and walls had been steam cleaned and carpets removed).  Unfortunately, you can't steam clean car roof liners or remove upholstery.   
However, the office ladies at my local Rentokil seemed to have never heard of a  ozone machine.  They only knew that they, Rentokil, installed fixed machines in certain well ventilated places. And they didn't seem to  be at all knowledgeable about why one uses ozone machines, so at least one of them thought I was a bit crazy.    
So that was close, but not quite.  I'm wondering if a more savvy member of Rentokil might know better.     
So if you've got a Rentokil nearby give them a try. Perhaps they've dealt with odour problems before and know what a portable ozone machine is.

It did make me ask the question here and the garage that supplied our winter tyres here said no problem.

			I have the prepay. There are fees for paying over the PO counter, and they take a little of money paid in as admin fees. But that is still less than credit card fees (unless you pay the entire, ontime, everymonth).  
It's useful to have charged for me as I have postfinance which isn't accepted everwhere, and for internet purchases.

But the commune basically forcing people to rent a private parking spot if one is available is something I have never heard of and I have strong doubts that such a rule would hold up in court. Honestly, this sounds like an idea that some local landlords and the local council came up with late at night after a few too many bottles of Féchy.    
Legalities aside, I agree with Anthony1406 though. Personally I'd go for a private spot, possibly covered. I only had to rely on street parking for a few months many moons ago and I wouldn't want to go back.

When can I expect the next MFK call ? I am told it should be after 3 years so I guess it means Dec this year.

			The more I think about it, the more I realize how frustrating the whole situation must be for both parties.   
As a driving enthusiast, I like to really tackle the twisties. Doubt I would be going 80 downhill, but definitely faster than 47. Still, it's not so much about the speed (or lost time) but the uncertainty. I'm uncertain of what the cyclists will do (and yes they were hauling ass side by side) and they're uncertain of my intentions. They had to do some major uphill climbing and this is their brief moment of bliss and it's ruined by other cars on the road.   
Ahh well...sharing sucks.

Getting other documents can be a nightmare. I had German, TÜV approved alloys for my winter tires and had a hell of a task getting documents which the Swiss would accept. At the MFK, they even made me take off a wheel myself so they could look at the code on the inside of the wheel. They kindly gave me a trolley jack, left me in the parking area and buggered off for lunch.

			Hello everyone,   
I commuted weekly to Munich for about a year and tried the bus out as it's quite cheap compared to the train (and plane!).   
 My opinion:   
- Zürich Munich leaving early is quite good. Few passengers, OK traffic, WiFi works in Germany only. However I had unexpected delays a few times because the driver turned up ca. 15m late.   
- Munich Zürich  leaving at 6pm or so is very crowded and markedly less pleasant.   
- Both bus lines are about the same in terms of comfort. The Allgäu Express wasa little better but not so much that I'd go out of my way.   
The bus stop im munich (ZOB) in Munich is easy to get to (on the Stammstrecke), likewise Zürich.   
Depending on your budget it's a good choice. My personal compromise would be bus there, train back, but for business travel the train is a clear winner.

			All I know is that on our BMW it sensors the wheels have been changed every season regardless of how particular one is about them being the right pressure. It is the suspension system that detects the change and it it takes it a while. sometimes. So you just pull over, go the tyre calibration part on the idrive and drive off again and it is happy for another 6 months. presupposing you don't have a puncture in the meantime  
We don't have run-flats so maybe there is another procedure with them - in any case RTFM and all will be revealed.

Does anybody know about the Bonusschutz in the car insurance?   
I bought my first car in CH and signed the insurance contract with AXA Winterthur in Apr.2013.   
Recently I had a very little collision on the back door and wanna fix it. My contract with AXA Winterthur included the Bonusschutz term, which says with one damage pro year my insurance premium will not 'upgraded' in the next year.   
Now I am just wondering, is the first round Bonusschutz expired on 31.12.2013 or next April (one year after my insurance contract)?   
For me, if this will be expired later, I would like to send them to the garage later, because the backwards parking is my weakness, I will expect the next damange sooner or later, and I don't wanna change the back door twice in one year....   
thanks.

			Our first Qashqai had a built in screen on top of the dashboard positioned in the middle and that was great.  The new one has it built in down by the central heating controls.  With the first you didn't really need to take your eyes off the road to see it; with the new position you have to look down and away so not as safe.  Would much rather have the old position than the new one.    Would much prefer the old sat nav system as well.  The new one may be low cost, but would have preferred to pay extra for having the very superior old version if we could.

			Thanks. 
I had no idea you could not use your own parts even with an independent garage? 
I have used Emil Frey in Lausanne many times when I worked in Swiss and had a company Land Rover Discovery which was always in the garage. Their service was overpriced and intermittent with quality. 
The other Question I have is my LC has had a suspension lift. Is this illegal in Suisse?

			I don't want to have a go at you because you, anyway, seem stressed out because of this. But quite frankly, you don't sound safe to drive a car and, as cyclist in Basel, this scares me a bit.   
I used to be the biggest petrol-head you can imagine (I used to drive between Basel and London every two weeks and loved every second of it) but I don't even own a car now. Life in Switzerland (and Basel in particular) is so easy without a car that it's just masturbation to own one.   
Perhaps you're worried about how you're going to transport your kid around when you have it; well there are plenty of options: tram, train, bicycle with a kid's trailer (when I first came here, I thought that was bizarre, but Basel drivers are very tolerant and aware of cyclists and there's a pretty good cycling infrastructure here - you see lots of local mothers transporting their kids that way).   
Anyway, good luck with your test, but I'm kinda hoping you go for the other options...

+ if you lose it, you can get a replacement

			Does it seem ridiculous that the searches I keep coming up with for a Friday-Sunday weekend trip from Basel to Paris by train is ~200 CHF?  Why was I under the impression that it would be cheaper than that.  I am going November 8th-10th and don't have a lot of flexibility with my departure times or dates.

			In Bern a neighborhood parking pass costs 264 per year. 
Information here:       
You can visit them in person or just send them the application form and you will get a bill to pay in the mail in a few days.   
Another interesting tidbit is that you can get a 24 hour blue zone parking ticket at all of the Bernmobil ticket machines. Can be useful for visitors.      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Overnight Parking Pass	Allison K	Posts: 1

			Hi,  
We have been in Switzerland since July and originally planned to register our car over here. We have decided against that now so need to sell our car preferably without taking it back to the UK.  
It is a Fiat Bravo 1.9 Multijet Dynamic Diesel.  It has a 58 registration plate, is mot'd until mid december. Tax has just run out but we will tax it for sale. It has done approximately68000 miles . Any offers considered in order to save having to travel back to the UK.    
Please pm me for any further details.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	uk registered RHD Fiat Bravo forsale	EmmaLD	Posts: 2

			Do you really need alloy rims for those tyres?  
I bought for my BMW 3 series 17"" Dunlops Wintersport 4D last month from reifendirekt.ch, fitted with steel rims and that's all I need. Winter driving isn't about driving nuances, it's about staying on road, on proper side, without accident.

			You shouldn't worry about km and age of the bike. My 18 year old VFR750 with 114'000 km on the clock passed MFK with flying colours before I sold it for CHF 1500. Engine and gear box like new, didn't burn a drop of oil.   
However, you're advised to check a few points: 
- drive chain and sprockets 
- front fork seals 
- head stock bearings 
- wheel bearings 
- brake pads 
- tyres 
- clutch (trial run in top gear)   
With current speed limits it's impossible to challenge a road rocket like the ZX-9, irrelevant of the rider's age. At least not on public roads.   
Ask the owner for past repair and service bills. Notice the owner's phone number and let the auction pass. Call him afterwards and try getting a better bargain.   
Another current auction on ricardo concerns a red Triumph Sprint 955 ST with half the miles of the Kasi for CHF 2500.-   
Regards 
Robert

My CH driving licence has not, it's dotted out, hence my original question. It's validity is based on the document I do not possess anymore so I don't have this info. The authorities probably have..   
Are you suggesting the EU state will stop the clock on the validity date of the licence they have issued to me in the first place just because I was out of the country for X number of years?    
Please clarify.

The conductor got on and I was fined CHF 80 for fare dodging.  I was mortified.   
I guess they can't be too flexible - for all he knew I could have been doing it every day assuming I'd get away with it and whatever excuse I came up with at the time (in my case, mumbling ""Sorry, I didn't realise"" whilst dying inside) could have been a load of bull.   
The forgotten or lost travel pass isn't such a bad thing as it's easily provable that, yes, you do have a valid pass but you need a little sting of a CHF 5 fine to remember it next time (or not chuck it away, eh abi_bouw  ).

			I am currently in the process of changing my car insurance. 
One of the options that you get with most insurers in the assistance option.   
Would this be a good alternative for TCS?   
In case I would need it, would it have impact on the bonus level?

Really annoying as half the decent is through partly covered tunnels which have no snow in them so bad for your tyres with chains on. I had an Audi Quattro with winter tyres fitted but absolutely no one was allowed down without chains. What happened to the people who were not allowed to leave, I've no idea. Perhaps they just waited until the police had gone.   
The chances of the police doing this must be small as it was the only time it has happened in perhaps 1000 trips into the mountains during winter. That was the only time I've used chains on a 4WD but carry them in the car in any case.

You need to contact the Road Transport Authority which has jurisidiction at your place of residence ( ).   
They will then give you a letter that you will have to send to the Bern office for permission to give the test in English in their canton and to fix an appointment. The Bern office then sends a letter confirming the appointment.

2896chf quoted by the other website ( =""http://www.fahrzeugmarkt.ch/autowert/""]www.fahrzeugmarkt.ch/autowert/[/URL]).   
For cars over 10 years old, the prices seem very unreliable or missing. For different EU countries, eurotax assumes different base KM per year, thus affecting prices. km is extremely important.

The license was a   of an Indian driving license into a Swiss one, and the canton was Baselland.

Almost any bike from a scooter to Superbike will happily run 2nd gear from 20Kms/h upwards unless the gearing has been tinkered with. My R1 can still go to warp factor without any problems in 2nd gear from 20kms/hour!   
1st Gear at 30Kms/h is fine but simply unecessary, especially under test conditions as it harder to control a torquey beast like the Speed Tripple when it's already comming into the band. (When you leave the 30 zone and accellerate from 1st gear, I doubt the instructer could keep up with you!) . Also, if you are riding the bike at a flat 30Mks/h, what the hell do you need any power for? Not accellerating or decelerating? Makes no sense.    
Back to the OP's rant; I think he was just letting off some steam so everyone give him a break! Everyone blows off now and then but no need scare him off! (Not seen any activity from him for a few days? Hope he's booking the next test!)

I know I'm a complete newbie and already here with an urgent question. 
We'll move to London this weekend and had an offer by France Removals which changes daily. So now I'm a bit fed up with them. 
Is anyone driving to London this weekend and interested in a shared van hire? 
Or anyone needing a van to transport stuff back to Switzerland on Sunday?

First, two days after the missed appointment, we got a second invitation letter via A-Post Plus (basically, tracked delivery without a signature).  It 'assumed' we missed our appointment due to some error (how quaint!):       
We were charged a CHF60- cancellation fee in addition to the CHF60- test fee.

Does anyone know of any free or cheap places to park in Montreux for four nights. Park and ride within a reasonable distance would be ok.

I need to change the plates of my 10 years  old (in very good shape) Spanish registered Renault Megane II.  
I am looking for a reliable mechanic in the Baden/Zurich area to do the pre-inspection and make sure that the car will pass it without issues. I just need the mechanic to speak English, French or Spanish (I don't speak a single word of German yet  ).    
Anyone can recommend a garage?   
Thanks a lot for any tips!

			You need the normal Eignungserklaerung as for any wheels. In fact, there are no ""winter wheels"", you can use them whenever you want    
If the germany company can't provide it, normally you can buy it at the importer of those wheels in CH (assuming they do import that model) for ~100chf.

Causing an accident while speaking on the phone is a grave offence and I guess they want to be sure that isn't the case.   
Imagine for a second, you're the responsible police officer.   
You investigate a scene in which a bicycle has back-ended a car on a cycle lane.   
What do you think is more likely?   
1) Cyclist didn't see stationary vehicle despite the road being straight and the vehicle being 100m away when it stopped, and drove into it at full speed?   
2) The motorist was phoning while driving and pulled over onto the cycle lane without looking back?

Full, unrestricted licence - yes... after passing the test you're on probation for 3y, where you have to attend two full-day courses. During this time you also can't accompany a learner driver, or - if you somehow manage to have your licence revoked twice in this period, you're back to square one.   
But for most practical purposes you have a full licence after passing the test.

			Apologies if the topic has been discussed in another thread but I could not find anything similar. 
I live in Kreis 1 and I am about to buy a car for which I would need to park within the public blue lines. 
I have understood that there is no blue parking available in Kreis 1.  
Where am I allowed to park? Would the price be the same as parking in my own Kreis (240 CHF yearly)?

			Before I went on vacation last month I looked up the websites of park n fly (based on the recommendation here) and also this one:         
I did not choose park n fly because it says that when you arrive, you still have to take a shuttle to your car (valet service is only for departure and not arrival).   
So I used airport parking instead: 
-Drive up to the departures area near check-in 2 and park your car at one of the short term car parks. Pay Fr.2 for the car park (for 15 minutes) 
- drop off your keys at their counter which is next to the info counter in check-in 2. Someone will drive your car away. 
-when you come back, pick up your keys from the same spot. 
-your car is waiting for you near the rental car offices in parking 3.   
The only small disadvantage is that if you have a lot of luggage, you still need to schlepp everything to parking 3 when you get back. On the other hand, with park n fly, you still need to put all your luggage into the shuttle, yada yada...   Price wise, it is only very slightly more expensive than parknfly.

Thought this would be a good place to post this as well.    
I just wanted to offer my services in automotive maintenance and repair.    
Can do anything from a simple oil change to suspension work.    
I have worked in a shop for 4 years in the US and now I do work on my own cars here in Switzerland. I have done work for a couple of members on this forum already. For very simple jobs I can come to you and do them on location or I can rent a space at a garage with a lift. Have worked on many different manufactures from Hondas-BMWs.   
I am located in the Zurich area.     
Please send me a PM for my competitive rates!

			Dear All,   
this is my first post on this such invaluable forum. I've read all the other hundreds about importing cars in CH found super useful (thanks!) but not definitive answers to my situation.   
I am Italian, I will move to Zug on Sept 23 with my family (I already have a permanent employment contract) and apply for a Permit (B hopefully..., as the latest update on EU quotas seems ok) on the same day. As I understand I will walk out of Immigration with just an ""anmeldung"".   
4 days later I am forced (I cannot go any other day) to pick up a used car my family just bought in Germany and drive back through the Basel border. The process has been perfectly explained here (german temp plates-->german zoll stamp --> swiss duties-->13.20A with stammnummer-->swiss insurance and so on with swiss registration).   
The car has 2-month german TPL insurance but no damage, theft, etc. covers. And my family is extremely *worried* to leave the car even in private parking without a full insurance cover.      
My worry: By the day I drive back I might not yet have received the final residence Permit (they take at least 1 week to issue, right?)    
* will I still receive 13.20A with all perfect car documents but with an anmeldung and a permanent employement contract, pending a B permit? 
*what happens if I stop at the Swiss border in this situation? 
*is there any way to obtain the B permit on an urgent procedure?   
thanks a real lot to anyone who could help!

			Hey,   
I own Tekna 4WD bought in 2010 (new). So far so (almost) good. I did 40k KM on it and I had only two problems:   
1. Problem with central lock. As a result I could not lock the car because there were some glitches with rear boot lock. Happened at 200 km   
2. Problem with transmission oil leak. Seems to be leaking oil near differential (rear wheels). Just saw the problem and I am about to visit a garage to fix it. Happened at 40 000 km   
Despite this I have some doubts the gearbox is working well. It feels glitchy and does not shift as smooth as in my previous Toyota Celica (20 years old car).    
But in general I like the car.

			We just bought a couple of Scott e-venture bikes - 2012 models so we got them at 20% off - but they were still around 2500 (each)...  I love love love my bike, OH got his for his daily commute when possible.  In my research, I found I preferred the Bosch drive system the best (we rented Flyers while on vacation and definitely prefer the Bosch over the Panasonic motor).    
I think good components, esp. brakes are necessary, for the downhill bits.  Not sure the v-brakes you'll get on the lower end bikes are up to snuff.     
We were considering getting our from Joos in the Bodensee area, but then found ours locally.  I know you are far from there, but they have a pretty good selection of e-bikes that might be helpful in your research.         
Have fun!   
Like I said, we love ours- I do as many errands I can with them (got 2 panniers for lugging groceries, etc.).   We live in a hilly area and the bike makes uphill a breeze!

Naturally the cover is red, inside the front cover are the 2 pictures of the car (cropped to size) - and the a sheet outlining the FIA Homologation.  Then you have a load of pages for the organisers to fill out the details of the races the car participates in.    	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2010	Groaned at 342 Times in 278 Posts	Obtaining a Swiss Motorsport Wagenpass	dodgyken	Posts: 9,936

I'm now trying to get plates from canton Zurich nevertheless. Apparently when you move cantons, you're also supposed to inform the Strassenverkehrsamt/service des autos and get your driving license updated with the new address.   
I haven't done this (yet) so maybe I'm still a Zurich resident in their eyes, in which case it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to give me ZH plates. Worth a try...

I think you misunderstood her.    
What Aftab means is that there are no   tempo signs on Swiss freeways (unlike in Germany) where there is no speed limit unless this sign is posted.     
The Autobahn(-strasse) / (semi-)autoroute / (semi)autostrada       (   )  signs, tell you that the default speed limit for the road you are entering: 120 (100) km/h, unless otherwise posted.

			I recommend a mix of both. Take a few lessons with an instructor (I can heartily recommend Roger Peng, who also speaks English and managed to teach stubborn, ""very late to learning to drive"" me) to be reasonably safe before heading out for private driving practice. Your read through all the terms and conditions on  ? If you just rent the car under normal Mobility conditions, you have quite a large amount under excess damage to cover, so be careful. Also bear in mind that if you do 100 km with a Mobility, car, this can easily cost you around 60 francs or more, so it may not be cost-effective.    
Sadly I don't have my licence long enough to help out but best of luck.

			That is what may have happened:   
Your frind sent plates and gray card by post to the Service Automobiles. 
 Service Automobiles canceled gray card and sent it back to your friends previous address.  
Now the big question: Where is the letter?  
- If sent the plates back just a few days ago it may be still at the service auto or in the postal system. 
- In the mailbox at his prevoius address. 
- Being forwarded to your friends current address. 
- At the local post office. 
- On the way back to the Service Auto.   
PS: Is a stamp ""Annulé / Anuliert"" Stamp on the phtotocopy? If yes than your friend has/had the gray card after returning the plates.

In City of Zurich traffic wardens are not paid by the ticket.      
If you have any doubt about a ticket you can ask the police about it:     
But be aware: If the police does not reject the fine and you think you did not something wrong and you do not pay or you forget to pay within 30 days the ticket will go to the judge and court cost will occure if you are found guilty. 
Problem: You may only see the police evidences once the case is at the court.   
You can even pay from aboard:    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Zurich,Blue Zone Parking Permit not visible --> Fine. Is there a way out?	ghip	Posts: 1

			When I bought my car I had to tell them not to clean it. It was perfectly clean. And they wanted 500 chf to put it in delivery condition (this is not including plates and controle...) after I bought it with no warranty they still replaced the hood shocks as he as holding on to the hood when opening it so I did not notice they were out of whatever is inside the little shock and the 100k service was not done (bought with 98,000 k on the clock) Never got a response from email so I went down there. they replaced the shocks and did the service on the spot.    
So yes go down and have it replaced. Btw the bulb for your light only costs a few chf and can be bought everywhere....a carwash costs 5chf (self) so up to you if you want to deal with the hassle.

			Practice driving with your instructor near the testing location (if you know it). Lots of people practice around their homes and workplaces, but some of the testing locations can be obscure.

			In case anyone is still watching this thread, I can recommend the   in Muri-bei-Bern. It's basically a professional garage, but they also rent out their lifts to amateurs like me for CHF40/hour. I spent a happy couple of hours there yesterday, replacing a transmission seal, steering pressure hose etc. It's unbelievable how quick those jobs are when you have a proper lift and all the tools, oils etc to hand. Hug is a family set-up, and they treat you just like an extra mechanic. For CHF40 per hour, you basically have access to everything in the workshop. Good selection of music on the workshop radio, too.

New Jags tend to suffer pretty horrendous depreciation - so 2-3 years down the line they make good sense. The 3.0D is the pick of the bunch.   
The ride quality will astound you.

			Many moons ago, when we were renting, my wife happened to park in one of the visitor spaces for our own appartment building whilst dropping off something fto a neighbour. She was only there for 5 - 10 mins, but came back to find a parking ticket issued by our own concierge, who had recognised our number plate, knowing we had a paid for space in the underground car park. When challenged about it he said rules were rules etc., etc. We eventually ended up paying the 30.- or something to avoid the hassle. 
I think the fine went to the commune, IIRC.

			Thank's for many answers, first of all I would like underline that my target is fix the car to the good shape again. Even I am planning to sell this car in Finland I am going to sell only perfect good car and as I can see if the car passing Swiss MFK it must be good enough to sell out in Finland  
 Only one spring are broken but I have got recommendation's to replace both of them instead only one. 
 Sure it would be great to find local car service (not MB Service) from Brügg/AG area who can fix this at reasonable price but I think reasonable price in Switzerland are more like a good joke.

			As mentioned the financial institute has formula to calculate risk and being new to a country plus not too long is a risk (nothing personal). Note for example that for car insurance nationality, marital status, age have a great impact on your premium. 
My suggestion would be to check with several garages and even car brands amd you may get a better deal.

			Just had to take my boat trailer for MFK today after 6 years.   
It passed OK but the last minute preparation was a nightmare.   
About 1 hour before the MFK appointment I noticed the boat was not sitting properly on the trailer so I had to put the boat back in the water & take it out again.  The risk was of the boat bouncing and one of the supports piercing the hull.   
My wife who usually helps was 70Km away & the front of the boat was chained & locked to the trailer. I did not have the key with me as I was not expecting to do this. 
Somwhere in the process my dog ran off but I found him a couple of hours later after the MFK. 
I visited the MFK half naked as I also managed to fall in the water    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	How to know when my MFK is due?	eric_c	Posts: 1

			My post can be off topic, and as so it can be deleted. 
But if you are buying a used car and maintain in Switzerland, maybe not.   
Now with Audi dealers in Spain or Portugal and consider that how many retirees from Switzerland (we are 250 000 Portuguese in Switzerland) go to Portugal and open legal Audi repair houses (some with experience working in Audi Germany or Switzerland for some years).   
My friend has an Audi A3 (lives in Lausanne) and a new back bumper and back lights was 800 euros with Audi original (SIVA in Portugal).   
And you have access to a substitute car. As people here go to Germany or France to buy meat, repair a car like that with 2 year warranty and original pieces must be something maximum for 500 euros.   
So for sure i would buy it and i would Portugal and Spain a holiday trip   "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Jun 2009	Groaned at 12 Times in 11 Posts	Would you buy a car with a dent like this on it?	poot	Posts: 335

It's not like a UK MOT test with a fixed length validity, so you simply wait until they ask you to take another test. IME, with relatively new cars, that only occurs every five years or so. In fact my car is now just about five years old and has never been tested. My old Volvo was tested when I first brought it here in 2001 and then again around 2005 (in BS). And again in 2007 when we moved to a new kanton.   
If you're looking at the little date disk in your car window, that's just the emissions test, with a 2-year validity IIRC. But that's no longer required at all for most modern cars. Search here for previous threads on that subject, as it has been discussed before.

			Last time we px/ed a car the dealer did everything for us, including notifying the insurance. I think we'd given them the carte gris from the old one, so by the time we did the deal we simply went in, swapped some cash while they swapped the plates over, then drove off with the new plates fitted.

			The local garage were helpful, quoting just 90chf for a fix, but they didn't have the original sized insert, and I would have needed an oversized sump plug. I want to keep the original sizes plug.   
The Swiss website suggested didn't seem to have it in stock (1 week delivery). 
The machine shop looks great for complicated work, but I would have to take off the sump.   
Yesterday I realised I was too late to take the train for an appointment, so in panic put lots of PTFE tape on the sump plug, and tightened it up gingerly. No leaks so far. I have ordered a helicoil kit from China, for 29 pounds including postage. I don't know how they manage to post it for that.

			Have to say that the SBB ticket office offers you a   zone ticket for the S12, Baden to Dietikon, direct. I think the problem is you can't  get a one zone upgrade, you need a 1-2 zone upgrade, so you have to specify which two. Sure this was discussed a few weeks back on EF. Of course the proposed inclusion of 184 would also cover the bus  .

			No, sorry, the big disagreement (currently between me and my friend) is still about the intersection posted in #14.    
I say: you can't be obliged to watch if a crossing street's triangles are lit or not. He says: it was the police that told him so.    
Again...  you are on what you know as the main street. You come to an intersection (no main road signs, but crossing road has triangles) that isn't very well lit. You think you have the way of right, but all of a sudden you are supposed to watch if someone comes from the right?    
All because: the triangle is no longer lit after midnight. And you should know/see that. (?)

You can mix the cheeses if you like (different kinds of chesses, or different variety of the same cheese) or use them solely (AFAIK Emmentaler is never used solo). For ex. the famous Moite-Moite is half Vacherin, half Gruyere.   
For dipping you can use bread, but also mushrooms, pear (preserved or fresh), banana, cooked potatoes etc.    
When you have nearly finished your Fondue but you are still hungry crack an egg into the caquelon and stir it into the melted cheese.    
If you are lazy you can also use a pre mixed package. If you are really lazy and you really do not care about taste you can use the microwave stuff.

			Hi all,    
I'm competing in the triathlon in Zurich (Landiwiese) this Saturday. I was planning to take the car because apart from the bike I have bucket loads of gear with me, and it's an early start.    
I know there won't be direct parking at the race (road closed around Landiwiese I think) but are there car parks near there, say even with 1km of Landiwiese or Mythenquai? My girlfriend is coming with me and could drop me off with all the gear and go park the car. Thinking of carparks / train stations / shops etc. Happy to pay for parking; guess car be parked for 4 hours MAX.    
Anyone any local tips be much appreciated!   
Thanks

			Hi,   
Has anyone imported a vehicle from Canada or the US and works for an international organization?   
My wife works for the Bank of International Settlements and we decided to import our vehicle from Canada.  The cost of importing the vehicle is being paid by the BIS and the moving company is dealing with the paper work.   
The vehicle is arriving on Friday and we will be given the custom form 13.20 to register the vehicle.  We are allow to drive the vehicle for one year on our Canada number plate.  The car insurance policy has been set up however it can't be activated until they get the custom form number (STAMM number) which will indicate that vehicle has arrived in Switzerland and custom has completed their paper work.   
We have not registered with the Canton as yet since the Canton office told us to wait until we have a permanent address.  I believe BIS or international organization employees are exception to the rule.   
What I need to know, what steps do I take after getting the vehicle on Friday?   
What fees do I have pay? 
Where should I register the vehicle? 
Should go to the straight to the vehicle registration office?

			If you buy a car from a private seller in Germany, he will not charge you 19% VAT, in fact, he won't charge you any VAT at all. So nothing to claim back at the border.   
With dealers, it depends. If it's a commission sale, no VAT is charged or paid either. So caveat emptor (buyer beware). Make sure you get an invoice / receipt that clearly shows the VAT amount included in the purchase price.

			Yes that is true. That is why I am importing the car.    
The problem I have is they are saying my Italsure insurance isn't valid and I need Swiss insurance. I have found the answer in another thread, though.   
Italsure has two parts to it, one part is underwritten in the UK, the other part is underwritten in Switzerland. We just have to show them the Swiss part of the policy and then the car can be tested.   
I was pretty sure this was the case.   
Thanks anyway guys.

			If you are near the SBB, they also sell tickets in the tourist office there. I'm not sure if you buy extra ones for later though as when I got them there the lady stamped them before giving them to me.   
You can also get some 5 CHF coins and keep some with you I guess.

			I'm trying to get my head around the different options for managing travel around Basel. I don't have a card. I have 1/2 card. I take the train once a week to Neuchatel, otherwise I'm pretty much in Basel all the time. There's a few options I see:   
1. Multicards (for 4 stops or less, or 1 zone).  
2. Rechargable U-Abo card?? ( ). I already have 1/2 card, I don't understand that website. 
3. Monthly U-Abo subscription ( ). Any discounts for 1/2 card holders? Doesn't appear to. Interesting that you can get one to share (maybe with my gf?)   
I won't be travelling enough to make the GA worthwhile.   
Cheers,

The car IS insured. It is likely that the insurance company will pursue your friend's friend for their losses (missing payments) and will also go after him for any costs on a claim.   
I'd rent if I were you. Don't be tight.

			I am going to the UK towards the end of the month in my Viano (pic below). I have space for 6 passengers with luggage.       
Costs for this all sharing would be max 100CHF one way. Same for return about 7 days after departure.   
All rules you would expect from a Britsher pretending to be Swiss apply, ie: No smoking, eating, drinking alcohol or soft drinks whilst travelling plus help with cleaning   
If you are interested (or not) write a load of old blether here & maybe even PM too  "	earned the respect of many	Join Date: Feb 2009	Groaned at 70 Times in 37 Posts	Travel to the UK AT THE END OF THE MONTH cheaply & in comfort anyone?	Hausamsee	Posts: 307

Does anyone know where I could find a garage (not a garage place, an actual lockable garage) in Zurich?

If you give me more information about your trip (from where exactly to where you want to transport the stuff? which floors) and what is your budget? I probably can help you. I am sending you my contact number to get in touch in private message.   
Have a nice day!

			Or package your bike up in a bike box so that no one can see what type it is nor hop on and cycle away on it. I have a Dhb Elsted gathering dust in our celler that you can have for chf 30 :-)   
Of course if you are planning on cycling your bike back to Switzerland from that small Italian town the box is not such a good idea...

			Hi Poot - free advice as short as I can make it  1) with SFr 5k, you want to buy good service records and condition, not brand  2) If you have time and patience, buy from private party (ricardo auto or autoscout24 dot ch)  3) ideal to buy above 100k km/""Zahnriemen"" change, but below 150k km  4) buy smallest engine/PS you can, lowers licence and fees  5) if you can drive clutch, go with it for lower risk and cost  6) I'd go Japanese, avoid Audi/VW/BMW etc since any repairs at all will be major $$$ 7) on insurance, go bare bones minimum, no collision, no hail damage, etc  8) get a TCS policy, worth it's weight in gold  9) if deal doesn't include winter tires, replace with 1 set ""all season"" unless you go in mountains a lot 10) don't forget you only have SFr 4.5k to give for car, need rest for taxes, licence, highway vignette, etc. 11) if buy from dealer, make sure in writing it's ""Unfallfrei"" and not repaired accident car 12) spend extra for A/C, you'll want it  Good luck!  PS stay away Saab, I love them (had 3) but you will have problems and service/parts can be problematic IMHO

			.... and the story continues...   
I called my insurer and with the Stammnummer provided in the 13.20A document from the customs office I got a Insurance proposal. (This proposal is notified by the insurer to the Strassenverkehrsamt directly without you doing anything)   
Then I went with: 
1.-EU Tech specification for the bike. 
2.-EU Street Permit 
3.-13.20A Document 
4.-Insurance policy went directly from the insurer 
5.-The bike is still insured with my EU insurance. And I guess is needed..   
to the Strassenverkehrsamt to get an Appointment for the MFK. 
They told me that there were some information that was not present in the EU Tech Spec document of the bike so I had to go to an Authorized Engineer to fill a document called ""Selbsimport"". And they gave me a paper with the MFK appointment.    
The Authorized Engineer (Don't need to be one from the official dealer of your brand in Switzerland, I tell you that, because I did it in a not Oficial Garage) will fill out the document/date/sign. You most likely need to pay for them to fill out the document but they didn't charge me anything for it. I would like to suggest to buy the registration plate holder to them if they are so kind not to charge you anything  .   
.... and the time goes by....   
Day before the MFK.... Clean your bike!!!   
MFK Appointment. 
1.-Be on time or earlier  
2.-Get eveything in good shape (all the docs you got). 
3.-Let them do the rest. 
4.-After a successful MFK go to the Strassenverkehrsamt offices and show the papers filled out by the Strassenverkehrsamt engineer 
5.-Get your plates and your swiss bike documentation 
6.-Put the plate into the plate holder 
7.-Buy a Vignette (and stick it under the seat) 
8.-Enjoy the bike   
My bike is in Switzerland. NOW I am here!!!!    
I has taken more than a year and a half, but today the sun shines.   
I hope this is useful for anyone else...

			As per Castro - a <5,000chf car in top condition with fresh service/MFK will be your best bet.   
You should still be able to offload it for 2,000chf after 12 months - 60chf a week.

			Hi again,    
I am going shopping for furniture to my new apartment next week and I was wondering if someone could recommend me a English speaking van and a man who could drive my furniture home for me.  
I am going to IKEA in Zurich so everything should be possible to take home the same day. 
I don't drive, neither does my boyfriend so we're a bit stuck. 
I know IKEA can deliver the stuff as well, but we would prefer getting everything home on the day rather than within 48 hours which IKEA is promising us. 
Thanks for any contacts or recommendations.   
Tanja

			Oh yes, I perfectly understand. And I think if it was a family house with lots of precious (at least to the heart) items, I would think twice about something like that. 
But we have a little furniture that we had for free here (thanks previous landlords!) and boxes with DVDs / books / table games. We will pack everything ourselves and will probably charge and uncharge the van as well.   
We just finished our PhDs and don't know when we will find a proper job. So the price is quite important to us. We thought about renting a van and doing it ourselves but it would be more expensive, actually. Just renting a van can be more expensive, without the fuel, highway tolls, channel crossing etc.    
So yes, you get what you pay for, I know.  
This guy seems friendly enough and answers my posts quickly. We are quite flexible as well, so if he doesn't turn up at that moment, we will still have 3 weeks to move if we need to. So it definitely helps.   
It really depends on your situation, I guess.

			eng_ch, that I know I have to swap it within 1 year since my arrival here, so with that one I'm still legit. But if I still have to go tomorrow at SVA, I'll ask for the papers to get it changed. A german colleague of mine told me that is no hustle with EU licenses, so I'm not that worried about that one.

			I just got my Swiss license and was given my US license back almost immediately.  They stuck a sticker on it saying not for use in the EU and stamped it with a little official stamp to make it obvious if the sticker was removed.  I have a laminated US license and so I was able to remove the sticker and clean off the stamped ink.    
I wouldn't recommend trying to be clever though.  As I asked the guy and he said said that police in CH if they check your license through the system will see that you are supposed to be carrying a Swiss license.  Swiss bureaucracy can move very fast when they want it to.  I removed the sticker because when I go back to the USA I don't want to have to explain what's going on the local constabulary.  Some times these officers barely register the existence of Europe let alone realize that someone could have a license from there even though they live in the USA.

Usually works out cheaper than even a half fare.   
Also check the website of where you live, all communes selling these tickets are not listed on that site.

			They reimburse you the unexpired part of your annual regional pass .. subject to a minimum amount of unexpired time ( I think a month in the case of TNW cards for NW Switzerland).   Check the details at the office where your regional card was issued.  They will also reimburse any unexpired portion of a halbtax card.

			If you're only here for a max of 60 days a year wouldn't it just be easier to sell the car and get a hire one when you need it?    If you could find a UK insurance company to insure your car, the costs would probably work out the same is my guess.

- for example if you only travels mostly inside Vaud canton (which is quite big), a monthly costs CHF 243 and an annual CHF 2430, about 1000 less than the GA. 
- if you only need to travel inside canton Geneva (tiny), then it's 70/month or 700/year.   
But if you need to cross cantons eg Lausanne to Zurich, then you need a point-to-point pass, which can cost nearly the same as the GA.  The link by MathNut has all the info about cantonal schemes.

Anyway, to keep on topic, 
Dave_A,  
Remember that some laws are in place to prevent those without common sense performing acts of stupidity.   
If your tyres have deep cuts, bulges, worn tread, etc. you should know if they are 'unsafe' or not.   
With winding mountain roads, constantly variable weather, (and if you're in Germany for whatever reason) and Autobahns with high speeds........ would you honestly take take the chance?   
The cost of a replacement tyre now is significantly less than the alternative should the tyre blow out.   
Don't rely on the law, make the judgement for yourself.

			0,5 second does not seem to be a lot but if you do 36 km/h you will actually move 5 meters within that short time.   
So...if you drive the allowed 50 km/h you will actually move almost 14 meters per second.

It's not quick. 
You don't die in an instant. Or not in every case. 
Even people who jump in front of ICEs (in Germany) sometimes live for some time before they go.   
I'm also in the ""why the hell get up so early in the morning just to kill yourself""-camp - but I'm giving the people in question the benefit of the doubt and assume, most didn't sleep the night before. 
But it's an extremely selfish act because, as mentioned, you pull the train-driver into it and (s)he's never going to forget the look on your face as it breaks on the windshield.  
So, my sympathy mostly goes to the train-drivers out there. They have the toughest job.

			Hi, I've just bought a clock on behalf of a friend, in central Geneva, to send back to the UK (ironically its British made!).  Could anyone please tell me how to go about back-loading it to the UK via France.  Is there any problem using a Swiss address, even though the item is being sent from France?  Appreciate any feedback from people who have done this before.  Cheers.

2826	10.06.2013, 14:45	Member	Thanked 33 Times in 20 Posts	Location: Morcote	"    Is this mis-information day??   
The answer is: it all depends on the 4wd system. Volvo, along with a great deal other companies, use a Haldex system. In normal driving this channels 100% of the torque to the front wheels. When slip is detected a clutch slips some of the torque to the rear axle. In the Haldex 4 system (as first used by Saab in their XWD cars) there are further clutches either side of the axle differentials allowing upto 85% of the torque to be transferred to a single wheel.   
Any VAG car that has 4wd and a transverse engine will use HALDEX and not QUATTRO.   
BMWs x-Drive system has a normal distribution of 40/60 (front/rear).   
Nissan's system is even more clever - the locked 2wd isn't actually locked - and will transfer to the rear under extreme slip. Automatic mode will shuffle upto 43% of torque to the rear axle - and 4wd mode locks the ratio at 57/43 - which is the weight distribution of the car.   
The biggest bonus of the modern 4wd systems is the HILL DESCENT CONTROL. Controlling and stopping a modern car (1600-2000kg) on a steep slippery descent can be tricky - HDC takes over and can hold your speed at 16kmph leaving you to focus on steering.   
9 years - used chains twice!

			Thank you all for posting in this thread.   
Today I went to police & everything was solved within 20 minutes.   
First they have checked the 'paper' filled by the police man. I suggested, that '2' was very close to '8'. The guy decided to check & indeed in that area (where they said i parked wrongly) lives a lady with this number and with the same car model. They have canceled the fine without any question & have given me some papers.   
Again thank you all for your participation/advises.   
Have a nice week!

			Maybe to prevent number plate cloning?  Never heard of it here mind but is a problem in the UK.   
You copy the number  plate of a car the same colour and model as yours and some other lucky person gets all your speeding fines.  But of a bugger to explain if you get pulled over by the rozzers though.

			The Swiss government have come down heavily on the side of rail investment versus road investment. They intend investing CHF 6'400 million up to year 2025.  
The car clubs lobbied hard for more road investment but lost to the railways.   
This must be the sensible way to go, especially for cities with commuter traffic. The commuter trains are bursting at the seams, but so are also the autobahns.  
Modern rail techniques allow a doubling of the present capacity, by intelligently controlling more trains on existing tracks.          
(Previous posts)         : Switzerland has already implemented    on certain sections, enabling the interval between trains to be reduced  to two minutes at 160 km/h. Further expansion up to year 2025 is  continuing. Using ETCS is an estimated increase in capacity of 10 to 15%  possible.        basic description of ETCS in English        detailed relevant description of ETCS in Switzerland, and where the investments will be made.

			A bit late but I just found this topic...   
To get a motorboat licence you will need to first pass a theory exam then pass a practical exam on the lake.   
The theory exam is 60 questions and the pass rate is 56. You can learn the theory from the free handbooks given out by the SCAN or better still buy the interactive CD for Fr 79.00 (see  ). I don't think you can do the exam in English, but ask the SCAN (maybe they changed the rules).   
Next, the practical exam must be taken within 18 months of getting the theory (otherwise you have to do the theory again!).   
My advice: Take private lessons so you get 100% of the time in charge of the boat. Private lessons are around Fr 90 / hour and you are going to need at least 10 lessons.   
Finally,   a list of all recognised instructors around Neuchatel. I recommend Philippe Marc Martin at Nid du Crô, he taught me and is a fun guy.   
Good luck!

			As part of their continuing efforts of world domination, Emirates have just announced that commencing with the 2014 schedule, they will replace the existing Boeing 777 Dubai-Zürich afternoon service with an Airbus A380.   
The statement doesn't make it clear if the second (evening) flight will be phased out or kept after that date.     
The only other A380 operator to ZRH at this time has been Singapore Airlines with a daily service.   
There are currently some 105 A380s in worldwide service. British Airways' first airplane of the type is currently being test flown up in Hannover prior to delivery to London in July 2013.

2) A friend gave me back the motorcycle I'd given him 6 years earlier (he'd gotten over his mid-life crisis)   
I've also borrowed dealer plates (did 6k km on one of my bikes with them, as we had some problems registering it as I had imported it new from Italy), but I'm friendly with several garages/dealers.

			Title gives it away I guess, but I suppose I should fill in a bit more information...   
I know roughly the process - Do the theory test, some sort of first aid course, then the lessons, then the test, but what I was hoping for was for someone to point me in the direction of where I could do all this in English.   
My German is OK, pretty basic but improving, however I would much rather do this in English as I would be far more comfortable.   
Can anyone recommend a site that talks me through the process in detail, or recommend an instructor who could do the same? I live in Zofingen and work in Zug, but would be happy to travel (Within reason) if need be.

			For 5 and 7 year old children, I would go for a high back booster.   
A 3 year old child should really be in a car seat with a harness.  For a child to be ready for a booster seat, they need to be mature enough to sit properly.  It's usually best to keep little ones harnessed until at least 4 years of age.  Once they are able to be positioned properly in a booster seat for the vehicle belts to do their job, they can graduate to a booster.   
Our 7 year old is in a  .  Our 3 year old has a rear-facing Britax  .  When he outgrows that, we have a forward-facing britax to keep him harnessed until he's mature enough to sit properly in a booster.

Take the highway towards the airport but exit at Glattbrugg/Kloten. Drive up north (this is Schaffhauserstr.) about 1 km. Just before you cross the tracks, there is a small Migrol gas station on your left. Next to it is a tire shop, they do it for 50. Not sure about diesel but 50.- is the price they displayed outside. 
The guy is really flexible and no need to make appointments. Just show up, chances are good they will do it on the spot. Open late too.

Once i returned to zurich from Lausanne (dep 23.45, arrival Zurich HB around 2am the following day), no problems at all

			Get your insurance person to issue you a new ""Versicherungsnachweis"" in your ex-wifes name. Take this along with the ""Farzeugausweis"" to the Strassenverkehrsamt. They'll print your wife out a new ""Fahrzeugausweis"" and issue you a refund for the remainder of the road taxes already paid and issue her a Rechnung for what she needs to pay. Shouldn't take more than 10 minutes once you make it to the counter.

			When you get a swiss driver's license are they (the Suisse) supposed to take away your previous license from another country?  I'm just curious...

			Do you have a french speaking friend or someone you know that can go with you?  We consulted some suisse friends that helped us alot in negotiations.  besides doing research, they told us mostly you can get the price down 6-8% but no more on a new car.  But you can ask for small extras for free, all weather floor mats, etc - as long as you don't ask for too much.  They will print you a contract there and you can take it away as we did to think about it, and then come back to sign.  They don't call and bug you for a negotiation price like they do in the States.  You have to respond to them.     
The research is also important.  I knew I wanted a Fiat 500, so I monitored what the dealers had in stock.  I saw the one I wanted in the color I wanted and monitored the dealer inventory for 3 months.  It was still there so I thought the dealer would want to move it.  We got it brand new for 16,000ch.  So it pays for patience and doing research.

You then have 2 options. Get it done in ch and donate an organ. Or get the same model in germany fitted and get the paper in ch.

			Hi there!   
I'd love to advise you better on this one but I'm not sure if you are moving 8cbm or 85cuft because they are not the same... 
85cuft is about 2.4cbm 
8cbm is about 283cuft 
Depending which it is would depend on the best passage over here... 
Feel free to let me know if you are still looking for contacts to get your stuff moving! 
All the best,   
Anna.

2900	12.05.2013, 14:19	Junior Member	Thanked 109 Times in 45 Posts	Location: Eglisau, ZH	"    Well, it's horses for courses, really.  An intra-Europe trip on BA, in economy, will cost you 18'000 miles round-trip, plus a flat fee of EUR30.  If you prefer to conserve your miles, you can do it for 9'000 miles round-trip, plus EUR50, plus the flat fee of EUR30.  Availability for these short-haul flights is generally pretty good, and this can represent a   saving on a flight like the OP has described, where there is little competition and tickets are expensive (EUR500-700)   
To fly from Europe to Australia, in business class, you need to spend 200'000 miles.  On top of this, you need to pay the taxes and fuel fees, which adds about EUR1'000 to the 'free' ticket.  Availability is limited, and you've got to be very flexible in your dates.  It's unlikely you'll be able to use the tickets at a traditionally busy/expensive time of the year.   
If I have a theoretical 200'000 miles in my account, I can have 22 short-haul intra-European flights and spend EUR1'760 in taxes and fees.  This represents tickets that would otherwise have cost me EUR11'000 - EUR14'000.   
Or I could have your J-class ticket to Sydney.  I'd be willing to bet that in the low-demand seasons, like where you could actually get an award seat, you could purchase a restricted, non-changeable business class ticket for under EUR4'000.  As an added bonus, you'd actually earn business-class mileage credit for this flight -- enough for at least four, and maybe as many as eight (depending on whether you're a BA Gold or not) -- additional intra-Europe flights.  And enough tier points to get you to silver...   
The economics are obviously different if you're flying on routes where you can routinely pick up cheap fares (eg, where there is competition from Easyjet), but if you're flying on a route where one airline has the monopoly, using miles instead of cash can leave you far better off, as the example above shows.   
Using miles for long-haul economy travel?    a mug's game!   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Air plane travel back home	MAzevedo	Posts: 99

			To break it down: 
0.8hr: 
to plug in diagnostic machine 
read the codes 
double check whether it a sensor that has failed OR the car needs an oil change 
perform an oil change   
0.25hr: 
removal and remounting of the plastics that protect the engine from below - 7mins off, 7mins on   
5l of oil 
oilfilter 
seal for the oil sump   
Individually nothing is excessive.   
Now here is the thing, you bought the car from Foitek, you have a relationship with Foitek, and Foitek offer a service pack (250chf for an oil change) - Foitek know that doing that you will buy another car from them - oh yes, you did.   
The other guys are just doing a service - a one off job.   
A couple of things to consider: 
200chf/hr is a main dealer rate - BMW is 260chf/hr - small garages 130chf/hr 
The dealer systems pre-define what quantities for what job - IE 0.8hrs or 5l oil for your car. You are within your rights to ask for the extra 0.8l of oil.   
Modern high grade oil is brutal - my advice is to buy it in bulk from reifendirekt and take it with you for a service.

			Hi there,    
We have been driving a Volvo V50 diesel and been loving it. It fits the kids and a rather big load in the back. We are currently selling ours due to an international move and not wanting the hassle of exporting it. It is diesel, has 55,000 km on it and comes with many options (blind spot detection, parking aid, isofix, etc.) This is our listing on autoscout24.ch but I also posted it for sale on English Forum:          
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see it!    
Thanks and good luck with your search!!

			I will be moving back from Zurich to Ipswich/London (into central London storage is possible) between now (beginning May) and end of June. I am looking for anyone who may be moving to CH from UK and has an empty van returning. I am fairly destitute so only other option is for my father to hire UK van and drive over himself and we will do it ourselves, but with petrol tools and ferries etc this is also not a fabulously cheap option. Any ideas?

			I have been researching flight options just like you. Skyscanner can be useful but of course, if the OP lives in deepest darkest Cornwall, then airports in the north are not much use to him! I haven't properly tried this method, so this is all theoretical.   
I have found a useful way to research is by looking up the Wikipedia page for the airport:         
There, you will find a list to all year-round and seasonal destinations from Zurich or Basel airport. You then need to read every row in the tables carefully and make a list of the destinations in the UK which work for you, and then you will need to find out where to buy the flights - Google, or click the name of the carrier in Wikipedia which should have a link to the carrier's website.   
Hope this helps!

			Questions on what it will cost to bring an imported car to an acceptable level for Swiss registration are impossible to answer. This will depend on so many factors: the vehicle, year, specification, etc etc. Lights, speedo and so will all have an influence.   
Basically, unless its a very recent model and selling will lose a lot, you bought it as a bargain, or it is a classic car, it is rarely worth importing a car to Switzerland...

Just a quick message to ask if anyone would be interested in helping me learn how to drive a manual car. I would not need too many lessons (as I know the basics) it is more to learn to drive in Switzerland.   
I would pay you of course, in the Luzern/Ebikon area, English Speaking and Monday and Wednesday afternoons would be preferable.    
Please let me know if you are interested! 
Many thanks in advance!

			Hello,   
I have a question about buying tickets at TNW/SBB ticket machines.  
From my working place to downtown Basel, (for example, Markplatz), I need to take a bus to Liestal bahnhof first, then change to a train to Basel SBB, and then take a tram to Markplatz. When I buy tickets at SBB ticket machines, there are two route options. So I can choose the route I wanna take, and it's 4 zones in total if I go with this route I mentioned above. But at TNW ticket machines, if I input the destination, it always shows 3 zones(which is possible if I take a bus and transfer twice), and there is no other route I can choose. My question is, if I buy the ticket from TNW machines, can I still take the route that goes by train via Liestal, or I have to take a bus and transfer twice? 
This has been confusing me for a while. Hope someone can help me figure it out. Thanks!

			When I switched to a UK licence a few years ago, I had to surrender my QLD license as part of the process. A few months later, I flew back to Australia for a wedding, went to the Department of Transport and said I lost it and got a new one there and then. Now I'm in Switzerland, I'll probably have 3 licenses, which I'll use as the situation warrants. I'm not planning on being pulled over though!

Hey Vaudoise, I am also in the process of getting a license and will be going for the First Aid course this weekend. A few of my friends did the theory exam in English in Bern. The process to apply in Bern is this: Once you complete the First Aid course, you will need to write to the Service des Automobiles, expressing your desire to do the test in English and requesting them to get in touch with Bern for permission and a date. Service des Automobiles then contact Bern and you should receive a letter from Bern with a date for the test. This whole process could take from 4 to 6 weeks!  
I am not sure of the cost of the theory test, but once you complete the theory, you will get a Leaner's Permit and will need to do a 'sensibilisation' course with a qualified instructor. This course if for 8 hours (4x2 hours). After this, the number of lessons you need will depend on how long you take to feel comfortable enough to go for the practical test.  
If you need a sample of the letter to be sent to Bern, please let me know. I can email it across to you.

The disadvantage of the ""übertragbare"" (transferrable) version is if you lose it, then that's it, you have to buy a new one. With the non-transferrable version it has your name on it, and if you lose it, you can get a new one issued for SFr20. However with the non-transferrable you have to show a photo ID along with the pass when the inspectors board the tram.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			The international agreed law that permits visiting vehicles to drive in foreign countries (outside of the EU) requires that the vehicle maintains a road legal status in it's country of registration for the duration of it's stay in the foreign country.   
Whenever I ship one of my British registered vehicles to the USA I get it MoT'd and retaxed a few days before it is loaded on to the ship. I surrender my UK insurance policy to my British insurer and they give me a partial refund. Marine freight insurance starts at the dockyard and a foreign visiting vehicle policy starts when it arrives in the USA.   
Technically, surrendering my UK insurance means that the vehicle is no longer road legal in the UK. However, British insurers insist that only one insurance policy can be on a vehice at a time and the Customs & Border Patrol in the US only usually check that I have a valid UK tax disc displayed and that my US insurance is valid. My US insurer requires the MoT to be valid as in the event of an accident, a document check is guaranteed.   
How does this apply to Switzerland? Well, if your MoT, road tax, or insurance expire on your British registered vehicle it is no longer road legal here. If your road tax expires but your MoT and Insurance are still in force, you can contact DVLA for one. If your, MoT runs out, you either have to reregister the car in Switzerland or transport it back to the UK by truck to get it retested.

			Hi all,    
I am very new to this forum and Switzerland - my husband and I just moved here this past week. We brought as much as we could with us on the plane, but have about 10 boxes of personal items that we wanted to ship (clothing, various household items, etc.)   
I have seen a few threads regarding this topic and understand that the shipping store back in the US needs to be sure to mark all of the boxes as ""Moving Goods"", so that we can have these count as our ""personal items"" and duty free as part of our move.    
However, what I can't find out is what additional information we will need to include for customs, how do you let customs know that these items are part of our moving process, etc.   
We will be using UPS or FedEx since we have been able to secure good rates (and my husband's company is letting us use their account). Unfortunately, both UPS and FedEx have not been so helpful in letting me know what will happen on this end of the shipment.    
Also, do you know if we need to wait for his Resident Permit to come through BEFORE we actually send these items? I'm wondering if they will want us to present when picking up?  
Many thanks for advice and help!  
Melissa

			This morning, I bought a bus-and-train ticket at my local bus stop. As I've only recently given up my AG, I'm still getting used to doing this and allowing enough time etc. So this morning I was a little flustered.    
When I got on the bus, I had a nagging feeling something was wrong. Yes, I'd bought a ticket for the right destination, but it was only valid for two hours and didn't I normally pay that price for a day pass...   
Eventually I figured out what I'd done wrong. I'd bought a single, full fare ticket when I have a half-fare card and normally buy a half-fare day pass.    
As I had a little time before my train, I went to the ticket office. I was expecting to be told that I'd made a stupid mistake and had to pay for it, or go through a complicated process to get a refund. But the girl at the counter listened to my story, looked at my ticket and half fare card, then cancelled the ticket and printed me out a new half-fare day pass (which was the same price).    
Very impressed indeed!

If the dealer wants to reverse the deal, then thats fine, he won't as his profit is in the car he sold. Strangely enough I paid about 50% of the asking price of a car I bid on here last year & received loads of abuse.   
I can't believe the dealer paid more than 3k!

			Hi,   
I normally get used parts for my cars from ebay.de. You will find pretty much everything there and the prices are very reasonable. 
Check also  . It's the web platform of some swiss salvage yards and they allow to search for parts online. But don't expect them to be cheap  It's often cheaper to buy new parts from ebay than getting used parts from salvage yards.

			I've used Navigon on my iPhone for years. I use both the USA version and the Europe version and have found it to be exceptionally good. So good in fact I can't use our Garmin unit (used by my wife) in the car because it is so poor in comparison.    
Navigon also links with Aroundme which is great. Just find a point in Aroundme ... like a pizza place, hit navigation and Navigon pops up and leads you to the destination.    
I highly recommend it!

			I currently hold a US drivers license (Massachusetts Class D) and in the process of filling out the forms to have my US license transferred to a Swiss one. My question is about license classes. My current US license allows me to drive any vehicle with or without a trailer up to 11,000 kg. I am applying for the B-class license, but I was wondering if I would also be able to apply for the C/C1, D/D1, BE or any other class my current license covers without having to take any additional exams. Should I just submit the papers with these boxes checked and my license information and hope for the best? 
Also, I have had my license continually for 6 years now (I understand for some classes you need to have held a license for more than 2 years). 
Thank you.

			Before you rush off and spend hundreds.... do you realise the police will not accept your photos as evidence?    
But I do agree, in the heat of the moment it might be useful to take a snap shot for the details. But then you do realise don't you that dash mounted devices are not permitted if they stop your view of the road? You need to mount them all the way across to the right side.

			I do not want to go in details and discuss what is wrong and what is right.   
The sole purpose of my question was to understand how the Swiss low may prohibit me to obtain driving licence in another country and drive except in Switzerland. 
As an EU member state citizen I can live and register myself in any EU country except UK. Hypothetically then this will alow me to pass the exams and obtain new driving licence. 
Or the Swiss ban to drive is applicable to the whole earth including the moon?  "	become a little unpopular	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 7 Times in 3 Posts	Swiss drivers' license revoked	pavlik1	Posts: 21

			Montreux- Lausanne you should do by train. It is much faster.   
Montreux Bulle However you should rent a car. You will first go to Lausanne, then to Payerne where you will be going on a small little train that stops every 2 seconds. It WILL take you well over an hour to do the trip and it is horrendous.    
What are you going to GIHE for? If you are a visitor (as a possible student) they will drive you there (between the campusses) Let me know if that is what you are planning to do and I will get you in touch with the right person) 
Also there is a small car renter in front of the station in Montreux that rents for like 50 bucks a day

			Hi All,   
I just wanted to give you some info, which might save you some money plus the hassle of going back and forth.   
I wanted to convert my license  to a Swiss one, so I followed the known procedure. Since my original license is written in a non-Swiss language (not English too), I was supposed to provide a certified translation of the license.   
I found a Swiss translation company, who charged me 108 CHF (the cheapest quote that I received). After sending back the license with the Swiss legalized translation, the Zurich Strassenverkehrsamt replied saying that they only accept translation made by the embassy of the issuing country in Switzerland, or they do the translation themselves through a translator costing between (80-200 CHF). I later contacted them, they said that these are the rules at least for Zurich, and they dont know the exact cost because the translator determines this on his own AND you would only know after the translation is done!   
So, the cheapest thing for your is to translate it at your respective embassy in Switzerland.   
Goodluck!

			From  :   and       
So, the way I read it, till she reaches 18 years of age, your daughter can not drive in Switzerland even if she did obtain the US driving license... Then she would have to have a IDP (International Driving Permit) which is not given in Switzerland, but (because of US license) in the US.   
Further, if she only has a ""learner-permit"", then she will not receive an IDP.  Also, if the driver with an IDP is under 18, Switzerland (or visiting country) can refuse to accept the IDP.  That increases to 21 for categories C, D, CE and DE (trucks and buses).

			An international drivers license is now required by law (Commencing January 2013) in Florida.  If stopped by the police in Florida you could be fined/imprisoned  Canada does not require an International drivers license but it is suggested that you carry one if traveling to North America. Better to be safe than sorry. The idiotic lawmakers in Florida did not think it through before passing this law. Even car rental companies were unaware of it.

I already opened a thread asking for some feedback ( ), but perhaps you can help.   
I would be in the same case with those bikes (owned for more that six months), but the problem is that I'm already living in Switzerland for 15 months more or less. In the moment I came to Switzzerland I didn't do any import process or declaration about any goods to be imported (I came with nothing  ).   
Nowadays I have the opportunity of importing those bikes, but I don know if they will apply more taxes because I surpassed the 12 months limit.   
I hope this is not too much off-topic.   
Thanks in advance.

			Are batteries pre-charged when you buy them?   
Took me and a mate 30 mins or so to change one that we bought just 15 mins earlier (no charging), in a staff car park in the UK. It was a small Renault car and we (me and another guy) were able to push it up a very, very gentle slope, we turned it around and helped push it back down the way it came and started it that way.   
(But you need to know that it's the battery else this isn't much good)

I do see small vans hired by private persons moving on Sundays, but you don't make yourself very popular with the neighbours unless you are quiet.   
But sometimes it can't be helped. If you have a situation where no one is being flexible on the dates what can you do?   
I think it also depends on the access and how many tenants you are disturbing if using a lift which happens to be the only one, and wedging doors open and letting cold air in if it happens to be winter.

			Hi OP,   
25 minutes from Basel in the city of Binzen in Germany you'll find an Audi Dealer. Here is the address:   
ASAG Binzen Audi 
Meitnerring 3 
79589 Binzen  
Tel: 07 621 40 29-0 
Fax: 07621 40 29-199   
Or you can try the one in Lorrach which could work out closer for you:   
Wiesentalstraße 30/31 79540 Loerrach, Germany +49 7621 15090   
My opinion is that they will work out even cheaper than the independents that you may use in Basel. Why would you take the risk with a nobody somewhere in DE.

If they are standard accessories from Honda and available in the Swiss market, then the certification is likely on file at the vehicle registry office.   
Otherwise, you will need to get the accessories certified, at your cost.   
Obviously, a new coat of paint on an item will likely not require certification.   
But exhaust will absolutely need to be certified. 
And maybe the levels too.   
And two bent wheels on a motorbike? That means all wheels are bent, and it is likely the vehicle inspection office won't like that.... but of course it depends on how deformed the wheels are.

Check with your CH insurer first. We were given a green international certificate that was required and it was dated for 1 year. No problem to get next etc.

			Hi!   
Could someone share an abonement for Mont-Blanc tunnel for this weekend? 
I will use 2 passes (aller et retour) and would appreciate if it will be cheaper at the end than 51 eur they ask for this.   
Cheers

I suppose you could declare yourself resident in both countries - the HMRC certainly won't mind once they hear that and they can have a share of your income along with the Swiss Cantonal and Federal tax!     
Otherwise, yes, you would have to de-register here.

			A hotel in Basel is the obvious option, but another one is to fly Ryanair from Baden-Baden (FKB) to Malaga.     
There are direct trains from Basel and Zurich to Baden-Baden, and the flight times might match up better.  If not, there's a very cheap and decent hotel at Baden-Baden airport itself.

Sorry only seeing this post now. 
The car is a 2004 Peugeot 206 with 93000 miles. 
It is in great working order and the only reason i'm selling it is because our son was born  
5 months ago and we needed a bigger car. 
Will sell this car for CHF 1000. Good price for a quick sale.

They just inform you that you are no longer allowed to drive in Switzerland for a certain period. Should be one month but could also be three months or none. Additionally, they will set you on probation. If you have an other severe traffic infraction within 1,2, or 5 years you will get a prolonged suspension.       You could be right. ""oder zumindest Inkaufnahme einer ernstlichen Gefahr"" could also mean intend. Without intend no crime. But that is were a lawyer is needed.

Given, regular or very regular flyers have their timing down - know where the hold ups may occur and can work around them.  The not-so-routine passenger may have kids, not familiar with the airport and follows airport suggestions to arrive with plenty of time to spare.  Obviously this allows for more revenue at the airport shops too

			My mum lives equally between Newcastle and Edinburge and I go to see her quite regularly.   
BMI fly to Edinburgh although it's very expensive, then you can get a train. alternatively go to Newcastle via Düsseldorf on Lufthansa or Amsterdam on KLM.   
I've also gone to Manchester and taken a train. If you stick to Trans Pennine Express and book online you can get some good deals. Just leave a good size gap between plane and train (bag claim can be very slow at MAN although TPE will allow you to take a later train up to 3 hours)

			Your fine up to Domodossola, then you must buy the ticket to Milano. It'll come out to be either 10 or 20 francs depending on which train it is. Also, it's better to buy from the SBB than Trenitalia, as the amounts are the same, but the currency's differ with Trenitalia being priced as 10/20 euros, rather than francs.

			really  it will be very bad experience at all but you will learn from it as well .     
I did last year 19 more at 50 Zone while searching my other car( i parked it and i didn't then remember where !! it was at late night at 00 Clock)   and  got flashed ,  so you will get as much as you can imagine bills   from many sides , Verkehrsamt , and then another bills for the service  and some others ...... anyway  you will have good contact with the postman at this period .   
so the total if i still remember was about 1000 CHF and they will register  you , so the next small problem you do you get then banned , but i think since yours is about 29 more at 50 Zone  you will be for sure min one month banned, registred for the next problem,  and if your drive license under  the trial period  so  they will give you then another one year ...   
but really don't worry since  you will drive again at the end , since many many   have no right anymore to drive at Switzerland due to this problems. Take it easy

Usually here they go with when your most recent license was issued (in my case that was less than five years ago). If your most recent license is less than that, you might want to get a letter from the UK that details a longer history.

anyone wish to double check my figures?   
bill of sale/invoice bike cost £3000   
duty 37chf per 100,  bike 140kg so assume 74chf.   
swiss value 3000 x 1.44875 = 4346chf 
vat @ 8% = 347chf   
plus 20chf for the import document at the border   
plus the mfk and plate costs.   
correct?   
im finding out if a COC is needed as its a model sold here and when I brought my car in i didnt need a COC then... unless things have changed?

			Thanks for the replies. I have successfully been put off driving to Zurich to work for life.. So now my plan is to Park and ride.. I will drive to Zug and take a train to Oerlikon and then a tram to Oerlikon.. Long winded but hopefully I will retain my sanity..   
Speaking of Park and Ride. Does anyone know how much it costs to park per month at the Siemens Car park in Zug?

As pure speculation -I can't access the app, and the standby rate isn't in the website conditions- I would still suspect that the intended value limit was 0.7 chf as the commissioned rate is 0.43 chf. The licensing issue would likely be null in the standby case as one could argue that the participant isn't being paid to drive, only to be tracked by the app.

			There's no expert like a garage or the TCS. Just take the car there (previous appointment required), pay a sum of money (50-150chf, depending), and get back a detailed report which no bring-along friend could ever give you.   
The only case where a bring-along friend helps is a ""first view"" of the car, assuming you (like me) take more than one viewing to decide. A skilled friend could then rule out lemons on the spot, potentially saving you the garage test fee and time.   
Finally, it would help stating what car it is: make, model and year. Different people know different cars and have different tools to check them (e.g., if you were buying say a VW Sharan up to 2004, I could maybe help you with a check of stored fault codes and such).

			Thanks for all the replies! There are truly lots of opinions on this one.  I do have a large family (5 + dog) so I do still see the need to have a 7 seater vehicle.  In addition, I fully expect to have frequent visitors (family & friends) so having the extra seating capacity is a much better option than potentially owning two cars.  I plan to take this vehicle on excursions throughout Europe so having some space for baggage is a plus too.  I am concerned about the parking spaces though.  I would guess that there are spots available...they just may not be the most convenient ones.  Thoughts?

			An XXL crate would fit on the train, no problem. They're also pretty light once Rover is not inside.   
Do you have other luggage?   
I'd consider a one-way rental - an estate aka station wagon that's bigger than compact would suffice.....   
Hertz in a random search for a one-way rental gives cars of about 220 francs with drop-off in Bern which would take the crate, a couple of suitcases, a cat and two adults with room to spare.

They say that the monthly pass is only available in a plastic holder, while the annual pass is available in card format. I can get the card at any ZVV or SBB ticket office.

It doesn't make sense pricewise, but timewise I ended up deciding it does. We'll be able to enjoy even the off-track destinations in superb hiking, skiing, and cultural country, and to be able hunt for the somewhat widely dispersed staples I always end up hankering for.    
Your expenses seem to be more or less in the ball park, although a garage spot even in Basel easily costs 1200 - is Zurich not more expensive?  
The MFK  , and you'll end up doing it fairly soon unless you demand it as part of the deal, and about every two years thereafter. Some cantons are apparently running a bit behind on their invitations, don't know how it is in Zurich. The   of CHF, and my understanding is this will need to be done before the MFK (but I would appreciate a line if it's needed elsewhere).   
Those threads are indicating that the car needs to be spotless for the MFK. I'm wondering where you get that done, and for how much. I know I'll never manage to get a car's undercarriage clean...  (Edit:     you go to a ""jet wash"" and spray away. Really? Oily undercarriages and all are as easy as that?)   
Regarding the car, mileage, and age, I think you can get something a bit spiffier for that price. Audi Quattros with a nice diesel in the 120-160k range are around there, privately purchased. (It's the Swiss Toyota, innit. =)   
(Edit: right, forgot ""road tax"", as others have mentioned. Just in case someone tldr's just this post.)

			As above with regards to whether it will fail the MFK.   
BUT   
Here it is - turning up with a big dent will suggest to the MFK person you take little care with your car - he will then assume you also take little care in ensuring the car is roadworthy. He will then scrutinize your car even more closely.   
They are like that!   
You may only win points back if you have ensured the car is completely clean inside, outside and underneath - they really don't like getting their hands/gloves dirty.

			Having had my father working for Iberia for more than 40 years as a sales manager I realized I should have asked him first!!!  
So he confirmed me what catandmouse says, tickets are priced in the currency of the originating country. In the case of Iberia, if you paid cash, the ""official"" rate was aplied. If you paid card it was up to your card issuer. 
Also I can confirm that paying with PostFinance from swiss.com a flight priced in EUR, the amount in EUR will be debited and PostFinance will make a currency conversion to debit the amount in CHF from your account. 
In my case, a rate of 1.2551 was applied which is pretty ok for a commercial FX ask operation. Anyways I'd rather have no currency conversion and pay directly in CHF but that's the way it is. 
Options are to start buying ZRH-MAD round trips instead of MAD-ZRH but that will make me buy at least one one-way pricey ticket to invert the order, and maybe another one when the time comes to return to Spain to never come back   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Change currency in swiss.com to CHF	citricut	Posts: 35

			Well if they refuse to service it then just contact the manufacturer and the deler will be hit with a hefty fine. They will be forced to do the necessary repairs.   
In any event if you buy an import from for instance a garage who are official VW service reps then they will honor the warranty and service no problem. 
You may pay a lottle more for the car than one of the big car supermarkets but still save a fortune compared to buying off a main dealer.

Oh dear.   
Never, ever, *ever*, travel with your passport anywhere other than on your person (in a reasonably secure pocket, or a money belt or whatever).  Leaving it in your bag is asking for an entirely avoidable problem.  Hotel safe, maybe, but definitely not in my bag.   
Your passport is, because of the hassle factor, the most valuable thing you travel with.  Not your CHF 2000 laptop, your passport.   
FWIW, though, it's another reason why I hate the nasty double-deck IC trains in CH (quite apart from the lack of seat width and legroom and the tiny windows in a country whose rail network's big strength is the view out of them).  I prefer my luggage in an overhead rack above me.

NO -  the garage can not give you co2 per km .  The manufacturer issues that and the kanton then  determines your ""naughty dirty car"" emission charge based on that figure.

			I imported a Lotus Excel which I bought from Lotus in 1989 (was chief engineer's car). I had the car in France and brought it here when I moved in 1991. I had no problem getting it licenced after an inspection at the Strassenverkersamt in Zurich. They checked it out against the specification and told me to get the speedometer changed to kilometres. The inspection was not expensive and I drove the car on Wechselnummer plates that I shared with my wife's car. Insurance was also reasonable.   
I also brought a BMW motorcycle that I purchased in the US. I rode it a couple of times here and then sold it for more than I paid because it was a 1000cc model that was not sold in Switzerland. The Swiss back then restricted motor size for the model to 800cc.   
Things may have changed in the interim, but my experience was painless.

			I have discovered an anomaly using ticket machines near where I live. I told the BLS railway station staff and they said they knew about it and maybe a change will come. (I posted here rather than starting a new thread, as it is obscure)    
If I travel by car from Solothurn to Murten, the route takes me via the autobahn and is 68 Km long. If I should walk the route it would be only 48 Km,    (Click on car and then on the man ikons)   
Similarly there are different rail routings, which come at different prices, and buying the wrong (Cheaper) ticket can bring a fine!    
From Solothurn there are 3 routes, via Bern is the longest but fastest.  
Via Lyss is the shortest but slowest. 
Via Biel and Ins is the cheapest.    
When using a ticket machine supplied by the   at Solothurn, there is no option to buy a ticket & travel via Bern. The touch screen does not offer the via Bern option. I have to buy a ticket to Bern, and then a ticket from Bern to Murten.  
When using the   machine at Solothurn there IS an option to select a ticket via Bern, which is the quickest, and furthest and most expensive route. 
When using the   ticket machine at Murten there is only the option of buying a ticket via Lyss.     
Infuriatingly the   machine offered me a ticket Solothurn-Biel-Murten using the tourist ship from Biel, a service which only runs after Easter and costs CHF 90.-- !    
In other regions of Switzerland there might also be a similar routing problem, be careful and study your ticket, and if it says via Timbuctoo, then make sure you take that route, otherwise you   be fined for being on a section of the railway you have not paid for.

			It all depends on what kind of car you want. We pay 650 for full coverage on a brand new tiny Citroen, which has great milage and surprising a lot of room to carry stuff.    
You can also pay 3K/year (or about 5k for the two of you) for a train pass and go anywhere in Switzerland   That's a bargain!

It used to be a Migrol self service, but it's changed hands a couple of years ago.  The thing is the price advertised is lower compared to the other stations nearby, but when you actually go to get your petrol/diesel the price at the pump is usually 3ctms lower than the advertised price.  So if it's showing 1.74 on the overhead display, the pump price is 1.71.     Weird, but nice to know.

			It is possible to buy a ticket in central Geneva that covers central Geneva (zone 10), along the lake towards Nyon (zones 21,22, 90) and various other zones in neighbouring France (81 to 89).  
So you can buy a two-hour ticket in Geneva that covers you for travel into France easily at any ticket machine or (in some cases) on the bus itself. The same in France, either from a machine or the driver.   
For example; The D runs from Bel-Air in Geneva to Saint Julien (and onto Vitam-parc-Neydens on certain days) without needing to change buses, and you can also travel on as far as Valleiry by changing in Saint Julien on to the Dn shuttle bus. The 4 takes you across the french border at Perly and picks up there as well.  
Both buses are run by, funded and staffed by the Transports Public de Geneve.

			""The garage said it might not be covered""   
I would speak to the warranty company and make sure. Theoretically, if the car was serviced correctly, and you have not needed to have a service (and missed it) since - then the car's state and condition was agreed upon by the warranty company and the time of purchase - missing services or not.   
I would suggest not pursuing any further repairs until you clarify with the warranty company

			For ""normal"" cars none.    
For tuned cars, you need to know TUV is not accepted here, so any TUV-approved parts will NOT be swiss-approved and you'll need to either take them off or get an approval certificate from a swiss importer of the part. Tuned = almost anything non-standard (suspension, exhaust, rims, bodykits, engine etc).

The not-so-bad news is that the yearly ticket did not increase as much as a percentage.

			Hello, I m a new user   
I saw that there are already other discussions baout parking for free in Bern   
But the there's no possibility to park close to Bern for free and then go to the center by bus?   
I really am on budget so i don't mind walking for 30 min or take a bus..   
so maybe free parking in the suburbs?   
thanks   
for example I hear near Rosengarted park you can find free parking then take a bus or walk..is it true?

			It might be a bit more time-consuming, but you might be able to check one piece of luggage in the day or night before your flight. That way, you would only need to carry one piece of luggage with you on the day of the flight itself.   
We were able to check our luggage in at Zurich airport the night before our flight, which was helpful since we had a baby, car seat and stroller to take with us on the train the day of the flight.   
If checking luggage in the day before is something you'd consider, I would call your airline and ask if it's possible.

  Thanks, weight off my mind.  Not used to using SSB website and had popped down to local train station, being Sunday the ticket office closed so could not ask.   
  I was used to London, where only some buses with special timetable operate on Christmas Day, 25 December, taxi double their prices (no tubes or British Rail).   
  Glowjupiter I prefer the train connections; asked re buses in case the trains were not running, as then would have to hunt where the bus stops are.   
  I was out of sorts today, you have all helped me get back on track.   
  Happy Christmas

I've not come across metered blue zone parking - as blue zone, by definition, requires the blue dial. 
Prepaid parking meters are numbered white lined bays - either on or off street.   
My 15mins thing was because usually because I would be trying to set the dial at 0945 - and was told just to put it at 1000.   
For the meters - no tolerance.

Thanks for reporting it to the police. It's not that they can't do much about it, but it will help them track a time and frequency with other reports. Hopefully these will add up to either an arrest, or stricter control measures.

			The fee tends to include: 
- paperwork taken care of at the STVA 
- liaises with insurance and STVA 
- fresh abgas test 
- thorough clean inside and out - often polished and not just washed 
- and a ""free"" gift - examples include chocolates, flowers, umbrella etc

			Hi Everyone   
I'm new here so please be gentle and forgive me posting my question if it has already been asked previously.     
We, my husband and I, are considering moving to Switzerland and we have two cars that we would want to bring with us.  Both cars are Spanish plated.  One, the 4x4 (need it to transport the dog) is LHD and bought here in Spain.  The second, Porsche Boxster, (Hubby's baby) is RHD that we bought in the UK and imported over a year ago into Spain.  We of course had the lights changed on the Porsche to meet the requirements here.     
Could someone please explain to me what we do about the Porsche because she was bought in the UK not Spain, do I have to go back to the UK to get any paperwork?  I read somewhere on this forum that you have to put on temporary Swiss plates, how do you get them?   
Also, both cars have Spanish log books, ITV (MOT), taxed in Spain and have Spanish insurance. Do they have to be translated into another language or will the Spanish documents be accepted?   
We are English but Spanish residents and currently hold Spanish driving licences, this doesn't pose a problem does it?     
Crikey I am sure I have loads more to ask regarding the cars but I can't think of anything at the moment and also don't want to bore you readers with my first posting.   
Thank you for reading and hope to hear from all you nice people real soon. 
Hugs 
Tara's Mum

I've just purchased a 2007 LHD VW Van from the UK, planning on converting it into a Camper in the next few months and bringing it over for the summers to spend weekends in the mountains or Italy.    
Anyone have a camper here? Was wondering if there's any decent places around to get parts or get iot serviced etc

10 percent tolerance in your speedometer is only a rule of thumb.  My old car had 14-15 km/h difference at 120 km/h.  Whereas my new car has only 9 km/h difference at the same speed measured with the same GPS.  So, actually, the speedometer of the car displayed a much higher speed than clocked by the laser/radar. My guess between 58 and 62. 
Shame on you Vlad.

			I really like my GPS. Map updates are for free and supports numerous of countries. Just connect it to your computer or use the built in WiFi receiver. Used it in South Africa, Croatia, US, Spain, Switzerland. Also many points of interest. Quite small, fits my pocket so I can even use while walking in the city. Additionally, it includes a camera and what it is really nice a full functioning GSM telephone for emergency calls.     
The Manufacturer? Nokia. Mine is an E6 but you may prefer a bigger screen.

You need original title in order to export the car from the US (customs requirement). 
I'm in a very similar position - I also received letter from bank authorizing myself to take car from the US.  
Also, I think it shouldn't be a problem to get GE plates - as this isn't exactly re-titling.

			At some stage, I'll be needing a car (my UK car is in the UK) and I'm across the lake from you.  I'm not really looking to get a car now as I'll be in Australia for a good part of next year, but just in theory   
dumb question of the day:  I suppose there's lots of paperwork involved in registering a car in France from Switzerland, no?  And I can't have it registered in Switzerland and keep it in France without an address in Switzerland, can I?       
Yeah, I know.  Worth asking though.

			It actually doesn't really matters, if you buy your ticket from the French company website   . 
They don't offer the Swiss 1/2 price reduction, but the prices are the same as if brought from   with 1/2 price reduction.

			You can find different-sized boxes at Coop Bau & Hobby or OBI. They're often called moving boxes, but if taped up well, you can also use them for shipping.    
I agree that shipping via the Post is probably the cheapest. I think you can check the shipping costs via the Post on their website:       
It says: ""The maximum weight for PostPac International Priority packages is 30 kg  and 20 kg for some countries. Your consignment must always be signed for  by the addressee.""   
Oh, here's their page for the shipping rate calculator:      "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: May 2012	Groaned at 5 Times in 5 Posts	posting a box (bulky goods)	mahmood	Posts: 88

			If you have friends or family visiting, via Basel or Geneva airport - do make sure they are aware of the difference- as it could make a huge difference to their safety. All cars hired on the Swiss side will be slightly (or more) expensive, but do NOT be tempted to go for the cheaper French option.     
For one, a motorway vignette will not be included- but most importantly, cars on Swiss side will be equipped with snowtyres and chains, whereas those on French side will NOT, unless booked and paid for as extras at the time of booking.    
So stay safe, and make sure your friends and family do too.

3257	null	null	null	null	"    Well actually Yes, according to my last visit to a refinery, the output can be tweaked (discussions with the refinery operator). But when I say tweak, this is very minor, i.e. from 10% to 11% or 10.5%. And yes I know fractional distillation (using separation columns if i remember correctly), didn't want to go too technical, but basically just the difference in boiling points. But for a meaningful change to the output, the refinery would have to be reconfigured (extremely expensive).   
True, the type of crude plays a role, but all refineries can usually take all types, but they prefer certain types due to the ""ease"" of producing the end product they are more set up for.   
On your second point, that indeed sounds interesting and makes a lot of sense.

Also, it may come with a km-limit too (ex. 20000 km).      The MFK looks only at safety and road worthiness aspects and if the emission test papers are present and up to date (Which does not say it was actually performed). The only thing it could get through OBD (ODBC is something else) would be if there was some engine chip tuning done, which is legal but has to be mentioned in the cars documents.    
MFK does not look at: cars service history, if involved in an accident, sub-standard body works, odometer cheating, etc. They wont even tell you if any repairs or modifications were done or are needed in a short time as long everything is legal and safe.

Right, compared with the cost of a street parking permit it's expensive, but if I compare the cost of covered parking with the total operating costs of a vehicle (depreciation, taxes, insurance, fuel, maintenance, etc.) it looks quite a bit different.

			Don't know how it is elsewhere, but when I do the ""Inspection"" in Nyon, 90% of the examination takes place on site. The examiner takes the car out on to the service road leading to the inspection area, does an emergency stop, does a U-turn and tests the speedo by driving at 50 km/hr towards a fixed radar. He does maybe 700 m of driving outside the test area.

If Switzerland does loose its priviledged corporation tax rates and there's a major exit of these companies to other parts of the EU, I rekon a new ""fart"" tax could be the way to go to recoupe the lost revenue.

			You need washer jets for xenon lights over here as particles of dirt/debris on the headlight can alter the beam projection. I can imagine this would be expensive to retro fit. THe BMW garage would have sai they would replace the headlamps because US spec headlamps have a completely different beam pattern to those in Europe (wider and flatter, I believe), which is far more likely to blind oncoming traffic.

			AS AN UPDATE...  it takes about 5 minutes to have the items removed from the paper.   
in my case speak with the MFK chef, he takes a quick look at the car, crosses out in pen the items on the modifictions section and then you go to another office for the new paper.    
no charge and just a few mins to do.

Really, you need to stop stressing.  The Geneva airport is about as big as, I dunno, White Plains or Scarborough.  There's no possible way you can get lost.  It's literally one long hallway.  If you come to the end of the hallway that has a restaurant called the Montreux Jazz Cafe, you went the wrong way.  Go to the other end of the hallway and you will see the train station lobby.   
Look for the sign that says ""RailCity"" and that is the ticket booth with the actual person in it.  Mind you, the trains are one floor below this so you have to go down an escalator to your track.  The trains to Lausanne run about every 15-20 minutes.

			Hi   
Honda CB900 2003.    
Actually I made a few phone calls and I seemed to have found out what I need. Looks like that anyhow I cannot use it on UK plates as i've already been here too long (almost 3 years) so importing with household goods is not an option.   
I managed to find a company that will bring it in a crate for me and also take care of all customs formalities. Riding it here and bringing across the border not easy as insurance is a issue as im not resident in the UK.   
Anyhow, thanks for the tips.

			If going with a bike is your preferred choice, it looks good enough (price not too bad either).   
There are a variety of hand-push trolleys (sackarre) - collapsible or rigid - if you were going with 4- (or more) wheeled transport.   
If yours easily packs into a bag, then you have a few options available .... mine just chucks in the back of the car or trailer - as it's without a bag.   
I have seen in the past, a member who posted pics of his canoe being towed behind his bike.

I look for someone to drive my car with me. I am very familiar with the driving rules in Switzerland but need more practicing driving to pass the freaking hard driving test.  
I live in Basel, close to DB. I can pay 25chf/hour (sorry, fresh graduated last year, limited budget). We can drive 4 to 6 hours per week depending on schedules.  
Please contact me if you are interested. 3 years above, B type license is good enough.    
Thank you!

			As you are new there is something else you need to know.    
Often in Switzerland there are small private roads, with no markings. At the start of a private road or private car park there is a sign at head height, about A5 size in aluminium with black printing, stating ""Verbot"" or ""Mise a ban"" The sign explains that if you do drive or park there, you can be fined CHF xx and there will also be a summary of the law and the judge agreeing the decision.    
I have trawled Google images, and these are the only ones I can find, but they do not look exactly like those I have always seen here,             "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Night Parking Thalwil	goldenc	Posts: 6

			What I did when my sis gave me her car:   
It was on Dutch plates , and I had been here a few years and have a Swiss license.  
Drove it here on her insurance and plates.  
I even got stopped by the police in Germany and asked for all paperwork...they let me on my way.  
Then got into CH and was stopped again as it didnt have the vignette....I said nothing about importing and it was after hours (offices closed). All was fine again which goes against the general believe of importing straight away....maybe it was a fluke but it worked.    
I left Ch again and just turned around right after the border and when I arrived told the lady I wanted to import the car. I got a police escort as you have to exit where the trucks do but I went to far  . The did all the paperwork and the car was ""sold to me for 3k "" which they changed to 3500chf which they believed is the value for the car and chf conversion. In the end I ended up paying closer to 21% of the value ( 751 ish +80 for all docs to be translated and filled in)    
Did that and 3 weeks later I had the appointment to get the emmissions test en the day after the big test. (make appointment as it is someone special for imports)    
Papers needed:  
COC  :150 chf from bmw CH takes 2 weeks 
ALL paperwork from cars first to last registration 
Insurance paperwork   
get it tested , call insurance guy (set this up beforehand as all they have to do then is press enter and you are good)  
get plates and enjoy your new ""free""car

			I can't see a dealer wanting to take the car off your hand for any more than 20k chf - and that is a push. Anyone actively looking for a Megane Estate will be tempted by a 2007 model (retail 14-24k) or the new model (2009) starting at 31k.   
Sorry to say - but it was the wrong car to buy at nearly full list price - and what you saved earlier with a low deposit you will now pay.   
I can't see there to be a ""cheap"" way out of this for you.

You can actually hand in the plates at a main post office as well or post them in.   
The STVA automatically notifies the insurance company.   
CAUTION: if you leave the plates for more than 12 months at the Strassenverkehrsamt, they get cancelled and possibly issued to another person.

The reason is it allows them to boast of better fuel consumption figueres and reduces CO2 outputs, thus asllowing them to creep into a lower tax bracket.    
It is quite a useful gadget if the trafic is stopped for a fixed period of time but when it's creeping forward stop start basis such as at a junction, it can be a pain.

To the OP, I don't see a real saving to make the hassle/cost of going all the way to Hamburg to get a car, driving back, import and registering it, and sticking it through the MFK.  At the end you'll still have a car that's an import which will have a lower resale value than a 'Swiss' car that you can get for similar money. Why won't this ""reputable"" garage do the service anyway? and you need to factor that into your costs too.

			I had a quick look and the same problem. They have an email address but no website.   
You easiest option would be to send the fine (along with the orange paper that it came with) and some cash to cover the fine to one of your colleagues in Vevey. They can then pay it for you. People in Switzerland pay these bills via their e-banking or at the post office. Your bank account is probably not set up to handle something like this.   
Good luck.

			I have to agree with you satans worm. The car you own is for you and no one else. There are few pleasures as nice as owning and driving a Boxster...my old man's had one for 7 years. A Miata is an awesome car too! To me, it's who's driving that matters, not the car...unless of course it's a bright pink Barbie FIAT 500.   
I also happen to think the X1, X3 and X5 are designed for people who like to ride over others and are willing to pay a premium for it. I was very disappointed driving the first generation X3. Compared to a 3er touring of the time, it had barely any additional space and none of the driving excitement. That said, I hear the new one is quite an improvement.   
I like to drive low to the ground, unless it's an old Land Rover.

			It's 30chf per year per child (under 16) for travel within Switzerland. 
When you buy one they give you 2 cards, one for the mother and one for the father, which you have to sign. 
The travel for the kids is then free as long as they are travelling with a parent with a valid ticket.  You can take as many of your own kids with you on any journey and they are all free.

Do people think it would be worthwhile him getting a lesson or two to practice driving on the right before heading in to the course? Do teachers here take non-learners for refresher lessons? I'd be happy to show him but I'm wondering if a professional might instill him with a bit more confidence than little ole me    
I've seen the sticky with the handy website for finding schools so that shouldn't be a problem but of course, recommendations always welcome.   
Any thoughts on what would be best?

			Hi all,  
I just finished importing/registering my car and I thought Id share the experience. Some of the steps are identical to ones already mentioned by other members in other threads, but some are somewhat different so maybe theyll be of use to someone.   
My car is an Opel Astra 1.6 Turbo, 2007 model. All parts original Opel, nothing changed. Car was registered in Greece.   
Before moving to Switzerland, and after researching the forum, I collected all necessary paperwork that I could and translated it all to German.    
My car was financed partially via a bank loan, so the initial registration said full ownership withheld. I had to make sure to get another paper which said that I was now the full owner (process in Greece: first you get confirmation form the bank that you paid in full, then a paper from the dealer and then you take that to the relevant traffic authorities and they give you a dot-matrix-printed piece of paper, which they staple on the original registration!).   
 The papers I translated 
I entered the country January 2012. When my personal belongings later came over, around April, I had made sure to note on the 18.44 that my car (included VIN/chassis number on the form) would arrive later this year. The 18.44 original was kept (for that reason, apparently) by the customs, at Chiasso.    
I asked the customs broker who handled the importation of my belongings to get the original, stamped 18.44 for me last month, and he sent a copy but with the official customs stamp visible. The customs people told him that they were keeping the original, but that this copy was fine for the purpose of getting a 13.20 and importing the car. Note that the customs broker initially told me I had to drive to Chiasso, but when I said that I know people who did it locally, he proceeded to find and send me a copy.   
I had also ordered a CoC from eurococ.eu a while back. It cost 104 and arrived in around 3 weeks. However, its NOT an original (more on this below)   
My car entered the country about 4 months ago (August), brought over by a relativeand therefore he could not stop at the border and import it for me. Due to a lot of work, I delayed the importation, but the time came that I could not delay it anymore, and had to start the process    
I had arranged for a green card (international insurance) from Greece, and renewed it after it expired. The car was theoretically covered at all times.   
Steps followed for the importation:   
Went to the customs at Embrach (Embraport, building Z1, first floor). Dealt with a very nice young guy, speaking excellent English. He asked for the following  
Note that at some point he forgot I had given him a 18.44, so he told me I can fill one on the spot, for the purpose of importing the car. This may be an option for someone, i.e., if the original 18.44 is missing/is lost. He then saw the one I gave him, so we proceeded with that one.   
He did NOT want the CoC, my drivers license or the insurance green card, though I asked.   
What I got back, after waiting for around 40 minutes 
Next day I get, via registered mail, a letter from the STVA, with instructions on what to do to register my car! That was truly impressive   
Anyway, now to start the registration process. The main point here is that your car needs to pass an inspection (MFK), to prove that its up to Swiss standards, etc. You book an appointment with them to do the test (plan ahead, as some members quoted 6 to 8 weeks wait times!), but in order to book the appointment you need to do two things:    
First thing, arrange for insurance. I had already discussed with saint7uk a while back, but he could not start the process until the car was imported. Now that I had the 13.20, I informed him and sent him the Stamm number found on it. He sent a nachweiss to the STVA, proving that I had coverage, so I could then proceed to the second step   
Second thing is to get an abgastest (emissions test). Checked the local Opel dealer, and he could only book a test in 2 weeks! (I asked but how long does the test take? and he said 1 hour! I guess a good sign I was going to be charged a full hours worth of labor) Knowing that the registration appointment could take up to 8 weeks, and with time running out, I checked for alternatives.    
I called a local, smaller garage, and the guy spoke good enough English. Said I could come the next morning for the test. I went over the next morning, but he pointed out that I did not have the small booklet that they record the results on (abgaswartung document). I went to the Opel Dealer again, paid 37 CHF, got it in around 40 minutes. I had all my car papers with me, I believe they copied some data off the original registration (date of first registration, and VIN maybe)   
Next morning I go to the smaller garage again, got the test done, cost:60CHF (duration: about 5 minutesthey plug a handheld computer directly to the console/engine getting readings directly from the car computer). Wrote the results on the booklet, also put a sticker on the window (next test: in 2 years) 
Now I had fulfilled both of the preconditions for booking the appointment.   
While in the garage, I told the mechanic that I also needed a yearly service, a set of winter tires and wheels, a pre-MFK test (which would include a nice cleaning of car and engine) and that if he was willing to take the car to the test himself Id do all of these in his garage   He said he does that, and also took all my papers and booked the appointment for me. The appointment was set for a week later and he booked at Winterthur.    
The papers I gave him for the appointment were 
After making the appointment, he told me to bring him the original CoC  I had given him a photo copy only. But the original had a watermark printed on it saying no original, and he was worried it may not be accepted as an original CoC . I sent an email to the eurococ people, and they replied (the next day) that its an official paper they themselves get from Opel. Its not _original_, since the original CoC was issued when the car was manufactured (2007). So we took our chances.    
The MFK did not care apparently, and the car passed the test. I got the car back with shiny new Swiss plates on, new registration paper and new winter tires and wheels. The MFK told the garage guy that the CoC was indeed not original, but they issued the registration anyway. I was told to keep the CoC along with the abgas booklet and the registration in the car at all times.   
I then sent the new plate numbers to saint7uk, so he could proceed with insurance. Took a picture of the car with the Swiss plates, shared with friends and family (""achievement unlocked"")    
Notes:    
hope this helps

			We are UK ex-pats and recently brought our car over to Switzerland. We were advised to get Macaron parking permit, which we did for Zone K. But the problem is for the last week we spend about 45 mins to an hour going round and round looking for a free parking bay.    
It is really tiring and such a waste of time. I am wondering if someone could advice us if there are parts of Zone K that are less used than others or alternate ways we can hire cheapish parking place.   
Thanks so very much.   
Regards

			Tickets bought from automatic machines are non transferable and non refundable, and for use on and at printed times and destination. 
Always need to check T&Cs - or better still buy from the ticket office and get a receipt.   
Ah, well ..... never mind.

			I don't think the Swiss will care as you are not going to be driving here.  I would think that as long as it hasn't expired, you can use it as much as you like.  However, if you move to Canada, you will need to follow the rules there.

I called DSA, DVLA, and the local test centre everyone says the same.   
The problem doing it here is  
1. 5000 is the quote from the school 
2. Its in french 
3. If you fail 3 times you cant sit it again for 5years and need to see a phsyc

The German says: ""for any number of trips in any direction within the time limit""      Actually, if your ticket is valid till 3:24 and your are still on bus/train/tram on 3:25 you will no longer have a valid ticket and may get fined. Unless, there was a delay and the time of arrival would have been within the tickets validity (but I am not 100% sure about that). Also be careful about the other why round a 9-o-clock ticket is valid from 9:00 sharp, if the train is scheduled to leave at 8:59 you may not board the train.

The terminals inside these cells are constructed from a net containing a lead paste. Over time the paste falls out of the net, to the bottom of the battery casing. When it forms a high enough little hill and it will short circuit the cell, resulting in a loss of voltage.    
If you jump start the car it can run on the lower voltage, but even after a long journey there will not be enough good cells to start the car. The short circuit effect can happen suddenly, and you will only notice when you try to start the engine using the battery. You can measure the battery voltage with a volt meter and see it is low.    
The TCS keep a log of visits to your car. They are a rescue service, not a mobile garage. If they come a second time for the same problem you can be charged. Read the small print.

""Note: If your driving test was not passed in the designated country that issued your current driving licence you may not be able to exchange, please contact us for advice by phoning 0300 790 6801.""   
The probable reason would be that in the UK you have a separate test category that only allows use of automatic cars, so to get a normal licence you'll have to have passed a test in a manual (stick), which isn't required in the US. It may be possible though to exchange, via the Swiss one, for a UK auto-only one. Anyway, I'm sure a quick call to the number above will answer your questions.

			If you live in Zurich and your wife commutes to Basel, she can expect anything up to a 2 hour commute door-to-door unless you live in Zürich HB and your wife's work is next to the Basel SBB. I know because I did Claraplatz, Basel to Zürich Kappeli for 5 years.   
Your 2.5 hourly commute to Lausanne will mean that you will be ships passing in the night.   
Sounds like your best option is a place at ETHZ and living in Zürich as only one of you ends up with a crappy commute.   
In answer to your question about the first class GA, I can't remember the exact prices - about 3 grand for a 2nd class and over 5 grand for a 1st class; it depends on how crowded the train gets on your particular route. I had to travel on the airport train to Altstetten each day. It was worth having the 1st class for the extra few inches of albow and legroom plus you often got a little writing table in the carriage with a powerpoint for the laptop - if you need to study or work.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			My experience with one of these generic, Chinese made car media players was not particularly good. They appear to be feature packed, however the implementation was often lacking e.g. frequent crashes, freezing, poor quality audio/amplification and really, really bad GPS (with no TMC). There are ways to hack them to run TomTom for WinCE, but it is far from straightforward and again not all features will work.   
I would get a brand name car stereo (e.g. Kenwood, Clarion etc..) which will have GPS, Video, Music etc.. and just use a double DIN adaptor. It will cost more, but you will benefit from a robust interface, features that work and regular firmware updates.

			In contrast to some of the posts above (including mine!), I've just attempted to buy my return ticket from Basel to Stuttgart.   
At Basel BB they would sell a ticket, although the starting point would be marked as Basel SBB.  The discount wasn't great and the price at the counter was the same as if using the SBB website and entering the fact you have a Halbtax card.   
Although it's been stated above that one can use the German website bahn.de to book, and select Bahncard 25, I was told at the counter that this isn't allowed, as the Halbtax only gives discounts on non-special offer tickets, which the web (and the German ticket machines) routinely price.   
I emailed Deutschebahn about doing this (showing Halbtax to a ticket inspector after buying a Bahncard 25 reduction) and got the following reply      "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Rail Plus & train connections abroad	alsbergt	Posts: 203

			Hi, I just wanted to say a big thank you to all who responded to my question, Basel airport to lorrach, it was indeed a great help .   
I subsequently had to make the journey from Oxford to Lorrach on four more occasions, until he was discharged from hospital, and is now on the mend.   
Thanks once again.

			In addition to what  said above, I'll share some of my experience from my time working with Volkswagen.  At the time I was working there, they had overproduced several models.  Rather than discounting the price of the new car (which could undermine overall pricing power as well as hurting the value of used cars), the company came up with a clever way of flooding their network with 'nearly new' vehicles that could be sold at a discount alongside 'new' vehicles, in a bid to increase sales overall.   
Staff (and contractors) were allowed to lease these cars at incredibly low rates -- I leased a Seat Ibiza for around CHF90- per month -- on the condition that they were returned after 3 months or 5'000km, whichever happened first.     
My boss, at the time, had a long commute of nearly 150km each way.  She would get a new car every few weeks as she hit the mileage threshold.  It seemed crazy, but actual the economics behind it (for VW's sales network) were very sound.

			Going back to the original question.  Does anyone know of a good place to get 2nd hand auto parts?  Particularly around the Fribourg area.   
I'm sure there's got to be some auto junkyards that would be more than happy to recycle their parts by selling them back to those who need them.

We have travelled in first class many times with our son using the junior travel card. 
It was a ticket inspector on the train who advised us to get one when we were here for a visit once. We were in first class at the time and he said they were valid for whichever class the parents ( or grandparents) were using.

			Five millimeter tread depth at the beginning of the season is a general rule of thumb for winter tires.  Match up your five years and five millimeters to determine if your tires are any good.

			Personally, I think that the auto stop/start is fine if you're driving a hybrid which can get moving with electric power then have the engine kick later. But if you are sitting at an intersection, you need to be able to move immediately instead of waiting for the engine to ""boot up"".    
As a motorcyclist, you learn to sit at an intersection with the bike in gear and the clutch engaged, so that you can immediately move if a car coming from behind fails to brake in time. Sure, getting rear-ended in my Audi won't be quite as painful as getting knocked off my Suzuki, but if I can avoid the contact all together by rolling forward a few meters, I want to leave this option open. And not have to wait 1-2 seconds until the car decides that I might need the engine.

			GT3 is not a Tesla rival.   
If you want to be pedantic you should be comparing an Elise to a Tesla. The Elise will return 40mpg on a steady cruise.   
Even the GT3 you quoted is good for 30mpg (9.4 l/100km) on a steady run.   
However, the simple CO2 calculation is rather simplistic view. Firstly, rising CO2 levels have typically been the resultant of a global warming and not the cause, and secondly, a high CO2 producing car is quickly outweighed by a car that travels a lot of Kms.   
A GT3 that does 5000km a year is going to pump out less CO2 than a family car (150g/km) that does 15000km. One is demonised, one is not.   
All cars kill kittens - and I don't see the Tesla to be any cleaner than any other.

			Eurail is only available to people who do not live in Europe, so if you live in CH, you will not be able to buy one.  Interrail is the equivalent available for people who live in Europe, and then only for countries other than where you live.  As others have pointed out, there are a number of restrictions on what trains either Eurail or Interrail passes can be used for, in particular France is quite restricted in what you can use it for.

			you can drive in the US on a Swiss license and you can also rent. As far as I know you will need a credit card and must be over 25 years old.   
If your credit card does not cover your insurance you can check on purchasing 3rd party insurance --insuring directly from the rental company can add a significant cost.   
I frequently rent from Avis and Hertz and have never had any problems renting. I've also been pulled over for speeding there and didn't have a problem with the license.

			Will you be living in Switzerland or France. Your current location is France so if you are living there you'll probably need to register the car in France unless there is a special arrangement for 'Frontaliers' (but I don't know anything about that).   
If you're registering the car in Switzerland then the first thing you need to do is organise insurance. You won't get a new 'carte grise' until you can prove to them that you have insurance. The insurance company can easily send details of your insurance to the registration office electronically so it should be pretty easy to sort that out today. The 'carte grise' from the owner will have all the info necessary for the insurance but the original owner should have already cancelled it (should have annule stamped on it). You won't be able to drive the car until you get the licence plates. 
All this is only true for Switzerland. I can't remember exactly how it works in France bit IIRC it was exactly the same procedure.

			Just registered my car this morning, and all you need is the grey book (previous owner has that) and make sure you have got car insurance. Here in the Swiss, as soon as you confirm the insurance, the company send it to the Strassenverkmpt (or how ever you spell it) electronically.    
Once there, they confirm your personal details, ask you to select a number plate size and also a actual plate i.e. they have a list of number plate numbers that you can choose from...   
Then you go over to the other counter, they give you the plates and a new grey book to show that you are the new owner.    
The road tax is also automatically done for you once you register it.    
Now am just waiting for the bills to come in the post...dreading that! :-)   
PS didnt need any Ausweiss or ID, they just did it right away.

You could park it in a surrounding country, and then never enter Switzerland with it, though.   
But, if you live here, you can only use Swiss registered vehicle within Switzerland.

Well roundabouts (rond-point, Carrefour giratoire) work as they do anywhere else in the world - once you're on, you have right of way.  But there are older 'places' in Paris that still stick to the 'priorite a droite' - this is where you have to constantly give way to the right.  Once of the worst places for this is 'Place de la Bastille', and IIRC 'Place de la Concorde'.        Sounds about right.  Despite the bad press, Paris waiters are actually very good.

			The price of mobility will correspond with the price of rental car (in Switzerland) because the rental cars will be charged by mileage too. So perhaps it might be 20-30% cheaper but it will depend.    
I didn't want to mention my insurance because it is based on my nationality, I pay 2700 a year for full casco insurance, where as a British or Swiss person probably will pay 50% less.

re. the handling of the car...he was a bit nervous and tentative... I expected that but the thing I was really concerned with...   
we were coming to a left hand turning, I told him about it in plenty of time and told him to be cautions and observe the road... we got to the turning and he slowed to an almost complete stop ( good ) then proceeded to pull directly in front of a car coming towards us which was maybe 10 meters away.   
then he stalled.    
when I asked him what had happened he said he was ""observing the road"" by looking in his side view mirror and then when faced with the car dead ahead he dropped the clutch and stalled.   
next lesson ( if there is one) will be in a parking lot practicing starts and stops.

			Indeed, Geneva taxis are obliged to accept all fares (I suspect within the canton at least). 
Solutions: 
1) Remain in the cab and don't move - you're depriving the cabby of a fare and he'll probably give up and take you. 
2) Report to the police. They do take this seriously.

Switzerland is free to come up with a new license plate design which follows the convention w/o joining the EU. (They may do shortly before Zurich or Berne will have more than 1 Million registered cars)       And as long as a Swiss car is only driven in Switzerland no CH Sticker is needed. And when a Iranian car which has IR as part of the license plate comes into Switzerland no IR sticker is needed. And when a German, French, or Belgian car w/o the blue stripe enters Switzerland the corresponding Sticker is   needed. But   nobody cares. (And as we will see later inside the EU too when such a car leaves its home country.)      The OP asked what laws applies to a Swiss car in a foreign country. 
You linked Swiss law that applies to foreign cars that enter Switzerland, how the hell does it apply to a Swiss car driving in a foreign country? Switzerland has (nearly) no jurisdiction on things happening aboard.   
Now here comes the funny thing. The law you linked to is actually not only Swiss, but Iranian, Belgium, and German law altogether. It is international law and known as the  , you can find   at the UNECE. See, nothing to do with the EU at all, but indeed with with Iran.       Why ruin the paint of the car for an event that is a) very unlikely to happen b) can be solved with a spare sticker from the glove box?

			For a 10 year old Honda, you're going to have problems, just take a look around atr the number of second hand cars on the forecourts.....then look at the deals for new cars and you'll see what i mean.   
Take the first offer you get, put it on hear for same price, if it doesn't sell, give it to the dealer for the agreed price.   
Sorry to be brutal, but think at best, very low thousands.

People realise its a right-has-priority junction (which it shouldn't be due to the relative traffic density and poor visibility) too late, slightly swerve to the left instictively and subsequently get glanced by the tram. Of course its easy to say 'well if you saw the sign you should know right has priority' but this happens so often that its obviously a problem for many people.

""Achtung: Gleis 7 ist im ZVV nur auf den Linien der SBB, THURBO und SOB gültig.""   
Only valid on SBB, THURBO and SOB, which doesn't include the SZU (the S4 and S10 are operated by the SZU, not the SBB). Not valid on buses, trams, the Felseneggbahn, etc.   
In other words, you are out of luck.

These cars are super intelligent, with lots of diagnostic info.  
BUT you need to have the original BMW diagnostic computer to read all of the info - so go to a proper authorized BMW dealer, or an independent BMW garage with the right equipment. Leave those small town garages alone.

			Hi  ,   
I don't want to be a stick in the mud here, but an XC90 with only 110'000 on the clock at CHF 13'000 sounds a little dodgy to me tbh. I hope you have done a lot of research concerning the model, year, etc before you part with your money.   
Having looked at XC90 myself (before opting for a different make), this model surely goes for more (on average) than what you have found...   
As the saying goes: If it seems too good to be true... (and you know the rest)

			The specs vary somewhat by canton, for example here and in some other cantons (Zurich, when I lived there) you are allowed to remove the blinkers.   
The only OEM stuff that you MUST have here (Ticino) is the mufflers, brakes, and wheels, pretty much anything else passes no problem.   
Question is, did the 2001 GS have cats in Switzerland or not?

			I bought a secondhand car 1-1/2 years ago, the dealer ""threw in"" a 12-month Quality1 5-Star warranty.   
It was around about CHF 1000 for the 12-months coverage, which of course was built into the selling price of the car....   
In that 12 months the car racked up about CHF 1500 in repairs that were mostly covered by Quality1, minus the excess which you have to pay.   
The excess amount increases based on the age of the car, a five year old car has a 15% excess from memory.   
So in theory the warranty paid for itself, just...but that was the 5-Star one, the lesser policies (let's face it, the warranty is really just an insurance policy) don't cover everything and might not be worth anything in the end....

To register the car within the canton of Neuchatel was no problem. They never even asked me for my drivers licence (I am using my Irish one) they just took a copy of my L permit and took my money and I was free to leave with my new Swiss plates, no problems at all....

			Thank you all for your replies and warnings, I know you mean well.   
I am sincerely sorry to hear about your bike being stolen biff, but even if you had one of ""these stickers"" (that no longer exist btw) you still wouldn;t be covered. A vignette only covers damages to others, so in case of theft you need to have a home owners insurance or a separate bike insurance that costs significantly more than a vignette.   
I would also like to note a few things. Firrst off, if someone removed a front/rear wheel from a bike then the bike was not locked properly it's as simple as that. Then, even if you have a lock and lock the bike properly (both wheels tied to the frame and to an unmovable object), if the lock is easily cut then a bike is still an easy target. So those cable or weak chain locks and almost any lock that costs less than 100 francs is next to useless to properly secure a bike with. What I'm trying to say is that of course bikes are being stolen, and most likely they are also locked, but that doen't mean that a bike is never secure since there are locks (and most importantly attitudes) that can make a bike pretty secure.   
All being told, I am a bit unease and I will not bring my nice bike to Zurich after all. I will keep it safe in my family house and get a (more) inexpensive bike to use around town. Thank you again all for your input though!

Thats the price of buying a second hand car you get it cheaper based on the risk something may need replacing. The warranty is usually only intended to cover large expensive items and depending on the age of the car it will also have conditions so if the car is past 100K in distance dont expect it to cover much.

I tried to call my husband who is Swiss, no answer so I called our Lawyer and she then explained to me that we had apparently received a traffic ticket but my husband had completed the form and signed his name and that was wrong because the radar pictures showed it was a woman. Trouble is, we have one car.. we share it on a daily basis so it's hard to tell who was where and when. The policeman understood that and did not doubt me especially because our lawyer had explained what was going on but I'm still in shock that the police have a right to come to your door at 6.00pm and demand that you provide an explanation as to why a traffic ticket was incorrectly completed and demand for your personal information. I must add that i live in a VERY small village and we stick out along with two other families one from D.C. and the other from Chicago. I'M VERY, VERY, disturbed by this incident.

thanks a lot - was still quick! Have to admit though that I feel that difference to Swiss price levels is not big enough as this is just 10% less than a Swiss car. See this one for example -    
Don't forget that the Swiss BMWs have free service for 100,000km - that has a value of around 3000 I would guess. Plus no hassles with the warranty.

			Just to share my experiance. I imported my Honda CBR 600 from the UK when I first moved here. I simply made an appointment at the MFK Zurich, took all the paper work with me and 30 mins later had the ausweise for my bike. The tester noted that the lights are for UK roads but let it go through anyway.   
I recently had my Buell tested and had to remove the street legal Remus exhaust because it was to loud. Its best to put your bike back to as close as standard as possible if you want to avoid a retest. They are pretty strict!

P.S. I have a 750kg trailer and this is the maximum permitted total load - the weight of the trailer (150kg), plus payload (600kg - this is recorded on the grey card).   
Trailer weights are recorded as max. combined/gross weights - so 2000kg trailer probably weighs only 250ish kg but it's still a 2000kg and cannot be towed on a B.   
 750kg is the maximum trailer weight combination permitted with a B category.

			Hi all, 
We came to switzerland 2 years ago from the UK, we transfered our UK driving license's across to the Swiss driving license. However we did not have the Category D1 put on the Swiss license although i still have the orignal paper copy of my UK license with this category on.   
I have asked the Strassenverksamt if i can now have this category put on my license as i have been offered a part time job. They have said that i now need to do a full theory test, driving test and have a medical.  
My question is has anybody else had this problem and how did they get around it. 
If i need to do a test could i go back to the UK to do the test as it is cheaper their even though i still have this category on uk license and will the Swiss authorities except me doing it this way.   
Thanks in advance for help and suggestions.

So far the OP got 5 hours and the instructor requests an other paid session of 2.5h, makes a total of 7.5h. Still a 1/2h short of the legal requirement. Report this crook.

			I would totally agree with some previous replies. Swiss rail especially when you don't possess any discount cards is remarkably expensive. If you use GVA you can try sixt. I think their prices are somewhat lower when compared with other companies e.g. Hertz. Try also to pick up and return the car at the same location if possible as it will be much cheaper.

			My personal experience importing and registering a car from the USA to BaselLandschaft. This was also declared as part of my household goods, so I did not have to pay import duty.     
  Vehicle details: 2003 BMW 5 series with Xenon HL, autoleveling sensor, HL washer, 18"" wheels and Kuhmo 245-40-ZR18 97W spec tires, DINAN strut bar.     
  1. replace yellow reflector HL lens with clear reflectors (piece of cake, done by myself) 
  2. Warning Triangle: purchased from Ebay for USD 15, fits like glove in the trunk where all the tools belong (If you own a BMW, you know there is a compartment in the trunk that you can store a few tools) 
  3. First Aid kit: USD 20 (this is optional in Switzerland, but is required in Germany) 
  4. Make sure there is no excess oil/fluid residue inside the engine compartment, the MFP people do look for leaks (big or small).  I maintained my own car way above and beyond, not a drop of oil/liquid can be found, the inspector was very surprised for a 9 year-old car. 
  5. If shipped with household goods, ensure that you detailed it in the 18.44 form. You will need this origianl form back from the shpping company. 
  6. Take off the license plates before you hand the car to the shipper, take the plates with you in your luggage (not in the shipment of the household goods).     
  1. First registration document, i.e. the vehicle identification card from the first time the car was registered (this is easy if you keep all your records and are the original owner. If you bought the vehicle used, please don't ask me how to get the first registration document, because I would not know. Sorry) 
  2. Vehicle owner's manual (put sticky on the pages that show the specifications of your car, e.g. weight, dimension, engine size, etc. The MFP will be more than happy to serve you if they felt that you have done your homework). 
  3. License plates      
  Any freight forwarder you want (whatever flows your boat). Cost varies. The shipper will tell you what you need to provide them (in general, the vehicle title and you need to general a EIN from the US federal government in order for you to export your vehicle. If you have to ship your household goods, you probably would have done that step already).     
  Depends on how you arranged for your shipment, you either paid to have the car deliver to your residence in Switzerland or you pick it up at the port. I chose to have the shipper deliver to my house. Make sure you get the 13.20A from the shipper. It has the Stem number that you will need in order to obtain insurance and to register.     
  This is the sucky part, there are not too many insurance companies will insure vehicles with foreign plates. Also things to consider is that when you try to register the vehicle in Baselland, the regulation requires you to have insurance from a Swiss company, i.e. not company from the UK, or elsewhere. For this,  I ended up with the big ""Z"", not the internet establishment, but the actual retail establishment and meet with the real insurance agent. Again, you don't have a choice.     
  Bring - 
  1. Original 13.20A form that has the zoll stamp and stem number 
  2. Original 18.44 form  
  3. Proof of insurance (the insurance company can send that electronically to the MFK ahead of time) 
  4. Obtain an appointment date for the MFP inpection     
  1. Get the Abgas document from your car brand's dealership. I paid CHF 125 for a BMW dealer here in Basel to prepare the AbgasDoc. The Abgas dokument is a requirement and you cannot avoid. 
  2. Wash the car. It is easier for them to inspect with a clean car than a car covered with mud and dirt.      
  1. Bring along your appoint sheet from the MFK 
  2. Bring the vehicle owner's manual, first registration document, 13.20A, and 18.44. 
  3. Show up 10 mintures before my appointment time. Your appointment will also tell you which lane you are supposed to line up. 
  4. Paid the CHF 240 fee and then patiently wait for your turn. 
  5. Cooperate with the technician. (for me, the tech was very polite and courteous)    
  They do check the car thoroughly, above and below, engine compartment, suspension, steering, wheels, brakes,  etc. The whole process took about 30 minutes and another 30 minutes for him to write up everything. At the end, my car passed with flying colors, and I was handed the documents back and was told to go to  the MFK to obtain the Swiss plates.   
  That was all. Not much drama. To be honest, I was worry about the 18"" wheels and the strut bar, but the tech didn't seem to be picking on them.   
  That said. I was considering paying some company to register for me, but at the end, I could not find a company that would care to respond or would not charge you an arm and a leg. I called the MFK and emailed the MFP several times to get some clarity on the process. In general, they are happy to help. So, why not do it myself and save some really money!

			I am also planning a move from Switzerland to the US (mid-west). I have found that some moving companies will not take a small load of only a few boxes, so you have to look around.   
The quote from Swiss Moving Service I received was CHF 2,950 for 3m cubed;  3,550 for 4m cubed; 3950 for 5m cubed.  Moving nearer a port would be less expensive.   
Has anyone had good experience with other moving companies?

Talk about the strong Euro a lot.  They will discount on the car and maybe throw in more extras.

			The way I see it, you were still lucky. Had you hit 74 on your speedo your license would have been revoked for 1 month. This way you will only get reprimanded.   
You will still be fined several hundred francs (sorry).   
If in the next two years they catch you with anything more than 65 (68 indicated) in a zone 50, your license will be revoked for 1 month or more.   
That is, if foreigners get treated the same way as the Swiss, which is kind of what I assume.   
I am sorry for you because I understand your situation. Our traffic laws really suck. Which makes people drive even worse and it is sometimes hard to bear.

			As I mentioned, try and get a newer one        
Alfa Romeo has finished in the top ten brands for customer satisfaction, making a mockery of its old unreliable tag.   
The Italian brand has been revamped in recent years with the likes of the Alfa Romeo MiTo supermini and Alfa Romeo Giulietta and has quickly shed the unwanted image.   
This has been confirmed after the brand finished tenth in the J.D. and Associates 2011 UK Vehicle Ownership Satisfaction Study (VOSS) based on scores from customers of the brands.   
Alfa scored 805 points out of a possible 1000, ahead of the industry average. It also finished seventh in the Vehicle Appeal Index category, emphasising how desirable Alfa Romeo cars are. Head of Brand for Alfa Romeo UK, Damien Dally, says: This is fantastic news for both Alfa Romeo and our dealer partners as we enter our second century.    
To be placed tenth in overall customer satisfaction performance is a great achievement and clearly demonstrates the improvements in customer service, ownership appeal and quality that are being made at Alfa Romeo.""   
Alfa Romeo has been known as an evocative, stylish and iconic brand in the past, with a fierce racing history and a recommendation from Top Gear, which says any petrol head needs to own one at some point.   
The great strides made by the manufacturer in recent years are highlighted by the use of Fiat Groups award-winning engine range. For example, the Alfa Romeo MiTo uses the MultiJet diesel and MultiAir petrol engines to lower CO2 emissions and improve fuel efficiency in its smallest car.   
Alfa Romeo has sold 12,000 MiTo cars since the 2009 launch, and similar success has been attributed to the Giulietta hatchback, Alfas answer to the Ford Focus.   
The two-strong range of new Alfa Romeo cars will be expanded next year when the Giulia saloon is introduced to replace the 159.      "	an excellent reputation	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 3 Times in 2 Posts	Thoughts on buying Alfa Romeo (159): Dumb Idea?	parkadam	Posts: 215

			Hopefully, this will still be of help: In Friedlingen/Weil am Rhein (D), across (100 m) ""Rheincenter"" there is free public car park; 15 minutes walk to Kleinhüningen, from where you can take the tram - or cycle to Basel center in 15 minutes. Free, public parking also in Huningue (F), either down at the old ferry port (near pedestrian bridge over Rhine river), in the town center or on the N/E side of ""parc des eaux vives""; during the week, take bus # 3 to Basel-Schifflände for 1.10 € or cycle to Basel center in 15 minutes, too.

			So, I finally had time to do this. 
Here it is how it works. I do bieve the solution is quite generic, so it might solve other problems as well in a similar way.   
You go to the station, and ask for the modification. They take your old pass, and give you a new one, with the new conditions (for me new zones, for instance), valid from the day of this action, or any date later (but not the original validity date). You pay for the new pass, and what is the key of the whole process is that they refund the remaining days of your old pass. 
My was valid for abt. for 3 more weeks, so I got refunded 81 CHF, and therefore paid 34 for a new monthly pass valid from today for a month (original price would be 115 CHF).

			I want to get my own driving license in Switzerland, after finishing the driving-school in another country (Romania). Basically I passed the theoretical exam and had driving lessons, but haven't had enough time to take the actual driving exam for a license. Can't really go back to Romania because the ""school"" evidence is expired so I would have to start from scratch therefore I want to get it in Switzerland, more precisely in Bern.    
I have read about it and apparently I need 8 hours of (here I was confused...of learning how to drive carefully?!) and 10 hours of first-aid lessons. Then I can take the theoretical exam and I get a temporary 2-year driving license. Then in these 2 years, I'm supposed to learn how to drive (which I already did in Romania) and take the driving exam, right? Please correct me if I haven't understood the process fully.   
What I'm mostly interested now: has anyone done the 8+10 hours of preparation stuff around Bern? Where exactly? And I'd need them in english because my german and/or french are really low.   
Thank you!

			The problem you will probably come up against is, the Canton will refuse plates until it passes the MFK.    
You can rent a trailer here      
You would be exporting the car into Germany, so you might need to get the correct paperwork from an import-export specialist.    
You could join the TCS and they would give you free advice.    
Another possibility is to get transit plates for one or two days, from the Cantonal registration people. Expensive, but include tax & insurance.       
You would need a certificate from an approved garage for a vehicle that is off the road longer than a year,       
More info:

			Usually people from the police in switzerland are very easy going. Not comparable with other countries. You as an foreigner should know you get away with such a trifle easy. If stopped, tell them you did not know about you did wrong and beeing stressed of relocating to marocco the next month.   
The fine will be 40.- in this case. It is a ""Ordnungsbusse"" and not to be handled by a judge. If you have disobeyed other road signs then it is a 100.- fine, stil an ""Ordnungsbusse"".

			I also used my US driver license to convert to Swiss one. You need to be able to show them that you have at least 3 years of driving experience in the US (I showed them my old US driver license) and that your current one is not expired. Otherwise, they would not let you convert.

			It really depends on which type of fare you want.  I believe the t-l at Flon also does train passes as well, because they took my coupons for railchecks there (normally used for CFF tickets).     
My husband has a monthly pass for all buses in Lausanne, plus round trip train to Gland, and all regional buses in between.  He only needs to go to a t-l office (or machine) to renew his pass.  If he wants to go, for example, to Geneva, his pass works just until Gland, then he buys a ticket in Lausanne for Gland-Geneva round-trip.  (If you plan to something do this, DON'T take a direct Lausanne-Geneva, it doesn't work! You'd have to take a train that stops at Gland for the pass to take effect).   
It is possible to get a combination train+bus pass, you just need to see which transport you are going to use the most, to see which will be cheaper in the long term.

			I recently had my Swedish driving license replaced with a Swiss one and today it finally arrived. Unfortunately I still had probation time on my Swedish license when I handed it in and therefore I'll have to do the ""2-Phasenausbildung"" before the time period expires.    
This makes me a bit nervous since my German leaves a lot to be desired so I'd love if you could tell me a bit about how you experienced the course? Were good German skills required and did you have to talk a lot? Do you have to pass theoretical and practical tests? If yes, how did it work?

			you'll find out exactly what the score is when they process the change of owner and issue a new grey card for the vehicle.   
in simple terms, they will then issue an invitation for an MFK and that's it.   
for the exhaust check, take it to a garage and see what is needed for MFK and get the test done and card stamped then.

			What we need is a good manual on how to drive manual. *groan*   
But seriously, when I had to teach myself, I found the best way to do it, is to give a bit more gas (till just before you hear the engine really revving), then ease off the clutch as slowly and gently as humanly possible. For the first few times, even if you are easing as slowly/gently as you think you can, ease it even slower. It takes time, and best not to do it in traffic, but once you feel it catching (ease EVEN more slower :P) then you can reduce the accelerometer to a comfortable start.    
And whenever you're not on the gas, have the clutch depressed.    
Maybe not the best methods, but it worked for me when I was 16, and stuck.

			Thought I would share this with petrolheads looking for soul mates or a fun way to spend a sunday morning.   
Every first sunday of the month, enthusiasts meet up in Nyon at 9am to hang out in a parking lot around cars which are usually sporty, classic - sometimes both in the spirit of the famed Crystal Cove gathering. The next one is coming up this Sunday (08/05) so don't miss it ! Location is convenient, not far from the A1 Nyon exit, very close to the site of the Paleo Festival.   
All details are  . No registration, just show up and mingle !

			Yes, my experience has not matched some people's here, so better to check early in your specific canton.    
I was told I  had a year or would need to re-do everything (including the road exam). I brought a photo, the form, an eye exam, and my license. They took it all and will mail them back to me (I think it takes about a month). I didn't need to have a record, but rather remember the year that I passed the exam in Canada. I've received the bill, but not the license yet.    
Also useful if you have a motorcycle license in Canada to point this out clearly to the staff person taking your info, and clarify it's for the ""big"" motorcycles (not scooters). In Alberta they put class 5 and 6 next to each other, which ends up looking like class 56.

			Hi   
Difficult to say, as back in UK I'd do my own mostly. Then had a VTR in France for a few years before moving to Zurich. The only service I've paid for here was the 1500km one on my Pan European. That was okay for me, didn't think it was too expensive. Bought the Fireblade 2 months ago, which had just had the 24,000km service done, so no idea on costs, sorry. 
Having 2 bikes and a car, none of them do that many Km a year, so for me, services are spread out quite well. 
Maybe I've just been here too long and am  now used to Swiss prices, please help.   
Hope you decide on one soon, while we still have some of the season left :-) And then come along for a rideout with the rest of us.   
Chris

			I think the one hour extension ticket with halb-tax (which you should get if you'll travel around at all) is 2.90 chf, if I recall correctly.  I don't know the price of the full day extension ticket, probably around 5 chf (prices without halbtax can be seen here:  ).  Since the price difference between 2 and 3 zone monthly cards is 36 chf, that leaves you about 12 one hour extension tickets before the 3 zone starts paying off, and roughly 6-7 full day ones.

3645	13.03.2012, 14:58	Senior Member	Thanked 144 Times in 102 Posts	Location: NA	"    From my own experience, it's always better to buy your car from a dealership that sells the same brand. You're more likely to get a car that they have known for years, you'll almost always get a 12-month full warranty, whereas those places specialising in selling used cars tend to have ""Quality 1"" or something related (*). You usually have to go to the same dealership if something breaks, however.    
Here's my list:   
1. Same-brand dealership 
2. different brand dealership 
3. Larger ""car discounts"" 
4. Smaller independent garages 
5. Yard-sale type snake-oil sellers   
1. + 2. are usually ok, while 3-5 are usually crap. I've had so many bad experiences with 3-5 that I'll never buy a car from those places again.   
Unfortunately, you'll find no. 5 most frequently here in Switzerland. Stay away from these.    
Peter   
*) ""Quality 1"", ""All-In"" etc. aren't actual warranties. These are insurance policies. As such, they always carry deductibles (which can be extremely high, depending on your policy). Also, as these insurance policies actually make the garage you bring your car to pay 10% of the repair costs, they're not very popular among repair shops. I've been told many times by repair shops that they won't repair my car under Quality 1 ""warranty"" because of that. So while they're usually better than having no warranty at all, these insurance policies are worth a lot less than a normal 12-month warranty.

This only works if you are living in Europe and not earning any income - this works out for me because I'm a student there. Most European countries lets you rent the full one year - unfortunately Swtizerland being Switzerland only lets you rent 6 months. Some of these so called buy back programs are Renault Eurodrive, Peugeout Open Europe, etc.

			It depends which office you go to - and probably which Canton you live in. We got the forms, filled them out, had an eye test at a local opticians & got the forms approved by the controle des habitants to confirm our residence information.  
We first went to the local offices of the Service des Automobiles et de la navigation in Aigle. We were due to leave on holiday within a few days so they suggested we went to the main office in Lausanne because they could print the licenses immediately whereas Aigle would have to send everything to Lausanne for processing - we did so and got our liceneses within about 30 minutes.    
To speed up the process we surrendered our right to a Category C licence - in the UK you used to get automatic right to drive up to 7.5 tonnes GVW with your car (cat B) licence. Here that is classed as a professional licence so you have to take a medical and get a police report of some kind - since we were in a hurry and have never used the category C we decided not to bother.

			Hello,   
I have a driver's license, but it's been a number of years since I've been driving.  Does anyone know where I can a get some refresher driving lessons in Geneva to review and get accustomed to driving again?  Any idea of approximate price?  Thanks.

			Hello all, 
Here is my situation- I'll be very happy for your suggestions!   
I'm buying a car (VW Passat 2005) from a friend who is leaving Switzerland on July 31 and lives in Hausen am Albis (near Zurich).   
I'm moving now to Yverdon-les-bains which is in a different canton. I will be outside swizerland from July 30 to August 3.   
My questions: 
1. What we should do? I read that he (the seller) should cancel his ""permis de circulation"" (what is the german name?) and then I should register it. How is it done? he gets a paper saying that he cancelled it and he sends it to me? Where exactly we do these affairs?    
2. Do we need to go together to one of these offices?   
3. in here:     
it is also written that we should have ""technical control certificate"" since the car is used. Is it true? where do we get such a paper?   
4. between the time that he cancels his ownership and I make mine, neither of us can ride the car? because he will need to use the car until July 31 and I won't be around, I'm not sure what our ""schedule possibilities"".    
5. I only have ""attetation de residence"", but I've been told it should it enough for registering the car. Is it indeed?   
Thanks a million!!! 
Menny

			So Hayleyob, what did you get? Do you like your car?   
We have 3 kids (nearly out of carseats) plus small dog. We need 7 seats for bringing extra kids home on playdates, taking extra kids to gym etc. ( so occasional use only)   
We are new to Suisse, we plan on doing lots of driving around CH and driving back to UK. Currently have citroen grand Picasso, bloody awful car. Had Honda Pilot before, loved it, but eats petrol!   
So looking at qashqai, santafe and  maybe xc90. Any thoughts?   
in September, do all the garages offer discounts on their  stock? Do all the latest new models come out September each year?

			Leg room in second class is very tight....  if you are above average height, it's worth paying the extra for first class (which also gives you a free meal).  And yes, the double decker trains on the Zürich-Basel route are very nice. The trains on the Neuchâtel and Lausanne routes are showing serious signs of wear.

However, if you have a warranty and plan to sell the car after you can relax, the warranty will cover all the issues, but you know, your time costs also money... Also, the Toyota will be sold with a higher price later.

3676	18.07.2012, 23:39	Member	Thanked 22 Times in 16 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    I add: 
(information not useful for torino if he is at UNI EPFL): 1st class/2nd class is valid for train only. There's a local scam (official!!) for the ""local train"" called LEB: there's no 1st or 2nd class and yet you can buy a 1st class ticket.      
Otherwise the 1/2price card won't be half price for the local buses and metros: Price will be reduce, but not by 50%. 
Example: A 3CHF full price ticket will cost you 2.20CHF if you have the 1/2price card.     
So basically your fare ""geneva airport ---> lausanne renens would be approximately 25CHF. It's train. 
With 1/2 card you'll pay approx 13chf. 
Without 1/2 card you'll pay approx 26chf.   
Then the local bus would be for 1 or 2 ""zones"" 
With 1/2 card you'll pay approx 3chf. 
Without 1/2 card you'll pay approx 2.2chf.   
That's all.

			Hello everyone, 
I'm going to move to Baden for work, in August. 
I've subleased a furnished flat in Spreitenbach for the first months. 
Can anyone advice me about the street parking (is it free? where can I buy the permits if it exists? 
There would be also the chance to rent a garage but, since, I hope, for the first time there shouldn't be problems with the wheather, I'd like to find a cheaper solution. 
thanks for your support.

			In hot hatches, I would go with a Polo or, if your budget allows, an A1. 
The 1.2 TSI DSG is torquey, surprisingly alert, frugal, and the DSG gearbox by far the best sorted out transmission in that segment. And you get VW quality for the interior, not the last word in refinement but well done.   
There's nothing worse than a poor automated manual or torque converter slushbox on a small engine, I would not buy without a good try.

Can anyone recommend a good ( cheap ) company that could transport my boxes back to the UK for me - I've got about 14, nothing too heavy but just clothes and a few books that I can't bear to part with. Price is a real issue, the quote I had already were for around 700 CHF so ideally cheaper than that - oh, and I don't care about the timeframe so much, I've packed all I need into a suitcase

			Very limited offer in that area, and it tends to be breathtakingly expensive. I know of one company which extends track day insurrance coverage to its customers (I have this clause for my GT3), but with a high deductible and funky language (no organizer timing, to competitive ""duels""). They seem to be tiptoeing into pre-announced, per event coverage offerings. I can provide references via pm.   
Even TF days at the Ring could be argued to fall under the usual language of no driving whatsoever on any closed course for any reason.

			So did they sort the Porsche out in the end? I found in the UK there was less an eye on customer service as there is here.   
This was an AMAG garage, so I guess they weighed it up and realised I that as I was a returning customer they would fix it anyway (sorry using the full 'would' now - back on a normal computer as opposed to a smartphone).

			And just in case, this is the delivered version of the ticket - return cross border, for one trip to and one trip return to be performed within a month from a certain date.   
I chose SBB as delivery of the ticket was free ( DB charges EUR 3.50 for postage although their tickets for the same rtn journey are cheaper using EUR). This price is slightly discounted because of the discounting card eg CH Halbtax or GA, DE BC25 or AT Vorteil.   
I chose the delivered ticket method as it gives me a flexibility of dates within a 30 day window since print at home tickets are valid only for a certain date.    
Enjoy your trip!

I had a demi tariff when I lived in the swiss french region- do I just hand that over with the money of course and my new address or do i have to take i.d and a new picture?

			I would have to say that the age kills the value more than miles, but only to a certain limit.   
For example, my 2005MY (but built in Oct 2004) X-Type has only 67'000kms and is worth less than a 2007MY car with 100'000kms, with the exact same spec.   
But if the milage climbs higher than the psychological 100K mark, values start to drop dramatically...

When I went to an optician for that test I was surprised to know that my eyes are not as strong as they used to be and apparently I need glasses... I payed quite a lot for lenses and assembling but they didn't charge me for the test (since I ordered my glasses there).

			Just finished reading some of your GCCE posts...it's nice to come across a kindred spirit! I'm also a fan of old Volvos, specifically the 240s. Other old tanks from the 80s excite me like the BMW 525i, Mercedes 300E, even the Passat for its design alone. There's a sweet spot in that era of car engineering...simplicity, quality, unpretentious materials. In the 90s, the manufacturers attempted to move upscale but the materials never quite held up over time. It seemed that luxury cars were built for the first owner, but never the second and third...especially Audis. I owned a Volvo 850 for a few years just before it started to fall apart in ways that the 240 would simply never suffer from.   
I would not hesitate to purchase another 240, but I'll never buy a used European car from the 90s on.   
Until I moved to Switzerland, I never owned a car worth more than $6500. Due to my contract it only made sense to lease, so I'm driving a wonderful car...a 2012 Mini Cooper S. It's the only car in my price range that I connected with on a soulful level. The BMW 120i that I tested was quite competent, but hardly engaging.   
My dream garage is a 1967 Land Rover IIA, 1998 Porsche 993 and whatever day-to-day car is necessary to do trips, etc. such as a BMW wagon.   
Best of luck with the 9-3!

Sorry, perhaps I shouldn't be sarcastic. But like a lot of things in life when you have a disadvantage you quickly learn how to deal with it, and giving yourself another couple of meters is the way you quickly work out will do the job.   
On the highway, there is no difference at all. The wing mirror does the same job whether RHD or LHD.

			The way I got my monthly pass is that my boyfriend's mom kindly agreed to ""sponsor"" me. The bill arrives her in her name, and I refund her the money. I think, emphasis on think, that the way it works is that if you can get someone with a C or B permit, and who is old enough, to agree to cover you, then you can get the pass. You have to agree to have it for a year though. I hope this helps!

I would hazard a guess there is more people killed like this than stopping on the hard shoulder, particularly in bad weather when most people have slowed down due to the weather.   
Stopping on the hard shoulder is 'dangerous' I agree but to say it is 'life threatening' is over exaggerated.

			Hi guys,   
Thought I'd try to get an answer on this older thread. I'm wanting to buy a monthly GA. I'm on an L permit unfortunately that won't expire until March 2013, so I have way more than 4 months left on it. But when I download the application on the website it says that you can only get the monthly subscription GA pass with a B or a C permit, no matter how much time is left on an L. Has anyone had any recent success getting a monthly GA with an L permit? Shall I just go to the station and try my luck?   
Thanks for your help!

As with your brakes the front tires will wear out faster than the rears.   
All tires also have a tread wear rating, although it is not strictly regulated that all manufactures use the same scale you can still get an understanding how soft/hard the compound is and how long the tread life will be.

I bought a mid size SUV, slightly bigger than q3, 6 months later the car looks like crap. It has more parking damage on it than i got in previous 20 years combined. I thought about downsizing and those sedans are not small at all. A6 station wagon is enormous, even a4 is quite large. Q3 looks big but the width and length are manageable. The other option is a3 sportback quattro.   
Very hard to choose when you can't afford 2 cars but need one decent car ( in case a potential client sees it). I would be happy with a yaris probably but not as a sole car

			My left ""angel-eye"" has given in, first it blinked for about few minutes then it completely failed sending the board message dipped lower left beam failure or alike. Went to local BMW garage and they quoted me c.a. CHF250-CHF300 for light and labour, if I have heard it right. Koblenz garage can replace the xenon for equivalent of CHF270. Knowing life, I suspect that the local garage somewhat misquoted it and I'm afraid it is gonna cost me more than at the German counterpart. Any ideas where's the best place to do it?

And with your low kms, it simply makes sense to keep it. The extra two years aren't going to add that much in depreciation.   
In addition, you won't be able to import the new car into Canada as it is not North American spec.   
After 5k in costs, I'd be keeping that car for another 3-4 years...but only if it's German!

It is necessary to consult with the gentlemen that actually give the practicals as they are the final arbiters of everything.     
If for some reason you don't feel you can deal with the theory in German, you can take it in English.  Of course, it will cost you more money but the Theory test is available in English, German, Italian, French and I think Romansch, but only in Bern.  If you need this option ask and I can explain it further.   
Good Luck.

Would it be possible for me to buy a car a couple of weeks before I move if I have a electric bill or some utility bill in my name at a French address?  Is it possible to buy a car and drive it (for a couple of weeks) before you get it registered, or will the border guards/police stop you?

			Your Swiss insurance will not be able to cover it.    
Sbrinz is right either French cover or trailer it to the UK is the easiest or a specialist UK broker like Stuart Collins should be able to cover it off the back for a pending import. As France is EU it is not as complicated as Switzerland and there are some further agreements in place.

			If you have two drivers and aren't in any particular hurry its no problem. We did Surrey to Montreux in about 12hrs including the ferry crossing (Calais to Dover) and a decent stop for lunch in a restaurant.   
Given that including train to GVA and all the messing around before and after the flight, it can easily take 8-9hrs, its not bad; especially if you want/need a car at the other end.   
edit: My wife has driven it on her own a few times and has also been fine, but she has better capacity for long drives than I do.

			Paveco in Grancia does wheel alignment (which is what I presume you to mean), and have great prices on tires.   
Have been their customer for 20+ years, they do great work, and have never damaged my magnesium or carbon-fiber rims.

			And the best thing is that the kids travel with the parents for free even in first class. Really handy for annoying the hell out of business people on the way to work.   
If you have a second class ticket and upgrade to first class then the upgrade covers the kids too. What a great system.

			After a little research I found the following information on admin.ch 
It's not conclusive, therefore I will look into it in more detail and report my findings.       
USE OF FOREIGN PRIVATE VEHICLES IN SWITZERLAND   
The temporary use of foreign private vehicles by persons resident in Switzerland is prohibited in principle. Concerning customs and road traffic legal notification obligations with regard to the use of foreign vehicles in Switzerland, experience shows that there is often uncertainty and confusion.    
People resident in Switzerland 
In principle, people who are resident in Switzerland are not allowed to use a foreign vehicle registered abroad in Switzerland. This also applies to vehicles which relatives or acquaintances from abroad allow you to use occasionally, for example.           
Vehicles of immigrants, foreign workers, students and interns 
When crossing the border, vehicles on which duty has not been paid must be declared for customs clearance spontaneously and without delay (principle of self-assessment).     
Immigrants may import and use their vehicles in Switzerland exempt from duty under certain conditions. Foreign workers, students and interns may use their foreign vehicles on which duty has not been paid in Switzerland. However, a customs permit is needed for this.   
Violations 
People who have not yet declared their vehicle to customs are requested to report to a customs office to declare their vehicle. Those who do not declare their vehicle for customs clearance will be liable to prosecution. In addition, a claim for payment of the import duties must be anticipated.     
Opening hours and addresses of customs offices 
Please note the customs office opening hours for the declaration (customs clearance) of merchandise. Declarations can be made from Monday to Friday during clearance hours; some customs offices are also open on Saturday mornings.       
The detailed opening hours are available in the list of customs offices.  
For merchandise, please note the customs offices or field offices that are marked blue/white or blue.   
Foreign customs administrations 
We are unable to provide information on foreign regulations. The opening hours and addresses, as well as other information from foreign customs administrations, are available at the following World Customs Organization link: WCO - National customs.   
Further information can be found in the right-hand column, including the fact sheets, which provide information on the most common cases.   
Additional information can be obtained from the customs offices and District Directorates of Customs. For questions to do with vehicle registration and driving licences, the vehicle licensing offices should be contacted (listed at  ).

			well if you have a windows smart phone then you are spoilt for choice, tomtom, igo etc etc   
if your buying a stand alone unit then it really has to be tomtom, I have a few satnav systems (tomtom, garmin, igo, clarion etc) and tomtom really does beat them all, it looks a bit dated now but it just works and quickly, igo based systems take ages to load (igo is sold under many different names, its the one that has the proper 3d buildings etc) eg if you add a new speedcamera database (for instance) it can take upto 15 mins to reload, it also seems to crash rather more often then it should.   
Clarion - very basic, very expensive, not worth it   
Garmin - very good, some nice features, but tomtom beats it for ease of use   
Make sure you get one with TMC, that way it will re-route you round traffic jams, bad weather, crashes etc - very handy! also make sure you get one that includes ALL maps, not just major routes of europe.   
ETA Tomtom bought the mapping company (tele atlas) all these satnav systems use.

			The annual pass is already a 25% discount on buying monthly passes. You also have the benefit that if its personalized you can get it replaced if you lose it, and get away with a 5 CHF fine if you forgot it one day when you were controlled. The only decision is whether the GA with unlimited travel in Switzerland is worth it. You don't have to take too many trains, boats, and the very expensive gondolas to make it worth it.

If not, it's reasonable to assume that you're not allowed to turn left, i.e. the lights are telling you, in lieu of any other signage.   
So yes, you must maintain the direction printed on the light.

			When we moved from Amsterdam (NL) to Switzerland, I moved my Suzuki. Coming from an EU country, you can ride your bike with the old plates for up to one year in CH. You can also use your Austrian drivers license for one year, before having to change them to Swiss.   
Changing the license plates means you need the official papers for the bike, including the EU (curious, seeing Switzerland isn't part of EU.) factory certification (for emissions I think).    
The motor department (equivalent of DMV) is pretty efficient, once you have the papers and forms filled its fast to get your Swiss plates.   
For the drivers license, its also pretty easy, just fill the form in, and do an eye test, and you can go and get the license made while you wait.

			Hi there,   
We are thinking about doing the same thing and it will actually be about the same time wise from Vevey to Geneva than from a village just outside Lausanne to Geneva and alot simpler according to my hubbie.  He says that the train from Vevey runs straight through to Geneva with a couple of stops so at least he does not have to catch two trains and the train is faster as it is the fast trains from Italy I think.  I imagine that it will have seating place to as it has not reached Morges or Nyon yet.     
My hubbie said that the train from Lausanne to Geneve always has place to sit and he has never had to stand either.

			Good to know as I always say I am a resident because once renting from Enterprise they required me to take out insurance and the cost was way higher than a resident.  Since I rent the car on my Visa and Visa will pay all costs of repairing your rental car should you have an accident, I prefer not to take out insurance. BTW, I had such a fender-bender a few months ago when renting Budget in the US and Visa came thru as promised! No hassle.

3823	19.05.2012, 13:19	Member	Thanked 32 Times in 19 Posts	Location: Texas/Bern	    I did look into some old Defender 90's and 110's but for everyday driving it really beats the hell out of you. I already got the boat and truck and everything seems to work well with our roads. What I like about the Navigator is it adjusts to road circumstances automatically and also adjusts its ride height when putting a boat into a lake with small boat ramps. I still want a Silverado but they are in the same price range as Porsche 911's and to me thats just ridiculous. I'll keep the Navigator for a bit and then maybe trade down to the new Ford ranger crew cab. So far I don't really have trouble driving in the smaller cities...just parking in garages is a bit of a trick. One thing that I do love is the parktronic sensors all around the car and the rear view camera.

3826	24.05.2012, 23:15	Forum Veteran	Thanked 533 Times in 283 Posts	Location: Holzhäusern	"    Why only the corner of your eye?  If you're turning, you should be checking your mirrors immediately prior to making the manoeuvre.  If you're moving off after being stationary for a period, you should also be making a final check over your shoulder into your blind spot.   Signalling doesn't give you the right to make a manoeuvre - it just makes others aware of your intentions.   
The point I'm trying to make is that if you had had an accident, this is what the cyclist's lawyer would be saying.  You would have to convince a judge that you had checked all these properly immediately before beginning to turn, found them to be clear,   the cyclist managed to arrive from outside your field of view to next to your car within half a second or so.  I doubt you would win that one, I'm afraid.     
Even if the cyclist has made a poor decision themselves (which they clearly have in this case), it would be easy for his lawyer to claim that you had plenty of opportunity to make sufficient observations to avoid the collision.  The responsibility for ensuring safety is pretty much all in your hands in this case.

			Hello from LA....the IRs leave Zug at the top and bottom of the hour for ZurichHB. The top of the hour (:58) stops in Baar and Thawil arriving around :25 to :30 in Zurich. The Basel non stop train leaves around 8-10 after that. The bottom of the hour IR leaves Zug at :35 and has 1 stop in Thawil arriving around :55 to :00 in Zurich. A secret to getting to Zurich faster is get on the train in Zug from Italy leaving at :32 and it is non-stop to Zurich. I think the Basel train leaves Zurich around :03. I think the run to Basel is around 50-55 mins.   
Hope that helps

			Dear EF,    
I read a lot of threads about purchasing cars, and some time ago, I was also looking for a car  - I had just moved to Basel in 2010.   
What I needed: 
a) family car 
b) spacious 
c) reliable 
d) low mileage 
e) within budget of 10,000CHF 
f) is somewhat 'stylish' to drive   
Having searched many websites like comparis and autoscout, I finally bought a car:     
Yes, I bought the BMW 525i from the Forum and this is what I wanted to report on buying an old car in CH i.e. by swiss standards.   
1) with 266,000km on the clock, I was a little nervous.  It has done 280,000 since I bought it, and is still going very strong. 
2) in 2 years, I have invested about 300 francs to get the door fixed ( it got jammed because my son poured water down the lock) 
3) the drive is still smooth, gives me 10l/100km. 
4) externally and internally, the car still looks slick..ok, so it not a new car, and is a 1989 model - but if well maintained, it makes me smile when I see it parked up. 
5)I paid 2000 CHF for the car. 
6) drove it to UK, and got a MOT check done whilst there - as my MFK is due at the end of the year - mechanic found it to be a very clean car for its age and was tempted to buy it from me!!   
So in small summary, the message is that for all those looking to buy a car, as long as you check the history, MFK, test drive, do your own checks ( download a list of checks from which.co.uk or other motoring sites), and a gut feel - it is well worth looking at the CH older car market - as you can pick up some great deals! very confident that it is better than what I experienced in the UK when buying a 2nd/3rd hand car.   
And of course, with the feedback that people provide on this forum for the cars that are posted, generally is worth reading ( not all the time), but it did help me in taking a mitigated risk when buying the car!   
there you have it! 
hope this is useful to some....and perhaps others have a positive story to share.  
Chippie.

Are you going to import the bed? Will you have a receipt?

			if anyone has a zumo 550 on the bike you need to check your cradle NOW!!   
open the back of the cradle (4 screws) chances are if its been raining the circuit board is wet.   
there is a ribbon connector at the bottom of the board that links to the pins on the cradle. The ribbon cable can burn out if its wet.    
pull the brown retainer out and look at the ribbon for any arcing.   
That meants the zumo is not charged by the bike and the zumo can also be fried.   
dry it out and repack the mount with non-conductive dielectric grease.   
A new mount is €80 / 120CHF   
the zumo is rated as IPX-7 (1m underwater for 30 min) but the mount is not waterproof    
this happened to me last week in slovenia and meant a day trip to Graz to find a dealer that had a mount.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2010	Groaned at 226 Times in 146 Posts	motorbike owners with ZUMO 500/550 !	rob1	Posts: 6,138

I'm considering buying a saver ticket and there are trains for Lausanne at 21:00 and then 22:00. :S 
I've seen there are some extra trains, which take 4min to get you to Basel SBB.

3847	20.10.2008, 14:25	Member	Thanked 10 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Zürich	"    you can get tickets for any zone you like from a ZVV sales office. All you have to do is stamp them. You don't actually have to stamp them in the zone in which they are valid. So you can stamp them at the start of your journey for example. You can get them as individual tickets but also the multi-versions. Just forhet about the ""Anschluss"" bit. You're making things unnecessarily complicated by insisting on that. So for example if you frequently need zone 21, you by a ""Tageswahlkartre Zone 21"" at the ZVV or  SBB sales office or even one of the touch-screen machines. On a day you have to go into zone 21, you stamp this at the ticket machine at the start of your journey (or on the bus if it is a bus that has validators, check this before travelling though). It doesn't matter that the machine is outside zone 21 as the validity is defined by the ticket and time of validation, not the place of validation. You could even stamp it in basel or Lugano if you like, though it probably woudn't make much sense. The ticket will then cover you for a day, ie, cover you for the journey out and the journey home.   
For example, my GF has a Regenbogen for Zürich zone 10. Sometimes she catches the train from Basel to ZH airport, and catches a bus at the airport to Kloten. So she buys a regular train ticket to ZH Altstetten (first stop in Zone 10), uses her Regenbogen from there and stamps her Zone 21 in Basel before starting the journey. This covers her from end to end.

			1. You can insure your bike, pay 1 year etc, but cancel it anytime with 1 month notice. You will get the balance back in cash or rebate for next insurance.   
2. Always get 2 or 3 quotations, and they will then give you a good rate.   
3. Try to stick to a company for 2 years, then switch. 
The switch almost always pays off.   
4. Calculate your machine price, cost to replace, etc.  I found that it is best I take 3rd party with fire and theft and saved 30% from full coverage. 
My new bike costs only 8kchf.

I dont have the axle stands or hydraulic jacks. However, from what you have said about the front left caliper; It sounds to me like the caliper has been seriously roasted. Most probably the piston seals are now permanently damaged. I would strongly advise against using the car any further until you have overhauled or replaced that caliper.

			On a more serious note, you need to go to  . In the automotive section, they sell the metal plate holder systems for  . You will need to screw the clip part onto both cars. The plate will sit in a metal holder with a type of clip system in the back. The plate does not move from the metal holder once installed. You just clip / un clip to move the plate from one car to the other.   
As a suggestion, you want to have a piece of cardboard with the word PLATES on it. You leave it on the seat or on the windshield of the car that does not have the plates   (this can get expensive as the police can be less than sympathetic).

			As you get more experience, you'll learn what speed feel appropriate given the driving conditions.  In general, for your driving test, I would concentrate on making sure that you are moving at approximately the same speed as the rest of traffic (without exceeding the limit).   
If the rest of traffic is flowing at 60km/h in a 60km/h zone, that's the speed you should be driving.  If the rest of the traffic is flowing at 60km/h in a 50km/h zone, you should be driving at 50km/h.   
The examiner will want to see three things:   
1) That you respect the speed limit 
2) That you can drive under control at an appropriate speed for the conditions 
3) That you are not blocking/hindering the progress of other traffic   
Good luck on your test.

			Congratulations!!    
1) Depends on the agreement that Switzerland has with the country you are planning to drive in, I think you are safe with most if not all the EU countries.   
2) I thought the permit was valid for 10 years  , never heard about the 2 year thing   
3)I think you should be ok   
Still confused about the expiry date though. Where did you do your exam? I have to do mine in 3 weeks and I thought that if you pass it thats that. Did you have a drivers liscence before? How long was the test and what did they focus on?

			They're not asking for the plate number, just the registration which you can find in the gray paper (our ask your friend to give you).   
With that, you can subscribe with an insurance - you can also do it online - and then go get your plates.

Did look for example Otto's, but as it is holiday, is it possible to hire just for some hours?   
all the information is helpful, thank you very much in advance!

			The flottenrabbat is accorded to certain companies who fullfill certin criteria and on this form it will be stated that if the manufacturer/importer does not accept the flottenrabbat then it will become void and the amount will be due probably but without seeing it or knowing which paragraph you decided to trace out, will be difficult to go any further.   
I presume you have a copy of the flottenrabbat papaer with the paragraph struck out and yours and the dealers original signature against it to signify acceptance by both parties...   
Maybe look for a compromise somehow, say 50/50 or whatever

			In my experience, most drivers are very considerate. However, watch out for white vans.  They will cut you off, make a left hand turn right in front of you and are generally menaces on the road. They are even blind to safety vests.    
Finally, be careful of tram rails.

			you've been been here less than 12 months and still have your UK licence then:   
As far as I know all you need to do is go to customs and get an import declaration, then take that to the zoll office and import the car. (you've owned it > 6 months so no taxes).   
Once you have done that you can register for it's test and swiss plates and change your licence to Swiss.   
If you have been here (b-permit) more than 12 months I have no idea.

Since you live near Thun (as I have been informed  ), going via Brig is a no-brainer IMHO.

			I don't see the possibility of running into a problem - you could always show them the timetable, and if it says ""ankunft 15:38"", that is 2 mins before 15.40 and your ticket even says (I presume) that it is valid until 15:40.

			Hello, 
I moved in CH on Jan 2012, and hold a B permit. On April I bought a used car in Greece, for use there (pay insurance and everything in Greece) and now I am thinking of bringing it here. I can't find a similar situation anywhere in the web and I am very confused. 
I basically own the car less than 6 months from entering Switzerland, therefore I guess I have to pay import tax and the rest. Should I pay it immediately, or can I drive the car for one year with the greek plates? And if so, the one year counts from the time I got the residence permit, or the date I brought the car?   
cheers,

Sounds like rubbish as they've revised, renewed, rolled, released other routes. 
But Manchester Zurich doesn't (yet) appear on their website's list of cancelled routes.   
I have to say that their Manchester Zurich flights are always busy when I go so it should be profitable.

			I went to Geneva car show this year and just at the last section of motoring product there was a nice German guy speaking funny French giving a presentation with setting fire on the hood (bonnet) of a brand new BMW 3!   This got my short span of attention and I stayed for 10 minutes to see what was going on.    
With my struggling French, I understood that this guy invented this product many years ago and it's polish, wax and protection all in one for all parts of the car, metal, glass, lights etc. There is no rubbing needed, you just wash you car good and apply the product gently with piece of textile. It polishes it and waxes the surface and it's protected from snow, salt bird stuff etc.   
To prove how durable the coating was, he put gasoline on the hood and set it on fire. The fire was burning (10cm wide and 20cm high) for around 15 seconds until he put it out. There was nothing visible on the place where the fire took place. Nothing. He than slammed the hood with his ring to show that the coating could have not been penetrated, he applied a little bit more of the product and the scratch was gone. I was astonished.    
Apparently this product existed for 20-30 years and the owner (the presenter himself, if I understood correctly) was coming to Geneve car show every year for the past decade or so. I was interested because you don't need experience or good tools to do the job so I wanted to order some or to seek more info on it. There is nothing on youtube only on his web page but there is not a lot of info going on there.        
I was wondering if anybody else has tried this product if it really works.

If you're going over for a few days, visiting friends and family in various parts of the country, you're going to need some form of transport while you're there, and the only realistic option would be to fly and hire a car. I've done this before, but even when the flight is paid with Air Miles, the taxes can still be significant, and car rental is never cheap. Oh, and parking at your home airport, or taxi costs too. So in some cases it may actually be cheaper to drive, yes (assuming two or more people).   
The offset of course is the additional time, but TBH if you've two drivers you can get to mid-parts of the UK within 12 hours or so - flying, while only taking an hour or so in the air, will require: getting to the airport, parking car, waiting at checkin, waiting in lounge, waiting for takeoff, waiting to disembark, waiting for luggage, waiting for bus to car rental, waiting for car to be made ready; all of which can take up to five or six hours out of the day, and that's before you start driving to your actual destination.   
Of course, if you live in a major city and are only going to a major city, it can be much simpler and cheaper than that, but that's where the advantages of driving lie for me.   
Oh, plus we'll come back with a Passat Variant full of proper thick 100% cotton John Lewis bedding, sausages, pork pies, Cadbury's chocolate, cheese and beer.

An extreme example of this: Girl at work here got stopped and has to do a ""producer"" because her Peugeot had alloys from the trim model above (ie one inch bigger, with lower profiles, but essentially the same car). Thought there is a certain amount of pedantry on the police's behalf there.

You just have to keep in mind, that while you are doing it everibody else has the right of way and that you are not allowed to impede traffic or to drive faster than 5 km/h (wlaking speed). If you reverse for more than 50m you have to change the side of the roads (ie driving on the same side of the road as if you were driving forward in that direction).   
Reversing is indeed a standard manuvour in Swiss driving tests, as it allows you to asses the controle the driver has of his car and his awarness, as it requires him to constantly check for oncoming traffic in all directions.   
This however is not performed on a main road, but rather on some minor road and the corners around one has to reverse are chosen such that there are no objects obstructing the driver's view.

So depending on how much you have covered in the book you will save money on the training Sessions - each Session(1 hr or 50 mins)  might cost you a minimum of 80 CHF   - So I would suggest not to enroll with a trainer directly - I can send you the book(Soft copy) or you can buy a new one from the stores - Can give you some reference for the trainer as well - pm me ;-)   Note - I recently did this Test & so all these are my experiences   - Good Luck   	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Learning to drive in CH for English Speaker - back on the road	Punky	Posts: 37

3956	10.04.2012, 23:05	Member	Thanked 11 Times in 9 Posts	Location: Basel	     I bought a car from Autoschiess near Volketswil and it came with a Quality 1 guarantee. Bloody useless. It did not cover any electrical claims or any part which failed that was not inside the engine or gearbox. And it was limited to something like 10 or 15,000kms. When my ABS failed a couple of weeks after buying the car, I was more or less told to p!ss off. Then when the intercooler burst and the engine lost half of its power, I was again told that it was not considered as a part of the engine and was not covered under the warranty. So the fact that the car was un-driveable and left a trail of blue smoke behind the car wherever I went was not deemed as an engine problem!     In my opinion, total sh!t. Best to really look into what those warranties are covering before you buy. (And by-the-way: I think Autoschiess are a bunch of crooks and I do not recommend them. They just buy cars as cheap as possible, give them a clean and then sell them on with little or no inspection)  	earned some respect	Join Date: May 2011	Groaned at 5 Times in 2 Posts	Warranty for buying second hand car privately?

You are already getting a letter, so there is no extra expense. Maybe a little extra paper. And sometimes the detection systems are wrong, but why should one have to pay to find out if they are or not? Proof should be part of the process, and a picture, as they say, speaks a thousand words and is pretty incontrovertible. At least, that is what I have learned to expect back home with this kind of thing.   
I would also like to say that I don't condone speeding, though I am no angel and have travelled over the limit in the past. These days I do my best to stick to the limit or to drive to the conditions where that is not possible. The points above are simply my thoughts on the process of fining and what the person being fined is due, as I see it.   
However, I think my tone may have come across as antagonistic and that was not my intention.

			Hi all   
I have a non EU driving liecence for over 10 years but did not drive since my test.  
Now in my late 30 s I decided to start driving. 
I contacted an instructor. I m told that i only need to do the kontrolfahrt.  
I recently started taking lessons. It feels as expected that i m almost a total beginer. I m gonna take the test with automatic car and taking 4 lessons a week. Currently not working so this is my priority but my instructor s to busy to give more lessons. 
However i would like to take the test in 3 months (is this realistic?) apparently i can only practice without an instructor i.e a friend once i apply for the test date which will only give me 3 months to get my confidence up.   
Is onyone out there had the same experience? I would love to hear others experience as i feel i am the only one with this mess. 
Will the examiner expect a super confident 10 plus year driver? Will i get penalised even if i drived safely in the test? 
I bought a book called driving today and studying it. I also would like to get the theory questions to make sure i prepare myself for driving in CH. I reaaly want to realise my dream of driving   any recommendations of which book or CD i should get?   
Look forward to hearing your kontrolfahrt experiences   
Fezza

I'm not sure as it would be an issue from the insurance from the county the car is from and not a Swiss issue.    
I guess it would depend if the vehicle was from a territory where the driver has to be named and is based on the person and not the car.. in that case I'd wager if there was an investigation in the event of a claim... perhaps

Having to much information is better than having none at all.   
vehicles only have 1 or 2 dipsticks under the hood of the vehicle. On American vehicles most dipsticks are labeled oil and the handle is yellow. The trans dipstick handle is red and or labeled trans.   
But, again like I said before when in doubt refer to the owners manual if available and or take to the nearest garage.

Perhaps surprising but, No it doesn't actually... In some other territories yes, but here the insurance is based on the car and plates not the person so, providing they have the correct licence, anyone with permission for non business use is covered if the vehicle is registered to a Swiss resident with a Swiss address. If the drivers are under 25, however, it carries an extra loading on the deductible as governed by Swiss law.

My wife had an A learner permit, but was concerned about not being ready for the test (lot of stuff going on), so I mention that she could just go and ask for an A1 (she already has taken the full course, and has a B).   
So Wednesday she went to Camorino, and today the new license with the A1 added arrived!   
Thanks,

			The best cheap car I ever had was an Opel Speedster.  Bought it cash for 25K with only 4'000km on it, ran it for three years and 30'000km of simply stunning mountain pass and other sporting driving and then got rid of it... for 25K!  Only routine service and one set of sticky tires.  Checking my records, this no-compromise sports car ended up costing me less per km than my previous champ, an old Corolla that I bought for 3K and ran into the ground.   
So, my advice for the cheap car experiment is to buy an Opel Speedster or Lotus Elise.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2010	Groaned at 342 Times in 278 Posts	The Great Cheap Car Experiment No.5	dodgyken	Posts: 9,936

			I spoke with the mechanic(the guy selling it) again, and he told me it would be best to take it to another garage as he had almost no experience working with the hydraulics before. But with the timing belt, this parking break, and whatever else small that might be wrong with it he gave me a a 1000 to 1500 CHF max estimate. Does this sound in the right ball park?    
It's an automatic transmission, with benzine. Not sure if that matters.

			Quite agree with snooky76 - if you are used to cycling in any town or city then Geneva is no different, and certainly not particularly dangerous.    
Particularly for commuting you will quickly learn the spots to pay particular attention on your route. As always, it is worth getting some decent lights for the times of year when it is getting darker.

In 12 years here I have only seen radar twice and in the last four years only one police car.. Oh but on the off ramps they control your autobahn sticker. The road is like a race track everyday, no way can you slow down to 120 going with the flow is like 160 then you get passed. The fastest that went by me would guess around 230 and more than once.

My current bike rack a Fabbri and is for two bikes. Ok when my son had a bike that could fit in the back of the car. Now I need a three bike one and we had to change our car recently. Looks like the Auris has a few problems with the ones you strap to the back of the car.

			Regarding filtering, it is not (yet) allowed,  .   
Regarding liability, you have to drive responsibly and in a way that you will not harm others. If somebody violates you cannot just hit him if the accident could be avoided. On the other hand you may assume that drivers normally (see bellow regarding minors) follow the rules.   or  .    
In your situation it is very crucial what you would have said to the police at the scene of the possible accident. ""Officer, I saw the Vespa next to me and I had this eerie feeling that he will do something stupid"". Or ""Officer, I have not seen the Vespa driver, and  I never thought that somebody could be so stupid and would try something so dangerous and illegal."" The former could make you liable whereas the the later may take you off the hook. I used 'may' and 'could' because at the end of the day a judge will decide.   
Regarding minors, you have to anticipate that minors will not always follow all the rules or cannot correctly guess speed and distance. See  . 
 For ex. if you see a child on a bike that wants to cross the street, slow down. See   and   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Correctness while Driving	pg2011	Posts: 46

			Just to put the profit figure in perspective,      /en/corporation/the-company/facts-and-figures/finances.html       2011, CHF 8,022 of which CHF 2,304 were public sector funding.   
So, there are the SBB's own figures, the Swiss railways enjoy a 28.72% subsidy from the public sector, ie. town and Canton supplements.    
They DO need the profit as there will be heavy spending in the next 5 years.    
I DO admire the SBB, they have built a great system, but remember our taxes also pay for it.

			If you have a Renault like mine, just wait a few months; the mounts will fall out by themselves, saving you some of the labour costs. Though there may be some ""anciliary"" parts & labour costs associated with this approach.   
Of course, being a Renault, you first have to hope it lasts those few months without breaking down completely anyway.

			Well the one I am looking at has apparently an issue with the parking break. I don't know if that can effect how the car performs or not. I certainly almost never use it on any car I have ever driven.    
It's mileage is a bit over 100,000km, but have been told it is in good working condition from the mechanic who is trying to sell it to me. I don't need something real pretty, cause I intend to use it to move things around, some of which may bang up the interior quite a bit. It's a good price compared to what I have seen for the same year, with 60 to 80,000kms more.

			edit: didn't realize this was an older thread...but I think it might still be interesting for some to see the breakdown of costs we had.  We could have avoided a few of those costs, like transport of the car to us from the port, but given we have 3 little ones and the smallest was just 3 months old at the time, we figured the cost of paying someone else to do it was less than the cost and stress to us if we did it ourselves!     
Excellent point by Caninsui about the type of permit one has - we didn't have that issue as we were moving to Germany at the time...anyways, here is my story    
We didn't import to Switzerland, but to Germany.  We were in a situation where we bought a car in Jan of 2009 and end of February we found out we were being moved (we thought the move wouldn't happen as we turned down an offer the Nov before).   
Anyhow, being it was in the throes of the recession, the place where we bought the car was not interested in buying it back.  And given the $ was so cheap then and buying cars in Germany was much more expensive, we brought it over.     
It was a MAJOR pain!  That was the most stress I had from the move...of course time heals the wounds and I don't remember it all, but here is a breakdown of costs we had at the time:   
ocean freight $1050 
insurance premium $600 (usually 2% of insured value, I think) 
trucking $475 (to take from my house in NY to the port, about 180 miles)   
total $2125 on the US side   
We then had a bill from Interfracht on the German side for 858 € on top of that    
unloading of container and taking to storage €325 
transport of car from Bremerhaven to Frankfurt area €290 
and some other various fees and charges bringing the total to 858.   
The cost of conversion to German standards was another 1500€ (to be fair, the guys were almost apologetic that it was so high as it is usually in the 800€ range).  We brought over a car that isn't sold here - VW Routan.  Parts are a pain...although since it is a sister vehicle to a Chrysler Grand Voyager, we are able to get it serviced at a Chrysler garage.    
Now, we do get many questions about the car as people wonder what the heck it is - and in the end it was cheaper than buying a new car here...but it was a hassle.  If I had to do it all over again I may have tried harder to get rid of it and buy a used minivan over here...

If you leave CH early it can be very expensive as your deposit & payments may not have covered the depreciation to date, there are a few threads where people have taken a 5 year lease & are leaving after 18 months.

			Does anyone have accurate information on what changes are supposed to take effect this year in Vaud with respect  to car tax from July 2012? I was told the tax will go up massively if you have an SUV as it will all be based on CO2 emissions. Does this apply to cars bought only after July or all cars?   
Would be great to get some detailed info! I tried googling but can't find it.

			Quick question ..... slightly OT, but related.   
As garages that fit tyres, normally sell them too, how do they react to fitting tyres sourced from a 3rd party, and is there any reflection in charges?   
(i.e. similar to corkage charges for byo wine to a restuarant).

			Sorry noone has replied.   
You go to your local traffic office (Strassenvekehrsamt) and beg an envelope from them, they have special sizes.    
Once you no longer need them, mail both the plates back to the Strassenvekehrsamt. Your car insurance will be suspended as soon as they are received, and your insurance company will pay out the balance. You will also get the car tax reimbursed, so let them both know where you are / which bank account you have.    
Of course you could also simply wrap them in brown paper and mail them (They must be reasonably clean).

4044	21.12.2009, 04:10	Newbie	Thanked 4 Times in 3 Posts	Location: Zürich	"    Funny thing was, I   approach them because my friend with me didn't have a Zone extension and couldn't buy one in time before the last train of the night was leaving.  We actually seeked them out and explained my friends situation.  Being polite, though not in German like your situation.  They debated between themselves as well. They thought we both didn't have them but then I mentioned that its only for my friend and that I had a ticket already.  They let my friend off easy but had to pay 13Fr for her trip.  We sat down and then they came around a few minutes later for me.  This time they had no compassion.     
So my argument is, why would a fair dodger openly approach the agents and try to do the right thing for his friend?  I think that's pretty much the telling point for someone who is not just some punk kid, and that it WAS an honest mistake on my part.  Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier to you all.   
But to my real point; the fine policy itself! 
Despite everything I've read here, I still think its perfectly acceptable to have a variable fine. The Vancouver transit system works just as efficiently as here, and they definitely give you a warning if you deserve one the first time, make you buy a ticket.  They could have scanned my pass and seen that I didn't have a history.

			Have you tried going directly to the SBB office in the train station to ask? I went for a ticket over Christmas and was able to get one for 220 CHF round trip (from Basel) - which included the reservation prices.  My boyfriend often has to travel Basel-Paris for his job and we just bought another ticket for next week for 214 CHF round trip.  Perhaps they have access to a certain number of seats if you buy it there directly? 
(We also each have a GA, but I think that gets the same discount as a halbtax for this kind of thing - somebody please correct me if I'm wrong)

			Hi   
Any car will do, unless you live well out of town on the slopes of (one of many) a nearby mountain.  Downtown Geneva gets relatively little snow, a few days per year only.  But you MUST get winter tyres which significantly increase grip.   
7 seaters are quite common, Mazdas will be available, but they're not so common as  Opel Zafira, VW Touran, or Ford S Max which are easier to find (if buying second hand).  Look at autoscout.ch for an idea of what's available here and how common.  Don't let others panic you, traffic here is no worse than downtown Christchurch or similar.  Rush hour is slow, but drivers here are civilised and you'll get the hang quickly enough.  Parking spaces are small by US standards, but not by European standards.  Unless you're a nervous driver/parker you should be fine.   
Don't listen to those who say you can survive in Geneva without a car.  Without kids, if you're loaded and live close to school, maybe.  But for ""normal"" people with kids, unless you intend to keep the kids from doing extra curricular activities, clubs, etc. or are a real fan of public transport, you'll need a car.  In particular, public transport with impatient kids is not practical outside business hours in the Geneva suburbs.  However, if you live where your husband can commute without a car, you should be able to get by with a single car.   
Half booster seats should be fine for kids that age.  Check the TCS (Touring club suisse) website for the rules.

			I often see posts about mean ticket-checkers and big fines and wanted to share my positive experience and hopefully help people avoid a similar mistake.    
I sometimes comute from Zurich - Lausanne or Geneve and usually buy a day pass (68 CHF) to go there and back and use the local transit. This time I was staying multiple days so instead got a return ticket (69 CHF) and for convenience added the city ticket option (+4.4 CHF) for the metro. I didn't realize  .    
After a long few days I was finally headed home and the conductor came and said 'oh, you have kind of a   ticket' and explained it was expired. I thought for sure I was in for a fine and another ticket. However, he was SUPER NICE, explained my ticket, suggested other options, and let me go with a warning.

			They have their own individual swiss policies (Winterthur) and have had them for over ten years, and are also members of the TCS with ETI cards and legal protection.  
The question of driving 'foreign' cars was raised with the insurance company right at the beginning as as a family we tend to swap cars and have cars registered in three countries (Switzerland, France and England). 
They have been 'controlled' several times, never had problems.   
I believe it   illegal to drive a car that you're being paid to drive (for any purpose) without additional insurance.

Car checked out, CH bought from Emil Frey in Lugano, all services done by same, due for service now and to be done once purchased. Very clean and maintained, no scratches etc. Very good condition. It was waiting to be cleaned/prepped in the back of the dealership without the pricing info displayed.   
Let us know if it works out.

			I seem to remember someone told me there is a Honda Motorcycle shop in Scaffhausen just over the border. Maybe you could try there?    
 From the tales of some other people on EF, I can tell you that it may be worth asking a CH Honda dealer to do the work. It will cost more but the garage will be motivated to help you get the bike tested and on the road in CH. This is really valuable when you have a local dealer who probably knows the people working at the local Strassenverkehrsamt and can help you with the paperwork.

Finding somebody to take over the car for you maybe it will be the best option money wise. -35% is good discount, should be easy.

If the car came with an MFK they should pay it.   
I have bought plenty of cars in Switzerland, from main dealers to small back street places, and every single time, and MFK'ed car means they pay for it.   
You got the bill because the garage paid by invoice - and the MFK bill was processed AFTER the address change on the ausweiss.

Getting caught going through an Amber/Red light is something that can be prevented by paying attention to the road ahead. It's not difficult - but - if you see that a light has been on green for a long time - the chance is that it will change fairly soon. So come off the throttle - and hover over the brake.   
You'll find this is something that good drivers do without being told - on a public forum!!

After a lot of hassle, the car owner who only had 3rd party cover did manage to claim from the hotel('s insurance). The hotel owner was a right arsehole who tried to wriggle out of it, even to the extent that the ski school director contacted his own insurers, who were quite clear that it's the responsibility of the building owner or insurer to cover this sort of thing.   
So you should pursue a claim from the building owner, or make sure your car insurance does so on your behalf.

			As Tom suggested, daily or frequent trips would be cheapest with a monthly or annual pass. A few trips each week, then you'd have to check the price difference between the pass and ""mehrfahrtenkarten"", multi-trip passes. My kids only travel to or from school without me on rare occasions, but they each have a card in their wallet to clip when traveling without me. You can buy them in bulk, either at a ticket office or online.   
Curiously, the   appears to not be available in English.

			I can't believe there is no CoC either but I have checked and double checked.  Commercial vehicles registered before 2011 were only required to have a country specifc document.  For the UK this only included the weight and tyre sizes etc.  The EU standard CoC was introduced for all commercial vehicles from 2011 onwards.  If my van had been the crew cab version it would have had a CoC but mines just the standard van.

			Oh yes, there's no doubting the beauty of it so long as you want either that convenience of are using the system that much.   
A GA costs 3100chf (I even had the famile version with children that reduced it 1700Chf and decided to ditch it!). A half-card costs 125Chf, which gives you half-fare on everything; the difference is 2975Chf. You need to be doing double that amount of travel  - 6000Chf equivalent to really justify it. And then with a half-card you can still get multi-journey and season tickets, as well the specials. Once you have the GA you don't bother with any fares. And this December the GA is increasing by 8% whereas ordinary fares apprently by 1.5%! Of course there are a few extra benefits with the GA as well. If one adult has one then one for their children 6- 16 only costs 12Chf/week.    
I have a bike pass @ 190Chf, a half-card @ 125Chf, a kinder pass @ 20Chf and six-trip tickets to my regular destinations; a lot more to carry right enough   "	earned some respect	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Half Fare card or GA card	RS13	Posts: 26

			If not already mentioned there is a smart roadster forum in the uk, they list loads of places where to buy part and also a lot of how to guides n stuff.  Give it a few moments to search and maybe if its easy enough you could order the cheap part over from the uk and DIY?   
Another thing, they dont make the roadster any more so in time they could start to go up in value (maybe/maybe not). Ive had one for about 5 years its now just stored in one of my garages.  Maybe one sunny day i will get it out for a spin, but then ive also been saying that for a coule of years aboutmybike too.

To add, it's a valid point though. Could someone check their Swiss insurance terms, does it have such a clause? If so I will have to revise my post above.

seems to be confirmed by this

			Hello all!   
Ive read some threads about boats and what you need to go on the water with it, but i didnt find what i want.   , to go with my own boat on the water without sharing some links to different Kantons or sites but short and simple.    
´Boat approval`, ´License´, ´Registration´, ...more... ?   
The license would be around 1250 CHF with 10 ours of lessons. 
And the rest?   
I have a 6,5 meters long motorboat with a 35Kw engine.   
Thank you very much!

Has anyone had a similar experience as the below?  
I received an e-mail from KLM telling me the return leg of a flight has been cancelled and they have re-booked the return leg some 19 days earlier. I am not happy with this and would prefer to look for another return flight, or better cancel the whole thing and rebook.       
There are no humans available at this time on a Sunday, so after
I stopped swearing I found this  http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens...r/index_en.htm 
which links to this  http://ec.europa.eu/transport/passen...nt_form_en.pdf 
so it seems that I can at least get a refund for the return leg. 
I was informed more than 2 weeks before the return leg.

E.g. if you cause a car accident you will usually get a fine and possibly have your license suspended for a few months. Now whether you have a good lawyer or no lawyer at all can make quite a difference, e.g. how high the fine will be or whether your license will be suspended or not.      Most companies offer two different types of policies: one for car/road traffic-related issues and one for everything else. 
Legal insurance is not mandatory, I would recommend it though.

			But, don't forget these tickets have no ""guarentee"" if you lose the annual ticket you have lost CHF 1'575, if you lose the monthly ticket you have only lost CHF 175.   
And if you choose your summer holidays wisely you can save on your rail fare (Not buy a ticket for that period) as well.

			If you do not mind 6 hours in the coach ( with stops every 2 hours ), there is a cheap coach fare from 30.03.2012 from the German side ( Frankfurt is one departure point ) to the Swiss side ( Zurich and Chiasso ) for EUR9 ( but not the other way around unfortunately ).   
There are some other cheap fares to other countries. I have only used Hamburg, DE to Aalborg, DK and was pretty good.

a one lane highway, and came across signs to slow down, traffic 
signal ahead, and I slowed down, and came to a full stop at the red light. About 20 seconds later, I hear the sound of crash, and my head slams against the steering wheel. The driver driving a convertible crashed into me, forcing my SUV into the car in front of me.    
I had minor bleeding around the eye area, and the police and ambulance came, and they were asking me, were you wearing a seat belt, and I definitely was. An ambulance took me to the ER (the paramedics 
announce we have another sandwich here) to get tetanus shots, and 
wound area cleaned up. Now being that Hawaii is a no fault-state, the 
$6,000 damage to my rental car was billed to me. (Thank g-d my  
credit card insurance took care of it at the end).

Thus if a UK motorist is flashed it's tough on the Swiss as they can't enforce it. Same way that driving your Swiss car on a Swiss licence at say 160 on the M20 the rossers can pull you over for a chat and a lecture and hold you up and unless deemed dangerous driving watch you drive away point and fine free....   
I however see the OP's point if they in fact live in CH not wanting it to chase them... I would suggest it won't...but if they want a clean conscience they should fess up but be aware that any future infractions will be straight to their door.

			I forgot to say that an alternative is to buy a replacement ECU from eBay. There's a few for sale for around the same price as a refurbished item. Then you would just need to pay a garage with a VAGCOM/ROSSTECH tool to adapt/recode the ECU once fitted to your car.

			hmm, 
tricky one. a few tips, but unless you have a reduction car for either/both countries you are looking at paying a hefty sum.   
Vueling.com fly from zurich to paris, usually much cheaper then full price train tickets   
easyjet fly geneva paris, not really sure about prices   
or try Covoiturage.fr   
this car sharing website is pretty good within France but not so good for international journeys. so if you are going to use this I would recommend trying to get to the nearest big(ish) French town by train or bus and then get the lift from there.   
otherwise I wrote an article about cheap train tickets here (supersaver)       
I think these tickets are only available until the end of February, and not for major international journeys. but it might be able to get you over the border to a lift cheap enough? or to the flight in Zurich.   
Otherwise i'd recommend getting the discount cards if you are going regularly as they usually pay for them selves in the first ticket or 2

			I had a UK driving licence, downloaded the forms from my local Strassenverkehrsamt, filled them out and then rang the Verkehrsamt who gave me details of the nearest approved eye doctor for the medical (which you have to have if you are over 60). It seemed pretty thorough to me. I handed the forms and my UK licence in to my local Gemeinde and they sent them to the Verkehrsamt. I then got a call from them saying that since my old licence included the HGV driving option I would have to go for an extra medical if I wanted to retain the HGV component. I decided that having survived 40+ years of driving without needing to drive anything other than cars and the odd minibus, I would hardly be needing to do so in the future. I was sent a form where I had to renounce driving HGVs and got my Swiss licence in the post 10 days later. The whole thing was totally trouble free and local. The whole thing cost 200CHF, so 100CHF sounds like a bargain. Different cantons different prices I guess.

'Bike' may also refer to a motorcycle, 'biker' always a motorcyclist , 'cycle' and 'cyclist' only ever to a pedal bike.    Some bikes can be seen around with number plates (in Basel, certainly) usually very old ones, so I've always assumed that it used to be a requirement in years gone by.

			But will it reach 7 million quid though...?    Its sick how some people have just too much money.             	Small number but a very big price     
It was auctioned for charity in the United Arab Emirates, beating the previous record of £3.5m for a plate featuring the number 5.     
The successful bidder said he bought it because he ""wants to be the best in the world"". Saeed Khouri, a member of a wealthy Abu Dhabi family, added: ""I bought it because it's the best number.""     
However, he would not say which of his many cars would carry the record-breaking single-digit plate. The oil-rich UAE began auctioning off so-called vanity licence plates last May. Proceeds from the auctions go to a rehabilitation centre for victims of traffic accidents.      
On Saturday, 90 licence plates were auctioned off, raising a total of £12m. 
The previous five such events raised more than £25m.

			Sapin, I guess wind is not very common there.   
Wife_of_Porsch, since middle December La Chaud-de-Fond has been covered by snow. There are more snowplows on the road than cars    
AbFab, with me was similar. I did the very same route 2 hours before and it was clean and shiny. When coming back, I started from Fleurier at 700m and then high up the valley in low snow, while I was gaining altitude the snow was getting deeper and harder, but I didn't realize how much it had changed the grip on my tires. That road is totally dark at night, which doesn't help...   
BonBon, true, but in good conditions if you don't brake enough before the corner, in most situations you can adjust the speed during the corner in safety. On the hard snow, there isn't any tolerance for wrong calculations with braking distances.       
If the snow keeps falling like this I have to get a skimobile ...

			I have yet to speak with a garage who hasn't given a ""rough quote"" over the phone without charging.   
For example - telling them what it failed on, how long would they expect that work to take - and their hourly rate. And ask would the parts be expensive?   
The quote you got was an accurate Swiss quote - down to the last bolt and washer. You'd pay that amount when you picked the car up.   
If he had the car on the lift and went through the system looking for actual prices - you're going to have to pay.

I have had friends nicked for thinking he/she could get away with using the front plate on one car and the rear plate on the other. 
But it   useful if you have a 'commute car' to use during the week and then a 'chuck everything in the boot' car at weekends for example.   
Sadly in my case the second option seems to consist of the weekly shop.

			easy: find the CH distributor, tell them you ALREADY have this kit on your car and you need the certificate for it, they will normally order it and then you pay about 60chf for the certificate.   
dont tell them you want the cert and want to order the kit from elsewhere   
You will also prob need a garage to stamp the paper to say its been fitted properly. However the stamp can be very easy to obtain if required.

			Yeah, my E46 M3 was love at first sight and that hasn't waned a bit since I got it. The E92 M3 is really quite a performance car and superior to mine in many ways, but just hasn't turned me on since I first looked at it last March in Geneva, an invite for an upclose in Garching in April, nor at my dealer a couple of months ago. I think the new fun car will be the 135i.   
That said, according to some studies and TCS, the current best on economy, maintenance, safety and reliablility in it's class is the BMW 1er series, over VW, Audi and the various Asian cars.

P2 Volvos have had history of having a batch of bad discs in 02 and 03 model years, and they're not exactly the hot rod car either.   
You can drive a car as hard as you want, if you allow for the discs to cool properly they won't warp.

			It sounds horrendous, but it's been the same fee of CHF 40 for God knows how many years and as Sbrinz says, it is for a whole year and covers the whole motorway system.  Compare that to crossing the Queen Elizabeth bridge for a year - say 250 days at £1.50 = £375 for a bridge that is only around 2 miles long.  And that £1.50 is only for a one way trip!  Plus you know that in Switzerland the money is going on the roads, in the UK it just goes into a central kitty.  So, in which country do you feel like you're being ripped off?   
They have thought about the tourists too as they're proposing to keep the CHF 40 as a two month pass for tourists to buy when they drive over.

			You know this is what I was thinking to, I remember my Father buying his VW from Germany 10 Years ago a RHD Golf GTi and saved a fair amount...but it appears to be the other way round now!! Checking the price/spec in Germany, UK, CH and the US the US and UK seem to be loads cheaper than CH and quiet a bit cheaper than Germany too.  The US though doesn't do the model I'm looking for so can't compare 100% also they dont seem to be as well specced as the UK cars either!! So with the hassel of getting one over from the US I really dont see the point of it....think I'm mangaging to convince myself into it the more I talk about it!! Just supprised there's not about UK on here compared to buying a US car....feel like I'm missing something really obvious as the saving is around £14000 or 17000 buying the car in the UK!!

			The challenge that the OP's friend has is that everyone and their mother is using the spot so the normal ""leave a note"" idea is not really going to do it. You call spend all of your time calling the tow company as well.   
As a couple of people have mentioned, you need to physically protect the spot. That means a chain across it or one of the pop-up/down metal triangles. Anything else is a waste of time.   
You can buy the metal triangles from Coop Brico.

			Since your bike doesn't have a number plate, they'd have a tough time tracking you...    
When you see where they ask you to go 30, you'll understand why and probably be going 20. By the way, kids like to play with balls hidden behind cars parked on the street in 30 zones. The balls sometimes roll out on the road, closely followed by a kid not looking where he is going. If you do 50, the kid is dead, if you do 30 with your foot half ready on the brake pedal, the kid lives. In the quieter parts of Zurich, you also have to remember that - unless clearly indicated otherwise - cars coming from the right have right of way,  . Here's another  , including maybe yourself.    
Zurich is ""we hate cars"" - town, by the way. They issue more parking permits (which you pay for) than there are spaces, most paying parking spaces are for two hours max and if you can find a spot to rent permanently, it will cost you upwards of 150.- per month in less popular areas and starting at 200.- in more central locations.

			In Australia we had a Mazda CX9 - huge inside, proper good seven seats and beautiful to drive, as well as being nicer to look at than the Q7.. I see they are here in Siwtzerland as well.  Might be an option for you to also consider?  To solve the car size problem, we have the big 4X4 here for our family weekend mountain trips and I drive a Smart car during the week (which is also a good match to my parking skills) and never ever have any parking issues   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Sep 2011	Groaned at 7 Times in 2 Posts	Audi Q7 - your thoughts	tiger12345	Posts: 40
4229	13.01.2012, 12:55	Senior Member	Thanked 226 Times in 117 Posts	Location: Geneva	"    Some others who contributed to the thread mentioned great discounts. So maybe there are good options meanwhile as well! I can't judge that and only know the thumb rule and that it's worth when purchasing a car to watch the loss in value per year.   
Concerning used cars I have only experience with older cars ( 7-8 years old) which are probably out of discussion here. Well at least at this level there are no big price differences in comparison to the neighbouring countries (at least in summer 2010/ estate car). Actually they were rather a bit cheaper in Switzerland, which I found interesting. This is probably connected to a lower demand in older cars. So I could make a good deal here at this time. (area: Zurich)   
Unfortunately, I have no experience with newer second hand cars or whether the recents discounts for new cars do pay off. Maybe the recommendations from the others will help. Wish you good luck in the car hunt !    
It's also always a bit of a fun part to look for a car isn't it? At least I find it interesting.

			I generally always use a car regardless as it's quicker & easier. I find it less stressful. I can get from Zurich to Geneva way earlier by car than is even possible by train. If I am late I can't even get home by train the same day. Once your used to driving a train is not fun, people coughing having to leave work at exactly the right time. Train is cheaper, however the milage tax deductions make driving a no brainer for longer journeys.

24 months @ 420chf   
Hand car back to the dealer at the end of the lease - assuming no excess KM charge.   
Buying and running cars is, as with a lot of things, more expensive that the US.

			I love you guys sooo much that I bought   tires for the car instead of one.  I had them installed on the rear.   
End result: A car that will make you crap your pants when it oversteers in both directions, not just one.     I had to rotate them to the front to make the car safe again.  The Dunlop SP Sport FastResponse is a touring tire (in spite of their marketing to the contrary) and a sheep in wolf's clothing.

He is presently secure in a hotel. The car has already been recovered from the roadside, and he has been quoted £4500 for parts only for a repair, so that is well out of the equation.   
Another option is to transport the car to just inside the Italian border, and either repair, or arrange onward transport from here.   
It's someone to do the transportation that I'm presently looking for.

			In December 2009, after 6 months wait, I took delivery of a new VW Polo (6R current model) 1,4 petrol with 7-speed DSG ( Direct-Shift Gearbox ) - essentially an automatic gearbox.    
All has been wonderful and with servicing every 30,000km or 2 years the cost to date has been CHF400.00 and repairs zero. And average 5.9l per 100km.   
With 35,000km on the clock and 24½ months of happy motoring, the DSG box went on the blink in the last couple of weeks.   
This involved the gearbox going into neutral while in 'D' and while driving. Once stopped and the engine restarted it clears. This happened only twice, but is understandably potentially leathal, especially in a tunnel or on the autbahn.   
A quick Google proved this, and all sorts of other problems, to be common with VW/Audi/Skoda models with DSG. Also getting satisfaction from either dealers and manufacturers appeared also to be just as big a problem.   
So it was with some concern that I check the car in at my local VW dealer (Autorama in Wetzikion (ZH)) where I also bought the car. After 24 hours and correspondence between Autorama and VW importers AMAG, they have agreed to replace the Metatronc box (the brains that drive the gearbox) free of charge (parts and labour). This is on order from Germany and will be done next week.   
Had I imported the car from Germany or bought at the likes of Autodiscount Uster, I wonder if I be so content. Autorama even cleaned the car inside and out while it was in for assessment...

If you're going to travel across country right when you get in, and money is tight, it might be worth it - but otherwise stressing yourself on the day of your arrival to a new country's probably a bad idea   
I would personally just skip it that day, get a full price ticket, and go order it the next time you're at a station. You do want one though - the payback period differs depending on your commute and personal travel habits, but it almost always pays back well in excess of its cost. A 20 chf commute to work means it pays back in 3 weeks, for example.

			There is also an Iphone app (I think from TCS too) that can show you the maps of traffic in Switzerland. If you commute a lot, Garmin has a traffic receiver (which connects to the charger of the GPS) and receives traffic updates via radio and shows them if they are en route or can divert you before to an alternate road so you don't get stuck. In your case as there is only one access road I guess it won't help much...   
I think TomTom has this option too.

			From your linked map it looks like Basel BdHf is in Zone 8. I highly doubt that the you could travel from Zone 2 to Basel BdHf with just a GA and Zone 2 ticket. 
For your mind, get a written statement from a DB and SBB official that clearly state that your tickets are valid for the intended journeys.   
I know for sure that the same thing applies inside Switzerland between different ticket areas. A crossing between TNW and A-Welle or A-Welle and ZVV is not possible if the traveler has two tickets for each area.

			Thanks all for the suggestions.  I have some great options now.   
Using SBB's fly-rail-baggage check through to the local train station is  convenient and well-priced.   
Good to know that I could haggle with taxis.  The Mobility pointer is great too -- I'll probably join once I get settled in to Zurich.     
It looks like renting a car through kayak or other price aggregators costs just about the same as, if not more than, taking a taxi -- at least at today's quoted prices.

			Has anyone figured out how to do the whole airport-to-ski-resort thing when a rental car is required? We tend to have 3-4 people with equipment - won't fit in any of the reasonably priced cars.    
A box or rack would be the solution, but... last time we reserved a rack (explicitly stating ""several skis and boards"" several times), we got two magnetic thingies that can barely accommodate a pair of skis, let alone snowboards. That, and a car with a glass roof. (Thanks again, Sixt.)   
So, is anyone aware of a rental company that provides actual racks/boxes? 
How about an actual van, without breaking the budget?   
Right now I'm looking at   - seems like they will rent boxes, but figuring out whether they will fit a random rental car is going to be tricky (""Passat or similar"" - thanks again, any and all rentals).   
Any ideas? 
Cheers,

			As others have said, it's hard to give advice about half fare cards or general abonnements without knowing your precise plans...   
But to help you figure it out...   
Use the sbb site to work out the cost of your daily commute (note, it automatically assumes you have a half fare card). Then either work out how much you will spend a year (and compare to a yearly GA), or how much you will spend per month (and compare to a monthly GA). Then make your choice.  There you go!   
I have a GA (monthly, it's a little more expensive but I can't afford a lump sum... and this way after the first 4 months I could cancel it if I wished). I find that not only is it cost effective (for me), but also it saves time and stress. No need to worry about having bought a ticket, ever! It also means that I don't find myself sitting there thinking 'I'd like to go to such-and-such... but can I afford the train fare?'...   
Oh, and about buying the ticket online... if doing this on a mobile phone, make sure you don't confuse the online ticket   and the ticket you can buy on mobile phones. I was on the train the other day and someone had purchased an online ticket on their mobile, but a printable kind, not a mobile phone ticket, and hadn't realised the difference so hadn't printed it out... the inspector was not happy because he couldn't scan it.

			Hi all, 
        Still battling away and only one week until I relocate from CH back to the UK. Next week I drive a van from the UK to Switzerland. I am using the Eurotunnel and as my van is empty I can travel with the passenger train on the way out. However because the van is full, it appears you have to travel with the freight Eurotunnel on the way back (Hello truckers)   
I saw someone mention somewhere that if you're bringing the contents of your apartment back to the UK you should fill in some form BEFORE you drive through customs. Can anyone shed any more light on this? Apart from the hours of driving I'm hoping it proves quite a straightforward process.    
Next stop is cancel my Swisscom (phew) Busy times.

If in doubt, I would just ask it at the station before boarding the train.

			It's not the same - we arrive by train - but what impresses me is that they are such a civilised country.   
Of course, they did not go invading Afganistan Libya, Irag, etc, and they do not go around the world imposing democacy or anyhting like that.   
Consequently no-one hates them and they have no hang-up about terrorism.   
At the railway borders they just sit there in their room, fortunately we are pale-skinned and of an age where bomb-making would appear to be an unlikely occupation.   
I can fully believe that the borders are largely unmanned - they are part of the schleningham agreement, of course.   
Mind, my son lives there, and he is VERY careful not to speed on the motorways, to have fully-paid his TV and radio license fees, to have a local company insuring all his posessions, and NEVER to try and 'get-away' with anything.   
So long as you abide by the rules, it seems a great place to live, - enjoy yourselves!!!

			Oh my - there are some good answers - and some scary ones.   
Firstly - and this is most important - if your wheels are locked - un lock them. This is usually done by lifting your foot off the brakes. Once the wheel is rolling you have control and begin sorting the problems out.     
There are 4 contact points with the road - the 4 tyres. 
Car controls are not on/off switches - they are progressive. That means brakes, throttle and steering. 
Hand position is crucial - there are 2 schools of thought. I go for 915 - and leave my hands there - I don't move them. If my hands are always in that set position on the wheel, I know exactly which direction my front wheels are pointing!! 
All inputs are done smoothly!!!   
Secondly - we need to define a skid. There are 2 types (of which there are subtypes).     
This is when the wheels are scribing an arc greater than their angle - IE you're going straight on into a barrier/tree. You should apply the brakes until the car gains grip at the front and starts to turn in. Once the car has turned in gently release the brake. If you don't you may end up moving into.....     
This where the back of the car attempts to overtake the front of the car. This happens where the front of the car has more grip than the back. The most common cause of this is insuffiicent load over the rear axle. When you brake for a corner - you get a weight transfer to the front axle - if you then turn in - there is little weight over the back - keeping the rear tyres in contact with the tarmac. 
To correct - lift your foot from the brake (perhaps even moving to a balanced throttle - 20-30% throttle pressure) - and steering into the skid.     
Driving without skidding is relatively simple. This is all based around the circle of grip. A tyre has a certain grip - this grip can be used for acceleration/braking and/or cornering. As conditions get worse the circle gets smaller. The more you try and get a tyre to do - the more likely you will go outside the circle.   
You can increase the circle by applying load to a tyre (as mentioned above).   
However, the most simple piece of advice I can give is this: 
ONLY DO ONE THING AT A TIME   
IE you brake in a straight line, you accelerate in a straight line. And you only steer when you are not doing either one of those 2 things.   
Never enter a corner with more speed than you need. If you have to brake mid-corner - you transfer weight to the front axle - losing back-end grip - causing oversteer.   
I would highly recommend a proper driving course with a qualified instructor to better understand the physics of how a car operates.

			Thanks for all the suggestions. As the car is newish, I will change from partial casco to basic next year. But even basic was in the range of 1400.- with smile direct on comparis, but it's difficult to get the quoted price when I call, they give me excuses and offer me other products or raise the price.

			soon as your plates are handed in the insurance and road tax expires. after that Id say see what you need to do at the Hungarian Import place. You can have foreign plates dumped in the country the car is going to ( I dropped my dutch plates here in CH at the OCN no problem) So yourwife can drive back and stay a while perhaps on your insurance etc etc.....

			A little personal anecdote on this one.   
There is a minibus which is owned by the family in the UK. Said minibus was purchased for £2000. A lower spec minibus goes for 10-14,000chf. Further more the family minibus had <10 seats from new - because it was set-up to move disabled people around.   
There is a huge difference between importing a minibus (70chf per 100kg), a van (66chf per 100kg) and a car with <10 seats (15chf per 100kg + 4% duty).   
The last one (car <10 seats) is why you need to know what the value of the car in CH is.   
The process is deliberately complicated and expensive!

well, with the 'resident' card, you can park indefinitely day and night without worrying about time. as far as i know, the resident card lets you use the space freely as long as you want, if you managed to find an empty spot.    
but without it, you can park during night until morning, and then during daytime you have to circulate in traffic before re-entering the park place for another 1-hour (well, maybe 1,5 hours) blue-zone usage.

But I worked at a ski lift here for the last three years and had to put them on at least once a week to get up and down. Going up the alps between 5-6 in the morning and wishing the snow plows would start earlier. My worst trip down was on ice without chains, from then on chains went on for ice. Nothing worst than sliding faster and faster and no control but knowing there's a big curve and a drop off coming, ended up in a stone wall on the other sdie luckily. I did finally get the spider chains, they go on and off quickly and don't bother the ABS sensors that some chains can damage. Good Luck in the snow.

These cameras are of a new type type to me and was wondering if they shot cars from the front or back or both. Cant appear to find any pictures of them on the web, they are mounted on poles about 10ft up all on the downhill side of the road in the case of the ollon-villar road.   
Would be interesting if they forget to turn hem off for the annual hill climb!

			Declare as you come through custom when to go to the UK, you will then get the right documents. 
You can run the bike on CH plates for 1 year then you need to register 
To do this you will have to take it to a VOSA test site , where they will test it for noise etc.  the headlight must dip the right way , and the speedo has to be in MPH (KMs on there own won't do).  Ironically, if you import from the EU, you can just put a MPH correction sticker over the top - but coming in from CH you will need a new speedo.  
If the bike has an LED display, just consult the manual about how to change it over   
Once to have passed the test, go to the local licensing office, and they will give you a registration number.  You then have to get a plate  ....   
If you have owned it for less than 6 months you will have to pay import duty.   
PS bikes are cheap in the UK, and expensive here.  It would be better to sell here, and buy back in the UK ....

On traditional lines without in-cab signalling, trains slow down to a speed where they can see the signals properly. Still not as much as cars, because as long as you obey the signals, the risk of running into a train ahead of you on the line is pretty small, fog or not.

			As the other thread is quite large and not a lot of info about Service des automobiles et de la navigation Lausanne and I think that this is a quite different story of what I read before.    
In July I applied to have my license converted. Did everything, I got my temporary license valid until November. In September I received a date with 9 days to spare. I had arranged classes with an instructor before even it was a bit of a stretch, I didn't complain. One day before the exam while running I had pain in my back. I called to cancel my appointment for the next day and I went to my doctor for a visit. I had small injury recently and had been visiting him for the last 4 months for the same issue. He took me (on the day of the test, which I canceled) had what I needed for my back and gave me a medical certificate specifically written for the SAN stating that I visited him on this date for back problems.    
I took this certificate couple of days later to the SAN and they said, no problem we will send you another appointment by mail next week. 3 weeks later I receive a registered letter with all my documents, my old licensed (annulled) and a fine for not presenting to the appointment, automatically forbidden to drive in Switzerland. That can't be right, first I canceled my appointment second I took them a medical certificate. My driving instructor was involved all the time and he was furious of what kind of bull they were doing to me. He went there couple of times, first they refused to give a reason for this decision and after 2 weeks they confirmed that it was a mistake on their part and that they will send me my appointment. 3 weeks later waiting I receive a letter from the lawyer of SAN Lausanne, stating that, as my medical certificate is NOT VALID, he will not give me another appointment for a driving test and he reminds me that I don't have the right to drive in Switzerland.    
My driving instructor went there to see this lawyer but he was refused a visit, it was not possible to talk with this guy. I went there next day (my french is limited) and I demanded to speak with somebody who speaks Italian. I requested to see the lawyer and ti give me a reason WHY my medical certificate is not valid, but also the same answer, not possible to meet him. After refusing to leave until I was given a reason for the validity of the certificate, they told me that the certificate did not include details of my sickness and it was not well written that I was not able to drive on that day.    
I went to my doctor explaining this and he is shocked, because to disclose personal details on a medical condition is ILLEGAL. He gave me his phone details and said just give this to whoever wants to talk to me and demand that details from me and I will set them straight. Going back to the SAN, they refused to call my doctor but rather he calls them and specifically the doctor that works for SAN who comes to work only 1 day per week. OK, I am bothering my doctor but he is willing to help, after 2 unsuccessful weeks of calling the SAN he finally got a hold of their doctor. After showing bills going back to 4 months before my test and stating from my doctor that he received me on that date with back problems and treated me, they requested a new medical certificate where he will write that I was not able to drive on that day.      
They could have requested this the very first day they saw my certificate and not take me into a maze of 4 months constant phone calls and bothering    
- my driving instructor 
- people at the counters that had no idea why is this happening to me 
- the Spanish lady at the Measures Administratif that was going back and forth to the lawyer's office to bring messages from me 
- my doctor    
After all was clear, I receive my new appointment, this time 6 days in advance.   I took 2 days of lessons and I went in today, passed it. What a huge relief. 4 months of phone calls, problems and not being able to drive.    
The test itself was not that hard but it was crucial to have a bit of lessons with a driving instructor. And the controllers seem to be more comfortable when you come with a driving instructor and you take their car for the test.

			Indeed you need the permit to register the car, simple as.    
The fact you have a UK licence has nothing to do with the fact you still have the year from entrance to surrender it for the Swissy, it makes no odds to the SVK.   
The insurance as correctly stated has to be in place before they will had over your plates, and no we don't fax or even e-mail such cover proof anymore it is done almost instantaneously unless the transfer systems are down... at which point I personally favour semaphore   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Dec 2011	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Temporary plates until I can register my car.

			I believe if you have a ""three country ticket"" (day ticket or whatever) then you can use it on that bus.   
However, unless you were going to buy a day ticket anyway, it's cheaper just to bung the driver whatever he wants in Euros as you get on.  I didn't know you could pay in CHF as well; hats off to VI for his knowledge.

			it doesnt work that way. you will almost never sell a vehicle to a dealer and then get a cheaper one.    
the dealer will MAYBE gove you 15k for it if that AND then rip you an even bigger one on the old car he is selling you.    
Sell it privatly, then import from Germany or so.  
Biggest financial mistake I personally ever made was buy a car in CH. Luckily my loan was in Euros so in the end I came out well....

			As I have been informed by my driving instructor: a space marked with yellow lines or a yellow cross means ""no parking"" - usually it's a spot reserved for government/police/fire vehicles or taxis/public transport or something like that. You are allowed to stop there and drop off/pick up or load and unload as long as you don't get in the way of the intended use.   
However - sometimes the yellow cross is time-limited - that is, it's a no-parking zone during some times and a parking zone at other times - if this is the case it's always marked on a sign nearby - usually there will be a sign marked with a P - indicating the times at which you can park (often weekends and out of work hours). If you can't see a sign then don't park on the yellow cross.

			Hi all, can anyone recommend a trusted mechanic in the Vaud area that speaks English. Preferably someone independant as opposed to a garage, who will not charge me a fortune (for a VW Golf). An engine light has come on and I am clueless, perhaps just means engine needs oil but I've only been here for 2 weeks and my french isn't great.

			Very late update,   
I brought the '99 Harley and overall it was pretty simple, not too expensive and totally worth it!  Here's a summary of how it went and some important notes...   
-Most important, you must have or get a copy of the title and/or registration to the ORIGINAL owner.  You need the DATE the first owner registered the vehicle, called date of immatriculation here.  My bike was 10 years old and the original micro film was about a month away from being destroyed.  I was VERY lucky!     
-A side note, plan on registering it right away even if you've heard you can ride on your US plates for a year, unless your US insurance will cover you here.  Swiss Ins won't cover US plated vehicles.  I didn't have any luck with that, anyway, so had to do the mod's, inspection and plating right away.  This ended up saving my ass on the whole immatriculation paperwork thing since the original doc's would have been toast had I waited!   
-I had the Harley dealer in Zurich do all the necessary modifications, inspections and registration with the Strassenverkehrsamt for around 200 Francs.  I picked up the bike ready to ride, totally worth the fee!   
-13 inch Apes, stainless cables and other slight modifications like sissy bar, foglamps, aftermarket pegs, etc. were fine.  These compliant modifications were listed on the registration so it won't be a problem for the future inspections, hopefully!  I have no idea how much it helped having the dealer (vs. me) talking to the inspection guys, but I'm guessing it wouldn't have gone so smooth for me.  Again, worth the 200 Francs.   
-Things that had to be modified to Swiss standards:  new light relfectors/bulbs/wiring, new speedo (mine was only mph), new exhaust pipes <80Db (bought stock pipes to pass inspection and just kept those on), air filter had to be the ""closed"" variety - not open to the back.  A couple other small things like a reflector in back and new license plate holder.  You'll probably be fine with little extra accessories but if they can be easily removed, just do it to avoid sticking points during inspection.   
All in all I think it was less than 2500 CHF to do everything which is a lot less than buying new or used here.  I've seen two bikes, nearly the exact bike as mine (same year, similar mileage and w/o my upgrades) advertised for the equivalent of about 4500 USD more than what I paid in the USA.     
My final note...If you can't handle expensive, don't move to Switzerland.

			There are differences in the pass/fail rates between cantons, and what is true in Zurich is not necessarily true in Vaud.  My husband took the control test in Lausanne and was asked either to have a driving school car available or test the handbrake in the parking lot.  He then had to do a reverse parallel park, a highway section, a town section- the normal driving test.  It is not unheard of in Lausanne for people to fail the control test.

So if you really want as much living space as possible on one salary and work in Wollerau - you should commute from the opposite direction. Anywhere from Lachen SZ onwards gets way cheaper than Wollerau AND Zurich. And that's a ten minute commute by car...

			I prefer the Discovery 4, have driven both in the last 6 months. Also had a RR vogue for a few weeks which is the nicest of the three but way too expensive. If you are lucky enough to get a reliable one the D4 HSE is a great car with a huge amount of space, if, like me, you get one that needs turbo replacement and 3 months off the road to get problems fixed, then it is a nightmare. To be honest I would avoid the Land Rover stable until they get the reliability issues fixed (I ignored this advice to my cost)

			No, I believe it is based on the current value of the car and is a fixed %. We told them car is now worth 7000 CHF because we had an accident with it (2 weeks after buying it) and had to do some work on it. They were very nice and trusted us, even though we didn't have receipts to prove it. So, if we payed the regular duty on the whole price, it would have been somewhat more.

			I always fly Continental, they fly out at a reasonable hour if you live in the Geneva/Vaud area and you're out of Immigration/Border Control by 12PM usually. The terminal C light rail station is in the middle of the building, slightly hidden but signposted properly and it gets you to New Jersey Transit pretty quickly. Then it's just a quick 20min ride to Penn Station, Manhattan.  If I have a 4 hour+ layover waiting to fly South I usually pop in for a couple of hours to enjoy NYC.   
  For the state of the planes, they're 90s vintage 767s. Leg space isn't fantastic but it's usually enough. If you're on a not so full flight go for the middle seat in an empty middle row, you can then spend the flight asleep fully stretched out on 3 seats! The inflight entertainment system is tape based and plays about 6-7 channels of continuously replaying movies or tv series, some old and popular, some pretty new. Not  on a par with more modern airliners but there you go. If you have a book and/or a laptop it doesn't really matter.    
  Continental use that annoying two prong audio socket btw, so you need an adapter for you favorite headset.

			Are you a student? Because if you are not then the 2 years automatically becomes 1 from the date that you declared the car. And you should declare the car as soon as you arrive to switzerland. Because if they stop you (customs, casual check on the morotway)  then you will have more problems than solutions. And if you have an accident then even more problem than solutions   
The driving licence you need to change it 1 year from the date that your resident permit has been issued

			I'm very happy with my Nuvi 2460LMT.  I got it from mediamarkt on sale for 259chf a few months ago.  I guess the cheapest around now is 267chf which is still a good deal.   
I had a Nuvi 360 for 5 years then I upgraded to this.  
The features I like best about it, which the 360 was missing, are: 
- lifetime map updates 
- big screen 
- voice command 
- split-screen junction view 
- lane assist 
- shows speed limits 
- the power cable and tmc antenna plug into the base, so you can just remove the gps from the base and take it with you without having to plug/unplug wires.      "	earned some respect	Join Date: Jun 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	4 year old satnav or brand new model?	Marco_T	Posts: 82

			Swiss tip - pay attention to the two little letters on the number plates of the cars around you, e.g AG stands for Achtung Gefahr (warning dangerous driver)    
Its good that NZ has the same roundabout rules as the UK now, but many people don't really grasp them and perhaps the swiss simplified version would be better. 
The painful problem for me is people who interpet the second exit as perhaps not straight on, maybe a few degrees left or right, and then they indicate left or right as enter the roundabout = confffussed everyone.   
Does switzerland have any micro-roundabouts? Probably not, I mean those roundabouts that really only serve to slow down traffic on a 4 or 3 way intersection. For those, there may not be enough time to indicate both on and off, but traffic certainly won't flow if people do not indicate when they are going around (right) the roundabout

			My OH is about to part exchange our car when he has just realised that the service book of the car he bought 6 months ago is NOT there    
According to the new garage they will not give us the price agreed without it.     
Unfortunately, my OH did not know it was not there (and niavely didn't know what it was as first car purchase  ) but being his usual anal self kept everything he was given on the day therefore we summise that he was never given it.    
So off we trot to the garage where we bought the car and they said they don't have it.  We are not sure where we stand now.  The car is 1 year old, he bought it in June 2011 and without the service book the new gagrage will only give us 10k for our 24k car    He's signed for his new car and made the payment without the book, on the trust that we turn up with it tomorrow.   
Any ideas?

4410	12.05.2010, 23:18	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Argau	"    Actually, I don't agree. I caused an accident last August. A three car pile up. In the process I wrote off my car and the one in front. The first car got off lightly with minor damage.   
It was 100% my fault. Luckily no one was seriously injured. I got fined, and rightly so, but no loss of licence. (EDIT: Saw your update post: bills & fines were in the order of 1,400 CHF, split 50/50 between Baselstadt and Baselland, as the accident was in BL, but I live in BS).      I'm with SimonHicken. You have insurance. If it is your fault, your insurance should still cover you. Accidents happen, that's what you have insurance for and unless you were drunk or speeding, then usually you are covered even if it is your fault.   
The only thing, I guess, is that people do try to take advantage of such situations to get something for free, but that's life.   
To the OP: your insurance company may or may not be the best place to ask for advice as they will not be impartial. Are you a member of the TCS? In which case I believe that they offer a first consultation for free. If you don't have their legal insurance cover - obviously if you do have their legal cover, I'm guessing you wouldn't be here!

			I can give you some concrete info regarding travel times from Morzine because we have a chalet in Chatel.  Travel time from Morzine to Thonon is about 35 minutes in the off-season (i.e. non-winter).  Thonon to the outskirts of Geneva is about 25 minutes.  Then, unfortunately, you will hit the REAL traffic and just to go 5 kilometers into the center will take you another 30 minutes, give or take, depending on the red lights.  It is a good, solid 1.5 hours in light/average traffic, door to door.  In heavy traffic, you need to add another 45 minutes to an hour.  My husband has almost missed his plane twice due to traffic and we had allowed an extra hour!   
Your best bet is to take the train from Geneva to Thonon and the bus from Thonon to Morzine, but you are limited because they don't start very early and they don't run very late.   
For us it is quicker, though longer, to drive around the other way (i.e. on the Swiss side) because there is a freeway all the way to Monthey.   
If you have any other questions about the Portes du Soleil, just P.M. me.

			Hi Tom    
I making the same thoughts as you , but the other way round as I have planned moving over to the UK and taking my swiss car with me.    
I have noticed that more and more cars from the EU with their different EU plates are in Switzerland and they are not changing their plates and it seems no ones cares really. In my road is one german lady she is here with her german plate car since a couple of months or more then a year. In Weil am Rhein /Germany just over the boarder are more and more british cars seen.  
As I know the law says you can drive anyway minimum 12 months in Switzerland without changing the plate. If your car is 3 month not in Switzerland I think you can even extend this , but check again.    
If I were you or me in the UK , I would do the following:    
1.If the car is already older (more then 10 years old for ex. ) I would drive it at least for another year , always paying the motor tax and the insurance of course, in the meantime checking for a new car.  
2. If the car is newer or you just want to keep it, then I would go after one year through the Motorfahrzeugkontrolle (MOT in Switzerland) after the check you will get the new swiss plate. You shouldn't have to pay import tax, but check this also.    
I just have noticed if the wheel is on the ""wrong side"" it is tyring to get the tickets of parking houses if the arm is not enough long. So in my case I can't enter in England in parking houses with barrier/Ticket system.  
In Switzerland we have much more such parking houses with barriers, so I hope your arms are long enough.....   
I hope I could give an idea...          "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Yet another car import question...	tommy1981	Posts: 8

The reason I mention this is that a few years ago I knew someone who imported their car but found, when they had a mechanical problem, that the part had to be specially imported which took time and a lot of extra cost. If you have to rent another car while you wait it makes it a very expensive operation. It’s also a problem if you want to sell the car here.    It’s worth checking this with the manufacturer.  	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	[Import] Bring car to Switzerland?	HDanilo	Posts: 12

The border crossing only became an official Swiss autoroute in 2006 (or was it 2008?) when the under-Basel route was finally completed.

			Not realy true, you need the 1320, every bikes has it, so make sure it comes with it when you buy a bike. Otherwise you can get in trouble passing the boarder. Other papers you dont need.

			traffic on the freeway was backed up so much at around 18:00 I didn't even bother with it and took surface streets.  Took me 20 minutes as opposed to my normal 10 but probably faired better that way.   The worst part was that I had to wait 5 cycles for one red light, where I usually only have to wait 1.

			It works both ways: I tried to buy insurance for me to drive my father's car in London, it was impossible. I used a well known experienced broker, Frizzell, and the problem was that I was not resident in UK any longer.    
Obviously you can get away with driving a car here for a time. But how often are you stopped routinely at borders or by town police and asked for your driving license and car papers? I am controlled at least once per year.    
And no Tom, no Zuger, and no Carlos, you cannot drive a foreign car sometimes, even in Basel & Tessin!

As there are only so many allocated per day, it pains me to see people buying them up, in fours etc speculatively, then selling them on here when they've decided not to use them. (I'm not talking for profit)

In the UK I am based in Yorkshire, so anywhere on M1 or M5 M40 would be OK for collection or drop off.

			This is from a consulting document,        
Of this regulation are subject to passenger cars, which are first approved in Switzerland for traffic. Passenger cars that are more than three months (variant a year) were registered before their import into Switzerland abroad are exempt from these provisions. For three months, the compatibility with European law says that cars that are more than three months outside the EU 27 were admitted, not subordinate to the 130 g / km-regulation. A period of one year reduces the risk of abuse. Three months in a vehicle abroad is to keep the face of today's popular waiting period for new cars may be no great obstacle to circumvent the 130 g / km-regulation in Switzerland. For a year, this hurdle much higher. To answer this question, both versions will be sent out for consultation. As a mass-giving date for the import into Switzerland, the date of declaration. Exempt from the provisions in any case, cars for special purposes are (eg residential motor vehicles, ambulances).     
Der vorliegenden Verordnung unterstehen Personenwagen, welche in der Schweiz erstmals zum Verkehr 
zugelassen werden. Personenwagen, die mehr als drei Monate (Variante ein Jahr) vor deren 
Import in die Schweiz im Ausland zugelassen wurden, sind von diesen Bestimmungen ausgenommen. 
Für drei Monate spricht die Kompatibilität mit dem europäischen Recht, welches Personenwagen, die 
mehr als vor drei Monaten ausserhalb der EU 27 zugelassen wurden, nicht der 130 g/km-Regelung 
unterstellt. Eine Frist von einem Jahr mindert das Missbrauchsrisiko. Ein Fahrzeug drei Monate im 
Ausland zu halten, ist angesichts der heute gängigen Wartefristen bei Neuwagen möglicherweise kein 
grosses Hindernis, die 130 g/km-Regelung in der Schweiz zu umgehen. Bei einem Jahr ist diese Hürde 
ungleich höher. Um diese Frage zu klären, werden beide Varianten in die Anhörung geschickt. Als 
massgebendes Datum für den Import in die Schweiz gilt das Datum der Zollanmeldung. Von den Bestimmungen 
in jedem Fall ausgenommen sind Personenwagen für spezielle Zwecke (z. B. Wohnmotorwagen, 
Ambulanzen).

I know of somebody who rents out classic cars (and drives them) for weddings. I don't think he's got a Mustang though. His name is Roger Descombes and he runs a taxi business in Neuchatel called Taxi Cobra. I don't have the number to hand but you can find him in the phone book. He runs the taxis from the Beau Lac hotel most of the time but he's sometimes up at the station.   
Can't really help with the buses though. Have you tried Robert Fischer at Marin?

			Ah. Well, he's in a much better position than if he had to go down town. You really want to avoid at all cost Rte de Lausanne and anything along the lake. But he won't need to go there to get to Lancey.    
It's been a long time since I've lived in GE so maybe someone else can comment what it's like at the border crossing. The two places that could hold him up are crossing into CH and then crossing the bridge to Lancey. Those are where you get bottle necks.

We changed one of our cars earlier this year (from Pug 206cc to Audi TT) and were not totally surprised that the premium went up significantly with the existing insurer (ZH). What was a surprise was that a quote from Axa, for identical cover, was something like 40% cheaper (~1400 compared with 2200). On the other car I've stuck with ZH for the moment, as they're about the same price, so it's clearly something to do with the specific model.   
As for Zurich vs Zurich connect, I've always found them to be identical. IIRC we had one policy with each, just by chance. Every time I've done comparisons they've come out just the same.

			To achieve a ranking of the tyres the testers measure how the tyre behaves under breaking and cornering with heavy snow, ice, deep water, water and dry conditions. All the factors are added together and a list of the performing winter tyres is published.    
You only need to buy the tyres which are recommended and on the list. One will be slightly better in snow, another better in deep water (Aquaplaning).    
Probably the most important factor is the rubber mixture. The summer tyres do not perform well in temperatures of less than 10 degrees C, and in cold weather almost any winter tyre is better than a good summer tyre.     
Just remember that driving on snow and ice requires  . Just because you have bought the best tyres, does not mean you can continue to accelerate hard, corner fast and break hard: you cannot!

4464	20.10.2011, 09:14	Member	Thanked 60 Times in 36 Posts	Location: in transit	"    Right. So it depends mostly on two things - what time you're driving and whether you're prepared to overtake. Actually, scrub that, from Folgensbourg it really won't make much difference. Time to Aeschenplatz will be between 15 (when it's me driving and overtaking, in light traffic) and 20 minutes, if there's a ""lot"" of traffic. I generally reckon on 25-30 mins and I'm ten minutes the other side of F'bg. Best other routes in would include coming in via Hegenheim, which would normally add 5-10 minutes, but is useful if you know there's a probpem on the motorway.   
It's a reasonable speed single carriageway road for about 7km from there, then a new bypass that links straight to the motorway just North of the border crossing, then round the Swiss motorway to the Breite exit, thence 2 minutes to Aeschenplatz.   
As for car sharing, that would be a little difficult. My wife and I both go into Basel most working days, say about 70-80% of the time, but our start times are very flexible, varying between around 0800 (rarely) and 0930. And finishing times even more variable. Oh, and we're often only in a 2-seater.   
BTW I'm also at Aeschenplatz, so would be happy to meet up for a coffee/drink/chat or whatever.   
Any other info I can help with?

does anybody know the answer to this question? 
I am moving to Lausanne and I have the possibility to buy a used car from my home country or to use the one of my mother for some time and then buy a new on in Switzerland.   
Do I have to register the car if belongs to my mother? 
If it belongs to me (from less then 3 months, value 2300 eur), do I have to register right away?  
Do I have to pay the custom fees and the sales tax?   
Thanks in advance

			Very important is to hire an instructor and practice with him a couple of sessions. No matter how good you are, Swiss rules are very unique. I know people who have had motor bikes for more than 20 years, good knowledge, have had licenses in other countries but failed the Swiss test a few times. There are countless details which you can only learn from a professional instructor.

			The scammer-promoted IDP myth is one of my favourite examples of optimism prevailing over reality. ""Really? It's a document issued by the United Nations that gives me the right to drive anywhere and can't be endorsed or revoked by anyone? And I can get mine for the low, low price of $19.95?

			If the train from Geneva is on time, you will be fine - the actual platform change won't take you more than three or four minutes.      
It's a similar sized station to Geneva,  maybe a bit bigger. There must be about 12 platforms altogether, all parallel to each other - you just go down the escalator, along the underpass and up the escalator to your next platform.

			It all boils down to this: misunderstandings can be best avoided by just including a bit more detail in the opening post, when requesting help;   
e.g.  (I assume he should know) .   
Not too hard, and now we would all know to tread a bit more lightly.   
I personally would use the resources of the internet, but if requesting local knowledge here, I would write as above - no real personal details, but the gist is given.   
It still amazes me how people are so economic with their typing on internet forums, as if you have to pay per character (like txtng). Even I can type a few lines at a time with two fingers. How hard can it be to write   after   in the thread title - for me, this and the OP set the tone for this request.

This is how a German friend did it with his German and Swiss driver's licence so it's probably the same rule throughout the EU at least.

			Halbtax is valid in CH only for   half the fare ( e.g. half price from Zürich to Basel SBB or to Konstanz ) and 25% off for the remainder of the journey into Germany. The 25% discount is because of the TEE Rail Alliance agreement, and would apply from Basel SBB or Konstanz to Frankfurt.     
For  , you might need to get the the   add-on ( you need to ask SBB to add this to your Halbtax ), in which case you get a discount for the foreign portion.     
There are no free rides with the Habltax in CH. It only reduces the fare ( by max 50% ) up to the last Swiss border station.   
You might want to look up   and plot a journey from Zürich to Frankfurt and under Bahncard / discounts, state that you have a Bahncard 25 ( which is equivalent to a Swiss Halbtax ). Purchases from Deutsche Bahn are best when made 90 days prior to travel ( some deals are as low as EUR30 onew way ) and prices increase rapidly when the travel date nears.   
Owing to an impending timetable change on December 11th 2011, journeys beyond that date are presently unbookable until the 18th of October.            "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Oct 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	zurich-frankfurt by train	aspartam	Posts: 1

4511	28.09.2011, 13:53	Member	Thanked 94 Times in 68 Posts	Location: Morges VD	"    This is not a very accurate post. You canot just walk in and buy plates unless you have a specific car to attached them to as in order to get plates you need insurance.    
In order to get insurance you need a car as quite logically a Fiat 500 costs slightly less than a sodding great Ferrari to insure, despite being manufactured by the same company.   
Garsage plates are available to bona fida garages, you need to show prove of a workshop and a business and garage plates (ending in ""U"") allow a garage to drive any car and be insured. If soemthing stupid happens when on ""U"" plates they get taken away, the garage guy will have a problem to run his business. Indeed without plates for a whole week would tend to suggest itr may not be quite true.   
Fancy plates with more or less numbewrs in particular sequences are available, usualy sold under auction, check the SAN website.   
To get plates is REALLY easy. You find a car and agree to purchase, you take a copy of the registration document and send to your prefered insurance company. They will issue a reciept of insurance directly to the SAN in Blecherette, Lausanne, also in Aigle, Nyon and Yverdon in canton VD. You go to the SAN office of your preference, give them the old registration dox, they re-issue a new one with your details and insurance policy marked on it, give you the plates which you then attach and drive off.    
It can be if the car has not got a valid expertise MFA/MOT they may ask you to have one at the same time as getting your plates or shortly afterwards, if you don't really know much, buy a car with a valid cert, it's far easier and cheaper in the long run than wasting hours running about and worrying whether new tyres are Chf 2.50 cheaper here or their, time also has a value....

			Hi All,   
has anyone done their CBT for the for A1 motorbike test recently?   
I've been looking around and found a place near my office in Oerlikon who, as an added bonus speak English, but I wondered whether the prices where competitve with what others have paid.   
i dont own a scooter yet so will be looking to hire there. Perhaps it would be cheaper to buy one first (not sure if im even allowed to!)    
they are quoting between 1500/2000 CHF    
thx

			Not quite on-topic BUT:   
If you are time-rich and price sensitive you are often advised to HUB-SWAP. This is the practice of taking a short-haul flight from your local hub to another - and then the long-haul flight.   
The hubs are where major carriers are based - and so try to tempt rival airline passengers with lower prices. If you are flying from LONDON it is often cheaper to hub-swap to Paris (Air France), Frankfurt/Munich (Lufthansa), Amserdam (KLM), Zuirch (Swiss) than it is to fly BA from Heathrow.   
It costs around 3 hours in flight times though.

			Understand - thanks so much for pointers. What I'm hearing is... recreational driving with winter tyres 360 (ish!) days a year is ok, if we stay on main roads and drive with care. Thats enough for us for now. Will also get chains if we need, and when weather bad be careful about our route / plans.    
More specific question - how does this affect the snow / ski resorts near Zurich? Liek are these main roads which are treated and ok to drive on most of the time with just a fwe bad days to leave, or would we always have an issue with these.   
Again sorry for level of the questions - total newbie at this real winter thing. Know it's not siberia, but in Ireland we get small amount of snow and when we do country stops  _

			are you talking about 4x4 or motortbike?   There are routes for motorbike available.    
other option is france on the ""chemins"" but not all are allowed.   
BEST option is italy, we returned for a weeks enduro riding and covered over 1000 km off road.    
there is an off road ""park"" somewhere in southern switzerland i seem to remembe but  supid expensive - as normal.

			Hi   
I checked out at Zurich Airport if its possible to use a Visa Debit Card, interestingly the only company that did accept this was National/Alamo Car Rental, they said they would debit the premium excess charge and the cost of refueling the car from card in advance. The others either said no, or that no other company does this.. although the National Car Rental counter was opposite them. I was checking this up on the internet as I wanted to find other companies too that would accept these cards. However, I came across one site saying that they could do a credit check if you present a debit card (I presume a national credit rating check) I guess to ascertain if I'm a flight risk or something. They said that the very fact that they check this will show up on my credit report and can have the effect of lowering my rating... I presume that creditors will form an opinion that if someone checked you mustn't be credit worthy enough. I don't know if this was referring to the US or Europe or somewhere else, but can anyone verify if this is true or not in Switzerland or Europe.    
I will get a credit card in the future, but not at present.    
Thank you in advance for any advice.

Anyway, she was showing him her phone and he appeared to be unhappy about something. In the end she stood her ground and stopped talking to him, and he got off at the next stop. Not sure what it was about exactly, but I was wondering, if you buy a ticket on your phone, do you have to prove you bought it before you begin your journey?

			If you really are leaving on the 13th month, ie. one month over the limit, then I wouldn't change it. But if you think there is any chance you will stay longer than in the 11th month I'd go get it all sorted.    
After the 12th month the problem is not so much the license but the car. You won't be able to import it tax free and it will be a bigger hassle.    
Anyway, it's not difficult so if in doubt, I'd go get it done.

			Hi there,   
This seems legit. The T1 is a transit document. This is needed to move your car as cargo from the seaport to the Swiss border.   
I take it you have arranged your own transport from Hamburg on? This would explain why they want a security deposit. Ususally, when the one and same transporter is in charge (for opening the T1 at the port and closing it at the Swiss border), this charge does not apply. But since you are a one-off customer and therefore a potential risk it is understandable.   
As for the cost - since it is your own car for personal use, you should not pay duty and VAT on it, as far as I know and if you have the correct documentation (form 18.44 Uebersiedlungsgut)...   
Good luck!

			AFAIK. its not the driving in Switzerland part that gives you legal trouble but the bringing into Switzerland part. Technically you are importing a car when you cross the border, even as a tourist.     Art. 30ff. It may help to help and argue with  . But you have to leave Switzerland with the car a after three days.

you can not claim the tax back on technical vehicle items BUT if you have the said parts fitted included in a bill with a labour cost then you can.    
eg i bought a rear tyre for my motorbike and a few other technical parts and then all was ok, i could claim the tax back.   
no labour = no tax back.

			My family and I want to travel for 10 days in October and I looked at the InterRail pass that gives you 5 travel days within a 20 day period for a reasonable price. My question is.....Once I receive the pass from InterRail, do I then have to make separate reservations on each of the legs I want to take, or is it similar to the AB Swiss pass where you can just go to a station and hop on a train. If anyone has some experience with the InterRail, I would love some real world info.

			I've driven ZH to the UK many times. I have done the Luxembourg route but prefer to use the French Autoroutes. Yes you have to pay tolls to use these roads but in my view it was worth it as the road quality is excellent and a it's a fast, direct route. As for scenery, it was mentioned above that there's nothing to see - I beg to differ, some of the forest landscape is beautiful, long sweeping roads going up and down hill, rolling countryside (like England only much larger) and of course, there's the whole of the World War I battle fields and memorials to take in if you want to make a few stops along the way, Verdun is well worth a visit.   
As regards speeding on the Autoroutes, in theory they can of course check your speed merely be checking the toll ticket purchase time and your arrival at the next booth, in practice I don't think they ever bother. Watch out for the Gendarmes, especially when going down a long incline with sweeping bends, the cops often sit just behind bridges with they speed traps. also, don't even think about speeding any where near the borders, the cops just love to pounce there and fines can be heavy.   
Safe journeys!

			Hi all, 
I will soon move to Basel from Italy and I'm thinking of bringing my car with me. The issue is that, although I always use that car, it is registered in my name and also in my father's name. Do you think this is going to be a problem for using the car and then register it in Switzerland later on? 
We have owned the car for more than six months so, according to  , I won't have to pay import duty, unless the authority create problems due to the shared ownership of the car. 
Another question is for the parking permit: I will have a B permit and hence my residence will be moved to Basel, where I would like to request a parking permit or "" "". Will it be a problem to get the permit for the first 12 months while the car will still have Italian plates? Or perhaps the police is happy to provide the parking permit as long as I can demonstrate that I live there and pay the relevant fee? 
Many thanks, 
Gigi

			84K in a 2 years old car is perfect. It means the car had run mainly in motorway, so the engine, transmission, brakes are in much better conditions than a car that run mainly in the the city where the brakes and gearbox are much more used.   
84k in a car is nothing. Like someone said ""Grab yourself a bargain"". Some good references about the dealer you choose is always important.

As has been said, City to Geneva then the train (but fares on Swiss have really gone up) 
I have gone Luton - Geneva but the timings are not good for me (early morning and early evening) 
Gatwick - Geneva - not too bad if you can get a good deal.   
The only really annoying thing is that every flight seems to come in just about the time where you just miss the train and then you have an hour to wait...

Cutting 20% of the price list across the board is the more honest approach, but it will have knock-on effects for all marques here...

I suppose it's not too  bad but just a cost to bear in mind when deciding whether to import.

			I am selling my 2003 VW golf estate. Its in good condition, probable worth between 2k and 2.5k sterling (From a quick look on autotrader.co.uk).   
I can't find the time to drive it home and get it sold.    
I would except any reasonable offer in CHFs, so there is a possibilty of a bit of profit to anyone who is heading to the UK.   
Could be ideal for anyone relocating back to the UK. I brought all my possesions down here in it a couple years ago. Drive it to the UK, and sell it there.

yes very amusing but it would grow old quick i guess with the use of ANPR now .....   The RTA 1991 amended the RTA 1988.  the figure used to be 15,000 but it was changed to the newer amount i suspect to prevent people depositing the amount.  The post office prob had the exemption as it was a state owned organisation  so would then make sense.   
If I was the OP I would have in writing from the underwriter NOT the broker, that the vehicle would remain fully insured (at present level of cover) for the complete duration the vehicle is not present within UK and stating who can drive the vehicle with the insuarance policy in force.

The roads are oversaturated as is, and unless everyone were to change their mindset overnight and start carsharing, the problem just gets worse. I'd stick with the train for peace of mind.

I took the train everyday, 80 mins one way for almost two years.  Now I have a car and it is about 45 mins one way.  The cost is about the same, even factoring in maintenance, etc. but I just prefer to drive.  Part of this is because at least once a day, I was running to make a connection.  But mostly, I like to be able to leave when I want and have a little more control over my schedule.  Plus, I can do conversational German in the car (which I can't do on the train) and/or sing at the top of my lungs if I want.  I am just more relaxed when I get into work and when I get home at the end of the day.  It isn't as draining on me to drive as it was to take public transport.  And saving half the time is also really nice.   	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Feb 2011	Groaned at 53 Times in 23 Posts	Car vs SBB: Where's the savings?	jerallie	Posts: 615

We're looking to buy a 7 seater car e.g C8 or Sharan, something along these lines.  Price around 30K to 40K. 
What would be the paperwork involved if we boutght it in Germany/France and imported here?   
What would the likely cost be? 
What are the benefits of going to a direct import garage here in Switzerland?

			As promised - an update on how Disabled Passenger Assistance works at Basel Airport.   
36 hours before travelling you need to e-mail CGS( ) confirming that you have pre-booked this help.   
At check-in we confirmed with BA that help had been booked, they were very helpful and put disabled stickers and 'Priority Luggage' labels on the suitcase and labelled her wheelchair even though it had been agreed that she could take her own chair onboard with her (it folds up similarly to umbrella type pushchairs). If she hadn't wanted to take her own chair they would have provided one for her for transport to and from the gate.   
However, despite having pre-booked the assistance and confirmed with CGS we still had to wait nearly 40 minutes for someone to come to take her through to the gates - not a huge problem as we had allowed plenty of time for all evenualities but if you were running late you could be in trouble.   
Once collected by CGS it was straight forward - straight through passport control and down to the gate, not too bad if the flight is on-time but could be an issue if there is a long delay as there was no-one around at the gate for most of the time.  Boarding was simple - first on the plane and plenty of time allowed to get to her seat before they allowed anyone else to board.  Although it wasnt necessary they would have physically carried her up the steps to the plane in her wheelchair if the boarding ramps hadn't been available!   
So, not as efficient as Heathrow but worked well, just a little concerned about how it would have worked if there had been a long delay and a change of gates (has happened to us several times at Basel).

			Agree with Bob, think about the unit if it's going on the bike. Will it be mounted on a RAM mount or similar, exposed to the elements, or in a tank bag to keep it waterproof. We seem to have more Tomtoms in the bike group than Garmin.  
I do all the route planning on mine, and it's pretty good, so gets my vote if you go for a mobile unit.

It was excellent value for money, but more importantly I was totally amazed at the level of service they gave me.  As I wasn't buying a brand new car most BMW main dealers didn't want to know, but the saleman from Bavaria Auto in Baar (near Zug) was excellent.  I got them to fit a Sat Nav stereo which they did perfectly and they even gave my wife a bouquet of flowers when we picked up the car (which was a really nice touch).  Please PM me if you want the name of the sales chap as he speakers really good English and is a great chap.  Would highly recommend them and will be purchasing my next car from them.

			Does one require a Swiss driving license in Switzerland to buy or lease a new car? If one has the money, then it doesn't matter I suppose, but if one needs to lease or requires credit then what are the rules?

For 50cc, you need category F (up to 45km/h) or any larger bike licence (A1 - up to 125cm³ and 11KW, or A - unlimited bikes).   
- Category F (50cm³, am 45km/h): 12 months learner permit after passing theory test. These things are slow, and tuning isn't taken lightly. Forget about that one...   
- Category A1 (125cm³, max 11KW / 15hp or 50cm³ unlimited speed if under 18 years old)): 8 hours base instructions. 4 months learner period, then another 12 months after passing 8h practical test (if you have car licence category B)   
- Category A step-up licence (bikes below 35KW and with maximum kW/weight ratio of 0,16kW/kg): minimum 18 years of age, 12hours minimum practitical riding instructions, learner period available.   
- Category A direct entry (unlimited over 35KW): minimum 25 years of age, 12hours minimum practitical riding instructions, learner period available.

			Apart from the logistics of transport, I suggest you pack some crayons and small colouring books in your hand luggage to keep them occupied during the flight. Or perhaps some small hand-games.   
I also charge up my iPhone to max and have a few games installed on it. Handing a toddler an iPhone to play with works wonders in keeping them quiet and occupied.    
Also take some chewable sweets in case they experience pain in the ears as the plane descends.    
You might also want to alter the sleep schedule on the day before the flight, so that they are more likely to fall asleep in-flight. Tho, be warned that if they don't fall asleep, you'l have a grumpy tired todller on your hands.

  Hi,   
  That's also good information--if all else fails we'll call the moving company-though they did seem pretty efficient with the paperwork, so I'm surprised they dropped the ball on this one.

			If you put Baden to Konstanz into Google Maps the second route it will show you (A7) takes you through Wislikofen and Embrach to Winterthur where you join the highway. I used to take that road when I was visiting a relative who was recovering at the lakeside after an operation. It moved quite well although I could imagine there being jams around the big roundabout just after the highway stretch at Glattfelden and again near Embrach. Also mind the speed cameras in Rorbas.

The inspection authorities here really respect the quality of German cars, but I would not import the car unless it is nearly new.   
If you buy a car, I would go with the Subaru.  It is best for the mountains and snow conditions.

			In my view you'd be better off with a 3000chf Volvo/Merc estate - after 18mths it'll only be worth 500chf anyway because it will need a new MFK when there is a new owner.   
2,500chf for 18mths motoring is about as cheap as you'll get over here.   
If you do want to lease - Bank Now and GE Money are arguably the big 2 away from the main dealer network.   
In both cases - find the car at a garage, apply online with Bank Now, give them all the information, they'll then deal directly with the garage. Remember though, with a leased car you'll need Fully Comp insurance - which is based on the NEW VALUE of the car - and not on what you paid for it. They rightly believe that a 100,000chf new price car will always cost the same to repair - even if it is only worth 10,000chf.   
Buying something old (and cheap) for cash means you can go with 3rd party insurance only.

			I'm not sure what ""stand-offish"" means, however there are two reasons they would dissuade you from importing the car into Switzerland:   
- the cost and nuisance of bringing it here and the conversion 
- normally it would be more viable to sell your BMW in the US and acquire another one here, which it seems is not the case with you.   
Other than the changes needed to make your car legal for registration in Switzerland, there are a lot of other differences between the US and Euro versions of the same model, the exhaust system, for example, and the Swiss parts/service system is geared for the Euro model and some parts for your car may not be stocked in Switzerland.   
When BMW tries to explain all this to a customer, who doesn't understand all the machinations, it may lead to misunderstandings and non-acceptance of reality, so they naturally discourage such imports.

			no idea where you are going to /from.  If you have your own car, the cheap car ferry route is Dunkirk-Dover, particularly if you travel around mid-night, 2 or 4am with Norfolk lines, now DFDS, cost can be as low as £20 each way.  The journey is 2hrs and is it a quiet and comfortable journey.   
Driving through Belgium you avoid the toll fees of France.   
But not sure if you will need to buy the vignette for Germany.  Quick search on google said only for Trucks since 2005. 
It is not the quickest way, depends how you like driving long distance and the time factor, good point you can carry a lot of luggage unlike airlines. 
Be interested to know if there was a coach service covering this route?

			Next to the airport, (500 meters) there is a place you can  
store your luggage. See: on the bottom of the page:   
""The luggage storage is located on Blikavöllur 5, 500 meters from the departure side of the airport. Its in a 3 story high building and it says Geysir on the outside of the house. Opening hours are from 8 AM  6 PM.""         
Other options: 
You can arrange to leave your luggage at Motel Alex, 
which is 2 minutes away from the airport.  .   
Another possibility is store it at the BSI Bus terminal. Two years 
ago their cost was 500 ISK for first 24 hours, and then 200 ISK 
for each additonal day.

			Rent a sprinter van...   
maybe fly to Manchester first and rent a van there as will be cheaper (make sure you tell them it's going to Swiss so they give you the vehicle docs and a yellow vest) and then go pick up your furniture...   
or if you aren't staying in Manchester rent a van from Germany.   
If you're lucky you might find someone on the forum bringing stuff to Swiss who would take your stuff back in their empty van.

The car is still registered in the friends name. 
Can I simply drive the car into Switzerland and show my B Permit and insurance Document? 
Or will the little chocolate swiss scouts give me grief?

I am shipping my car from US to Germany. From there I am planning to drive it to Switzerland and eventually register it in Zurich. I have valid Canadian license plates for the car, but Canadian insurance does not cover the car while anywhere outside North America. 
Does anybody know what procedure should I follow to get the car insured in Bremerhaven? What insurance company should I talk to (preferably in English)? Is it possible at all?   
Thanks,

			Standard approach for BSL is usually from the north for landing 16, with strong northerly or easterly winds you might get traffic on 34. The cross runway is too short for any airliners of a reasonable size. Just because Switzerland leases much of the land from France at the southern end, this doesn't influence approach or departure routes. (I can't find any STARs or SIDs for BSL freely available on the net I'm afraid). STAR - Standard Approach, SID = Standard Instrument Departure.   
I'll quote my much vaunted phrase, ""unless you are about 80 years old, you'll probably find that the airport was there before you.""

			Delightfully almost devoid of people. Avoided the Bundeshaus because I thought there might be more people there, and I refuse to accept politically tainted chocolate anyway.   
My BH wanted to see the children's lantern parade, but no children to be seen on the Monsterplatz, none on the streets. I told her they must have fed them all to the bears, so we stopped for a bite at Fugi. Then over a sip of Sake, much to my surprise, a rather small parade with brass band made its way up from Baerengraben. Lots of parents, but not many kids with lanterns. Where are all the kids?, she asked. Told you, bears ate them.

			Main problem is with the websites of the airlines as Emirates or Singapore. If you fly from Zurich they always show prices in CHF. Most of teh times they define the prices in CHF (e.g. 849 CHF) and they do not adjust the prices based on the currency. 
I know expedia but in this case doesn't give many good options. 
I found quite good   Does anyone know this website? Prices are in USD, wide options and quite easy to read.

			I decided convert my driving licence to Swiss. I have A and B category. 
Now I've recieved a papers from Stressenverkehrsamt but don't understand what exactly I need to do. 
Should I check only ""B"" or ""B"" and ""A""? 
I'm going to convert all my categories, but when I was in Stressenverkehrsamt  they told me I need only driving exam on car. It will be enough. 
This paper confuse me. 
And what about driving lessons they told me in second paper. Should I find somebody for driving lessongs by myself or they give me some contacts or some person?   
Sorry about stupid questions, but I do not understand Swiss system for a while... 
Will appreciate for any help.

			My 2 penny's: I was told that even with a UK driving licence, I would require to carry a translation of the document , if I was to drive in Spain. This was a requirement by the insurance company as well.  I gather that the situation has changed with the introduction of the new Photocard, etc, but for Spain, it is still advisable to carry this translation, esp wioth a UK (DVLA)issued document. 
BTW, I was stopped at the Swiss /German border a few months ago, in my Lorry, and the Border guard would not accept the UK photocard driving license or the new 'Smartcard' Digital Tachograph.  
Happy Days.

However, other people are saying you won't get a good price because it was a ""foreign import"".  I'm thinking of coming over with a 2004 A6.  It has only 22K miles on it.  I would take care of any changes necessary e.g. lights.  I was of the opinion that I could sell it for more than in the US after we used it for a year of probably more low mileage driving and pay off my transport/conversion costs.   
So a question to you since you seem experienced with this. It appears I can drive on my US license for a year, I can keep my plates for a year.  Our assignment is for a year.  Do I have to have the changes made if only a year?  Do I need it inspected immediately or can it wait some period of time and if so for how long?  Is insurance any problem?  Would I get it there or from the US prior to leaving?

			Does anyone know what the maximum allowed time is for train station lockers? Does this vary by station? I need to leave some items for about a week. I looked and the sign is confusing, it says after 3 days collect your items from the baggage department but does this mean 3 days is the maximum, will I incur a fine, does the price change, etc? At the 3 day mark do they come and collect the items and place them in their baggage department? The two train stations I am specifically interested in are Baar and Zug. I checked the website and there is no information on this topic, only price and dimension. Thank you!!

			Hi all - we're heading south for the weekend from Zurich. Not too worried about Friday evening as we're collecting the car about 5pm and only heading as far as Chur. Then working our way down to Locarno / Ticino.    
On monday we come back via the Gotthard pass (not the tunnel) back to Zurich. Trying to figure out what time we should leave, how much time we have for sightseeing and playing in Alpine passes on the way home      
Just wondering: 
 - if this usual journey time is say 2.5 -3 hours, what would it be on a bank holiday / public holiday Monday like this one? 
 - are there times of the day we should avoid, or is it like most places where the trick is to get on the road early enough?   
Thanks 
Graham

			Getting around Lausanne, and continuing on the A1 towards GVA anytime near rush hour in September will make you think twice about driving, with all the traffic and congestion (I would second the train option if possbile).  During summer holidays it is ok, but during the normal working periods, the A1 around here can be a parking lot, even without an accident, and more and more each day, with either rain or an accident, it will be paralzyed.  Hitting GVA after 9 a.m. should be ok, but Lausanne around this time will be difficult at best.  I would plan at least 3.5 hours or more, depending on whether you can miss your flight/take a later flight or not.     
Also, be aware of the Jeune Genevois holidays (8 Sept.) in GVA in early Sept., you did not mention a date. And Jeune Federal for Lausanne/VD.

			To be honest, I really wouldn't worry about license transfer to the US. Just start ""from scratch"". While I don't know MA in particular, if you know how to drive, preparing for and taking the drivers test is likely to require $50, a friend willing to loan you a car, and a few afternoons to read the book and maybe practice driving through cones.

			You'll want to get the book referenced in this thread:   . You can get a hard copy of the book, which is what I did and kept in the glove compartment until I left (just in case!).    
Driving rules are different (you'll absolutely need to learn the right of priority before you get behind the wheel) from the US. Also learn what the street signs mean pretty well before driving, as they will catch you out as you're driving even if you thought they made sense on foot.

			Hello,   
A suggestion would be to book 'ACC' - 'accomodation only' via a UK tour operator.  After working in the travel industry for many years this would be an ideal option.  You then book the travel arrangements yourself.  Just make sure the airport transfer option is not too difficult for you and try and pick somewhere not too far from an airport so if you need to use a taxi it wont cost you too much.

If it's a daily ticket and not just an ""hour"" ticket, you can still ride around the city for unlimited trips on that particular day.    
2.  There is a system called Zuri Rollt which is a free bike rental service.  I think you have to leave a deposit and maybe your ID  but it might not be the optimal solution for a daily commute.

			OK, I (eventually) went into the SBB office at Morges and the person there didn't know...   
However yesterday I got my new card in the post - without having done anything! Quite impressed, but still had questions... so I rang up the AG service centre.    
And the answer is, that if your AG subscription is continuous from the end of one year to the next, then no, you are   tied in for the first four months of your new card.    
And, incidentally, even though they send you a new card around 6 weeks before your old one expires you are not obligated to use it - you can send it back and cancel it.    
However, the bad news is that the tariffs went up in December, so when my new card starts I have to pay 305fr per month instead of 285fr... but I was expecting that.

			HI   
I have been in switzerland just over a year, i bought a cheap car from a garage and its been very good to me. I had a service done on it at the beginning of summer and the mechanic said everything was fine and just changed the oil filter for me, he also checked everything from the big service and reported everything to be fine with the car (I know him from work)  
I am selling my car for 1500 CHF as im leaving switzerland at the end of the summer, im willing to negotiate if you interested ?   
Its a 1995 vw Polo, it has done quite a few km just over 150 000 but runs well and is pretty good on petrol ( i drive to and from work and to the next village and have been to bern twice on one tank and it lasted me 3 weeks).   
let me know if you interested, or good luck with your decision making      
Thanks

As far as I know, you need to have an International Driving Permit (IDP) along with your Indian driving license if you want to hire a car in Switzerland. However if u hold a Swiss residence permit, you can drive with your Indian license for one year.

			I was looking for a different piece of information on the gleis7 website and came across this passage:      which translates very roughly to:      Concerning the later bits, is it saying that if you take an early morning train that departs before 500, that you can continue riding that train to its destination even after 500?   
I am interested basically for the S-train (not SN) that leaves Zurich HB at 4:48 and reaches Brugg at 5:25. Does the Deutsch say that I should be covered the whole way? This would give longer nights and free return home!

			If you cancel the tickets you should get a refund of all government takes that you've paid.  If the flight to Oslo was not direct (i.e. there was a stop-over) then even better as there will be 3 airport taxes in the ticket price to refund.   
However, Czech may make a charge for doing this, which could be equal to or more than the taxes.

			The whole ""hire and reward"" thing is pretty much clear in all countries including the UK; the key word is ""consideration"", i.e. will you be getting any personal advantage out of it, be that in cash or any sort of ""payment in kind"".   
Cost-sharing where you also pick up your proportion of the hire and fuel costs is perfectly legal; the others covering ""your share"" is not. And the reason for getting that nice bottle of Scotch a few weeks after the trip? Well, who knows?!?!?

Am looking for a motorbike rider (Class A 25kW) or someone who has the transport possibilities for a motorbike. The bike is located near Sissach (BL). The bike would need to be ridden/transported to Kanton Aargau, roughly 60km. I will pay all transport costs (train, gas).   
Thanks for sending me a private message.

			I've occasionally heard snippets of information about this project over the last few years. When visiting the Swiss Transport Museum in Luzern a couple of years ago, I saw a display all about the latest version that they had been testing. It's great to hear that they have a solid plan to implement the system. However, it seems like a huge undertaking to equip all, or even a significant amount, of Swiss transport with the system. Plus, the idea seems excellent in theory, but would encounter a lot of problems in practice. However, if anyone can figure out how to do it right, then it will be the Swiss, so I look forward to seeing the results.

If it came in at around CHF 5k I could probably live with that but not too keen on paying more.    
I suppose my biggest concern from what has been written so far would be with regards to the car being ""original"". It was restored in the early 90's and as I mentioned I will have some further restoration work done on it. Certain modifications will have been made to improve things like the ignition but it is not like to is some super modified racer or anything. The original Lotus chassis has been replaced with a Spyder chassis which is fairly common in Elan restorations.

			I think the point you need to make clear to the authority is that even though your old permit expired on 5 May, you do have a valid new permit that begins on 6 May.  In other words, you did not park there at any time illegally.      Your mistake was that you did not have a valid permit displayed at the time you were parking, but since your new permit is actually valid from 6 May, the parking was not illegal.  Best to make a copy of the new permit and let the authority know this and also let them know that even though the new permit is valid from 6 May, you did not actually receive this until later!  You can perhaps photocopy the envelop showing a postmark after the 6 May (proof that you were sent this valid permit only much later).  Hopefully this will change your fine to a failure to display permit one instead of parking illegally in blue zone.   
In any event, do let us know what happens at the end.

Geneva Secheron is a new stop that was added with the new local regional train that goes to/from Coppet to Lancy Pont Rouge.  Only really useful for local commuting in the greater Geneva area.  Although if you are lucky, you may be able to use it to connect to Cornavin for the bigger trains, but it runs bascially only 2x per hour and only the small regional train stops there.  Generally though you have more and better connections by tram or bus to Cornavin from the Sechereon area, or just walk, it is not far.   
If going to the airport, again, Cornavin is better, about half to a third of all trains entering GVA continue to the airport.  If taking the secheron stop you would have to change trainis in Cornavin anyhow as the regional train goes to the other direction to Lancy pont rouge.

I've actually already gotten an eu exhaust, and even the original eu exhaust for this model/year - sadly not good enough as the registration still doesn't have measurements.     
Makes me wonder though, what if one were to change the engine for an eu one? the vin would still be Canadian, but they would have little excuse to measure a certified eu engine. I would imagine that's somehow illegal though.

Here was the solution (I am not sure if you have the possibility): As we are members of Mobility CarSharing we rent the car through them with Hertz - it was also discounted. We needed to call them and they placed the reservation on our behalf and invoiced it to us. Like that, Mobility was like a garantor to Hertz for us.    
(In the end we had to cancel the trip anyway, but that's how it supposedly worked)

			Because most airlines increase their fares the closer you get to departure. One of the downsides of being in Zurich is that it can be a right PITA to get to some places in the Med (Ionian, some parts of Turkey, Gibraltar etc) - especially anywhere I want to sail  
You might consider a more convoluted route - I'm flying to the Ionian later in the year and it's cheaper to fly to Manchester and out from there, than the closest direct flight

			It depends on which bus you get. If it is a Zürich city bus or trolleybus then the driver doesn't sell tickets so you get on at any door. On the suburban buses (eg Glattalbus, Limmat bus) or the post buses where they don't have a ticket machine at every stop the driver will sell tickets and you can get on at any door until 21H. After that, as others have said, you get on at the front and the driver will check your ticket.

There is a bus service between Vicques and Delemont and a direct train from Delemont to Basel, so the TNW pass wouldn't be valid as you say. I already bought my monthly pass, paid chf172, which I don't think is too bad, I'll make the journey 44 times, so just under 4 bucks each way is okay by me.   
The guys at the station didn't seem to know anything about Basel trams, the furthest they could make my point to point was to Basel SBB. They said they couldn't do anything at their end, so I'd have to sort that out in Basel.  
So you're basically saying there is a monthly tram abo, but it could be cheaper to buy 12 for the price of 10 tickets?

			The normal train tickets (not Mobilis) should be valid until about 4-5am next day.   
If you are within Mobilis range:   
Mobilis individual tickets entitle you to unlimited travel on all operating public transportation services within the applicable zones during the validity period. Mobilis individual tickets are valid for 30 minutes, 1,2, 3 or 4 hours depending on the area of validity (local tariff, short distance, zones). The last journey has to be completed when the period of validity expires.   
The Mobilis Day Pas entitle you to unlimited travel on all operating public transportation services within the applicable zones during the validity period. Mobilis Day Passes are valid the print day till 5 am the next day. The last journey has to be completed when the period of validity expires.

Is anybody interested in making a trip to London for either taking or bringing stuff back to Basel.

Any takers?

			Here is my opinion based on my day to day use (not fuel consumption/off raod capability/speed ect - not my area )   
I have 3 kids and it comfortably fits 3 kids car seats across the back, a 2 piece pram and stacks of shopping. 
I find its very easy to park, only in some old car parks do I find the spaces tight. I have the front and rear sensors, with a visual too. 
It mainly costs me 50chf per week this is running kids to school/clubs and generally a trip to Germany. more at weekends if we go further obviously. 
The sat nav - imo is easy and simple as is the digital music system I have all the music from my itunes directly on it. 
I have not had any problems in the snow yet.  
When we got here the X5 was on option too but the amount of extras we could get on the Q5 made it far more attractive. 
We bought ours from Wettingen they were really helpful they squeezed every last extra they could get into in our budget.   
well thats all thats important to me (a mum of 3) im sure my husband would say something completely different  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Audi Q5 vs. BMW X5	mattyup	Posts: 26

			It's also possible to change some lights yourself when out driving. If there is no other traffic around and you're approaching red lights, a quick 2 second blast on high beam can trigger the IR sensor to change the light sequence for you, saving you having to slow down too much. Works a treat around my way when I'm driving to the airport for a 0500 start :-)

			To follow up on this, Zurich Connect appears to be working out for me.  The only time we have used it thus far is for one of the many times I have left the lights on and needed a jump.   
It is interesting to note that it was the first time that this happened was with Allianz Suisse.  It was during the filing of this claim that we discovered that they could not actually provide coverage despite what the salesman had said and all of the paperwork that I had been issued saying that I was covered.   
I just received a bill from Allianz Suisse asking for me to pay 160 CHF for the tow truck drivers time.

2. Look at the threads Ittigen has posted and it'll tell you exactly what you can expect.    
3. Speed cameras can result in putting you in prison and taking a chunk of your money.

			From memory you have to register the car in the UK within 6 months of arriving. You need to have a special MOT test, since the car I assume is a non EU spec. Lights / speedo and having a reversing light on the UK side are favourates to be needed to be changed.    
 You can insure it and MOT it on the chassis number or Swiss number plates, Direct Line Insurance was ok for this. I remember that we sent the plates back in the post. We have since returned back to Switzerland. We did everything once we arrived back in the UK. Contact the DVLA for more info.

			Hi Confloozed, 
Your car is probably fine.  You should be able to find your car's coolant capacity in your owner's manual.  The coolant capacity of the car should be several liters, while the reservoir holds probably a liter or less.  So, you haven't changed the overall ratio of water to antifreeze by very much (once you've run the car and gotten the fluid mixed thoroughly).  If you're worried, just watch the temperature gauge as you drive.   
Generally in hot weather it is better to have a mix of less antifreeze and more water, but unless your car usually runs near the edge of overheating it shouldn't make that much difference.  When winter comes around, if it gets very cold where you live you'll want to make sure the ratio of antifreeze to water is correct to avoid freezing.   
My first car had a slow coolant leak, and I just alternated refilling the reservoir with water and antifreeze to maintain about a 50:50 ratio.  It worked fine.  (though that car had plenty of other problems ...)

			It is also worth remembering that if you are clocking up lots of KMs then  costs will be considerable when parts go wrong - by buying a 2 year old car you can benefit from a good warranty from the main dealer (I got a 2 year one with mine).   
For that distance - think about cost per KM - and that the amount you are paying is for transportation AND not to purchase a depreciating asset.

			Sorry for the delay in closing up this story.   
After I got the thread going, I dropped by the body shop that I use (I am unfortunately too good a customer  ) to ask where he would suggest that I go. He mentioned someone around the corner but who was on two weeks vacation so the service center was closed. He was back today. Thankfully with the the 30°C + temps.   
Anyhow, he recharged the system with gas and a UV tracer agent, put in a new main seal and got everything up and running. Thank goodness it was not the compressor. The UV tracer helps if there is a leak, it can be spotted very quickly.    
So the ""damage"" was CHF 185. Not cheap but I think I can say that it was probably less than going to AMAG.

			look either at Thule or Yakima mounting systems   
either come as modular units and you buy whatever mounting bits you want,  
bike , skis, kayak, grandma.     
I think they would fit santa fe                   
n.b.... personally I preferred Yakima systems as they seemed to me more adaptable, but they are a US based company and I'm not sure you'll find them here.   Thule I am pretty sure are Swedish

They both came out of the same factory in Germany. I think this says an awful lot about 'education' aka brainwashing,   
So lets assume you buy the US model for half price, will your cost of ownership be more or less than the 'Swiss' buyer after 4 years? If the US one was worth 0chf it would still be a better deal!

Practically, the landlord probably has an idea that if the tenant leaves the country he can't enforce payment and if the tenant has no money he can't get blood from a stone. So, many times they landlord will negotiate an ""out"". But he is by no means obliged to do this.   
""Pleading for mercy"" yes is a bit of a jokey way of saying, you need to talk to the landlord. But like you say, try to rent it first and if say by the end of the year you can't find a new tenant and your circumstances haven't improved, then perhaps have the chat with your landlord.

			Some years ago my girl friend sold her car to a small garage, the owner said he would hand the plates in to the Strassenvekehrsamt. Well he didn't and 4 months later in November I queried why the insurance was sending a renewal, only to be told that the car was still insured. The owner had given the car to his wife to use! I quickly went round and took the plates off!    
My best advice is to drive the car to the dealer. Remove the plates. Take them to the Strassenvekehrsamt. Get the Grey/Beige car paper ""Ausweis"" stamped ""Ungültig"" and post it back to the garage.

			Don't tie up loadsamoney on something big, impractical and expensive .... and 2nd-hand.   
Get yourself to a main Renault dealer and have a look at their Romanian offspring   (but with Renault engines).   
I have no flag to fly with this company, but have previously recommended their 4x4 as a cheap alternative to more expensive ones.   
For me, a cheap and cheerful alternative to the over specced, over complicated and over priced other makes on the market is long overdue (but wont last forever) - especially for those who just require personal transportation - and not an image.   
You can have the advantage of a brand new, dealer supported car, chuck some extras at it and still not have too big of an outlay. Use a chunk of your 10K for deposit, and see what they offer in finance.   
Everyday, I'm seeing more and more of this make on the roads - which tells me, for some (many?) people it's price and not   that talks loudest.

			Sorry if this is ""old news"" but I thought I'd post a couple of tips I found when travelling to UK from Switzerland.   
1. Last month I arrived 4 hours early for my flight as it was no use going home after meeting in Zurich. I went to the desk to ask if I could transfer to an earlier flight and they quoted me silly money so I tried asking at another desk in T1 and he said the same but if I just present myself at the gate for an earlier flight they may let me on if seats available. NOTE: I was carry-one baggage only. I went to the gate and hey-presto got on the 3pm LHR flight instead of the 6pm LCY. Makes no difference to me as I need to get to Central London anyway. I didn't beg or plead or give them any BS, just asked nicely    
2. On my trip last week the flight was overbooked and they were asking for volunteers to catch a later flight at the gate. No problem I said and they gave me a 150CHF voucher in the form of an ATM card + PIN to just get cash as and when you wanted. Had to wait 2.5 hours for next flight but politely asked if I could use the Sky lounge so the girl rang up and got me in there too   Simply walked back through security and spent a very relaxing couple of hours on free gin and tonics.. 
I met another chap who tries the same thing every time. He registers at the gate as soon as he arrives to volunteer.

			Hey Ya'll,   
Anyone have any ideas why there were a bunch of US Army trucks from WWII running from Mullhouse, France to Basel today? I caught up with them near the Euro Airport Zoll and saw all of them had plates from AG, BS, BL, VD.. All of the trucks, ambulances, prison vans, jeeps etc.. were in mint condition (obviously restored) and I think they were driving back from somewhere..    
I had to succumb to my north american temptation and roll down my window to do my USA, USA, USA chant near the zoll (much to the embarressment of my wife and he quizzed looks from the drivers in the convoy).   
Any ideas about what all that was about?   
Thanks,

			I'm not sure you can liken the taxi business to healthcare. I believe it's more akin to the deregulation of the telecom market. Healthcare is a heavily regulated industry where doctors unfortunately have a interest in overselling patients. And since generally no-one dares to question a doctor's diagnosis/prescription, the steadily increasing prices are no surprise. The taxi industry, in contrast, is a low-margin industry that is highly competitive. Besides, there are already places in this country where prices are not regulated, such as Bern. I don't know the exact situation on the ground, but I'm unaware of prices having sky-rocketed in those areas. But maybe I'm missing something obvious here?

			I will be in Geneva, Switzerland the last 2 weeks of june and I need a truck to transport lots of equipment (3 - 4 truck loads) with a VERY large box in one of those loads.     
Does anyone know where I could rent a flat bed truck.  I would ask about a ""box"" truck but i do not recall ever seeing box style trucks on my prior visits to switzerland.   
Thanks for any help..

			It's official: our local garage told us there was NO WAY our old British left hand drive Peugeot 806 would pass the Swiss MOT!  Is there anyone in the process of selling their car? Would have to be a 6+ seater, in good condition  (""expertise"") and bear in mind: if our car was an old Peugeot 806, our budget is not for a Porsche Cayenne, even at discounted price! (max.budget 10.000CHF)   
Geneva Canton area if possible.

Whilst you're doing that, maybe you could also   in mind the vast difference in the number of vehicles and distances being travelling Germany compared with toytown Switzerland. Also bear in mind that only around 5% of roads in Germany are unlimited. Also bear in mind that many countries have a speed limit higher than 120 KPH and they don't all have extremely busy undertakers and Accident/Emergency units.   
Oh and maybe come off the ""Switzerland is far better at everything"" pedestal? It gets a bit nauseating at times. There are genuinely some things in this place that are utter shite - road policing and driving attitudes are sometimes up there on this list. Defending moronic systems isn't clever, try having an objective view and perhaps admit that even in Eden there was apparently a snake in the grass

			Even though it seems like you have sorted your situation out, I can add my experience recently- it may be helpful to others. 
I bought a car privately from St. Gallen (I live in Basel Land). I didn't previously own a car here.  
To get my number plates, I needed a (photo)copy of the grey ownership paper, which went to the insurance company together with the insurance quotation form. They then sent a cover letter to me. Whilst this was going on, my payment went to the owner, who then deregistered the car in St Gallen and sent me the cancelled grey ownership paper. Also at this time, I ordered number plates from the MFK in Basel Land.  
I took the ownership paper and the cover letter to the local MFK to get my new ownership paper and the BL number plates. Then I could go over to St. Gallen to pick up the car! Phew! It seemed a bit stressful at the time, working out what needed doing and who got paid (insurance was the last thing!). It took around 10 days from agreeing to buy to being able to pick the car up. Hope this helps...

			Ok, I have not seen a case where leasing was not cheaper than financing. Where exactly is the difference?   
- Leasing: You borrow money and put the car as a security. If you are unable to pay, the bank can collect the car within a short time and has so a very low risk.   
- Financing: You borrow money without giving much security. The bank will look at your income, wealth and so on and assesses the risk. Some people will not be able to pay their credit back and since banks never lose, this loss is calculated into the higher interest rates you have to pay.    
For the ones who will now write ""but leasing is only for new cars and you give back the car after some years..."" No. Not necessarily. Some years ago, I wanted to buy a young   car. I paid half of it up front and the other half in 24 installments. As a leasing contract. At the end it was paid off completely and I owned it (till today. Want to buy a 2004 A4 1,8T?). The difference in the interest rate to a consumer credit was back then easily 4 percent as I got a very cheap leasing offer.

4922	null	null	null	null	"    Do you really think such problems are so isolated? Do you take the train to/through Luzern every day?   
I take the train through Luzern every work day and quite often on weekends also. The train station is at capacity and the line between Luzern and Zürich is also at the limit, due to some of the single track areas, notably the track past the Rotsee. Delays of 4 minutes (aren't counted in the statistics) are common. At least once a month there is a delay more than 15 minutes and/or the train is cancelled altogether.   
Currently there are three tracks into Luzern and one of those is narrow  gauge. If either of the normal gauge tracks is blocked, train traffic  almost comes to a standstill, with an exception for the long distance  trains. The roads are not much better, especially with the current  construction.   
At least there are a lot of people who agree with you that the countryside must not be ruined. So they want to spend   to build a new train station. All that money and I will still have to go through Luzern twice a day. (Of course I will probably be retired before they're finished, so it's not that relevant.)   
I prefer the Luzern North solution, where they would build a new station or expand the existing one in Emmenbrücke. Not a lot of countryside would be ruined - it's already very industrial. And it would separate the tourists from the commuters. But more people prefer to dig and spend money, even better when it's federal money.

So we have bought a ticket for her for the 18'th (nonrefundable - 29 euro) as this was the preferred day to travel. Now we just hope to find a way to bring her bike back as well... The 24'th is therefore too late for us.

That section is also quite away southbound - and it would be easy to get annoyed if stuck behind slower traffic.   
The other thing about the German heading southbound is that he shouldn't have been confused by the Kantonalroad. - The Kanton road is on the right when heading south (IE the West side)

			I have to agree with vwild1. If it isn't a classic, not worth the bother.   
Additionally, if you change out anything that results in a part number changed, you may have issues with the STV as the get really anal about this kind of thing.   
If you do decide to go ahead, make sure you have a decent tool set already as you'll be paying top dollar for tools here, and the choice is limited in places like bau and hobby and migro do it center. If you need imperial or SAE tools, forget buying them in Ch. Any eBay other than .ch is your friend for tools.   
Parts are going to be another problem as there aren't any generic auto parts places here, and i think a total of 3 wrecking yards that will sell you parts. best to go to DE or UK for this, or eBay again.   
Generally speaking the Swiss are not big on hobby DIY beyond train sets, I also come from an upbringing where you didn't think twice about tearing down a V8 over the weekend and rebuilding it.   
Some kantons here hobby workshops that are fully stocked with tools that you can rent. There is one near where I live in unteraegeri, but I wouldn't know where else.

			Just to add a rough guess on the  t.   
Assume diesel truck.  
Assume CHF 2 per liter (should be a tiny bit less).  
Assume since a truck is not very aerodynamic you will consume around 14 l / 100 km.   
So to do 370 km you will need about 52 liters that will cost CHF 2 each, so about CHF 104 for fuel if it is one way.   
This assumes that it is mostly highway driving and not too much climbing as the consumption will go up dramatically.

I'd just find the car you want and either call the dealer or better still, go in, have a test drive and get some quotes that's what I did.

In mexico I ran out of battery, i had a grand cherokee and my mechanic came to the house with a spare battery and the cables. 
Hope someone helps you, sorry i cant, but thought the info might help.

			You can import your car without paying taxes if you are moving to switzerland. However, I you already live in Switzerland, you have then to pay the taxes. For both cases, you have to pass the technical inspection which is not that difficult for a new car. 
hope it helps

			For info:   
The only way to travel that line is to take the Inter Regio (regional train) once an hour or so and there are no supplementary trains. It is full packed overcrowded like on a normal day in the Tokyo subway. Once you are on, it should be all right but there is no time, everything is late and subject to annoucements that you have to listen to carefully. The ICE start then from Freiburg further to the north.

Regarding your options, I think now the woman is back on home turf, she's going to play hardball. 
The sad thing is you're out of pocket - fortunately, not by a vast sum - but to recover this could maybe turn out to be hassle, time and more expense. 
It may also be difficult for the police to do much, now, after the fact.   
Probably the moral of your unfortunate incident, is, under similar circumstances, if it is believed the other party may be at fault, get the police to attend the scene at the time, and then you (one) have a better platform to recover any losses and costs.

			One easy method is to buy a new car from a swiss garage which has already been imported from Germany. For example, auto discount center near zurich (adu.ch).    
I found them very good. Zero customer service, but rock bottom prices and zero admin. To save an extra CHF 400, ask to register the car yourself.   
Check out the prices.    
(MODERATOR : W-Maximus, you may well be correct, but please note that there are other threads on this method on this website)

			I'd be grateful if anyone can recommend a friendly English-speaking Nissan dealer in the (greater) Zurich area.    
I visited Nissan Zurich Progress earlier this week and their English was about as good as my German (i.e. fairly poor). They were quite helpful in getting a quick Abgas test done, but I'd still prefer to be able to communicate somewhat more easily (and they struck me as being somewhat old-school and not terribly approachable).   
(btw the reason for wanting to go to the dealer is that my car still has warranty so I'd better stick to official servicing etc for now).

			Have you considered just to get a decent car for around or so 10`000.- til you have saved enought for your Ferari?   
I make an example, a Porsche Cayenne  is new around 120000k that means you pay off every month 2500.- +5% leasing rates during 4Year.  
You can buy a 4 year old Porsche Cayenne for around 45`000.- so that means the depreciation during the leasing period is 75`000.-   
Isn`t it far much better to put the the leasing pay offs on your Bank account for 4 years and drive a cheap car in this period. So that means at the end you have 75k on your bank account plus rates on it plus your Porsche and saved a lot money for mandatory insurance.      
So where are the higer costs? owning a Car and over 75`000 bucks or Having a car only and already payed a lot for Insurances?      Looks like you are doing your job well. But in practical live you have to catch up a lot. 
There are a lot cars out there which have a depreciation of 50% in the first 3 years, so why don`t you save up for one ?

If you don't have to pay the fine, that would be really lucky (I paid).   
As far as I understand, it doesn't become a 'criminal record' unless you fail to pay or do it more than three times...   
What made my situation worse is that there was this lady on the same bus who didn't have a ticket at all (at least I'd gone to the trouble of trying to have the correct ticket!)...and the ticket guys kept looking at her as she argued with them over the ticket, and at me, who they had just fined 80chf! - eventually they pulled her off the bus because the longer she argued, the closer she was getting to her destination... and everyone else on the bus was starting too (and wondering why they didn't just hurry up and issue her the fine notice)...

Step 1: Find out which US brands you are interested in are available in CH. Price doesn't matter at this stage. Call the importer up, tell him you just moved over here with your US car and you would need Swiss papers for your existing rims. If the Swiss model is the same as the US one, he will send you a copy of the papers for a two digit amount of CHF.   
Step 2: Buy the rims in the US, send them here, pay the import duties... get them on the car.   
Step 3: Bring your car with US rims and CH letter of approval to your nearest Strassenverkehrsamt and get the wheels written into your cars papers.   
Easy... well, no. But probably worth it.   
P.S: Same holds true for EU parts as well if you happen to be not into the US gangster chrome stuff... they didn't invent alloy wheels in order to slap heavy chrome on them. From an engineering perspective the opposite of sensible.

The only place that now demands a different licence is the stretch called ""old Rhine"" from Bodensee to Stein am Rhein, I believe.   
If i could do a test in another country & then swop the licence for the Swiss one I am sure it would be easier......

			Hi, help! First time using this, and I wondered if any one had any ideas on a problem I can't find the answer to. We have a UK registered car, and live permenantly in the UK, but have a house in France. We fly to Genenva, and have the car parked at a friend's house near the airport. The car stays for most of the time in Switzerland, but we drive in France, say 1 week a month, where our address is. Would we have to register the car in Switzerland or France after 12 months? It will return to the UK within 12 months, for MOT etc.   
Has anyone any ideas about this?  
Thanks Aenaj

			One thing I found out while searching through this forum: the import exempt is valid only if the 6 months ownership were BEFORE registering in Switzerland.    
So doing it now does not help      
Best to ask the customs office directly for a solution.

			If you only need it for a short time (say two to three hours), normally the most economical option is Click and Drive from SBB - they have cars all over the cities you can use once you've registered at a railway station.       
Otherwise, there's all the big companies like Hertz, Avis and Sixt in Basel.

			Yes, you can ride any motorbike in CH if you have a full UK licence.   
Make sure you swap the UK licence for a Swiss one within one year of arrival in CH. Dead easy -- no test. Just a little money, of course.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Driving LIcense in CH	Ivan1987	Posts: 12

			I see it all the time and in the UK it was pretty much drummed into people not to drive while on the phone, so it annoys me. Then again so does loud telephone chatter on the trains. Unfortunately for the younger generation it is part of everyday life and they don't understand us 'oldies' get annoyed by it.

			Thanks for the answers guys! I've a funny feeling that RX-8 on autoscout was so cheap due to the horrible colour   
I'll look into it a bit more, as even if I have to pay a couple of grand for shipping and paperwork, I still think that savings could be substantial (ok maybe not on the RX-8). It doesn't take much to make a Japanese car road legal in the UK, so unless there is a bureaucratic barrier (as bigblue says about France not accepting Japanese VINs) I can't see it being that expensive.   
The reason I was interested in the RX-8 was that I used to have a RX-7 when I was living in Japan, but I have never seen one in Switzerland. Come to think of it, an RX-7 can be had for about 3000 quid over there, and I'd happily pay 6000 to have one on the road here   "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Mar 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Anyone had experience importing from Japan?

			I have imported a couple of bikes - Bimota db2 and laverda jota, the latter was imported in two stages as I was waiting for the engine to be found. The import tax is calculated by wieght and value, I stated the value of mine and they accepted my value and I also bought magazines to give the dry weight. I guess if you value it too low though you may have problems with insurance value etc.    
To import them  I stopped at the border and declared them, they gave me some paperwork and I had to take it to the local customs office to sort out the money and get the all important stamm no which you need to register. unfortunately my bikes are in bits and I still searching for headlights etc to convert them to the swiss side of the road.    
Getting them on the road is much easier IF the model has been officially imported at some time in the past. While the emmisions maybe a problem the other side is that the swiss Love their classic cars and bikes so if they are in good condition then it should be ok

			hello there,   
yes, used cars with leasing option is quite common in Switzerland since the used car conditions (motor, paint, interior etc) are one of the best in Europe. They managed to keep it new even after many years..   
I think it starts around 50 kCHF here in CH for a 3 years old one, and for that you may pay around 600- 700 CHF per month

			What is the use of a bank that does not transfer money out of the US?    
When you live here you will need an account here. Reccommended is the Swiss government Post Finance.    
Open another account in the USA. Transfer money to your CHF Post Finance account here. Pay the garage with a transfer.    
Alternatively pay money into the Garage bank account with cash.

			He arrives from South America at 19:00 (which means out of the airport at 20:00 earliest IF the plane is on time). Assuming the family is there ready to go you might get on the road at 20:30-21:00.   
There is NO WAY someone getting off a plane (with jet lag) should be driving at night for 4+ hours. That means the ""chauffeur"" will need to do the up and back (with preferably a stay-over at an inexpensive hotel AT THE AIRPORT since you have an early flight.

			To prevent another indigent outburst when a fresh bunch of EFers come online tomorrow, I think I'll take the precaution of closing this.   
I think we have safely established that it is not allowed. Fortunately a couple of EFers have also pointed out that this is, for some people, a new area and they asked because they didn't know. Some of the rules about children's seating etc. are comparatively new. Much better to ask on here than to try it out and run risks of either injury in an accident or a brush with the law.

			I recently heard about an excellent website that has awesome information on mountain passes all over Europe, plus many other mountain roads that are not passes:  . It is specifically geared towards cyclists, but others might also find the information useful. It has profiles of each climb that include the average gradient in each km, or each section of the climb, in a color-coded graph (see attachment). Plus the base height, summit height, length, average gradient, and a difficulty score. The difficulty score is based on a complex calculation that sums the difficulty of each section of the climb to get a total score, and it seems to give pretty indicative scores.   
The attachment is the profile of  , which goes from Graubunden (Santa Maria) to Italy (Bormio). It is the climb that I've done that has the highest difficulty rating (132.4), and is the highest pass in Switzerland (2501m). My wife and I did this at the end of a long tour across the Swiss Alps last summer, on fully-loaded touring bikes.   "	null	null	null	Swiss Mountain Passes - Indexes & Opening Dates	guest	null

I had a big chip and they actually had to replace the whole windshield.  Just scheduled an appointment and they took care of everything. It was even covered by insurance.

5063	null	null	null	null	"    Actually, I've heard that some insurance companies prefer to think that you did not sell the car, but rather suspended your plates (i.e., you can return them back to 9 months to police), therefore they can still bill you for casco insurance claiming that they assume car is somewhere placed on parking (without plates!), and in case of any damage they will cover it. Therefore, they continue to send insurance bills    
I was told about this problem from my insurance agent about Generali insurance. He recommends to notify insurance with a letter that you have sold your car, and state that this is not a temporary suspention of plates    
Hope it will be helpful to someone.

			I'd just hand in the plates and de-register it.  Then, the buyer gets the cancelled registration, and can get plates, put them on, and drive away.   
If you don't have the time to do it yourself, your local garagiste can do it (or anyone, actually).

			Possibly this type of camera   
"" Truvelo Speed Cameras The forward facing Truvelo camera system is designed to take photographs of the front of a passing vehicle. This allows the picture taken to show the driver of the vehicle as well. In countries such as Switzerland, Germany and the Scandinavian countries driver recognition is a required factor to enable a successful prosecution of a speed or red light offence.    A single front photograph, taken just after the vehicle has crossed the piezo sensors used for speed measurement, includes all the secondary check information required.  
To avoid the 'flash' which is given out by a rear facing Gatso camera the Truvelo system uses an infra red flash which produces no visible 'flash' to the approaching driver.""

			Quite a lot of misleading / incorrect info on this thread, so here's a more definitive source:       
On taxes:      Basically, in addition to the VAT, you'll need to pay duty on the car.  This varies depending on where & when the car was manufactured, with either a flat rate of tax (4%) or one based on the weight of the car (12-15 CHF per 100kg).   
The guide explains all of the technical requirements for getting your car registered in Switzerland, too.   
Hope this helps.

			the test is not hard at all, most of it is parking the boat (atleast what i experienced in vaud on lake geneva)  If you know how to drive a boat you will be fine.  What I did, and I recomend, is just take 1 lesson to get used to the boat (assuming you will use that boat for a test) and the instructor will basically take you through a mock test so you know what to expect.  again since most of it is parking, its good to be comfortable with the boat, and parking very carefully in the tight marinas.

			Your GA is valid up to Chiasso, and SBB gives you a discount to buy a slow train ticket for CHF12 rtn to Milano Centrale, or higher for the EuroCity train.   
In Milano Centrale, it costs EUR4 one way to Chiasso ( no, your GA is no good in Italy ).

			I actually love the focus st, the engine is especially potent and with a remap can be easily bumped to 270hp, plus it pulls from low revs like crazy. But the downside is that the engine is 2.5l, compared to 2.0l on the golf, which might result in higher insurance and tax, plus higher fuel consumption.

			Thanks for your help digg and dodgyken. I visited the Strassenverksamt today and they confirmed that it is possible for me to import a car from EU (read Germany), run it on Swiss customs plates up to two years and then re-export it without paying any duties.

VP is Verkaufs Preis (selling price) and the rest is the rates for differnt leasing periods.   
Bear in mind that any leasing contract will have to go througth your bank so I wouldnt be to sure its not easier to buy One for a couple of thousand (depends on what you want and your expectations but a couple of k should get you something useable)

			I go there often by train and I usually do as suggested above:   
SBB ticket to Milan 
Trenitalia ticket MI-VE (to be stamped before jumping on the train)   
If you have to go further to another destination in Italy that is not a main city, the trenitalia one is the only reasonable option (sbb charges more on some secondary routes).   
You may want to consider the SBB for the whole journey if you are not yet sure about which train to take, so that you can get easily reimboursed.   
And remember that the train tickets in Italy are for a specific train only, not for the route like in Switzerland, so you have to choose at what time you want to travel before buying the ticket.   
Enjoy!

			One more thing. I found out that one can pay 30CHF to be able to park in the Blue Zones for a month. But is that limited to the district where you live or is it any blue zone in the town. I wonder, how many of the blue zones are there actually? Would having such permit usually ensure that I could find a spot in a walking distance from where I live (not sure where that's going to be yet, I'm looking for something relatively cheap).   
Thanks a lot folks!

			The tax savings should more than makes up for transportation costs - either by train or by car.   The issue is really more one of time - how much commuting time can you afford?   
What kind of commuting do you anticipate doing - daily rush hour into Zürich, off-peak into Zürich, daily running around the area doing errands? There are lots of ways to save, but how you travel makes a difference.   
We life in the Höfe area - although we are only a short walk to the train, given the type of traveling we need to do we could not get by on public transportation alone.   
My husband drives into Zürich as he likes to be at the office by about 5AM, which is before the first train. Even if he were to wait for the first train, getting in at 6AM, the trip would be an hour and 15 minutes - whereas it is only a 30 minute drive at that time of the morning. Although, I see that from Pfaffikon you have an earlier train than we do...   
For running around the area the trains are convenient to Rapperswil and Einsiedeln, but for the day to day errands I find driving makes more sense for me.   
I'm terrified of driving in Zürich   , so I take the train whenever I have to go to the city - which I do only occasionally. I find that a half price card, coupled with an all-zone 9 Uhr multi-ride day pass is the cheapest option for the kind of travel I do. Obviously that's only the case if you are going in after 9AM.

			If you're returning to your home country permanently, I think you will need to revert back to the DL of this country.   
I would guess this is something you should only do once there. Your driving privileges should remain the same, and you should still be on the driver database of your home country.   
You should enquire to the Driver Licence Authority of your home country to check out the specifics. I'm sure this is easily done on-line.   
I see from your profile that you are from the Czech Rep. They may be EF members that can specifically advise.

5144	09.01.2011, 11:13	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Around Baden	"    Re. lights - this is a valid point. I am in constant amazement how any  one riding a bike doesn't have lights when it's dark. This is a  combination of ignorance, machismo-ism, and pure dick-headedness (plus lack of policing). The  cheapest set (from Landi or Jumbo) is only about CHF10 (with batteries, I  think). When I see kids riding without lights, I am even more shocked -  (as in a lot of other situations) where is the parental guidance -- checking and ensuring their children are safe when they go out? 
This point about lights and possibly the second part of your quoted  sentence above is due, I believe in the perceived status of the bicycle,  here. Immaterial of the correct legal position, many, riders and  pedestrians alike, see the bike as having the same rights as  pedestrians, as opposed to being a road vehicle. It is accepted that  they can ride on pavements, in between pedestrians. Even when they ride  on the road, when they need to turn left, they often stop on the right  and then ride across the (jaundiced) zebra crossing. My view point is  from ""sticksville"", and not from the centre of a busy city, where the  problems are probably more abundant and extreme. 
But without digressing too much and discussing and comparing the  differences between motor- and pedal- bikes (which is a whole subject on  it's own), I think that in this day and age, for any cyclist riding in a  busy, congested urban area, a loud horn is now a pre-requisite. Even if  it's use just prevents a car forcing you off course and clipping a  curb, is enough. Bearing in mind that there is now a big push to get  more people to make their journeys under (battery-assisted) pedal power.

This is a good shop if you are located in Zurich. I went there summer of 2009 when my battery died on my Audi S8 (so it was a big one). (My cousin left the rear tv's on and they drained the battery). They charged me CHF 200 for a Banner battery. I picked it up and walked with it back to the office and then trammed it home and therefore didn't need to get it shipped. I assume you are able to carry a battery but be warned as Swiss people will obviously have never thought of this possible and will stare you down like you are a lunatic.

You may be able to hire a car but if you are stopped by the police and they see that you have been in the country longer than a year then it's a problem. Not sure what that means exactly. This country is big brother when it comes to knowing how long you have been living here.

			Hi Jessica,    
 Please don't waste any money on buying a torque wrench which goes down to 10Nm!! I can tell you that this is a very small torque to apply and it does not warrant spending all that money on a tool. (Unless of course he decides to repair old swiss clocks or other such delicate machinery which requires a little more accuracy!)   
 I can guess that your husband is using it for the bolts which are on the engine casings or plastic fairings of the bike? These only need to be hand-tightened and can be done in the following method: (Make sure he follows the tightening sequence - if there is one! - outlined in the manual)   
 For torques of 10 to 30Nm, tighten the screw/bolt/nut by hand and then use the appropiate tool to GENTLY turn the screw/bolt/nut until it stops. In other words, turning the screw until it stops with hardly any presssure. Then turn the screw/bolt/nut a further 30 to 60 degrees. This should be plenty if he is only tightening covers or fairing panels using small M6/M8 screws/nuts/bolts.   
For important things like brakes, wheels, internal engine components etc, then ALWAYS use a torque wrench.   
 Hope this helps.   
Neil

			I had this problem last sunday travelling from Chur. When we arrived in Landquart there was luggage piled up in front of both doors and someone was sitting on the stairs ""in first class"" . I was told by this individual that it was not their luggage but the belonged to 2nd class passengers sitting in the upper deck. I moved a piece to scramble over and open the door then I calmly moved some more out of the carriage and on to the platform to allow the other passengers to get on and I went on my way. Wonder what happened after..

Thank you for your information.  I will start contacting directly.     
We are locating in August too.  My kids will be going to ZIS as well (or atleast hope to).  My older son was accepted into the Upper School, while my younger son is on the waiting list for the Middle School.   
We determined it was better for my husband to commute rather than the kids as well.   
Maybe when we both arrive, we can meet.

			If you got a train from Zurich to south of the Alps you would miss a lot so certainly the first leg by Bike to Goeschenen would be my recommendation pretty much follow your nose due south, takes in some very nice lakeside scenery and several picturesque towns and villages en route. Then the option of a short trip through the tunnel to Airolo by train or maybe slightly longer to Bellinzona.

I was relating to my situation: 
- for reasons that are not longer relevant, my imported BMW was initially registered in my wife's name; 
- later when I wanted it (legal ownership) to revert (back) to me, she received a road tax refund and I, a road tax bill (for same amount plus admim. fee, I think) -  
- as the plate wasn't changing, no visit to OCN was required, hence everything being dealt with through the post, in this case.

			So, just as follow up. The MFK was passed (TCS in Brunegg did a pre-test, but found nothing wrong at all (save for a broken lamp), so he decided to call it the official MFK and stamped the fahzeugausweiss accordingly. I did not even need to have it professionally cleaned - I just did a full-service car-wash beforehand and he was happy enough with that.)   
In hindsight, I guess I was expecting a worse story from the MFK; horror stories seem to be abound on this topic from all quarters, but I had a very good experience.   
Car was then in the garage for two days, which cost 2100CHF (timing belt, 125K service, rear brake disks and pads, plus items that required replacement due to the engine warning light coming on)   
All in all, Audi said that the car is really in good condition and should be fine for at least another 120K/150K, the money spent on the service was money well spent, and I may as well keep it for another few years. Which I will do.   
Cheers, 
Chris

			The one-year bike pass is 195 CHF. As for SBB-ZVV bike ticket validity, the SBB says this: ""Public transport operators covered by Zürcher Verkehrsverbund also accept bike tickets (with the exception of some local busses).""   
However, there are time restrictions for bikes on ZVV trains: ""At the weekend, there are no restrictions on accompanied bikes on S-Bahn trains in Zurich. From Mondays to Fridays, however, accompanied bikes are allowed only from 08.00 to 16.00 and from 19.00 to 06.00.""   
If you want to take your bike for free, then take the front wheel off and put it in a  , which costs about 90 CHF from  . This option doesn't only allow you to avoid the bike fees, but it also allows you to take a bike on any train or other form of public transport at any time of day, because it then counts as normal hand luggage.

			If you are not stopped and searched, you can bring as much as you want.   
When stopped and serched... the allowance is    
red or white wine : up to 15% Vol. = 2 litre/person 
other alcohol : above to 15% Vol. = 1 litre/person   
Outside of the limit(less than 20 litre) you pay 0.60 CHF/litre 
Outside of the limit(more than 20 litre) you pay 3.00 CHF/litre   
beef : 500g/person 
Outside of the allowance you pay 20 CHF/Kg   
sausage+chicken+ham... : 3.5Kg/person 
Outside of the allowance you pay 13 CHF/Kg   
----------------------------------------------------------   
This is only some part of the chart about the allowance that I was given by a custom officer when I was driving back from grocery shopping in France. 
It was the first time I have been stopped after about 20 times going through.    
My German is very short so you will be better off checking on their web site by yourself.       
Good luck!

			This thread may be of interest to you:  . It sounds like you want to buy the Swiss Pass or Swiss Flexipass, which are available in Switzerland as well as from agents in other countries. In contrast, the Swiss Transfer Ticket and Swiss Card are only available from agents outside of Switzerland, they are not available from within the country, but it does not sound like this is what you want.   
The prices in Switzerland and from abroad are set to be pretty similar, but if the exchange rate has changed since the prices were set then you may save a small amount of money. Depending on where you enter the country and when, there may or may not be an agent available at the station to sell you the ticket, or there may be a line of people waiting. Therefore, obtaining the ticket before you get here might be easier.   
The part of the thread that I linked to above that is important for you is probably this (note that the prices are from 2010, I haven't updated it with 2011 prices yet).      and    
Both these tickets allow for a certain number of days of unlimited travel, and also give free entrance to over 400 museums and exhibits, anf 50% discount on many mountain-top cablecars. They are only available to people with a permanent address outside of Switzerland, but in addition to being available from agents outside of the country, they can also be bought within Switzerland at most major train stations. Before the passes can be used, they need to be validated at an SBB ticket counter. If two or more adults will be travelling together, the second and further tickets can be purchased at a 15% discount (an option called the 'Swiss Saver Pass').   
The Swiss Pass is valid for 4, 8, 15, 22 days, or 1 month of unlimited travel on   days. It costs 260, 376, 455, 525, or 578 CHF, respectively. These prices are reduced by 25% for people between 16 and 26 (a deal called the 'Swiss Youth Pass').   
The Swiss FlexiPass is valid for 3, 4, 5, or 6 days of unlimited travel within one month,  , with all other days between the first and last unlimited-travel days at half fare. It costs 249, 302, 349, or 397, respectively. There is no youth discount.

			Even in Lausanne, where we have some of the most relaxed policies about bikes on local public transport, you cannot take one on during the rush hours.   
Some folding bikes only take 30 seconds to brake down and build up at each end, but good, reliable ones are a fair amount of cash. Ones from major brands do tend to hold a decent amount of their value, though, and you might find a used one if you search for it. Folding bikes can be taken on all forms of public transport at any time of day (just like any other piece of luggage). In the UK, there was recently one train company that tried to limit their use, but I believe that plan was quickly squashed by people who had more sense.   
In case anyone is interested, in Lausanne (in addition to your own ticket), the bike just needs a half-fare ticket that is valid for the zones you are going through. An SBB bike ticket is not valid even on the local metro trains - you need a local ticket. You can take bikes on any bus or metro train, but there is the provision that you can only do so ""when space permits"" - which generally means not during the rush hours or other busy times. There is often a bike symbol on one of the doors showing where there should be extra space for the bike. You need to stand with the bike the whole time - you are not allowed to leave it unsupported.   
In most other parts of Switzerland, bikes are not permitted on local public transport. Lausanne is different partly due to the hilly nature of the terrain, which makes cycling less popular, but this drawback can be partly avoided if people can take the bus to get up the hills.

			why not ask the French place that issued your licence for proof of passing/licence which you might be able to use to convert into a Swiss licence?   
That way you're not playing the system.   
Strictly speaking, you should not be driving now as there is no way at this time to prove you have a licence.

Swiss motor insurance is ridiculously expensive and there is no need for it to be so. As long as people like you say it used to be much more expensive and imply that we should therefore be grateful things will never change.   
It doesn't matter whether I have 3 or 300 motorcycles. Paying a full premium for each one is crazy.

Looking to leave Basel at about 3pm (a little flexible).      
Driving to South London, and should be able to drop off anywhere within reasonable distance - PM me.      
I will have an empty car, so there is space if needed.   
Share costs.     
PM if interested.     
Cheers.

			Hello Everyone     
We're thinking we may try to buy a car from Germany and import it.   
Does anyone know of any consumer groups who flag cheating dealerships with a bad reputation?   
Also, we were searching on Mobil.de and we see many cars that have the vehicle # listed eg GE 110111.  Can we do some kind of check with this number?  Is there any way to verify the cars history?  In the U.S we have CARFAX for example.     
thanks for the help

			Sorry for bumping the thread but I have some questions about the Brazilian Driver's License.   
I'm brazilian and i'll stay for 3 days in Zurich next July. I'll rent a car in Germany and drive around there until Switzerland.    
As far as I know, the brazilian driver's license (CNH) is accepted is some countries but is desirable that you have an Internation Driver's License, which is accepted all around the world due to international laws and agreements signed by the major countries.   
I'm willing to get this international license to drive in Switzerland. Does anybody know if it is accepted around there?    
Thanks.

But that would not excuse the fact the contact number for CH was for Swiss from Zurich only - as the woman who replied kept insisting- despite the fact I explained clearly, in 3 languages... that the problem was with bmibaby from Geneva.

			Its gone up to 30 Chf this year, but when I squawked in surprise at the price rise, they informed me that the previously 60 chf grandparent card had been reduced to 30 chf, so that was their justification for the price rise.  But particularly if you are jumping on and off trams/buses it is really good value.

			Here's an RHD Punto being sold by some garage. Not sure if this is cheap? I guess they'd have a lower resale value:    
Anyway, depends on the person and the value of the car to that person I guess. If you like your cars and don't mind the servicing then you'd probably stick with what you know and import.   
The story of having an RHD car in a LHD world never really washed with me. I've got an LHD car now and had it in the UK for sometime and vice-versa, RHD here when I first arrived. Also seen many British registered LHD cars in London and then there's islands in the Caribbean like US Virgin Islands that has US LHD cars driving on the left. You get used to it. Overtaking isn't a big deal in a car. You can see through windows/around both sides of the car in front. Just stay out of multi story car parks but even then, it's only taking your seat belt off--or even better, reverse into/out of them.

			I've got the C1 and C1E category on my Swiss license with minimal fuss.  I got them automatically at the time of taking my test in the UK, and simply applied to have all the same categories for my Swiss license, in addition to getting my eyes tested I had to take an extra physical with a doctor.   
The license authority only checked that I hadn't submitted the categories by mistake, I just told them I wanted all the same categories as my UK license.   
Perhaps it's not the same situation, as you mentioned taking the C test recently, I had to do no such thing, also I guess there's a difference between C and C1.

For example Basel Bad Bhf ( which is very close to Basel SBB ), or Thayngen / Konstanz / Waldshut etc.   
This would qualify for one of the many   ( Europa, Schweiz, Dansk etc. ).

			We also have a tandem and only have one vignette on it. I can't confirm that this is officially correct, but it would seem to make the most sense. After all, you can only get into one accident at a time, and only one person can be liable (probably the tandem's captain). In addition, since if you own multiple bikes then you need one vignette for each bike, not each person, that also suggests that the tandem would only need one - because again it is per bike not per person.

			A number of years ago my CH boss lent her car to her nanny. The nanny proceeded to cross a solid white line at a traffic light. A 750chf fine and a 'suspension of licence' notice arrived for my boss (the owner of the car). The photos confirmed that my boss was not the driver. Therefore although the nanny was now back home in South America the fine still had to be paid by my boss. She however did not loose here licence.

			This morning, I had to get to an appointment pretty early in the morning (for me, anyway).  I was bumbling through the buses of Zurich, trying to figure out which route would work best this morning.  I decided after a few moments that I would switch in Milchbuck.   
I used to often switch in Milchbuck, but due to the construction that was there, and using a different line, I just don't go through there anymore.  But today I decided to use the stop.  As I got off the 69 bus, a couple of men greeted the bus with hot chocolate and gipfili.  They greeted all 4 tram lines and the 2 bus lines that serve that stop with a small army of workers from the ZVV as a way of saying thank you for dealing with the construction at Milchbuck.  The hot chocolate was nice, and the gipfili was free, so I can't complain.     
They didn't have to do this little gesture.  After all, the new Milchbuck stop looks pretty decent.  However, as a thanks for the patience of their passengers, they went that extra little step.  They made a lot of people's mornings just that bit nicer, especially in the cold, dark early morning.   
Just another reason why I love the ZVV.

			I often travelled on the train with the dog as she got a free pass ('service dog') from the guide dog school. Naturally only people who liked dogs sat with us and they often let her sleep with her head on their foot or stroked her head.   
When they asked me about the dog, I thought, ""Great! Let me enjoy slaughtering their language with my lisping stutterings."" And tried my best to scrape the bottom of my German vocabulary bin. Methinks it's because of such friendly folk on the trains that our dog decided to become a therapy dog instead of a guide dog.   
Once I took the train with my two elder sisters to Milan, Florence and Rome. An Italian man started talking to me in Italian (I knew only five Italian words at the most) but the only thing we had in common was football, the Italian national team in particular. So we were naming all our favourite players - very slowly, as we had many kilometers ahead of us. After the Italian man and his wife left our compartment (love those seaters for 6 or 8!), my eldest sis said, ""Wah, your Italian is not bad, huh?""

 When travelling by ZVV, you pay for a combination of area and time; on the Swiss national transport network, you pay for a particular route.""   
Schaffhausen is outside ZVV area, a ticket  to Schaffhausen won't cover any zones only a route on the SBB network eg HB-Schaffhausen or Stadelhofen-Schaffhausen, one way or two way.

			I think you guys are going about this all wrong.   
Sure loud conversations are annoying, but there is some real beauty about them as well.... like ""Stupid things people say"".   
In the capital cities in Australia there is a daily rag (newspaper) that is printed for the afternoon commuters (like the ""Blick am abend""), and this paper is equally as SHITE !!! - however there is a little piece of gold in there, a little column called ""Overheard"".   
Overheard is where people send into the paper all the stupid things they hear other people say on the train, and it is DEFINITELY worth reading.   
I can't find a link to the section to add but I can add some golden moments from memory:   
""They make 5, 10, 20, and 50 cent coins.... why don't they just make a 100c coin?""     
(conversation) 
""I'm sick of blokes starring at my tits"" 
""why don't you cover them up?"" 
""because then nobody will see them""   
""That Chinese language is absolute rubbish.... I mean, you can't even read it !!""       
....... I'm sure we've all heard something similar. Perhaps we should just start our own thread on the EF instead.

			As is mentioned, 750kg is the max for unbraked.   
The brakes are generally for when parked, they are not connected to the car brakes and only the cars brakes slow the trailer down when driving.    
However, you also connect a line from the trailer brakes to the car. If the trailer becomes unhitched it will activate the trailer brakes so it stops. Make sure you connect this as it's an important safety feature and you will be booked if caught without it.   
Re speed. Yes 80 kmph is the max. I once went past a camera at 97 with a trailer and it went off even though the limit was 100. I got fined.   
Re purchase. I had a car with a similar towing weight and bought a relatively large but light trailer so I had good volume and weight margins. You don't want to find your trailer inadaquate so my recomendation is to do the same.    
Incidentally, that trailer is now for sale as I got a bigger car and a much bigger trailer to acomodate my needs. It's uncovered so I don't think it suits your needs.   
I found ricardo best for finding a trailer. Both times I found one that was a little different and consequently cheaper.

			Strange coincidence - I also thought about this today, and was up the Post Office this morning, and was able to remove the last two, without scratching off some of the anti-glare strip on the windscreen (that I'd foolishly stuck them on, in a hurry)    
Just, another thought -- what do other 'bikers do about displaying their vignette. I always keep mine in my wallet with the Fahrzeugausweiss, but technically, this isn't valid.   
Before I moved here, when I came here with the 'bike, from London, I did get one prior to the visit, and stuck it on the outside of one of the hand guards. For 2 wks. in the summer that was fine, but for a whole year, I cant help thinking that through a combination of weather and possible curious fingers, it probably wouldn't last a year. [I can't ever recall seeing another bike with a vignette stuck on it.]

I think I sold one of my cars as well and forgot about the dumb key... I would ask the dealer where the other keys are. Even if they are broken, he should give you the broken ones.   
It is potentially a risk and you would need to trust the dealer - he has your address, so if you believe he might be on the not so trustworthy side - if he has the second key, he could easily visit your place and drive off with your car... but if you do trust him, you can easily get a new one at any dealer that sells your brand new.

			Regarding the original thread title;   
I relocate to ZH next week and plan to rent a vehicle for the first few months before looking to buy a new (or newish) RR sport, or 4x4 equiv. Figure if your going to ""Do""  Europe you may as well see it in comfort - all 12 months of the year!   
Ideally cash purchase but I understand that there may be tax benefits for lease or loan against said new car.   
Any tips /  advice most welcome.

			Dear all!   
How come an SBB Monthly Point-to-Point Pass for Adults from 
Baden to Basel Cost 306 CHF   
and a GA (for all switzerland ) cost 305 CHF / month   
Am I missing anything ?!?   
Actually I am trying to find how much would would cost these two Abo / month??   
Rheinfelden -> Reinach  (I found that with TNW, U-BO for 70 CHF, please correct me if i'm wrong...)   
Baden -> Basel (305 CHF !!!) is this correct?   
Thanks!

			Usually the back of the exhaust fails, and then 6 months later the rest fails. It might be worth changing the whole lot in one go!    
Phone up, make appointment, take the day off, take your passport and Swiss ID and some Euros, and visit these people,         
Go for a nice lunch in Lörrach while Golf is being repaired.    
Pay garage in Euros. Get Mehrwertsteuer form from the Garage, go food shopping, get form stamped at German border (Show Swiss Permit), go back to garage and get your 17% tax back.    
Go back to border, pay 7.6% Swiss MWSt.

			By the way, found   on ebay if you're still scratching your head.. It just occurred to me that perhaps you could stick the vignette to the plasic number plate holder under the plate, then when the Busies come and control you you've got it to hand.. I'd stick it to the plate itself, because I've been riding on dual insurance, I want a touring bike for when the Mrs comes out with me, and I want to keep the ""hang on for dear life aaarrrgggghhhh  "" bike for when I'm out on my own, then I only need 1 vingnette for two bikes because I swap the plate accross, but then it also occured to me that you shouldn't stick the Vignette to a removable part, like the plate, or the seat itself, because that's not classed as part of the vehicle, and if Mr Fuzz wants to be a real pain, he can charge you 100CHF plus the cost of another vignette..   
I'm not intending to spend too much time on the autoroutes this year though, they're no fun..

			I have travelled extensively around Switzerland by train and can thoroughly recommend it.  There are also the Post Buses for many of the more remote areas.   
As others have mentioned, there are times when a car is a more practical alternative.   
With such an extensive public transport network, the times when a car is essential could be very low for most people.

			Hi tony, you can actually come off at the airport junction one before, drive into the airport and straight across the front of the terminal on the 'car park' road and into Switzerland that way. There are no checks and this also brings you just to the other side of the motorway border, and in fact is probably quicker than the earlier alternative I posted. 
Make sure you buy the vignette at the first services you get to, just the other side of Basel. 
The parking at Lauterbrunnen is always full so book well in advance.

			It's not usually a problem understanding it when presenting your ticket to be checked.    
The fun started when you were new here, you get into a crowded bus, it's raining, a queue of people still out in the rain are pushing from behind, the bus is late and the time to the 'connecting' train is very short, you're attempting to stop your umbrella dripping into your bag and at the same time you are already trying for the third time to pronounce your destination so that the driver selling tickets understands it, you are delving into your purse for an as yet unknown amount of change to pay for it and the chap throws you completely off balance with this incomprehensible and unexpected phrase ' ?' which, to your overworked brain, could mean anything under the sun.

			Aha, ok, this gets clearer now.    
I suspect, then, that different radio stations are emitted in different Cantons;  I  have noticed that Coleur3 (great station) can be heard south of Bern and Lausanne, but not here in Basel.   
So I guess then FM Radio stations can choose the region where it's emitted.  And supposedly they pay more if they want to be heard inside tunnels?

			We brought our Discovery as part of our move here - as part of our belongings. It had to be done officially at our local customs office - and if I remember right it costs nothing. But there was some paperwork involved. We then had to register the car here- and had to have all the official MOT type testing/pollution testing, etc, and get Swiss number plates and road tax- can't remember the actual figures, but it was not expensive. Our car was quite new- so no problem with all the tests - but it might be a different story with an older car- as pollution testing might be more difficult here. 
I am NO expert- but would say if an older car, you are taking a risk that they won't pass it. We also have bank accounts, address, etc, in the UK - but working here and living here - you cannot run a car on UK plates, insurance and mot.

			We sold our LHD Range Rover that we imported from the UK.   
Advertised on autoscout24.ch and it took around three weeks to sell. Had five or so people come and look at it and sold it to a lady from Zurich (for 20k CHF more than the garage offered). Saying it, the car was still under warranty (3.5 years old) and in perfect condition.   
If you are interested, here is the thread/details of the car:

			I just had to get new a new headlight for my car. I assume you have Xenon/HID lights, hence the cost.   
I was quoted 360 CHF for ONE light (240 for the part, 120 labour). I also got a quote from a French garage for 200 Euro.   
In the end, I bought it directly from a french website ( ) for 38 euros, and got the light fitted for 35 euros. Due to the potential risk, I just didn't want to do it myself. It took the guy at the garage a full 30 minutes to replce the light.

			Oh knowledgeable ones on this forum:   
We live near Lausanne, but after our experience flying from Geneva to San Francisco via Heathrow before Christmas, the Swiss Air non-stops from Zurich to SFO are looking better and better.   
According to  , ""Many local hotels offer up to 2 weeks free parking with one night stay. This can be especially convenient if you have an early flight and need to park at Zurich airport. They provide shuttle service too.""  
Unfortunately, ifly.com does not identify the ""many"" hotels making this offer.   
Through extensive googling, we've been able to identify two hotels offering such an option: Zurich Moevenpick (up to 2 weeks free) and Zurich Renaissance (up to 1 week free).   
Does anyone know of other hotels near the Zurich airport that offer free parking after you stay one night?    
Thanks for your help!

			When you look for a car, say in mobile.de or on audi.de, look for ""MwSt. ausweisbar"" (VAT reclaimable). If you don't see it, high chances that you cannot get the VAT back.   
You get 19% off, but you need to pay 8% Swiss MwSt plus 4% tax.   
Consider using the services of autociel.ch who specialize in importing cars from Germany; they will do everything for you. However, that comes at a cost - the total price they will quote you will be about 6% higher than the sticker price.

			You won't get 1/12 of the price back per unused month (annual tickets are cheaper per month than monthly tickets - a rule of thumb is that an annual ticket costs about what 10 monthlies do). The usual philosophy for these things is that you end up paying about what you'd have paid for the number of monthly tickets you'd have bought to cover the travelling you've done.   
For instance, the refund rule for a GA per the terms and conditions is that the purchase price is refunded less 23% for the first month used and 7% for subsequent months.

			I was tired to pay MB dealer rediculous bills and tried to change oil at the Rue de Geneve.   
These guys ( ) changed oil (8 liters of MB-approved 229.5 full synth 5W30, not sure about the brand) for Chf 150 (that's including the work). Oil filter is Chf 26.50. The guy speaks no English at all, but very friendly.   
That's very reasonable. I tried non-Mercedes Shell Mon Repo garage last summer for oil/filter changes to save some money - they charged 700 (and I brought my own oil  ), including 250 francs for the ""overall inspection of the vehicle"". I paid 550 and told them to get off. I remember the air filter were at least double the price and they charged 75 francs to change the air filter (2 min, no-tool job  ).   
Affordable service in CH exists - just need to know the places and speak the language    
PS 
I had the same problem when we lived in Vienna before. Had to change broken glass in a cheap Mitsu - bought it for EUR200, but the service wanted EUR250-300 (!) to change it and 3 weeks to the appointment. 
Luckily a colleague of mine recommended a private garage - the guy changed the windscreen and did the MFK for 50 euro. I was his customer since then.

			Hello forum!   
We're soon to move out of Switzerland and back to Denmark   (good and bad )   
It's in this matter, that I'm trying my luck here on the forum.   
We will be leaving end of March 2011, and because we have to much stuff for the plane and not enough to use a moving company, we will probably do the moving ourselves.   
But, we don't have a car and one-way rentals are really expensive.    
SO, is there anyone who are in the same situation - I know it may be a long shot, but hey if you don't try...      
We will be happy to go almost anywhere in Switzerland to pick up a car or rent a car and drive to your place to get your stuff - and to drive to Denmark. We're moving to Copenhagen, but we will of course drive the stuff where ever you are moving (Denmark, southern part of Sweden)...    
To sum it up: If you want to share a car rental to Denmark or if you need someone to drive your car to Denmark or if you have another idea, let me know!   
Hope someone is interested. Any tips and ideas are also very welcome.  
If this doesn't work out, I will take the plane to Denmark, borrow a car, drive to CH, fill up the car and drive back to Denmark   
Thank you and merry Christmas    
- Henrik

On dry roads the debate can go on all it wants. On snow and ice there is no contest. Even the winter tyres that I rate as pretty crappy are light years ahead of summer tyres on snow and ice.

			man up, you committed the crime and got caught.   
if you say you were doing 150 then was the limit there 120?  This is with rounding, I assume?   
You'll get a short ban and a fine related to your income.   
I assume Mummy is none too pleased with you?   
On the bright side, the train will get you from Geneva to Zurich in the same time with fewer chances of fines (well, only the 80 francs when you don't buy a ticket).

If your husband has half-price card, then he should   use the snow'n'rail offer.  If you have Gleis7 then you'll have to check whether it's cheaper to get a single ticket plus lift pass (and use the gleis7 for free return travel) but I doubt that would be cheaper and you'd have to hang around in the cold until 7pm...  almost certainly 2 snow'n'rails would be your best bet.   
Having said that, if you're really just a beginner you may want to check out single lift tickets rather than a day pass.  Especially smaller resorts offer these and if you only manage to take a few lifts in a day (due to getting tired, falling over etc) then they can be very good value.   
Also if you don't have your own equipment then you can sometimes get special deals with equipment rental and a lesson together, which are also very worthwhile.

			I would check out Top Gear reviews (usually on youtube), and hire final choices before paying serious money. I hired a small Chevrolet a few months ago, and it was horrid to drive, brakes were scary. Everything on it was really cheap, and not wearing well. Renault Clio drove well and used hardly any petrol, small Peugeots were good too. The 500 has a  galvanised body and looks cute, so you should be left with something worth selling in future.

			Indeed.  I was amazed at the difference in grip with the Nokians fitted.  I can't recommend them enough, especially at a fraction of the cost of Michelins etc. (and I fit nothing but Michelin in the summer!)   
Why not give ATU a tinkle?  They were incredibly helpful and seemed to have no issues with stock.

			Hi everyone,   
Does anyone know where around Basel you can buy those headlight converter thingys please? I'm thinking of the reflectors you stick over the headlights to switch the beam from right to left.   
I ask as I'm driving to the UK for Christmas this year, and it suddenly occurred to me I'd need to get a set of these, particularly as I'll being hitting the shores of Blighty shortly before it goes dark! I've tried a larger Coop Bau+Hobby and  Jumbo without luck so far.   
Alternatively, does anyone know if it's possible to buy these things at the Euro Tunnel terminals please?   
Thanks, 
Chris

			I don't have mine to hand right now, but I believe there is an overlap of ~2 weeks - ie your 2010 is not invalid until about 15th Jan - you should be able to check this - but anyway if you have both, place them there together, just make sure the 2010 is still fully visible.

			Probably a bit late for you, but as I like looking this stuff up:   
In most of the tariff unions (ZVV, Onde Verte, Unireso, etc) if you have an existing pass valid in some zones but want to travel to other zones you need a supplementary ticket that adds the extra zones. Onde Verte calls this a ""Billet de Raccordement"". Details are in their ticket brochure:     
On SBB/CFF ticket machines you'll usually find them hiding under ""Communautés Tarifaires"" or a similiar heading, but as I live on the other side of the linguistic divide I'm not sure how they're set up over there.   
You can also, of course, just buy an extra ticket from the last station your existing pass is valid to to your final destination. In this case, though, if I remember rightly it has to be the last station the train actually calls at which your ticket is valid to.   
The advantage of using a supplementary ticket is that it gives you full travel privilieges within the zones you bought it for (you can change onto buses and so on) rather than just being a point-to-point rail ticket.

			One option would be to meet up with someone at the ferry port. Say a family of 4 travelling over, with a 5 seater. You could take the 5th seat just for the crossing. 5 adults in a car for 600km might be tight with luggage, but for 6km to the port it would be OK.

			My Easyjet flight to Zurich was cancelled last Wednesday as Gatwick was closed and the south east hit very badly by the weather conditions.  To be honest I had no faith in Easyjet getting up and running quickly once things improved so I rebooked with BA from London City for the Friday.  The price was really good considering how near to departure I booked.  Even got an extra 3kg of baggage allowance  .   
Hope everyone else is now back where they needed to be.

			There is a small shop next to the Lorzen Tower Block on Chammerstrasse who does roofbars and car accessories, you might wanna try your luck with him. I have no idea if the stuff he sells are good or not, but I see the stuff outside everytime I go by, and I believe he should have the Thule halterung. I need to get one too, if you do go let me know if it works for you.   
Also do you know if the Thule halterung, just fits on top of the BMW roof bars or does it need a special one from Thule?

			Of course it's not that simple - but no more difficult than any country when crossing a customs post.  The transporter will need a carnet - this allows them to pass though Switzerland without importing the cars.  They will have to check out on the way out of Switzerland where the cars will be checked against the carnet to make sure a few havne't been dropped off  .     
Now the interesting bit - your car, having been collected in Switzerland, will be subject to duties on the way into the EU.

			If I understand this article correctly then exhaust gas tests are now every 4 years instead of every two?  I checked in the web site of the Zürich Strassenverkehrsamt but nothing new there on this topic.     
Seems a good idea to me.  So far as I know the idea of exhaust gas tests started in the USA & most States have now dropped or reduced the requirement.   
It always seemed to be a daft idea to me; I never saw any scientific study showing testing had any benefits.  Reducing emissions does have benefits but testing? 
The process is that an auto manufacturer publishes the emission levels for each vehicle & we all trot along to a garage every 2 years with our vehicle & a bundle of money to check that our manufacturer was not lying - what a daft business.  Failure rates here during testing are practically zero.   
I suppose the new 4 year check is only for vehicles with catalytic converters; the non - cat vehicles must continue go every year?

			Chains should be mounted only when absolutely necessary or required by the police or in a specific region where it is posted as required.   
Chains wear out fast on roads with little or no snow, and cheapo chains wear out faster. When they wear out, a link breaks and the loose chain proceeds to beat the crap out of your fender which becomes very expensive very fast. The other thing that can happen when chains aren't properly mounted or break, is wrap themselves around your axle blocking the wheel and giving you a real mess to untangle.   
Winter tires are an assistance, not magic, and chains are only for emergency use in extreme conditions. You need to learn winter driving techniques for winter driving, you can't just leave it to the machine.

			I am not into Bmw so i don't know much of them, but when you mean with "" replace windscreen wipers"", are we talking the lot? blade and rubber?   
Our previous car was an Opel, the garage we had it serviced had the rubbers on a roll ( from Bosch so no crap)    
He just cut them to size and replaced them on the blades,where other garage will replace the full blade and rubbers , costing you way more then just the rubber.   
Would that be an option? or does Bmw not accomodate swapping just the rubbers on its own?

			Could be worth listing it on Autoscout24.ch for 15,000chf. It will save you the trip to the UK to sell it. The typical speed freak who would buy it is going to be less concerned about RHD than most drivers. Quite a few dealers on there sell write offs, and a conversion to LHD would be less costly, as it already has an MFK, and there is no shortage of LHD Astras in scrap yards for parts, it could make a nice project for someone.

			For comparison, I imported my vehicle through Germany in early 2009 and was required to leave a deposit with the importer of 19% tax on the value of the vehicle. I was also required to show proof of vehicle insurance to the local customs office before exiting Bremerhaven port. When I reached the Swiss border, I had the German and Swiss border control stamp a document (I believe it was a T1 but I could be wrong) verifying that the vehicle had left Germany. The Swiss border control issued a temporary document that permitted me to bring the vehicle to Zurich and register it here. A few days later I sent a copy of the stamped document to the importer in Germany and I was promptly refunded the deposit to my Swiss bank account. If you have difficulty finding auto insurance for your vehicle, I can recommend Geico Insurance (same Geico from the US). They will check your driving record in the US and their prices are reasonable. I have used them for two years. You can call their Germany office (+ 49 631 414 63100 ) and the coverage is valid across all Europe.

When you are driving from Zurich there will be signs (football signs + P) on the highway. 
As far as I remember they can be seen at around Pratteln / the Delemont (road 18) junction. 
I would add an extra 30 minutes at least.

			157 CHF per month for 2nd class.  That gets you unlimited travel from Geneve Gare to Nyon in both directions.  It covers the rail only (not any Unireso transit) and assumes that you already have the 1/2-card.   
Edit: Annual is 1413 CHF.

			Yes this is normal with Avis and I suspect with the other BIG companies. US market is most competetive and rates are lowest for them. However the applicant should be a tourist from the USA. Having said that sometimes if you are lucky you can get by even if you are a local.

			wow.  i'm impressed with all of the info provided.     
i didn't realize planes had cargo rates but it sounds like that is the best way to go for what i want to do. i never heard of bookdepository either so thanks for that tip.   
as i stated, i had done cursory checks with usps, ups, dhl, and fedex and i appreciate that someone above helped confirm what i had also found which is that usps was by far the cheapest of the lot.  i guess that's not saying much though considering the rest of the lot were utter ripoffs    
i appreciate the information related to planes on guitars.  back in the day, it was never questioned if you wanted to bring a guitar on a plane free of charge.  but that universally changed 10-15 years ago.  or so i thought.  biff are you saying that both BA and Swiss air allow you to carry on gits or that only Swiss does (couldn't tell if the greater sign had some special connotation in your post)?  and fwiw, i would never check my guitars or buy a seat for one.  i don't trust them being checked and it would probably cost about the same to just buy a new one (though i'm sure swiss prices are exhorbitant).   
thanks again to all that posted.

			I've dealt with these. I drove in the congestion charge with my Swiss car without paying. Two weeks later they sent me a letter written in German and fine (£60) converted to CHF. It had the TfL logo on the top. I paid up via credit card through their site.... I thought it best as I wanted to drive in the UK & London again.

			Serenity:     
Lease amount isn't important. If the interest rate is crippling or the period is 60mths compared to 36mths - you may end up paying far more than you wanted. For 1000chf per month you can easily get a brand new Volvo Estate (V50, V60, V70) with a very good specification.   
Give an indication of the total price of the car.     
Pretty much all cars will have NCAP 4 or 5* ratings. Kias aren't bad - their advantage is lower running costs. However their engines aren't as efficient/powerful as rivals.     
A 1.8 litre engine can produce considerably different levels of performance/economy depending on the manufacturer. BMWs latest 320d (or X3 20d) is a remarkable bit of kit. Huge (if peaky) performance and exceptional economy.     
Volvo = family, safe, conservative 
Audi = well made, Swiss loved 
Subaru = The farmers choice 
BMW = sporty but frugal 
Merc = Luxury 
VW = working towards an Audi   
Generally, the image of Opel/Ford/Peugoet/Renault is poor in Switzerland, ranking little higher than Japanese makes.   
Think twice about whether a people carrier type vehicle is the way to go. If you don't need 7-seats don't buy a 7 seater. A more traditional estate style car will be more economical, arguably more attractive and easier to drive.   
If you are looking for main dealers - go to their swiss websites and look for ""Handler Suchen"" or ""Standort"" - you can then usually search by post code.   
Assuming your budget (leased) is 50-70k, I'd look at: 
Volvo V60/V70 - D3 
BMW 320d 
Merc C220d - Used 
Audi A4/A6 (depending on space requirement)   
If you want to buy a petrol engined car - the only manufacturer which has managed to mate good performance with economy is BMW.   
If you want a ""cool"" family estate - and are happy with 4 year old - there are a number of V70R available - both auto (not a great match to the engine) and manual. More than enough sporty image for the husband, plenty of space, great seats, good safety, and 4 wheel drive. They come in around the 40k mark - which with a 10% deposit will be around the 700-900chf per month depending of residual payment and lease rate.

You should know by now that they like their rules, and most Swiss I have spoken to have never heard of the maxim: ""rules are made to be broken"".   
It is Sod's law that you are going to be checked the one time you try it. Look at the other thread, the guy said s/he was travelling a distance of 2 km and they got caught.   
The other thing, of course, is that cars are a very emotive topic, as they can cause a lot of damage, so again, the police will take a dim view of the situation.

			This is why the googling    ,   works so well. You can put several terms with plus signs between them which must be present the sought Thread. Jrspet showed me the method ages ago and I, together with a lot of other EFers, I use it all the time for searches. Otherwise I use Advanced Search, especially if I can remember who posted in that thread, which also narrows it down quite a lot.

			That's very interesting Mrs T and you may have hit the nail on the head. I tried with both my CHF card linked to my CHF account and with my Euro card linked to my Euro account. This was up to the point just before you click ""Buy"" and both times they wanted to convert to Euros. BUT, both my accounts are with a bank in France.   
So I'm just trying to think what happens when I buy petrol or groceries in Switzerland with my CHF card. I don't think I get an option to pay in Euros although I would automatically refuse it if it was there so perhaps I've blanked it out of my mind. I suppose it's up to the retailer if they offer this ""service"".   
With Aer Lingus I have a feeling that if I had not chosen the guaranteed price in Euros then they would have charged in CHF but this was certainly not stated. It is good to know that you have never seen the conversion yourself.

			About 2-3 years ago it was one flat fee (about 30pounds in the UK) to add an additional driver, now you have to pay per day which is a huge amount more.   
Sometime you can get their extra insurance cover which lowers the excess to 100 pounds (or zero) and that includes an additional driver, I know Avis in the UK do this?

Special cases     Such persons may use a vehicle duty-free in Switzerland so long as they are deemed, under Swiss law, to be non-Swiss residents.   No import formalities are to be observed; the vehicle may be imported without a permit.   Only if the stay lasts more than one year (more than 18 months for short residents), the entry customs office will issue to the driver against presentation of his registration card, a permit for duty-free use of the vehicle. Fee of 10 Fr.   4.2 Vehicles brought in by foreign workers (annual workers) and students (seasonal workers. see par. 4.1)   Such persons are permitted to use a vehicle duty-free for a period of two years from the date of first entry up to the commencement of the employment or study, even if, due to their activities in Switzerland, they also transfer their domicile to Switzerland.   Are to be shown to the Customs office: the Swiss residence permit, the registration card.   At the expiry of the two year period, the conditions of domicile of the holder of the vehicle are clarified and judged on the basis of the criteria laid down in Art. 23 and seq. of the Swiss Civil Code.   Where no transfer of domicile has occurred, which is, as a rule, the case in respect of students, the holder of the vehicle is permitted to continue using the uncleared vehicle. On the other hand, if the holder of the vehicle has transferred his domicile to Switzerland, he must either pay duty on the vehicle or export it definitively, provided that the conditions for duty-free admission as migrants' effects exist. In this case the procedure laid down in par. 4.3 below shall be applied.          	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	12 months register car rule	LeonW	Posts: 11

			Yes it really did expire!! If u look at your Swiss license u probably see under ""4b"", a bunch of stars. Well mine has a date in 2009! Wtf!!! 
I had a full license that id had in the states for more than 2 years, and was driving for ages before that in Canada where I grew up. This is so frustrating!!!!

			I came across in my car in Aug with little issue....quickly got used to driving on the ""wrong"" side....I was told ""just follow the car in front of you"" I have not done the import of the car yet but will do so before MOT and Tax run out in March next year.   
The only real difficulty is parking garage ticket machines....a few options....get out and walk around and shrug at those behind you...stretch across or make sure to have a passenger...   
I guess I will in due time get a left hand drive car but for now sourcing and buying a car is one hassle I can do without.

Cycling and walking, everyone knows, are two of the best possible means of commuting (where practical) ...to give up the pleasure just because of some isolated incidents of perverts fooling around is OTT. Who knows, if their intention was to deter people from cycling in that area, we'd be playing right into their hands

			Having had friends that have owned them I'd go with the lack of flair opinion. The general consensus is that as a pieces of engineering they are superb. They handle well, they ride well, they are built well, they have good performance - and combined together you can hurtle along any ribbon of tarmace with gay abandon.   
The problem is, the joy of driving, the excitement of tackling a new or known piece of road, can't simply be measure by distance over time. There is far more to it than that. There is how the engine sounds, there is how the engine makes you feel, there are flaws in the chassis that you have to learn to find and then compensate for and there is your respect and admiration for their history.   
I think the Cayman is a great car - in a way it is a Ronseal car - it does exactly what it says on the tin. But it doesn't excite me. I don't look at one and get ""Sportscar jealousy"" despite it technically being a ""better"" car than mine. I crave something different, I crave something flawed and I crave design that excites.   
Other great engineering projects - which just happen to be in car form are: Veyron, 911 4s, McLaren MP13, Cayman, C63

			Tiny though this country is, there are some fairly large temperature differentials -- wayyyyyyyyy up north here in Basel where the OP lives, it is often 4-5 degrees C colder than wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy down south in Vaud. One forecast I saw yesterday suggested we would get -3C overnight later this week (and even the link provided by volodymyr forecasts +2C this week).   
In any case, as Carlos R pointed out, if we feel inclined to drive the massive hour and a half to the mountains, we are going to encounter snow.

Yes, this is what happened. Read it in a paper somewhere. 
I find this a bit silly. While I like public transport, I can't really imagine going shopping for and with e.g. a family of four and carrying everything on a bus. 
The people that are most likely to use public transport (high-income singles with few stuff to buy, because they eat out often anyway) are also most likely to just get it elsewhere (Sihlcity), where the approach isn't an odyssey. 
And they are the most likely to have been using the bus even before the parking fees were asked (most likely because they had a GA anyway). 
In the end, it's not much more than political theater, intended to make politicians look as if they cared for the environment.

			I would not go down to 49cc as the speed and acceleration will feel really slow very quickly. If you can I would go for a 125cc as a minimum. It will give you a bit more oooompfh to get out of tight spot, overtake and just flow with the traffic easier. Sorry I cannot offer any advise what to look out for when buying in Switzerland.

The EcoCarrier (small truck/delivery van) seems more reasonably priced and would probably be great for local deliveries. Question is whether the 80km range is sufficient if you need 8-10 hours for a full recharge.   
The bikes and scooters look much more appealing to me, but still pricey...

			Hallo ,   
 I did my Kontrollfahrt 1 month before and passed.   in Aarau   
1. Since you are doing a Kontrollfahrt, you can do the test in an Automat and if you pass the test you can drive automat & manuel . 
2.Check the mirrors , careful while changing the lane   
3. Normally in a kontrollfahrt there is no reverse or parelle parking etc.. 
4. Be calm and cool ...     
All the best and regrads

			Hi everyone,   
I have been driving my Vespa around with my L licence since June. It officially expired 2 days ago (16.10.2010). I thought getting the 8 hour weekend course would be sufficient to extend it for another year, but my instructor told me right now that I hadn't reached the goals of the Grundkurs yet (through private lessons, and passing a small test with him that I can drive around small streets with lots of junctions, using my mirrors correctly, and with him sitting behind). And because I hadn't done this test yet (the weather is too cold now), I am not able to get my extension.    
The only proof of me doing the 8 hour course is a section with Fahrzeugbeherschung on the back, showing I paid 400CHF and attended on 4 Sept 2010 (the second date of the course was not marked).     
I have already done 5 private classes (ie almost 10 hours), but am still not ready for the exam because during the 8 hour course we did not learn swerving and the full emergency brake. And I do need practice with a lot of other things as well.    
What were your experiences with extending the L?  What should I do next?

			Morning ,   
Have a look at these    ,  and  .   
I am sure they will be able to fly you in the right direction.   
Also, check out if all your cert's are valid here..many people came over to Switzerland ( lovely country mind you ) finding out afterwards that what ever cert or diploma they had, was not valid here.   
So they had to re-school in what ever they did, to get a Swiss diploma or cert.   
Again..not sure if this the fact in your case but check it before you make the move.   
If all goes well, safe travels and i hope you will enjoy the country just as much as i do    
all the best   
Joey

			Well, my dad has been and gone now. The exact details were that his vehicle was about 5 tonnes and he was towing a trailer with a scooter, and the outcome was:   
 - he had to get a vignette for the trailer/scooter (I think it must have been for the trailer, as I've heard that scooters drive for free here) 
 - he had to fill in a special form for his motorhome instead of getting a vignette. This entails a charge on a per-day basis for being in Switzerland. 
 - there was no tachometer requirement.   
In fact, the worst problem he had was finding somewhere to park the damn thing!!

			Hi,   
Another driving licence question...   
I have been in Zurich since the start of this year and so far have been driving on my UK licence.  From 1 Jan next year, exactly one year after arriving, it looks like I will be only semi-resident here.  I will still be employed by a Swiss company, earning CHF, but working probably 2 days a week here, rest in UK.   
So the question is... should I switch to a Swiss licence?

			Hi,   
I need to move my stuff from the UK (Oxford) to Zurich and was wondering if someone would also be doing the same in either way and if would be interested in sharing transportation? Perhaps we could synchronise or get organised with a moving company. I'm looking into a reasonable option price wise.     
 Regarding dates: I'm flexible but I would need my stuff moved by early December 2010. Perhaps, I could stretch the dates to January.   
Please let me know if you are interested.   
Thanks!

			you should get a map. the stations are usually named after the street name or some building next to the station. We I came to Switzerland I took tramway and bus all the time and I never left without my map. Ask at the main station for a good one. The tramways are show on the map.

Certainly when I went to Augsburg earlier in the year on such a ticket, it was accepted on the ICE without question from the ticket-checker.  Certainly the CHF119 ticket I quoted up-thread is valid in this way.  The person at the ticket counter at the station will be able to give you full details on the validity.

			If you have an accident where it is 100% your fault, you would have to pay the first CHF 2,500 of the damage. You can reduce this to CHF 300 after making an extra payment as listed below.         
As a Mobility customer, you are covered by third-party, comprehensive and passenger insurance in the event of a claim. The policy deductible is limited to CHF 2'500.- (in addition to obligatory surcharges for inexperienced and young drivers) per claim.   , choose the liability reduction and reduce your policy deductible to a maximum of CHF 300.- per claim (in addition to obligatory surcharges for inexperienced and young drivers). 
Order your liability reduction policy when you register. If you would like to take out liability reduction after concluding the contract, simply call the 24h Service Center on 0848 824 812.   Liability reduction for the 4-month trial subscription CHF 48.-  Liability reduction for one year CHF 125.- Liability reduction for co-members of the cooperative for one year
(if the first-time member of the Mobility cooperative possesses liability reduction) CHF 50.-  "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 25 Times in 22 Posts	Mobility car sharing (with SBB travelcards) - insurance?	cheesey	Posts: 1,148

			Hello everyone,    
In the next few weeks I need to move about a car load of personal belongings from London to Zurich. As I don't have a car I was thinking of hiring a car to bring it all over, but obviously this would mean having to drive the car back to the U.K again.    
Is anyone doing this journey and has space to spare, wants to share driving, or needs to do the Zurich to London and can take the car back etc. I'm open to suggestions!   
Thanks,   
Chris

			Glad to hear basic maintenance solved this!  Go buy a lottery ticket now, as replacing a shifter fork would have been about 1000x more trouble and expense!     
As for what type of oil to use in a motorcycle with a wet clutch.  ALWAYS make sure it indicates on the label that it does not have ""friction modifiers"" in it   or is non 'Energy Conserving'   
Friction modifiers can make your clutch slip.

Should I get a new car via renting?....

			I drove with my boyfriend from Scotland to Zurich when I moved here, via the ferry from Dover to Calais. We avoided all of the tolls on the mainland by taking the smaller roads. Of course, this takes a lot more time, but it was very beautiful. And of course, it was cheap! We could have done the trip in a day using the highways, but we chose to take our time, stopping at Bologne, Reims, Vittel, and Nancy. If you have the time to do this with your family, I would highly recommend it. There are so many nice places along the way, and your son would probably really enjoy it-- as long as there are frequent breaks. Of course it also helps if you can trade drivers once in awhile    
Have a nice trip!!

			Hi,   
The car is a Porsche 993 and I am in canton Schwyz.   
Oddly enough the car is fitted with a variant of the gearbox with taller ratios that was only fitted to cars exportd to the US, Austria and Switzerland to meet their more stringent noise requirements!    
The only other difference between the US and Euro version was the emission system which on the US cars was more stringent that then Euro models built at the time.   
I am sincerely hoping that i will get a nice letter from the Porsche importers AMAG (whom I called with my problem yesterday) and go with this, the customs form, the emissions test and insurance for the road inspection.   
Rigth now nobody at AMAG or Porsche that I have spoken too seems to know what to do   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jun 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Car export from California -- US registration question	2x2	Posts: 70

For all of us that are not as knowledgeable as our friend Kevlegs, see below.     
In some countries (primarily UK and Switzerland) where a car allowance is the best practice, this policy allows such cash allowance competitive with benchmark data in lieu of a company car. The car allowance is subject to social security and tax deductions, in accordance with local taxation laws. The car allowance is not considered part of the base salary (for purposes of pension fund, bonus calculation, etc.) 
The car used for business purposes under the allowance scheme should be fully and comprehensively insured. The driver and passenger must be insured as well. The insurance costs for the required insurance will not be paid additionally by the employer and are considered to be part of the allowance 
The car allowance is all inclusive meaning it should cover for all other car related costs including (but not limited to) fuel, mileage, maintenance, road taxes, tires, fines, etc. Any car used for business purposes must be in a good and safe condition and suitable for business use. 
the employer is authorized to check insurance conditions and documents and where necessary carry out safety checks if the car is used for business purposes. In the case where a the employer business car is available the use of the private car should be avoided to prevent additional costs for the employer.

			I'm not sure how it is in the US,  but in Canada if you get too many speeding tickets, your insurance will go up, potentially making it impossible to get insured after a certain point.  That's one of the main reasons why people fight tickets, often paying more on legal fees than the ticket itself just to avoid the charge on their record.   
I think the system here is much easier.  Pay the fine, and you're done.   
You also have to look at the amount of power that a police officer is given in North America compared to here.  Catch a Canadian cop in a bad day, and he'll write you a whole bunch of tickets and tell you ""if you don't like it, fight them in court"".  Or... ""your exhaust is too loud, this is a street racing modification"" without doing a DB test, having your car impounded at your expense and making you take a taxi home.   
Here everything is fairly controlled, where an encounter with the police is not the most stressful thing on Earth.  Follow the rules, have papers proving legality of all modifications, and you're pretty safe.  The occasional camera flash is nothing to get scared about unless you're looking at a 1000+chf fine.  If money is a problem, don't speed.  Even if you lose your license for a month or so, it's not the end of the world.  Good luck getting insurance in Canada after losing your license.   
Also, I'd rather know that the speed limit is the limit, not like in Canada where you're always over the limit, hoping that the police won't fine you for 10 over.   
BTW, to answer your question, I've never tried to fight a ticket here :-)  I've also never received one (knock on wood).

Never drove the damn thing again (for various reasons, financial ones being most prominent).

			Hello,   
I'm desperately looking for an out-dated Eurostar ticket. I would need a ticket ideally Paris - London (but could be the other way) from any day in July or August that would not have the name of the passenger written on it.   
I have traveled from Paris to London in August, and need my ticket for a validation, but I can't find it. If you have such ticket, this would save me a lot of administration pain...   
Thanks in advance. Jo

There is a small health coaching company who also offers the ""Nothelferkurs"", as it is called, in English. They are called HEALTHY AND SAFE AWAY FROM HOME, you can find more information on their website,  . Their course fees are quite competitive. (And they offer a large variety of other first aid course, too).   
They will also come to your own home as long as you can organise a group of at least six people. Otherwise, their courses are usually held in either Langnau am Albis, 15 min. from Zug, or in Adliswil.

			What is your nationality? The reason I am asking is that I was in a similar situation to yourself a few years back when I lived in Norway.   
It was far cheaper and quicker for me to book some lessons and a test over a period of three weeks during the summer in the UK and get my license than go through the whole process in Norway.   
IF you are a Brit then I think that will be the best method. I don't know how it works in other English speaking countries. There is a small proviso that you have to be resident in the country, but I have a UK address and who is ever going to ask you in your home country if you are resident there?

			it is the government's job to protect your freedom, not your safety. that is society's job.    
This is all marketed under ""safety"" but all it does is control the people and pay for bureaucrats to sit in offices and tell us how to run our lives. bureaucrats who were not elected. ALL oppression is always from the government. it is what we must, as responsible citizens, protect ourselves most against.  there should be a referendum against these. they are pure tyranny. people should rise up and revolt.

			I live in Zürich and bought a car in St Gallen.  I went to look at and drive the car, liked it, gave a deposit of 25% (it was a cash sale) and they gave me the grey papers.     
The following day I emailed TCS about getting auto insurance about 0630 in the morning.  By 0830 I had a quote emailed to me.  I liked the rate, signed the papers, scanned them and emailed them back.  I had insurance confirmation by 0930.  At lunch I went to the Strassenverkehrsamt with the grey papers and insurance papers (which were not needed - my insurance info was already in the computer) and was issued license plates.  The car had its last inspection done a few months earlier in Bern, and the ZH Strassenverkehrsamt put that date in their computer for the calculation of the next due insoection.     
Took the train to St Gallen that afternoon, paid the balance due on the car, put my plates on the car and drove home.   
The cantons didnt matter other than I had to use the ZH Strassenverkehrsamt since thats where I live.   
The entire process was astonishingly easy - it took an afternoon for me to decide on the car, and the following morning for me to get all of the paperwork done.

			Isn't this the consequences discussion?    
Certainly i believe I would have A bigger problem if I skidded in a car with no electronics now as compared to 20 years ago.  Slide a car and it will work it out fro you rather than having to work it out for yourself.  But, as I only drive newer cars, the consequences of that reduced ability don't effect me or other road users: at least most of the time   
I believe driving ability is worse but risks are lower because of the technology   
Sadly the thing that no technology can sort out is lack of consideration and  , I believe is worse the more time goes on and even more sadly, the further south i drive.  Basel: good, Ticino: getting worse, Italy: Oh sweet lord!

			I would think about getting a diesel car, when you get troubles with it, it will cost you a lot more to get it fixed  than a petrol car. Also maintenance seems to be more expensive than petrol cars. Turbo diesel motors might need expensive replacement parts, like turbo and fuel injectors and sensors.    
If you want to save fuel with a diesel car, get an manual or one with an electric clutch, this will save you a lot more. 
I think it is much more ecconomic to your account  get an petrol car because petrols are usually cheaper to get, at least get 1 year full waranty with it if it is an diesel. 
I would get an Chrysler Voyager, plenty room available, both with disel and petrol, automaitic uses around petrol 12-13Liter, Diesel 10-11 and Manual Diesel 8-9 per 100 Km or much less on high way. Long and short versions available, but long ones make parking difficult, the short ones should fit 2 puschchairs too.  
But V6 petrol cars are cheaper to get and cause much less headache. I would look around in germany because of the strong Sfr.

You want a van, you have been given a load of links and you know it will cost a lot - deal with it - rent a van, pay the money, move your stuff. DONE      is normally pretty cheap - 114chf for a day - 100km = 11l = 20chf for fuel.

			a cheap way to find out what you really need to do, is just take it to get your inspection done, they will then tell you whats wrong with it.  for example on my older cdn spec a4 i imported, i expected i would have to change the headlights, but i didn't bother, and it passed with the original ones.   i had crossdrilled rotors on it as well, and he asked me about them, i played dumb, said they were replaced by audi because of a known defect with the original ones, so he counted the holes on the rotors, and passed them as-is.  not sure if he felt bad because he had already found a broken spring and claimed i had a loose baffle in my muffler so managed to cost me 1k to fix that, but either way i was happy as expected i would have to change those back to stock.  i also swapped my oem winter wheels on for the inspection bc my summer rims are not stock and dont have the papers for them.

5617	13.09.2010, 11:00	Member	Thanked 55 Times in 23 Posts	Location: Zuirch	"    My car is a 5-year old Saab, with a full Saab service history. The warranty was included with the car, but I think would have cost about CHF700- if purchased separately. It's covered the following work:   
Thermostat replacement 
Head gasket replacement 
Timing chain replacement 
Throttle body   
I don't have the exact amount each service cost, but it was all performed at a main dealer, and was more than CHF3000.-   
For each incident, I had to pay the first CHF100.-. Labour was covered at 100%. Parts were covered at 50% (due to mileage of car). I think I paid about CHF1200.- of the bills, including excess, non-covered portion of parts, and fluids with the thermostat and head gasket repairs.  The warranty company picking up the rest.  But in any case, the warranty covered FAR more than the cost of the warranty in my case.    
I was surprised that they covered the timing chain replacement, as I'd consider this a wear-and-tear item, but there was no debate at all. It hadn't failed -- the dealer noticed it was a little noisy, and suggested replacing it.  Every time my dealer proposes a repair to the warranty company, they pay out without question. A   different experience than I had in the UK.   
I wouldn't have bought the warranty if it hadn't been included in the price of the car, but now that I've used it, I'm glad I had it -- and I would buy it again if I bought another car of similar age (especially given the high cost of putting something right at a dealership in Switzerland).      This was my experience of aftermarket warranties in the UK. They always find an excuse for not covering something, and aren't worth the money. But I've had a totally different experience in Switzerland, which is why I recommended investigating the warranty.

			I am British, and have an unlimited motorcycle category on my old UK license, but I came to CH from US, and when I showed my US license the Strassenverkehrsamt (SZ) didn't understand the US license and didn't give me unlimited motorcycle category (just up to 25KW).   
This wasn't a problem, as I didn't have a motorbike anyway, but am now starting to think about taking it up again.   
I just moved to GR, and explained the situation at local SVKAmt (in my limited German), but they tell me I've left it too late to change my Swiss license to include the unlimited category and will need to take motorbike test.   
A couple of questions:  Does anyone know any way around this?   
Is it possible to do the theory in English?

			Hi   
The nighttrains are not too bad. I have used them to Denmark a few times.   
But....   
I used to be in the 4-6 cabins sharing with strangers (not allways what you call perfect) 
Im also 1,88 M tall, and you do manage JUST to fit in the bed.   
If you travel 2 together you can get a 2. klass 2 cabin. much better, and not much more expensive. But you need to pay for 2 ppl to get it (I think)   
Good luck 
eather way - you will survive :-)

			I assume you moved your car to Switzerland as a household item...this means you won't have to pay tax and it's a breeze getting it through registration within 1 YEAR. I if you miss the one year time limit you will be in a lot of pain registering the car, because now they won';t accept it as a moved household item and you will have to produce emission certificates, noise certificates for your vehicle ld haveand the Swiss importer will not give those to you. You will be forced to get them done at EMPA and it will cost you major bucks like 5 grand...so I suggest you register the vehicle before 12 months from initial import are over and submit form 13.20 which you should have received upon import.

			It really is a snap, as the others have said. Enjoy your flight and look forward to an easy arrival in Lausanne.    
By the way, a one-way fare from the airport to Lausanne costs CHF25 in 2nd class and CHF42 in 1st class, in case you want to treat yourself!    
If you're up for it, you can purchase a ""half-fare"" pass at the Airport train station. There is a tourist information centre right next to the ticket windows. It will cost you CHF150 for a year (maybe less if you are under 26 years old) and with it all your train fares in Switzerland will cost you half-price during that year.    
Welcome to beautiful Lausanne!

			Interesting about the same paperwork as the belongings.  As far as I understand it, all my stuff is ""Umzugsgute"" and not really subject to taxes.  Haven't really tested that theory, but moving to Switzerland from Germany wasn't much hastle.     
As far as paperwork goes, I'm fluent in German and ""quale"" through the paperwork myself.  It's a pain and reading law in German sucks, but I like to know what it is, and where it stands.  I usually print out the laws of relevance to what I'm doing and bring them with in case of any discussions with the customs officers.  You'd be amazed how you sometimes get a different answer from each and every person you talk to at the border.

			Dear group,   
Can anyone recommend an English speaking, professional travel agent (or agency) who can help me organize business travel for my self-employed consultancy?   
I don't need a lot of help, I usually go online and search timetables and build itineraries myself. I really just need someone who can issue me tickets and assist with modifications, etc. if necessary. On the other hand, I need a single point of contact instead of having to go through airline call centres!   
I don't want to go to an office; I need to be able to do all business by email and telephone. This also means that the agent can be located anywhere in Switzerland.   
As I am self-employed, I don't have the resources to make a contract with an agency or guarantee a certain level of business (I don't know if this is an issue but I thought I would add it).   
Thank you for any suggestions/recommendations you may have!

			There are direct trains from Zurich airport to Basel SBB (the main station) every hour at four minutes past the hour from 6:04 am until 9:04 pm.  Direct does not mean non-stop (there can be something like 7-11 other stops along the way depending on the train but it shouldn't take longer than 90 minutes).  Basel SBB will be the last stop.  Outside of those times, you will have to take the train to Zurich HB and transfer there.  A one way ticket costs 35 CHF without any discounts.  There is a ticket counter at the top of the stairs that lead to the tracks along with several machines that can print the tickets for you if you use a credit/debit card.  If you are nervous about it, go to the ticket window to purchase the ticket and ask the person there for directions to the correct track.     
Hope this helps.

			Hello,   
It looks like my GF's car would need a new head gasket (we're starting to find oil in the coolant). My understanding is that the head gasket in itself is a fairly inexpensive part however replacing it is labour intensive.    
Given the age of the car (a 12 years old Renault Clio 1.9d) we would only do the repair if it made economic sense, which, given Swiss garage rates would not be the case, hence the idea to look at the other side of the border.    
Can anyone recommend a small garage on the French side of Geneva that could do this on the cheap?   
Thanks. 
Alain

			Hi,   
Billhardie kindly took my old rusty bike which meant it was time to find a new one. I looked locally on the internet and found a place in Oerlikon that had a bike sale. (Their motto is Swiss Made in Zurich)       
If you scroll down the page the 50% off bikes are at the end. They have a lot of what looks like high end mountain racing bikes for sale at the beginning 30% off.  I think the sale ends end of August, so a few more days.   
I bought a Kristall Downtown one half price 600chf, still a lot in my book but better 3 figures than 4   and the gentleman kindly fitted the basket on the front for me.   
It looks nice quality and I feel like I am driving a 4wd.. I'm sitting quite high up and I have 24 gears in total (affecting the front and back wheels)!   
Am looking for a good bike lock and will most likely go for an Abus, just not sure which one yet..

Pneu Egger offered something near 1400.- including fitting. The cheapest local dealer was offering 970.- including fitting.

A mouse click of an Migrol employee would be more expansive as what you paid for the fix.   
Btw, I know a lot of people paying regularly 1500 to 2000 CHF only for regular maintenance, it seem this is the norm in Switzerland.

			My partner and I are going to share a number plate, (Wechselschild). Now that it is all arranged, he has told me that we actually have to removed the number plate each time.   
Is it possible to have two plates made up?   
I usually drive to my mums in the UK and then don't use the car once there. If I had to send the plate back it would be ridiculous.   
I don't use my car much but do make the weekly trip to the supermarket in my car because we don't have enough seats in his.   
Thank you to anyone who can help.

			Don't worry about driving a RH drive car over here. I brought my UK car 2 yrs ago and despite all the advice I got to the contrary and the frequent funny looks I get, I'm glad I did. It really hasn't presented many problems. The only no-go zone is my local Coop car park in Thalwil, where the combination of a sharp turn and hill at the exit gate means you practically have to get out of the car to insert the ticket. On the other hand, fellow Thalwilers with LH drive cars also complain about it!

			I rest my case in defence of Japanese 80/90 vehicles. I had loved my Toyota Corolla 1.6GLE back in SA for 5 years (carburettor model) before I parted from her. She was very obedient chick long distance and few major cheap services would serve her well. Minor once (oil change, sparkplugs, oil and fuel filters and brake pads replacement) I used to DIY. 
Sometimes I miss this ""scoroscoro"" what my wife calls it. But here in CH I would rather opt for local manufacturers e.g. France, Germany, Sweden. I also think that and it is shared opinion by the others that buying cars form Switzerland is not a bad idea. The driving culture is more subtle on CH highways than on German autobahn's where the vehicle screams for mercy. I also heard (could be urban legend though) that Swiss get rid of the good vehicles like spoilt brats after say 5 years of exploitation to buy a new model.   
BTW: I am also in process of budgeting for second hand car (inspired by being sick and tired of using my bike and public transport) in range of CHF10k to CHF15k. This time it will be German car and I consider only four major makes: Audi, BMW, Merc and VW. You can get a car cheaper than that but I would like to marry some elegance, style and quality altogether with estate at still reasonable price. Then you need to cough up a bit more my man...

			I imported my Ford Focus Kona about 10 years ago and did not have too many issues getting the paperwork changed.  
What I needed to do at the time is change the ""standing lights"" that used to be orange ( the light for the blinkers) and I found a garage who just added a small light bulb in the ""normal"" front lights, and changed the wiring accordingly and that was it.  
So all the transformations in Switzerland only cost me about 400 CHF - and I am not sure if this is actually a very good deal I got or not - I assume not as I am a girl and did not know too much about cars.  
There are papers available from the Strassenverkehrsamt or the Service Navigation with the details you need to respect to import your car.  
I would do it again in a heart beat - a little bit of work, yes, but you can put your car on a boat and have the trunk full of goodies :-) 
Hope this helps.

			Hi all,   
I had the same issue as a number of people seem to face when moving out/back to UK.  So I bought a van in the UK for £900 and drove it here with my stuff a couple of months ago.    
My 45 day free parking permit runs out soon and I don't need it out here so I've got a couple of options:   
1) Drive it back and sell it again in the UK (will do this september 3rd if I still have it). 
2) Sell it to someone here in CH for them to drive their stuff back   
So if anyone is in the situation where they need stuff taken back to the UK, I'm happy to sell to someone here for a discount who can drive it back and sell themselves.   
With the tank and a half of diesel (100EUR), breakdown cover (30 EUR), tunnel (£100), tolls (100 EUR) then it makes a lot of sense i think instead of hiring/shipping !   
The van is a Ford Transit semi high top SWB. Its S reg, 88,000 miles, FSH & only 1 prior owner. Used to be a builders van so its pretty scruffy interior but I put new covers on the seats and gave it a good clean so its ok now. Exterior small bits of rust on arches etc - standard transit !! Most importantly, mechanically its sound, stamped service book to back up the mileage and it made it here in 12 hrs ish without a problem. I've been running around in it (Ikea etc !) since so its been running weekly since.   
I intend to sell it in UK for £1000 (probably on ebay) - sure it will go for this as I've tidied it up a lot and when I was looking to buy it was a nightmare finding one in good mechanical condition under £1000 !   
Let me know if anyone is interested - I'm based in Zurich city.

			Carouge is certainly nice, but it is very hard to find an apartment there.  You may want to expand your search area, as the the rental market is very tight in Geneva. You might want to consider Plainpalais, which across the river from Carouge, too.

Yeah, short people never consider the tribulations we tall people go through.... you never have to worry about bumping your head in Swiss hallways!   Actually, it's more of an issue than you might think, comes into play when buying clothes or cars or such - and I'm not even all that tall. I've got siblings a couple inches taller than me, and that's hell.   
The plus side is I can flatfoot more or less any motorcycle ever made.    
There used to be a horsepower restriction on Swiss bikes for the first two years, but not an engine size - so you could buy a large bike and simply have it restricted. In any case, they changed the law a while back, and you can now start on anything - though I rode 125s for a couple months before I started test driving the bigger ones.   
Anyway, looking forward to doing some (gentle) group rides once I get the bike. You'll know I took delivery when my avatar changes.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 158 Times in 114 Posts	Opinions on the Suzuki DL 650	Corbets	Posts: 2,898

			Hi, we have used   for our move MUC-ZRH. After your registration different companies will bid on your move - when you are lucky and flexible with your dates, you might get a great deal from some company that is looking to fill up their truck on their way to a planned big return move, that would be otherwise empty. We paid under 1K EUR for moving our 2-room appartment.

Sometimes you need to battle with your employer to improve your circumstances. Parents commute, not 8 year olds. The simple answer is to move, even if it is just for a year.    
8 is too young to take the train alone that distance, regardless of the weather. Taking a local bus to school at that age is not the same thing and that is what an 8 year old might do here if he couldn't walk to a local school.

			Old fashioned autoboxes were poor for driver involvement - but in exchange you get a very relaxed drive - which, certainly around town, is a massive improvement.   
However their biggest problem was their effect on fuel economy. In the late 80s automatics began to feature a ""lock up"" mode in the highest gear - effectively bypassing the torque converter and providing a clean minimal loss path. Gradually over time, as automatics gained more gears, this feature began appearing on lower gears. The best automatics now involve complex software and lockup functions. A very good example of this is the one used by Jaguar. Under full acceleration the torque converter ""slips"" for a fraction of a second before each gear is ""locked up"" until the red-line.   
From the mid 90s you began to get selectable automatics - one of the finest is/was the Switchtronic employed by Alpina - basically new software for the ZF box - to keep it simple. This employed steering mounted button that would allow the drive to drop a cog when required - ie for cornering.   
To get an increased level of driver interaction it was thought that a good way to go was the automated manual - found in the early 00s throughout the Ferrari/Maserati range - and also in high spec BMWs - think M3 CSL and M5. Software would activate the clutch - disengage a gear - engage a new gear - and release the clutch - all in a fraction of a second. When driven hard it is a fantastic gearbox - changes are rapid and accurate - and under braking the blipping of the throttle is beautiful. For driver satisfaction there is little to rival it.   
The dual-clutch transmission is considered even better - pre-engaging another gear meaning seamless changes. The downside is that the software that controls the automatic side of the transmission is often a bit sluggish and designed for economy.   
Finally, in terms of transmission loss and performance, there is virtually nothing in it between BMWs DCT (dual clutch) 7 speed transmission and their 8 speed transmission - and although the dual clutch seems like a perfect solution it may well find itself supplanted by ever more sophisticated and multi-cogged automatics - with manuals every increasingly the domain of absolute motoring enthusiasts.

My car needs servicing and I've never had it done here before but I don't want to get ripped off. Can anyone recommend one near Lachen or somewhere between Lachen and Zurich?

The production of ""my model"" was stopped in 2007 for the all new two cylinder which is now in the F 650 GS (and only the marketing understands the name as the engine actually has 800 cc...). When I ""borrowed"" the pic for my post above, I read ""2009 GS"" which made no sense for me... till I found out that they started to produce them in Brasil again. And now: In Germany, the Brazilian bike is ""of course"" not available, please buy the new thing. In Switzerland, BMW imports it as   650 GS as a beginners bike for 9900 CHF... this was not available last year and suddenly my second hand deal does not look as good as it did then anymore....

			Do you have an Audi A4 from 2008? If yes then it has an adaptive cruise control system which is factory fitted as an extra option in the car. If that is the case then:   
Adaptive cruise control (ACC) - The adaptive cruise control system available for the new Audi A4 enables the driver to preselect a suitable road speed between 19mph and 124mph, and to maintain this selected speed for as long as the distance from the preceding vehicle permits; this can be up to 180 metres. The radar sensor detects when the car is approaching the vehicle ahead too closely.   
If the driver decides to overtake, ACC is temporarily overridden by pressing the accelerator pedal, but remains active and later restores the pre-selected road speed and the corresponding distance that the system maintains from the preceding vehicle. The system is de-activated whenever the brake pedal is pressed, however, and then has to be reset using the control lever. This restores the previously chosen settings. 
The radar sensor is located to the left of the single-frame grille, in an exposed housing with a covering lens. The scanning angle is about eight degrees, and the range approximately 180 metres.    
The radar sensors four transmitting/receiving units operate in the 76.5 GHz frequency range, which is licensed for radio signals. They calculate the differences in frequency between the transmitted and received radar signals. With the aid of the Doppler effect and the signal transmission/reception time, the speed of the vehicle in front and its distance from the car can be determined.    
The system is integrated into the CAN network, which extends through the entire car; it can therefore communicate within a few thousandths of a second with other control units, such as those for engine management, the automatic transmission and the brakes.

TopCar Zug seem to have a great selection of used cars for a reasonable price and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with them - given the problems i've heard with some dealers (ala the Auto Discount Uster).

			EuroTunnel is really good if you want to drive on get over the channel and drive off again. I.e. Stay with your car, not go to duty free etc, etc. Then it is quick.    
If however you want to have a break, eat something, possibly pick up some duty free etc, then the whole faff will take you just as long as the ferry.    
I haven't done the trip for a couple of years now, but I took the Ferry 9 times out of 10 as I like the break and it was a lot cheaper at the time.    
Once I was in a hurry and I managed to do the EuroTunnel thing in well under an hour and once I was there at peak time and the Ferry would have been quicker and it cost a fortune.   
Hope this helps

			Some guys I know share a 21ft , around 350hp wakeboarding boat parked on lake Zurich:   
annual costs: 
- insurance Fr.750 
- tax Fr.750 per annum 
- winter storage Fr.2000 (in a facility which is about 50km away). On lake Zurich it will cost double. 
- Annual clean up and service, between Fr. 500 - 1000 which is done by the winter storage facility. Depends what actually needs to be done for that year. 
- Boat parking Fr.800  (not bad after waiting 8 years)   
- Variable cost is petrol. If they spend half a day wakeboarding, maybe around Fr.150.  Remember that boat petrol is always about 10% more expensive than car petrol   
- boat licence will set you back at least Fr.1500 if you have to take around 12 hours of lessons 
- I don't think there is a speed limit on lake Zurich. THere is a limit on lakes on the borders eg. Bodensee, because it is 40km/h in Germany.   
Finally, a boat is not an investment. It is an expense. I am sure you will enjoy the boat, and only you know if it is worth it or not. My friends split it 3 ways so they are quite happy with the costs, plus, you can't wakeboard all by yourself anyway!

			We had ours tested on the way to get our licenses at the optical store just down the hill from the Motor Vehicle Office which is across the street from the airport. It took only a few minutes and they spoke English.  Here's the address of the Migros shopping center:     
Avenue des Bergières 50 
1004 Lausanne   
You can't miss the optical store, it's just outside the entrance to the Migros.

			In Switzerland the car is insured, not a person who can drive it. So as long as you have a valid driving licence then you are able to drive the car. This is the same rule for most of Western Europe!   
If relatives come with a foreign car, it would be up to the insurance policy of that car, whether a third party can drive it or not.

			I can confirm it's one year. When I first came I had to check that with the ""service des automobiles"" in Lausanne. By the way, it was also one year for your driving licence. It was a simple case of swapping my British one for a Swiss one, except they forgot to keep my British one - now a possible museum piece anyway  )

			What Ken said, plus it is standard in most UK insurance policies that if you are a non UK resident the insurance is invalid anyway.   
I also spent a lot of time looking into insurance for over here, and like Ken said you will soon come unstuck if you need to make a claim.   
There is one UK company, underwritten by AXA (can't go to them direct tho) who do issue 12 month green cards for euro cover:    
In the end I got Swiss insurance through a contact at Zurich who could arrange cover for UK plated car over here. 
I would have used the UK company but they would not insure my car for anyone less than 30yrs old on that policy!

			Hi All,   
A quick update to yesterday's post... there were two options of getting the Swiss PPL. 
1. Convert the license 
2. Get a new Swiss license   
I got an answer today:  for option 1 you need to have an ICAO license (e.g UK, USA, Australia would be recognised as such).  You need to be ""current"" (flown recently, up-to-date medical etc.).  Then you can sit the theory exams, show that you are language proficient (this might mean German, French or Italian) - then you get a Swiss license.   
If you are not current (as is my case, I have not flown in the last year and I do not have an up-to-date medical) you are left with eithr going home and become current or doing a new license (minimum 35h with instructor + theory +++).   
Regards, 
Peter

			Get a personal loan - buy car - import it (ouch).   
Maybe you can buy car in Germany with a Swiss lease (by importing it) - but you woulld have to talk to a leasing company to discuss - Bank Now or GE   
Either way - you are making your life more complicated rather than less

			Hallo ,   
 I am a non EU and have applied for a swiss driving liscence. I originally hold a non EU liscence, so I have to apply for a Kontrolfahrt ( Test Drive) before I get a Swiss Driving Liscence.    
I am attending lessons with the driving school in Olten, but I would like to do some more practices at home. Since I have a Learners Permit now, I am not allowed to drive the car alone.    
Could any one help me ( just sit together with me ) for doing some private lessons ? I will be available only morning 6.30- 7.30 or evening 8.00 to 9.00 week days and completely on weekends.   
I have to do my kontrolfahrt by the middle of september . Any one willing to help me ? Please.    
Regards

			Thanks Chris,   
Car has a warranty that's still valid (aftermarket, not the Audi one) from when I bought the car.   
So I should be limited to the price of the service, as I doubt the warranty terms allow for me to get the work done where I please.   
In Lausanne, I am not that far away from some French Audi garages, so I might price check both here and across the border.

Of course, if you don't get your ticket inspected, or can persuade the inspector that what you've done is correct you may get away with it.

			It would help if the OP could clarify when/why (s)he uses the train: to get to work or for leisure? My wife and I have them mainly for leisure, and then the second class is normally just fine and not full at the times that we travel. Occasionally we treat ourselves to a one-day first class upgrade if we're going extra far or on an extra nice train route. However, if we used them for commuting on a very busy route, using first class all of the time might be nicer because of the reduced hassle.

			Can someone let me know what the rules are regarding turning right where there is a cycle lane? I know you are supposed to ride into the cycle lane when turning right but is this the procedure in every instance? for example, if there is a cycle lane coming upto a roundabout, are you supposed to use the cycle lane when turning right at the roundabout?

			to simply answer your question - yes, cabs do take cards (though not all, but the majority - either have a sticker or are part of the larger cab companies like alpha taxi).   
a half hour ride will cost depending on distance and waiting time around 60 - 150 chf.

He was very outraged by the incident because, like you, he couldn't believe that he was not allowed to simply walk through the first class carriage.    
He estimated that he was issued with a ticket within 1 minute of hopping onto the train. He knew he was in first class because it's always the closest carriage to the stairs, and he didn't want to miss the train so he jumped on with the intention of walking through to second class. The train was moving as he started to make his way through to second class, bearing in mind that there were 3 or 4 first class carriages on this train.   
Perhaps it makes a difference whether or not the train is moving at the time you are walking through the first class carriage?   
Regardless, I think the ticket inspector in this instance was a bit harsh. Though, I guess he/she was just doing their job. I suppose anyone can say that they were just ""walking through"".    
To avoid doubt, people should just enter the carriage that corresponds to their ticket.

			First find the person who will take over the lease.   
Next contact the leasing company and arraneg a meeting.   
Then go along with the person who will take over the lease.  Numbers will be crunched.  Paperwork will be signed. Deal will be done.   
Normally you will have to pay something into the pot - but not as much as the normal early exit penalty.

5801	15.07.2010, 11:33	Member	Thanked 53 Times in 19 Posts	Location: Vevey Montreux	"    Kind of yes... firstly you have to ask yourself does the local garage really know how to do a complete/exhaustive service on your car (actually one may question whether an authorised dealer does but that's another story!  ). Answer is it probably depends on the job and type/age of car. For example I guess many local garages do not have the the correct equipment like appropriate computers to read the car's body computer (to see what they has to say) and also wouldn't be able to reset the ""service maintenant"" message.   
Secondly as a potential buyer, would you buy a car that hasn't been serviced by an authorised dealer at regular schedules? Answer is it probably depends on price/age/type of car. If it's a relatively new Audi then probably best at authorised dealer. If it's an 8 year old Opel with a few blanks in the service history but with receipts for work done at local garages then probably it's okay.   
So for a car like yours with 45'000 km on the clock (probably 2.5 years old?), I'd say get it done at an authorised dealer. There's also a book in the glove box with a list of authorised dealers in Europe.

			With all your encouragement and a few pm's I dared put the coolant in myself. Evidently everything is labelled on a Saab engine, unlike in the manual.    
I looked behind me as I drove and said ""oh noooooo"", but it was a seam in the road.    
The car did not overheat, but I will watch that carefully and recheck the fluid once the car cools down.   
Thank you for all your help!

			I too am thinking of trying leasing for the first time later in the year. Does anybody have any idea of a good place to hunt out bargains (low interest rates/special offers on terms etc) on the net?   
I can't seem to find a portal for comparison of current offers. Is it more a case of visiting the showroom and haggling when it comes to leasing?   
What sort of percentage do they want generallz as a deposit in order to give you a strong bargaining position?   
THANKS!!!

			I thought they stiffed you at customs and charged you more anyway, something like 45 instead of 40 CHF. Although the Euro is almost 1:1 with the CHF...    
You may have been caught by this double whammy, on top of the fact that they don't want to muck about with giving out change in Euros, so they collect nice round numbers, like 40 for example.   
Longbyt, if you want to get a cheaper vignette, shop at Denner in December. They usually offer 5 CHF off if you spend over 50 CHF (from memory).

			Great info, guys. I agree, that web site will be a great tool for plotting rides. 
It's nice to have so many options. The choice will be whether to live near the city and ride out, which sounds pretty easy, or live further out and depend on public transportation when I need to come to the city. I'll be in Zurich to meet with the relocation service next week and I think I'll have them show me around the southern end of the lake and out to Pfaffikon (a colleague in London who lived in Zurich for a year also mentioned Pfaffikon). 
I'm looking forward to what sounds like very interesting terrain. Certainly different than the New Orleans flatlands. 
Thanks for the suggestions!

			Indeed, usually you are allowed to import your personal goods up to 18 months after your registration or initial arrival here. Make sure though that you register all your stuff that you want to move on the 18.44 or the associated packing list, this should be quite complete - if you want to import more stuff after you have submitted your list, you'll probably have to haggle with customs to see if they still accept it under the ""normal terms""...   
good luck

			The direct route, through the Gottard, is about 180 km and theoretically only 2 hours. To that you can add between 2 and 4 hours for traffic at this time of year - there's a fixed capacity for the tunnel and tailbacks can be huge.   
Via San Bernardino is about 250 km in distance and about 3 hours for straight drive time - but you'll be unlucky to have any serious traffic problems on that route.   
Same problem when coming back from South to North.   
As previously noted, the only times when the Gottard tunnel is clear at this time of year are late evening until early morning.   
The pass is a beautiful route too - as long as you don;t get stuck in the traffic on the motorway before you get to the exit. tailbacks are many kilometres long....

			Zurich is awash with scooters once it stops raining and the sun is out. At the same time the police appear and ticket each one that weaves through traffic - and/or overtakes using the tram lanes.    
You'd have to get it transported down - which isn't likely to be too cheap - so it may be better to buy one here.   
Either way - well done for surviving the year!

Under no circumstances turn into a corner on the brakes - you won't know where it goes - what camber or gradient change you have - and also whether someone is bouncing across the track in front of you.   
I have seen way too many crashes at the Ring - probably more than I have seen when racing. However I agree with Rich, if you do go - pick a weekday evening - and take it easy. It isn't the same as the Playstation

			If you move to another canton, you have to collect the new plates at the ""Strassenverkehrsamt"" within 14 days of the move (or you will be fined).   
That's only if you have a car. If your Swiss license is credit card format it is good forever and you won't need to do anything.

			I would strongly advise you to do some lessons in Germany - a set part of the course is 2 hours at night, two hours autobahn and two hours country roads - do those and you more or less have it. It won't prepare you for Italy and the Germans do have too many traffic signs but they can drive - the Swiss can't. And its going to be cheaper.The other alternative is to do the theory exam - You need a set ammount of theory classes to do it in Germany but I rather doubt the Swiss have that regulation so you could do that here. I think the theory exam can be taken in English.

			Semi-related question... has anyone taken a cat from San Francisco to Zurich?  My cat has never flown before, and it's a long trip, so I'm a bit worried about this.   
The airlines I've found that take cabin pets on this route are Lufthansa, Northwest, Swiss, and United.  (Does anyone know of others?)   
I'm wondering if it's better to fly SFO to Munich (11 hours + short flight to ZRH) or to make a stop in the US to break up the trip more evenly.   
If I give my cat acepromazine, is he likely to be able to sleep for most of that 11 hour flight?  That would be ideal.   
Any experiences would be appreciated.

			Booster seats also help reduce car sickness because they raise kids up high enough to see better out the windows.  This helps their brains make sense of the motion they are feeling which in turn reduces car sickness.  Quite helpful with all the twisty turny mountain roads around here.

In South Africa we always have an indication on the road or a sign if you need to stop or yield at an intersection.  But in this case you could think you are on the main road (since it is bigger than the intersecting roads, and you are going straight, not turning) but you have to yield to the right.  That is strange if you are not used to it.  In short, in an intersection when the road from the right does not have a stop line or these triangles indicating they have to yield, you have to wait for cars from the right.     
I suppose the more official way to know whether to yield or not is to see all 'Main Road' (yellow and black sqaure on its side) and 'no longer Main Road' signs and know when you are the Main Road or not.  But since you can miss them, I looked at the road markings of intersecting roads.   
Good luck.

You can try parking in Utoquai, Globus, the carpark near Central tram stop and the likes (I think one of them is 24 hours, I cant remember which) if you want something really central but I personally will take the train.

You mean converting from DOT to E-code?  Again, EF offers no solid answer on this.  I do have (had?) an e-mail from a Vaud SAN employee (in poor English) which suggests that DOT headlamps are OK for a vehicle that's been imported as part of one's personal effects.      In my case, Swiss customs cared about absolutely nothing except for the paperwork.  I have non-EU lighting, non-ECE approved tires, illegal window tint, a non ECE trailer hitch, and a rear suspension that's been modified with a component that does not have Swiss homologation.  I've been driving it for six months.  Nobody has cared.  I've even done multiple border crossings.  I show the border people my paperwork and they are happy.      Anything inside the car would be treated just like the rest of your personal effects.  The same rules would apply.  It all goes onto form 18.44.

			Hi, I just took my Subaru Outback to Austria to get serviced. It needed full servive in addition to replacing rear brake pads and discs. the bill was a whopping 750. My guess is that I would have paid a little higher in Switzerland, but not much. My take out - next time I will save myself the hassle and get the car services in Zurich. I used a Subaru garage in Wallisellen for some earlier work and was pleased. I will use him again in the future.

Unfortunately, I think you will find that most people who are killed aren't involved in accidents where the speed limit is being violated.  Speed is just an all too easy target and much easier to quantify than good driving or safe practices on the roadways.   
And yeah, I had a cousin killed by a drunk driver and another family member killed a person who was riding out of a blind side alley.  In the first the driver was a repeat offender and had a long history of abuse of alcohol and the system.  In the second there was nothing that could have been done and the driver was not exceeding the posted limit and conditions were optimum.  Two people are still dead.   
BTW, did your dumb ass go to jail?  Or did s/he go free like the drunken louse that killed my cousin?   
To the OP, you could always bring a thousand francs with you when you fly back into switzerland next time just in case you need to pay that other fine.    "	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: Jun 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Caught Speeding way above limit.	krisb	Posts: 11

			About time I thank the guy (as I'm about to move to Oz): 
(Kevin, sorry for the advertising delay and thanks again for a great service)   
So to conclude the story, back in November I used the services of Kevin Oaten (Moveurstuff.co.uk) to move just under 2 cubic meters from Edinburgh to Lausanne (door to door, and up the stairs).   
Advertised in this thread: I strongly recommend for the  , their  , their   and their  . 
I only met him once in Switzerland at delivery time, everything was dealt with beforehand on the phone and by email (I wasn't present at collection time). It went so smoothly I would use them again anytime! (UK to CH, CH to CH)        Don't forget to give him a detailed list of your boxed belongings for the Swiss customs, stating the estimated price of the items. I estimated everything I own for CHF 1700 (because most things were purchased before the year of the move) and I didn't have to pay any import tax. Also if like me you'll be waiting for your stuff in Switzerland without a permit yet, make sure you give him a copy of your ""Attestation d'établissement"" produced by your local ""Contrôle des Habitants"". 
(I didn't know at the time and they were stopped at the border for couple of hours - everything was sent to the customs by email)     
I hope this helps, 
Sebastien

			If you have a GPS, get on to Trapster.com and download the data for Switzerland (it's very easy to do). Not only are fixed cameras shown, but also police radar hiding places. I have not got a ticket since installing this product (yes I know there are sneaky mobile cameras in cars etc., but they are very rare), and driving in Switzerland has become a pleasure again, rather than a Sword of Damocles experience when driving in an unknown area. 
Before the 'but   about the  ' brigade start wailing, I am not a dangerous, fast driver, just someone who is sick of the persecution that the Swiss police inflict on drivers who are not maniacs, or intentionally out to break the law, just perhaps a bit slow to hit the brake after revving to crest a steep hill (just over the brow of a hill is a favorite place to put a camera), or a bit heavy on the loud pedal when trying to join a motorway (yep, cameras on motorway slip-roads.... sheer genius, and bound to save the lives of adrenaline junky kids who enjoy the thrill of playing there), or a bit slow to catch the car as gravity adds its push to the engine on the way down a hill.    
Cheers

could be barings or worn brakes, easy to check if you know which wheel its coming from, jack the car up, hold the wheel and see if you can wobble it side to side (careful not to pull the car off the jack!!) if the baring has gone you'll be able to move the wheel ever so slightly.   
for the brakes, take the wheel off, get a torch and see how much of the pads are left, then feel the brake disc, is there a noticable lip on it? the pads should have at least a couple of mm left on them.   
If in doubt get a garage to look at it!! someone like euromaster will be able to check how much life is in your brakes, should do it for free to.

			If you are flying back then take it on the plane with you. The cost will vary depending on the airline but it's not too bad normally. the other option is post but I think that will be really expensive

			Yes, I use the Kandersteg-Goppenstein train pretty often (we have a chalet in the Loetschental). 25 CHF per car in each direction; takes about 15 minutes through the tunnel. It does get busy at peak times, so around the school holidays (e.g. friday evenings!) the queues can go all the way back to Frutigen. But they are very good at putting on extra trains during busy times. Should save you a lot of time.

			In December I swapped out 1 car for 2 at a local BMW dealer. This enabled me to keep a certain level of practicality that the Volvo had offered - but also get a car that would put a smile of the face if the sun ever comes out.   
Today I fielded a call from their customer care wondering if I considered upgrading from that to the new 35iS. Considering mine is one of only 370 of its type - and that I rather like it - I told them it would be a good 3 years until I even thought about changing.   
On the flipside, I have the habit of only keeping cars for a shortwhile - so they were perhaps trying to get lucky - OR they have someone looking for my car.

			Would anybody be able to tell me the difference between the various day cards on offer. 
1. SBB 9 AM day pass --- Cost 54CHF 
2. Tageskarte Gemenide --- Cost depends on the gemenide 
3. Kiosk in Paradeplatz (Zürich) --- Costs 42CHF (I think)   
Do all these offer the usage of the same facilities (inkl. aerial cars, gondolas, mountain railways etc) 
Or do these cards provide discounts for the above mentioned transports. 
Will these discounts be available with the half fare too?   
For eg., could i use this for the Golden Round Trip (Pilatus).   
Buying a card from where would be beneficial?

			Chris yes this is normal, happened to our UK licenses too.  There was going to be a slightly more restrictive swiss license issued, could have been minibuses excluded (can't remember exactly now), without a more extensive medical than standard. We paid for this extra so that the licenses are equivalent and it should be able to swap back if we return.  Hope this helps.

			Errr. Yes do a search about importing a car. It's not as easier as getting a licence! If it's an exact make/model of a car sold here then it'll be easier. Be prepared for having a car test (MFK) with a clean car (including engine bay) and maybe certificate of conformity then emissions test (abgas) and Swiss insurance. I'm not sure about the order. Start your journey at the Strassenvekrsamt. North American and RHD cars need headlight modifications at least.

			As for the liscense, it depends on how big the trailer is.  For a really small one, no; for a larger one, you may need something extra in your driver's liscense.  Sorry, I forgot what the cut off is.   
We have a trailer, owned, separate grey card for this but irrelevant if renting.  The more important thing is the hitch on the car in my opinion.  Does your car have one?  There was a lot of pain and paperwork to get the hitch installed on the car, your grey card needs to be amended for this, and it states how much you are allowed to tow (legal limit of weight), etc.

			Here's what I did.   
I bought the car from a seller on autoscout.   
After agreeing the price, we met  at the Strassenverkehrsamt to do the exchange.   
I got an insurance broker I know to arrange the insurance and he sent the details to the Strassenverkehrsamt.   
I gave the seller the cash and we registered the car in my name.

At the moment the volcano is quiet, when you travel, who knows. As Slim said, it could erupt and affect areas south of it even more than on Iceland itself.   
If you are wishing to be really secure, Switzerland and south has been a good bet.   
Check with the agent you have bought the ticket from and see what protection they offer if the volcano does pop. Better to hear it from them than us speculating.

			If you're going to be relying on public transport a lot then you could consider a GA (General Abonnement) which means you get free travel on the trains and also public transport in most cities in Switzerland. If one of you buys it then the other one gets it cheaper (the duo option) but you have to prove you live together, so maybe once you've settled, if you think it'll be worth it. Mind you we forgot our documentation once and the man at the station accepted our wedding rings as proof.        
Edit: When I say free... I mean obviously you pay for the GA, but you get what I mean.

Not speaking the tester's language is not considered ""wrong"" enough to fail.   
I know some French terminology as I was instructed in it during the lessons I took, but I was having help from the other students during the practical exam.   
Not really a problem if you know what you are doing and are confident.  I think that most people fail because they are afraid they don't know what they are doing and that causes them to make mistakes due to lack of confidence.

			The way it worked for me is that we ended up with 2 18.44, as the form can be used for follow-on separate shipments. So we filled out the main one and then a subsidiary one for the car that we gave to the car importer in CH. End of story.    
THis is used when you ship in several batches or like in that case, separate types of goods.

The will simply hook it up to an emissions test machine to make sure it is within a certain tolerance.  That tolerance would be met by almost any newish car.  They will not be able to detect (nor will they even try) that you have modified the computer.  Just don't show up to the inspection wearing some flame resistant race suit. :P

			Hi,   
We want to buy a smaller LH drive car. 
Our trusty Volvo estate needs to go to a good home either here or go back to the UK. 
It is all registered , pass tests, etc here in CH.  
Volvo garage service history, good condition, will carry anything! 7 seats, roof rails etc etc. Has a set of UK headlights and a tow bar (not currently attached) 
Going to best offer...will consider anything over 800.-CHF !   
Anyone interested??

			I'm not sure it's necessarily such a good idea to block this service. In terms of privacy and no fines in the Ausland this seems great, but having your number listed has some positive sides to it as well. If you park your vehicle incorrectly, the registry provides the option of someone simply calling you and giving you an earful instead of expensively towing and ticketing your car.    
Once when I was sure I was parked correctly, I got a personal visit at home from a security guard telling me to park somewhere else. I was a little creeped out by the visit, but very pleased to have no parking fine!

			hi...   
ebc: a few months back, i got ebc sport discs and greenstuff brakes from their swiss dealer, Graber Sport Garage,   . I tried to bargain hard (due to double the price in ch), requests going over the real ebc support, and got myself 25% discount. well, i wouldn't say they are the best brakes, but i guess, you might be paying a close amount of money for original pads of your car brand.        might be somewhere to check, too. they've got the ferodo ds, which got some nice reviews in some forums.

			Hopefully I can benefit from the experience of others here, or at least from their ability to read German.   
Here's the situation:   
I would like to buy a car in the UK, but I no longer have a UK address at which to register it.  My intention is to buy the car from a dealer, collect it, and drive it back to Switzerland, where I will register it immediately.   
By way of background, the vehicle is a left-hand drive, post-1998 model with a EU certificate of conformity, and I know what modifications need to be made to get it through the Swiss MFK.  As I understand it, the vehicle will not need emission / noise testing with the EU CoC, except for the normal Abgas testing to confirm that what's coming out of the exhaust matches the limits specified by the CoC.   
My question is about buying the car and driving it back:   
Can I use daily plates to get the vehicle home from the UK?       
I'm not clear whether these plates are valid ONLY WITHIN SWITZERLAND or whether they're valid for driving in the UK and France as well (as I'd need to cross both to bring the car home).   
Alternatively, can I get   for a used vehicle in order to drive from the UK to Switzerland, or are these only available for new cars?

			Hi All,   
I live in the Vevey/Montreux area and need recommendation on a Car Mechanic/Garage.   
My UK Ford Focus has a leak and the power steering has gone. I know of a Ford Dealership in Vevey who can repair but dealerships often cost an arm & leg .     
Can anybody recommend a car garage who can do repairs in and around the vevey/montreux even towards the luttry area ?   
Thanks

			You might not get a full refund. You get a discount for a year pass, paying something like the cost of 9m travel (sbb passes this is). If you cancel it after 9m you get nothing back, if you cancel it before they will effectively charge you as if you had simply get monthly passes.

			Here is what the helpful book called ""Living and Working in Switzerland"" by David Hampshire ( ) has to say about this:   
""When you enter Switzerland to take up residence, household or personal effects that you have used for at least six months can be imported without paying duty or VAT. A complete list of the items being imported must be provided at the time of customs clearance, together with a request for duty-free import (a form is provided). VAT (7.6%) must be paid on any articles you have used for less than six months. Itemised invoices should be provided.""   
So, just riding them around the block won't get you around this officially. However, in practice we had a list of the main things that we were bringing into the country, and although the customs guy asked a few questions when we picked the stuff up from the shipping agent at the airport (4 bikes, a computer, and some other electronic stuff), he certainly didn't want to look inside any of the boxes or ask how old any of the items were, or to see invoices (which we didn't even have, and I don't think most people would).    
So, I would just just ignore this 6-month rule and not expect to pay any tax since you are moving here with them. Report the true value, and if it does come down to them saying that they are brand new, tell them that you bought them at the end of last year but haven't used them because it's been winter. However, I doubt that they are going to be very interested in the exact details of the personal belongings that you're bringing with you.

If you haven't switched yet, bring in all the documentation and you can avoid the probationary license.   
By expired, I mean that there is some form of limitation on the license.  Swiss licenses don't expire, so they assume other licenses don't either.

			i have had some experience trying to get mine done properly but have failed to find someone who ""knows"" what they are doing.... eg any idiot can turn a bolt here and there until the computer says yes thats ok.... bu finding someone who knows what to do if you have a problem with the factory settings is nearly impossible here.   
eg on standard setings the inside of the front tyres wear down  i have revised setting but all i get is its different from the computer.   
dont worry about it being 4WD loads of cars here are and its nothing special here.   
whatever you do dont use a place that uses the measurement equipment that comes in on tracks. they are not accurate.   
find somewhere were the frames are clamped onto the rim.   
i went to pneu egger once - never again, totally useless, the car wouldnt drive in a straight line - they tried to blame me saying i had hit a pot hole.   
also for anone in basel avoid the alignment place thats just behind ikea in prattlen.....     this bunch of jokers..... they claimed the adjuster was worn on my car and couldnt do it but actually they had loosened the adjustor so much it was riding over the stop and had worn the stop edge down as they repeatedly tried to turn the adjuster, they got it right in the end but when i looked under the car a few weeks later they had taken the anduster out and just clamped the whole lot together!!!!!

			Unless the Schaffhausen gig is some kind of dream job for you, I wouldn't do it with a 2-year old kid in tow. The little one in Zurich, while you're both an hour away, every day of the week, sounds risky and complicated. The other option of one of you having a probably 2-hour commute each way every day, sounds onerous and exhausting.   
I'd look for a job closer to Basel if I were you. But I'm not, so just my 2 cents.    
Good luck!

So, I brought my car with personal effects on June 08, 2010, and I already had the first Prufung, but since my car has after stock parts I am dealing with that now.   
My question for this post is: Can I still drive my car outside Switzerland? Winterthur still sends me insurance invoices, and my car runs fine, but still has Canadian plates.   
Can I just try to extend my next inspection for a month or more since I have a friend here and we're supposed to do a road trip and we can't wait for the second Prufung.   
thanks!

			Hi,   
It was a fairly painless process. We moved our total household goods as this was a fairly permanent move - so we used a removal company who handled the customs clearance for us - but we had to fill out the list of all our goods and value them. We imported the vehicles the moment we crossed the border therefore. We did have to post a deposit then because we didn't have a certificate from the local comune stating that we were residents (we did have letter stating that our request for residence was approved and our permis would be issued shortly but the guy on duty was following the rules in great detail that day). Fortunately I'd had a premonition and drawn out a couple of thousand francs in cash that morning - I didn't have the full amount he originally requested but after a bit of pleading he accepted a lower bond and let us in.   
Once I'd got the vehicles insured it was a case of going to the Service des Automobiles et de la Navigation in Lausanne. The insurers had given me a form to fill out requesting the allocation of a new number plate but when I got to Lausanne they told me I also needed to fill out another form giving the technical details of the vehicles. The guy on duty was very helpful and suggested that I get the forms filled by the local dealer - but in the end I managed to get all the data necessary from the (Italian) registration documents and vehicle handbooks, it was all fairly simple stuff. I think they also took copies of the original registration documents when I presented the forms and requested my new plates but I don't remember for sure now. I am pretty sure they cross checked what I'd put in the form with the registration documents. Once they were happy that the forms were all in order they accepted the request and I got an invitation for the expertise appointments in the post a few days later.   
As long as your vehicle is a model on sale already in the EU you shouldn't have any big problems. Switzerland is part of EFTA so ought to accept any vehicle already homologated in Europe. I was arriving from Italy so all three vehicles had European registration documents - I don't know if that is going to be more difficult in coming from Japan, I'd suggest contacting the Ducati importer in Switzerland and I'd certainly talk to whatever is the cantonal authority for vehicle licensing, they handle stacks of these requests every day and, from my experience the people were very professional and helpful, even suggesting the best way to prepare the vehicles for their expertise and explaining how the whole process worked.

I have not looked into any specifice schemes in Switzerland - and whether they would give you discounts. In the UK you can do an Advance Driving Test.   
It all depends on what you want to achieve. Better driving on the road is often more a case of better observation, anticipation, driving position and location of your hands on the steering wheel.   
A full day of driving at a track - including a full day with a tutor - could easily cost more than 2000CHF - excluding tyres, brake pads etc

			I did my (full) driving test here in Switzerland, and given the headache that is I'd strongly advise you to get the conversion test drive right first time so you don't need to go through all that - it's not only incredibly expensive but it's a lot of work too with theory, practical, training courses, lessons, more courses after you passed and even then you only get a 3 year license to start with!   
I'd recommend getting at least a couple of lessons with an instructor (there are loads of English speaking ones) to point out the things that catch people out - and to tell you what the examiner is looking for - like the rules about trams and giving way to the right, how to behave with cyclists (they're big on that around here).

			Hi, 
 Check out   , I used them couple of times and was satisfied. 
 They are a broker of big companies (Europcar, Avis etc), but due to the business model they can offer lower prices for the same service.

			I am driving 920km from Cherbourg to Bern (CH) next month and hoping some of the good people here can provide me with some advice on the best route to take.   
I can share the driving with my wife if needs be but I will have a 2 year old and a 7 month old in the back seats so, we will need to do a stopover for a night - maybe two if its somewhere we don't want to rush out of.   
I've come up with the following :     (922 km) 
Autoroute A6  - Cherbourg - Paris - Auxerre - Beaune - entering CH around Orbe. No stop-over options yet.     (1,079 km)  
Autoroute A4 - Cherbourg - Paris - Reims - Strasbourg - Mulhouse - Basel. No stop-over options yet.     (1100km) 
Direction A28 autoroute  - Cherbourg - Le Mans - ** - Beaune - entering CH around Orbe.  
** Not exactly sure how I would get from Le Mans to Beaune/Dijon - doesn't seem to be a motorway (from what I can make out).  
Maybe Le Mans - Tours - Orléans - Auxerre - Beaune   
Some friends recommended to stop at a park they have used south of Tours. Hence, the detour south but avoiding Paris. (Not that I am overly bothered about this)   
--- 
As an aside, I have a GPS, Google Maps etc but think I'll buy a good old map with France and CH as a back-up. Does anybody recommend one in particular?   
--- 
Anyhow folks, that's just my initial thoughts. Any opinions much appreciated ....      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Cherbourg to Bern Route with Stopover	moon2	Posts: 2

			Hey, I rented a van from Europcar the other day. I also have the halb tax and UBS CC. I think you get 20% discount with both, nevertheless I think you can only use one per time. However, you might want to check if they give a discount regarding your workplace! I would have paid 208 including all insurance with the CC or halb tax, instead I got it for 152! All I had to show was my company ID card :0) Always worth asking!

			What richardm & vwild said.   
IMO, you'll be stuck with a 5 year old pig in a poke, that may cost a fortune to ship and make legal here (if it even has type approval), that should any major repairs or accident damage need fixing will cost a fortune and an age to fix as they will not have the parts here.   
Maybe not what you want to hear but sell it, and get something decent here. For a 5 year old Honda it isn't worth the hassle

			Hi All,   
A good friend is moving to London in September to start his PhD and we have had the idea to bike there from Switzerland.  Instead of riding my own bike, I thought I would inquire here to see if someone is in need of getting a bike from Switzerland to London.  I am not sure exactly when we will make the trip but it would be sometime in late August or early September.  I live in Zurich but would be willing to pick it up in a nearby city.  Please send me a PM if you're interested and we can discuss the details!   
Cheers, 
Chris

			It all depends on whether you want to get the drive done - or whether you consider it part of the holiday.   
We tend to just go for it on long journeys - we did Madrid to Chur in a day last year - 1800km in 16 hours (including stops) - it was brutal - 5 shifts of 3 hours between the 2 of us - yet the journey never felt that bad.   
I would say the Bergerac trip would take 9.5 hours - including short breaks (15mins every 2.5hrs). With children - it might be a very painful trip if you do it in a day.   
Psycologically there is a big difference spending 8 or 11 hours travelling - so think carefully about how long you stop - a 2 hour lunch might be nice - but you may end up regretting it later in the day.

			To the OP: sorry to hear about this.  All very reasonable actions on your part.  Funny how some people's egos/aggressions really seem to take off when driving. It is interesting to hear people saying that you should lock your car whilst driving.  I would have thought this could be dangerous in the event of an accident.  I wonder what police AA advice would be on this one.

But many taxi driver at the airport are rude and unwelcome people who give more work. I gues you would have to ad 20-30.- for lugage to the normal fare. 
There also used to be a bus taxi for around 15 people which goes every 30min to Zürich City. This cost is around the same as an taxi but it is cheaper if other people drive with. 
But again those taxi driver are rude, unfriendly and many of them don`t speak well english or german and some drive longer ways than required. 
Depending where you want to get and to and what time, i would take the train because in the rush hour you might end up in the trafic jam which could take 1-2 hour longer than usual.  
between 6.30-8.30 and from 16.00-19.30 it is bad and on fridays from 15.00

The 1609 train goes direct to Locarno, for example, and is usually not *that* crowded.....the 1701 and 1709 trains are more packed.   
You can get on the trains 10-15 minutes before they leave.  That will help you.   
If you have to change in Arth Goldau then you may have a fight for seats.  You will always be better changing at Bellinzona in my opinion - the Zurich-Locarno train stops too often for my liking.

			Hi, 
I imported my car (2 years old) from Italy last December and made everything in Switzerland. Overall I paid around 500 CHF, including road taxes. i was a little bit scared as everyone was saying that it would have costed minimum 3000 CHF and was probably better to sell and buy a Swiss one. However I decided to try and everything went smoothly. The only extra thing I had to pay was an engine cleaning which costed 100 CHF. I did not understand what it was about, but once at the control station I spotted all the shiny clean engines and I understood. You are 100% sure to fail the test if you do not have one! The Abgastest, i.e. emission controll costed me 50 CHF plus around 30 CHF for the documentation that had to be made for the first time. You have to go to a garage that services exactly the same brand you have in order to get the documentation. Once you have it you can do the emission control test wherever you like. I know of garages that do it over the border in Germany and France and are a lot cheaper. Good luck and PM me in case you need advice,

			Sorry to be the bearer of more bad news but, if he's moved here, when he reaches 18 and applies for a Swiss licence (must be done within one year of arrival so don't forget otherwise he will have to take the full test again),   if he passed the test in the UK after 1st December 2005 and less than one year before his entry into Switzerland. He will get a provisional licence ""permit de conduire à l'essai"", even though he has an unconditional English licence.    
This provisional licence subjects him to a  of a one year probationary period during which he must maintain a clean record - not commit an offence which results in his licence being suspended. Also during that year he must attend a two day road safety course at an approved centre with a group of other kids. This course involves road safety videos, practical training on the skid pan and driving on the roads for an hour with an examiner plus a couple of peers from the group. To do these practical test you will have to supply your own car or rent one from the centre. After the one hour driving exercise, the examiner and the peers will then comment on the standard of his driving. There's no test to take but it is an inconvenience and it's not cheap to do this course. And the course is not available in English as far as I know. There are only a limited number of centres  providing this course so make sure you book early. The centre nearest to Bex is in St-Maurice:     
At the end of that probationary year, but not before, as long as he hasn't had his licence suspended and he has completed the course, he can exchange the provisional licence for a full Swiss licence.    
If you have any question you can contact the Service des Automobiles in Aigle which is next door to the big Migros in the Industrial district on the other side of the motorway.

			We were set to buy one! After many test drives of the different motor packages, my wife and I weren't happy with the deal AMAG was giving us. We then turned to the Subaru Legacy, they were willing to make us a better deal but the car would take 4 months plus before delivery!    
We were feeling down because we wanted to replace our Audi while it still had value. I wondered into the Skoda dealer and was BLOWN AWAY!

			They must be getting much more lenient.   
I just got my new permit demand in with a copy of my L . normally not possible but he said it should be fine. I got new plates with a copy of the permit request...normally you need an attestation signed stamped watermarked etc. so they are getting much more lenient i guess in these matters. Maybe because they have been losing some of the originals?

			Hello,   
Can anyone recommend a good driving school in Zurich to take the Grundkurs for the A permit ... just got my A learning permit    
I would like to take the Grundkurs with someone who speaks either Italian, Spanish or English and hopefully has a HD similar to the Fat Bob I am planning to get ...   
Many thanks in advance, 
Best regards,

a) Buying second hand is not only a big risk but also a compromise ... you don't get exactly what you wanted in the first place. This is a bummer at least for me ... maybe you save 5K but at the end you paid say 15K for something you don't completely like ... so you wasted 15K    
b) all the hassle to coordinate everything ... at the end it seems that the effective saving potential is around 5K ... not that much considering the risks and hassle.   
c) if you search for Fat Bob second hand you wont find almost any e.g. motoscout24 has two listings only and the prices are on the same region as of buying a brand new Fat Bob 2010 ... makes no sense.   
d) And finally how about the day you get your new toy totally unspoiled and ready for you exactly as you wanted it hehe ... the smell to brand newwy bellezzaaaaa!   
AFAIK there were produced around of 1500 Fat Bob CVO worldwide only ... so it is like buying a jewel   also looking at the second hand prices it is really so ...   
Thank you for your hints ... I do not feel so bad anymore buying it in CH.   
Cheers,

If there is any major difference in value in the swap, we can agree some cash settlement.

			Ssangyong make, or used to make Mercedes Commercials. The technology in them is out dated Mercedes Benz.   
As for performance, they're reasonably fuel efficient for a 4X4, go reasonably well, reasonably well fitted out and reasonable off road.    
As you may have guessed, they're a ""reasonable"" car. You'll get trouble free motoring for a few years at a really good 'buy in' price but the resale value will be hideous, they're worth nothing second hand.

However, you can pick up used ones for reasonable prices (i  got a nice city bike there refurbished for < 300 CHF) at the monthly Velobörsen (  or search for EF threads).    
My personal experience was that I waited ~5 months and then shipped over a road bike. I did save some cash and like my bike, but I also missed most of a riding season. Whether it is worth it really depends how nice of a bike you are bringing and how much you value being able to ride.   
Getting the bike through the airport was no problem though - as it was personal belongings owned for > 6 months.

			Point to point - Same ticket for both ways and if I'm wrong, but you've got the right ticket in all other respects, I'll pay the Fr.80.- it will cost you if you are caught on the train without a valid ticket. How's that for an offer?    
(Perhaps I'll change my mind when I actually wake up). The info is correct though - including the Fr.80.- That is really what it costs. Hope you get on OK.   
If you ever buy a SBB '6 journey card' which you have to put into the machine and stamp with the date each time, it is also valid in both directions. 
The first question someone else will have to help you with.

			I am actually coming to Basel rather than leaving, but I wasn't sure where else to post...   
Does anyone have any advice on shipping belongings to Switzerland, Basel in particular. Or can you recommend any good logistics companies to help with the move.   
We are shipping a relatively small amount from Istanbul- clothes, books, nick-nacks etc so were recommended Air freight, but the 2,600 Euros we were quoted seems expensive. However we don't have enough stuff to fill a container so that was even more expensive.   
We are also shipping some furniture from the US, which will be a larger job probably by sea.   
If anyone has any advice or recommendations it would be much appreciated.    
Thanks.

			Tanya   
Start looking on autoscout.ch - it is arguably the best site for looking for cars.   
You will find some very cheap cars - but they will almost certainly be without an MFK - the Swiss MOT/Roadworthiness check. It generally pretty thorough and tends to pick up on more points than a UK MOT.

			I've done the T1 to T4/T5 connection a lot around the time you're suggesting  to catch overnight flights to Asia. Late evening's not the busiest time at Heathrow to use the ""Flight Connections"" route between Terminals - morning is the busiest when overnight incoming flights from Asia and North America all arrive one after the other. Then the flight connections channel gets choked. Most of the transatlantic traffic is gone by 7pm and that cuts passengers down a lot.    
For evening departures I usually allow 2 hours connection time and in 15 years I've never missed a flight - although once or twice it's been by the skin of my teeth. But I always arrange carriers so I can check through to final destination so I don't need to to check in or check bags on arrival at Heathrow.    
Obviously the great unknown would be a big delay on your incoming Heathrow bound flight - a delay of an hour would put you at risk of missing your onward flight if you only allowed a 2 hour connection time, although that's happened to me and I've still made the connection.    
I'm sure there are horror stories where folks arrived in Heathrow on time and 2 hours wasn't enough but they are are the rare exceptions rather than the rule, especially in the evening.    
If you and your bags are not checked through to final destination in Zurich that means you will have to get off the plane, follow arrivals and walk to baggage collection, wait for your collect your bags in T1, exit T1, walk to the train and take the train to T5, then check in again and clear security. That could easily add 60 to 90 minutes to your connection time, even when things are running smoothly and you will have to factor in the time the check-in closes so you arrive before that.

			In my experience - I have bought to excellent quality cars (for practical purposes) in Switzerland.   
A 1994 Merc E280 Estate - which was extremely comfortable, enough toys and capable of dealing with everything I threw at it.   
A 1989 BMW 525 - which in just over 12mths has covered 20,000km - without a problem - including 9000km on a 5 week round trip to Morocco.   
If you don't want to throw a lot of cash at a car - dig around for an older Merc or BMW - get one from a small local garage that you trust - and get it with a fresh MFK and you should be all right.    
2 that I would recommend - in Graubunden though are - Pennella (Ringstrasse Chur); and FunfDorfer, Zizers.

			I drove a UK reg BMW for a full year (insured by Stuart Collins). Driving an RH here is not that big of a deal (but then I drive an American-import LH in the UK). After vacillating for a while, I am in the processes of getting CH plates. You can only use your UK plates for a year from the time on your permit - CH authorities at the toll borders will take the view that you are now resident here (I know it from experience!). However, you are allowed two years to import the car. If you want to hold on to the car here for more than a year of course you need to get CH plates, it is becoming less of a hassle.  In any case, you might want to contact BMW in the UK ( ) to get a ""Certificate of Conformity"" that eases the process of importing down the road - they are pretty quick with sending you a copy in the post.

			In Canada, when one takes their license for bikes, we are supposed to understand that a bike has the same rights and laws as a car. Would you do all the passing you do on a bike in a car? probably not, but we do it anyway. I have had my bike license for 20 some years and have to say here in Switzerland is one of the safest places I have ridden (maybe that says a lot about Canadian respect for bikes (or lack of)...). 
Filtering inside the white line depends on the person in front of you letting you pass or not, outside the white line depends on oncoming traffic (or not), as I have seen more illegal wrong side passes than staying on the right side.  
Just feel out the traffic and if they don't let you pass, buy a bike with a big enough engine to do it quickly...   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2009	Groaned at 312 Times in 251 Posts	Swiss Drivers attitudes to motorbikes WTF!	bigblue2	Posts: 6,249

In short, Swiss car insurance is generally   comprehensive. I discovered that my free VW recovery policy even included a local VW dealer coming out and opening the car when I locked the keys in. That said this is Switzerland when clocking up huge bills if you don't ask is often the order of the day. So I would get that policy translated PDQ...

			Hello!   
Still investigating possible locations when moving to Geneva region in September with family. Could anyone using TAC line 1 or TER 113 (Evian-Geneve) give me some feedback on their commuting experience ( + is it suitable for a 15 year-old on his own? For example on the ter timetable, it looks like you need to change in Annemasse, is it straightforward?), which areas are served by these 2 lines and yet offer an enjoyable environment for a family?    
Thank you for any advice.

			Was thinking about it but couldn't decide as last year it was a lovely hot day. As I was riding (followed by a Policeman I may add) along between Illnau and Dubendorf, I kept losing concentration when I passed all the spectators casually sipping ice-cold fresh beers! After about 1/3 of the route, I went home and ditched the bike in favour of a pair of shorts, sunglasses and several ice cold beers served at one of the many 'pit-stop' bars. Not to mention it's so slow that I was cooking the engine on my R1 all teh time. (Most the fan has ever run in one ride)   
This year, I will only be entering as a 'spectator'  I also heard that the weather could be poop.

			Dear Hollisterb,    
I only know this because my 14yr old is   in the process of applying for permission to ride a mofa (or Töffli as they are called in this neck of the woods!). You need to apply for the category M (Mofa) license.   
First, you have to go to your local Police Station and ask for a form(for Gesuch um Erteilung eines Lernfahr- bzw. eines Führerausweises der Kategorie  ),sorry that's really what is says on the top of the form! You could try just asking for a form for a Führeausweis, that might be easier!   
Then you have to carry out all it's requirements, including getting an eye-test and asking the Optician to sign the form. Then you should get a Theory (Fahrschule Prüfungsfragen) package (Book and/or CD software), & learn until you feel ready. Then when you're ready you take the form back to the Police and they will arrange an appointment for the Theory test with you. There is no practical test.   
We haven't got as far as this yet, but I assume that once you have passed you will receive some sort of license/permission to drive the mofa.    
Best of luck!   
Angela

			I have a couple of co-workers who drive around in Smart cars with advertising on them. One is for Re/Max (he knows the real estate agency) and the other a fitness club (he's a member of said club). The cars were bought by my co-workers and a deal was worked out where they have the advertising applied, are paid a monthly fee (maybe around 200.-chf?) and at the end of the contract (2 years) the adverts will be removed from the cars at the advertisers expense. 
It's actually a ""Smart"" way to pay for the gasoline (pun intended   ).

			Ugh, sorry it was so expensive for you!    
That nearly happened to me last year. I had parked the car in the only area not cleared for roadworks on my street - but I couldn't see it from my apartment. I didn't look for a few days and didn't go that way - and the morning I was heading out to actually use the car there was a guy standing there dialling the phone to get it towed. Lucky and narrow escape for me...and it taught me to check the street and car every day where it was parked.

Leasing wise, all the big garages do it. Just decide on the make and model, call them up and make an appointment. Ours was a painless process (all the documents needed werent too much of a hassle) but then again, we have been here longer than a week.

At the time the OP is suggesting leaving Basel (18;00), there will be no hold ups on the Brussels ring whatsoever. I took Evilshell back to the UK the other week going this way, and even hitting the Bussels Ring at 19.30 on a Friday evening only added an extra 10 minutes to the journey. Yes at peak hours it can add what seems like an age to the journey, but in reality never more than 30 minutes unless there has been an accident.

			Most oil filters can last two or three oil changes (if done on time/ mileage) 
In the states oil filters are so cheap that its common practice to replace them every change even though they are still good.  So if you can't find a filter go ahead and change the oil, drain the filter then re-use it.  Now you have another 3,000 miles to look for an oil filter.

power the individual must be at least 14. To helm a vessel over 8hp the 
person must be over 18 years. On Lake Constance the h.p. is reduced to 6 and 
the individual must be 14 or over. Anything over that then the individual 
must be 18 or over. 
The RYA did suggest that you made enquiries locally to confirm. Perhaps the 
Swiss Embassy may be able to assist, an E mail to them possibly? 
That is all the information that I could obtain from them. If you wished to 
you could always take the Inland Waterways Course with us to gain more 
experience, that is the ticket for the inland ICC. You would also need to 
sit the CEVNI exam.     Hope this helps....  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jan 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Boat on Lake Geneva	GingerViking	Posts: 8

			My husband and I signed up for mobility when we first got here and it was great for the odd day out but it is so useful to have a car and you do get to go to the places that you miss by train. We bought a cheap car 2500, insured it for 500 and paid the road tax etc. It doesn't cost that much for petrol our only annoyance was that we had to pay 120chf a month for underground parking because none of the cheaper parking spaces outside were available.  Other than that it's been fab. Unfortunately my hubby and I are now moving back to  the UK in July and we only bought the car in March so that's a pain. We are selling it for 2000 fresh MFK if you are interested in a cheap run around!!!

			Try both routes for a week and then see which one you prefer?  I always found that I commuted the path of least resistance!!   
The cost of the boat adds up but then so does the time to drive through Zurich.

			As previous posters have said- all those relevant car-related documents- Grey ownership paper, insurance cover note, etc. Don't forget your residence permit (might as well take your passport along as well!)   
The MFK place is in Fuellinsdorf, about a 5 minute walk down the hill from the station. Try and check the opening times before you go- I've been there 4 times when I tried to registered my car, and it has been closed twice!

			All right. Let's get some things straight.   
If you have an auto license AND have already switched it over to a CH auto license THEN you DON'T need to do any theory test at all. Just go get your learning license for the motorcycle from your Strassenverkehrsamt.   
If you still need to take a theory test, go talk to your local Strassenverkehrsamt about your English booklet.        The theory test covers traffic situations, i.e. right-of-way rules, etc, and as such is the same for any vehicle.

			Watch out though when renting a bike/scooter for the beginner's class. You will have to leave a sizable deposit when you pick it up and will be liable for any minute dings/scratches/scrapes/discolorations that may well result from your beginning attempts at managing the thing. A friend laid a rental bike down on his course (laid it down mind you, not crashed it down) and was stuck with a 2000 Fr repair bill to replace the exhaust, turn signals, and other parts incurring microscopic damage.

			Welcome to the forum MDK, your English is excellent!   
Have you looked at the Zurich web site?   the canton suggest you contact a driving school and get some lessons. It states you need a minimum of 8 lessons.    
Getting the ""Lernfahrausweis"" is of course the beginning of learning to drive, which for all of us takes several years before you are really competant.    
Be careful and realise that only qualified people should teach you. Also be aware that you can drive around in someone else's car and get experience (With that person sitting next to you) is OK but be careful not to pick up any bad habits! You might be suited to say one lesson a week and then 2 or 3 hours practise in a   car each week.    
However the driving schools have a close relationship with the testing stations, and you should take their advice! They can also sell you driving test ""Sample questions and answers"" for self study of the theory.    
If you take the cheapest way you might start making bad habits and fail the test several times before you can rid yourself of them. Good luck!

			Usually your local garage (where you get your car serviced) will do it all for you.   
I've been told that it is also better than way as 
1) they are less likely to find fault 
2) if they do find fault, and it is minor, the garage will be trusted to fix it and no re-inspection is needed   
This of course, has a fee associated with it   "	considered unworthy	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 43 Times in 20 Posts	Good place for an engine shampoo / wash?	expat_in_zug	Posts: 195

			Today I also had a seriously bad experience with some animals dressed in police uniform. I left my keys inside my car with engine on and went outside my car to check something on my wheels. Apparently what I did was close to a war crime. My experience is that they only need to keep looking on their stupid code to find whatever reason to fine anyone. And they interpret at their will so that they do whatever they need to.      
Tonight, since they were just literally bullying me I took my mobile out and started recording. They took it immediately from my hands and told me it was illegal. After plenty of discussions they however gave me my natel back, after making sure the recorded video had been deleted.    
I wonder whether it is indeed illegal to record any police agent (or animal dressed in police custom) while they are issuing you a fine. If it would be I am sure they would have issued me an extra fine. I honestly think they just wanted to abuse me and of course that there was no tracking record.   
Finally: one of the police animals -I mean, agents- was wearing a earring. Anyone knows whether male policemen may wear earrings?    
Tonight they stole from me 140CHF francs. And it was policemen who did it.

			We had a diesel Espace in 2004-2007.  Overall the build quality was poor - lots of little things going wrong/snapping/breaking or just not working very well.  We had significant problems with the electric windows, battery/starter system, and the locks (requiring the use of a bit of string to keep the boot shut).  We also found the key system a bit bizarre - there's a card instead of a key and it works from a distance. Oh, and the system for holding the seats in place/moving them around was quite awkward to use and inflexible.   
On the plus side, everyone had their own proper seat, it was comfortable and spacious.   
We also had all the seats stolen, which were horribly expensive to replace, but I can't blame Renault for the Parisien criminal classes.   
Maybe some of the build quality issues have been addressed and lots of Espaces have been sold so they can't be all bad.  I always thought we just had the bad luck to have a 'Friday afternoon' car.

			If anyone is visiting for a one-off trip e.g. job interview, this ticket can be good value for longer journeys.  . It is £75 for a return journey from any point of arrival to destination.  the ticket is valid for a month.   
As the fare from Geneva to Lausanne is CHF50 return it would not warrant getting for your journey.

			I know this is a late response to this posting but I hope it might help someone.    
Here is my story bringing 2006 VW Jetta to Switzerland from USA. I used Schumacher Cargo Logistics ( ) with port to port shipping. Delivered my car to port in Houston and they delivered it to me in Baselland in about 5 weeks. My totall cost for that was approximately $3100.   
That was shipping... Once I got it in country, I connected with an insurace agent (AXA Winterthur..I can provide contact in Basel) to get a nachweis ( not sure about spelling) sent to MFK. To get this you will need the stamm nummer from the customs papers. Once That is done MFK gave me an appointment to test the car and I was allowed to drive it until the test date with my US plates.   
At the MFK test only adjustment needed was headlight angle and local VW garage did that for me for CHF 20. Next bit of important information is the top speed of the car. If it is not in the manuals, find it from Google. Tires on the car must be adequate for the top speed specified by the manufacturer.   
Now I am driving with BL plates   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Volvo S60 import from USA	1Scandinavian	Posts: 1

			The design of engines these days has become very strict with emmissions levels so without completley re-designing the engines, they make advancements in performance figures which have to be compromised with other factors, like octane ratings and thirst.   
Compression ratios is one factor. 
The ordinary car, take a 2.0L petrol might have a compression ratio of 10.5:1. That means the mixture is squashed by a factor of 10.5 times per stroke of a cylinder. 
Add a turbo and to get performance it adds a lot more air/fuel mxture, but if you compress this larger mixture it gets hotter too quickly and would combust well before your spark plug produced a spark. Pinking. Bad. Damaged engine very quickly. 
So a reduced compression of perhaps 8 or 9:1 fits this turbo situation.   
Modern turbo engines are now increasing their compression to get more power, back up to 10, or 11:1, so to prevent the spark, the octane level is increased so the fuel does not combust until much higher temperatures and pressures, hence the need for the 98RON fuel.   
Again formula 1 is another example although economy and emmissions are not so critical. How would they ever get 700hp+ from a 3.5L engine without turbo. Compression and octane as the basics, but their engine designs are obviously not road-going capable.   
Back in Escort and Sierra Cosworth days (80's and 90's) we had 100bhp per litre. 200bhp from a 2.0L car. Now we are some where up to nearly 140bhp per litre, VW have a 1.4L engine with 170bhp, with a 200bhp version on the horizon.   
VW used to have an engine called an FSI design. Don't know if it's still used as they-re nearly all TSI now. Anyway, it preferred 98RON or even 99 V-Power from shell, but could be run on 95RON. What later transpires is that after 4 or 5 years the cylinder heads start causing problems. It was very sensitive to the fuel and noticed based upon using 95RON fuel over a long period. This was a report in the UK, but I can't imagine the rest of Europe had differences. 
These engines were only higher performing in their class as they were only small engnes. 1.4L, so it's not limited to supercars.   
Without a complete redesign of engines, power increases will be small, so the current options are still higher octane, as emissions will never be able to be kept within acceptable limits.

			We only flew with Aer Lingus ZRH-LGW once. My problem was not the two hour delay we had flying out (which was down to an incoming flight from Dublin which the flight crew were being switched over from being delayed) but the way in which they handled it. We got on the plane, of course it is only a very short hop to London anyway, and the staff were too busy eating their own meal (in open view of the passengers) to start serving until just before we began our descent into Gatwick. By the time they got to us (delayed by messing about giving people change for their purchases) it had taken so long it was too late. The least they could have done in these circumstances would have been to whisk around with one free drink for everyone, had their snack, and then asked if anyone wanted something else. Instead we arrived in London parched and never flew with them again.   
If you are able to plan ahead you can get some great deals with Swiss to LHR and LCY, and reasonable, free, service.

			Aha - yes.  Called provisional licences in the UK but what you mean by a learners licence.   
The Swiss licence is now provisional for 3 years (at least for younger drivers, not sure about age limits) after you get it and in that time you have to visit 2 full day driving courses.  However there are no restrictions on passengers or times etc.  However if you pick up too many or too bad infractions in that time you can loose the licence completely.

			In Australia you'd fail your driving test for not having both hands on the wheel at all possible times, except for the brief time that you change gears in a manual...   
Your hands must also always be in the 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock position...skimming them around the wheel or hand-over-hand is also not acceptable (when your hands are in a crossed position you are no longer in full control of the wheel).   
If you are 'flicking' the wheel (letting it go so it turns back without your hands on it) then chances are you are not in proper control...   
Please don't drive...too many people are overconfident driving...   
But I am biased...my best friend nearly died and her baby was killed from an overconfident driver who thought he could overtake two trucks and a car in the rain on a one-lane highway...he swore in court that he thought it was safe to overtake and he never saw their car coming the other way....point being, overconfidence can have devastating consequences...

That said needs some timing belt changed; and body work seen better days (having been in a storm much like the one featured in Japan of ""The Day After Tomorrow"".

			Kudos to the Baselland Motorfahrzeugkontrolle.  I dropped off all my application papers to have my license exchanged for a Swiss one at my gemeinde.  I'd mistakenly used a BS form instead of a BL form, but a quick call to the local MFK indicated that it would be no problem.   
A week later, the license arrived in the post.  Already impressive turnaround time... but they'd made an error.  They'd forgotten to add my Class A entitlement, instead only giving me a Class A1 entitlement.   
I decided that the easiest thing to do was to pop around in person.  I arrived, waited about five minutes in line, and was served by a very helpful young lady. I showed her a copy of my old license and explained the problem.  She cheerfully admitted there had been a mistake, amended the license, and reprinted it on the spot.  Ten minutes later I had my new license in hand.   
You could have knocked me over with a feather.  It would've taken four weeks and a lot of arguing at home.     
I   Switzerland.

6171	03.03.2010, 11:07	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: nyon	"    It is always better to look first at the official Government web site as well as asking questions on a forum because while many or most forum answers are the truth they are not necessarily the whole truth.   
Switzerland has accepted a large number of EU directives but not the Driving Licence Directive 91/439/EEC & Directive 2006/126/EC.   &   That means while it has arrangements to exchange EU/EEA licences for Swiss ones without tests   it does not follow EU law that allows you to drive at least until age 70 (in UK for example) on a (non-professional) licence issued by another EU/EEA state without ever exchanging it.   
(This does not apply to you, but others may find this useful: EU law does not require another member state to exchange a licence unless theory and practical (written and road) tests were taken in an EU/EEA country. So if (like my wife) you obtained your Swiss (or French, Danish, etc.) licence by exchanging it for a third country (USA, say), the UK will not exchange it for a UK one.   But once you have passed the theory and practical tests in any EU state the only restriction another member state can impose concern optical and medical tests, or those resulting from penalty points. Some of the current EU rules mimic American efforts to prevent drivers having been banned in one state (typically for DUI) from obtaining a licence in another. Meanwhile there are numerous fraudulent schemes advertised on the Internet for obtaining and exchanging EU licences: all are scams   -- which is not to say that driving schools and driving examiners, especially in some of the EU-8 countries, have not been suspected or accused of complicity in the corrupt issuance of licences to unqualified drivers. Also a scam, but at least one has a facially valid driving document and until and unless they catch the fraudsters one is able to drive. But this happens everywhere from time to time:   (California))   
As the Vaud driving licence web site points out   for foreign licences issued after 1 Dec. 2005 and less than a year before arrival in Switzerland there will be a probationary period. (But there is a 2-year probationary period in the UK anyway.   )   
In Switzerland where domicile is registered, as in most European countries, you can only get a licence (or in fact take a driving test) upon proof of registration with a commune. As the UK, Ireland and Gibraltar have no registration requirement for Swiss nationals and Swiss passports will not be stamped on entry, the EU law requiring 6 months' residence to take a practical test is enforced by the test examiner having the driver sign a certification on the test sheet. (To obtain a provisional (learner's) licence, holders of passports other than UK ones need to send them in to DVLA for inspection.)   
(As another aside; Switzerland, like all countries, makes driving licences available to diplomatic personnel without tests upon proof of prior licensing in another country.   In Switzerland such licences are unrestricted, valid for life. In the UK the DVLA use a supply of ancient little red booklets and the data page is marked ""Diplomatic"" and expires after 3 years without right of renewal.    
(There are at least 110 licence styles still valid in the EU/EEA/Switzerland   &   All those countries are now using a standard credit-card-size photo-bearing pink format for new and replacement licences.   From 2013 EU driving licences are supposed to be subject to renewal every 5 or 10 years, per Directive 2006/126/EC.   )   
For what it is worth: the pass rate for UK practical tests is mostly between 40% and 50%, depending on the test centre:   The rate is lower for drivers taking the test for the first-time. I think it is worthwhile hiring a driving instructor who teaches in the area of the test, for example Iseleworth (near London). Familiarity with the test routes is helpful (all are published; one is assigned one of the official dozen or so routes arbitrarily at the moment of starting the test).

6174	16.03.2010, 14:25	Forum Veteran	Thanked 2,523 Times in 1,215 Posts	Location: Zug	"    Hallo, Just a question that if I have the flight on 13.20 at Malpensa airport, an international flight to Hong Kong. Do you think I can check in at Malpensa airport on or before 11.20am? Seems difficult if I depart from Zug early morning to Milano Centrale and could only arrive 10.35am. It takes 1.5hrs(??) from Milano Centale to Cordona and then Malpensa express to the airport.  Or by bus, as you suggest, not faster than train I assume. So, I need to go to Milan the nite before. Any tips for me?   
Cheers,

They also have discounts for various companies, so Mama G's corporate discount meant that they were only a few CHF more than mail order for the Continentals we use so it was a pretty good deal and dead easy. They will also store the tyres that come off for CHF 34 for the set, so you don't have the hassle of storing them yourself.

			Remember that the canton of Geneva is pretty tiny compared with ZH, so the whole of the canton is covered by Unireso zone 10. Looking at the map there are various outlying zones covering bits of France and a bit of Vaud (unsurprisingly, as the subsidy regimes etc. will be different.)   
There are tariff unions covering most of Switzerland - some are a little newer than others, some are more zonal than others in their outlook, but they all follow roughly the same model of delivering a single timetable / tariff structure / fare collection system across the multitude of companies that operate services. Zürich's ZVV, for instance, doesn't actually operate transport services or send ticket inspectors out - that's done by its member companies (SBB, VBZ, VBG, SZU, BDWM, etc). What the ZVV(/Unireso/TNW/Ostwind/etc) does is act as a coordinating body to make it transparent to the passenger what company operates their buses, arranges it so you can transfer between services operated by different companies without having to pay again, and so on.    
At a higher level, a lot of bus services and all rail services are coordinated and timetabled nationally, producing the somewhat epic three-volume Kursbuch every year (volume 1 railways/ships/cable cars, volumes 2+3 buses) that lays out pretty much all the public transport in the country that isn't part of a town's local bus network.   
A basic function of the tariff union is to deliver cross-medium season tickets (""mobility pass"" is the current hip term) like the original poster describes. In more rural areas where there might be only one or two transport operators (say, PostAuto running buses and a regional railway operator like the MGB or RhB) I'm guessing the choice is either a season ticket for the individual operator or a GA.   
It's not an exclusively Swiss setup - there are similiar unified tariff systems elsewhere, either on a regional basis (Germany has many regional tariff unions) or a national one (the Dutch Nationale Strippenkaart comes to mind). Unfortunately the UK is kind of behind the times here. Quelle surprise.

			When you queue up to pay the toll, not only you must avoid the yellow-marked ""Telepass"" lane, but also the lanes for ""Viacard"" only. Viacard is a prepaid card.   
Stick to the lanes marked for cash payments (the sign has a logo with banknotes and coins). However if you end up in a viacard only lane it's not too bad, because there you can pay with you credit card.   
There is no general rule to where are the different telepass/viacard lanes, sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right, just follow the signs for cash payment.   
In some parts of motorway (for instance around Milano) you must pay before you enter, in this case you will not receive a ticket at the toll booth but you'll be asked for a couple of .   
Be more careful than usual while driving in Italy.   
The general limit on the motorway is 130 km/h. Nobody goes so slow in Italy except huge lorries and swiss pensioners    
The law allows the motorways with three lanes to have 150 km/h limit, but afaik no motorway manager dared to increase the limit to 150 yet.   
In case of rain the limit drops to 110, and in case of fog it's 50 km/h on all the roads (including motorway).

			I do like some of these posts. In Aargau the traffic police are particularly keen and also they do things like advertise how many licenses they have pulled this month and how many accidents there have been but by far the worst are those in Schaffhausen... So they must be the worst drivers    
As regards the new 3km limit I find this interesting. I have just received a present from the friendly police in Aargau for driving at 59 and that was 4 over the limit and the normal CHF40 fine... so is this another one of those Gemeinde/Canton laws?   
Also don't be so sure Motorcyclists can avoid the fines. A lot of the setups here are cameras from front and rear so they get you one way or another...   
As for breathalyser tests any police officer will tell you that the first part of the test is there talking to you when you wind the window down. If there is a smell of alcohol you will be blowing... The main problem here is that it is almost socially acceptable to be caught. In most normal countries it is very socially unacceptable... That said random checking things here is a normal event so I guess they do pick up plenty of guilty drivers. In other countries like the UK where there needs to be justification there might be one in three over the limit and not one in 40.    
By the way how many people have been stopped by the Border control WELL inland. It happened to me again by Aarau which must be at least 40 minutes inside Switzerland and the usual question are you carrying anything... I can't work this out.

			Jay,   
Nowhere on either Vaud's or Zurich's website have I seen any notice that the temporary license plates are to be granted only for new vehicles (what do you do if someone's registration has expired and you want to test-drive or bring home a vehicle that you've bought ?) However, I do think that having the bike shipped home is a better idea, riding home under the current weather conditions wouldn't have been much fun. 
Re the inspection, they'll schedule it when you have completed the customs paperwork, so yeah, you might have to wait a little. However, once you get it scheduled, call or send them an email and ask to be rescheduled for an earlier appointment. Apparently enough people cancel to where they can usually get you in under half the original estimated wait.   
Cheers,   
Stefan.

Yes the test is as stringent but what they can't see....be careful on insurance though. You should be able to get a""old timer"" stamp on the MFK providing the vehicle is essentially standard which means MFK only every 5 or 7 years

The household effects must be imported close to the time when the transfer of domicile occurs, generally in 18 months. I asked the Customs and they said that they will calculate it from the date of entry as stated on your permit.  
You can of course try to claim that you are only now transferring the domicile but I'm not sure how this would work if you have in fact been living and working in Switzerland for 10 years.. 
There is an option to import a car tax free if you have been a resident of Switzerland but worked abroad for at least one year witough giving up the Swiss domicile and used the car there at least 6 months, but in this case you would actually have to show that you were studying and working abroad for a year.

I am sure that the ethics will not be satisfacatory for every one but this might be a solution for some.   
This could be useful if you are going to be in Switzerland for a couple of years and saves: 
(a) Hassle of registering the car in Switzerland 
(b) Re-registering the car in the UK on return which always makes selling the car more difficult as V55 will disclose the export/import of the vehicle. 
(c) Cost of modifying the car to pass Swiss MOT (Head lights for Right Hand Drive) and then changing back for UK on return. 
(d) Car Insurance appears to be cheaper in the UK than Switzerland. 
(e) less likely to be fined for speeding (certainly by cameras) and parking offensives in Switzerland.     
1) Form an English Ltd company. Cost £100 with obviously registered office in England.   
2) Register the vehicle with DVLA in the name of the limited company you want to drive in Switzerland.   
3) Take out car insurance in the UK in the name of the Ltd company and make sure that you are a named driver on the policy and the policy covers travel abroad.  It is better that you also have a UK resident on the insurance policy as a named driver.

As soon as you try to get a new license plate for the car, they'll summon you for an inspection. If the car were in good condition, the previous owner would have had it checked  before selling it - that increases the re-sale value. If a car is sold without recent MFK, there's something fishy about it.

These are rough times at the moment, so can be a little flexible if needs be.   
If interested, please send me a PM.

			I don't think you can return a second hand car within 14 days or even within 1 day ... Usually all private sellers says ""I am not a garage, so I don't provide garanty that the car is OK"". When you sign a ""selling document"" usually it is written there ""selling in actual condition with no garantie"" ...   
Tell us more what's wrong with the car? Maybe I will be able to help with advices. I know a little about cars.    
P.S. If you were given a warranty on a second hand car and it broke, you can ask to repair it.    
However, recently I bought a Honda CBR motocycle. And after some time I started to hear some bizzare noise coming from cam chain. So I came to garage (I had warranty). They tested and said ""well, it happens, noise is nothing you can scare of "" ...   
So on my own costs I am now going to buy a cam chain tensioner and change it. Yes, the garagists are busdarts. I know.

			thanks a lot for all your reply !!   
The reason I think about a car is - to buy food from France or Germany, to back home late in mid night, to go travel with car. Even I am not living in the center but I am living in the city, which won't take me more than 30 mins to reach the trainstation by bus.    
I have to think about the cost again, for this amount I can buy a year card from SBB already. It sounds not cheap to keep a car, like i have to prepare at least 3K for a year, which is not include the petrol yet   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	How much does it cost to operate a car in Switzerland?	cckkt	Posts: 46

			In Germany, the trend goes more towards natural gas than E85. It is by far less taxed than the ""normal"" fuels and therefore a conversion of a car (you can get them to run on normal fuel as well as natural gas with an extra tank in the back...) pays off easily. No idea of Switzerland as I find myself not driving very much, but enjoying public transport and walk to work.

			I've driven from Ireland through mainland Europe, using ferries of course then through Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and had no problems what so ever..   
Some countries require to pay a road tax/insurance almost like an entry fee, more common in Africa than Europe but a few have it..   
One thing to watch for is the speed limits, some police forces watch for foreign cars and you will be pulled over even the slightest bit over even if the locals are speeding away.. its a bit like a ""tourist tax""..    
Check that your insurance covers driving in foreign countries and breakdown assistance is good to have too..   
As good as trains are, its hard to get off the beaten track relying on trains and public transport..

			Thanks for all the tips and links, this is very helpful.   
Just one other question (I've searched quite a bit and haven't found anything informative). Is there anything in the area that is similar to ""US-style"" autocross? I know the term autocross refers to a different racing style in Europe.    
The positives about US autocross events are that pretty much anyone can attend, they are quite frequent, there is a very low threshold of planning/investment (you can run most any safe street car), and one can learn quite a bit about low/medium-speed car control.   
I'm just wondering if there are any sactioned opportunities to push the limits, without the planning, prep and money needed for a formal trackday at a circuit.

You can get full comp cover bu its not worth it. They will take your car value as it was when it was new (weird I know) so you'd pay more in premiums than the car is poss worth. Best option is 3rd party thats what I took for my RHD 96 Wrangler.

			I did the same trip several months ago and was not stopped by anyone. I did buy the reflective vests (which have to be kept in the passenger glove compartment I believe) and spare bulbs, headlight reflectors and GB sticker - all of which I bought as a pack in the Ferry coming across from Dover to Calais for about £30 from memory.   
I would also advise on getting any rental or contract hire paperwork in place where you have a letter giving permission to take the car out of the country. Some border crossing are really brutal about this as they consider that cars without such clear written authority could be stolen and on route to some East European country.   
In terms of navigation, I followed every word my GPS lady told me! I found the French motorways excellent and made really good time as they were mostly empty even though I was travelling across on a Saturday during the day.   
I have a colleaugue that also cam across a few months later. He flew over with his family and had some friends hire a truck and transfer his house contents to Baden. The truck was stopped 20 miles outside Baden and was escorted to a weigh bridge. It was overloaded by a small amount but they still got a 1400CHF fine, which was pretty tough! Also, they had to then leave the overloaded items at the Police Station and pick them up once they had delivered the load they were allowed to proceed with.   
Hope this helps and I hope you have fun when you get to Baden!

... and then they resell them on to either residents or both residents and non-residents, whichever they choose to do. Validity is basically that of a normal Tageskarte zum Halbtax (in other words, it's a one-day GA) - except you don't need a 1/2 abo to get one. It's actually the only way to get a Tageskarte if you don't have a halbtax, with the exception of a few special offers which appear now and then.   
Many gemeinden manage theirs through the web, often via:     
but others merely sell them over the counter on a first-come, first-served basis. For instance, if you live in the Stadt Zürich you can get them for Fr42,- from the Evergreens kiosk near the Hbf:   
(in Zürich you don't need to be a resident to buy them, which is a top tip for people with visitors who want to go on day trips)   
The number of tickets available is restricted depending on how many sets of tickets the gemeinde has purchased. Oh yeah, and they're second class only,  but they're also upgradable to first via a Tagesklassenwechsel (Fr39,-, or 33,- if it's after 0900) or by paying the upgrade fee for part of the trip if that's what you'd prefer.

			Before I put this into a jobs offered thread I thought I would ask if it is an interest, or if maybe some one had a reasonable link to a friend or other... 
I have a car that needs a complete replacement of it's engine, and all the parts like water pump, alternator, etc that can be changed while the engine is out. I have been to the garage here, and the price is insane, but I am not shocked anymore. Since I found it to be a real hassle to change the oil myself here, I think this might not be of interest to anyone. But, if there is anyone out there that is a mechanic, or knows enough about home auto work, and could be interested in the work, I have a Peugeot 306, automatic looking to come back to life. I also would have all the parts as well. Well, I would. Plus, it wouldn't have to be finnished in a day or two. I can wait up to a month, so a little here and there would be fine. If anyone is interested or knows of some one, please let me know. I have to take a descision on what to do with this car soon, and if fixing it's an option that is feasable, I would prefer to do that.

			I can't help with translation, but once you get the phrase you could search ebay.fr for people that move cars people buy on there.   
You could try ringing TCS, or the French equivalent. There must be cases where they need to recover cars broken down abroad.    
Ask a local classic car garage in Mulhouse. These people always know the cheapest way of moving an immobile car. I would imagine a French garage should be cheaper than a Swiss one.   
Uship do list car transportation people in Europe, but google ""uship scam"" first to know what to look out for:     
Finally, you could hire a car trailer. Getting one with a winch is a good idea.

			Be careful, who you select to show a stretched out middlefinger.   
I once experienced a guy pushing himself in in front of me in a very cheeky way, and showed him a finger in the mirror. He turned around and pointed at me and shouted, and when the traffic light switched, he turned right, and I went on the motorway, and drove just around the speed limit. The motorway was completely empty and I saw 2 cars approach very fast, and recognised the first one. So apparently they had picked up a friend and decided to go after me, but they must have gone so fast, they did not recognise me.

6258	06.10.2009, 12:10	Senior Member	Thanked 367 Times in 171 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    You can take the tests in English in Bern.  At least I was able to take the Sailing test, License D, in Bern, in English.   
If you do this it will cost you extra money.   
Your canton will charge you 30chf to send a letter to Bern to tell them that you are registered to take that test.   
Then Bern will charge you 40chf to put you into their system so that you can actually take the test. 
Plus of course you will pay the appropriate fees to actually take the tests as well.   
So in summation, it cost me 70chf more to take the test in English in Bern than it would have to take it in Vaud.  Obviously, plus the cost of travel as well.   
They may charge you individually for each ""authorisation"" to take the exam at the local canton level, but I think you should only have to pay the administration fee in Bern once.  Of course, I could be wrong, I am just guessing about this last part as I only took one test.      
Good Luck,

			more often than not, there are a half dozen trim levels for each model, and I think Opel have gone too far in naming them distinctly rather than just suffixing L, LX, Fx, GX etc as most other manufacturers did in the past.

			We used TCS for our UK registered car when we broke down on the swiss french border, and they allowed us to join and register with them knowing our car wasn't swiss registered, so they can do it.  Our car is now swiss registered and I just changed the number plate details on their website.   
Give them a call and see what they'll do.

My wife did some classes with   school: they had a teacher, young chap, who spoke good english. These guys always offer ""double hours"" = 1.5 hours of driving, compared to other schools with ""1 hour"" =45 mins driving. They claim this saves them and you the costs.

			My understanding was that the North American car market is protected and non-US spec cars younger than 25 years were not allowed to be imported there. There are differences such as the bumpers that you could not easily change. If you ever compare a Golf in Europe, or for that matter the same car sold on both sides of the pond, there are quite some differences, albeit subtle between the two.   
Start by reading here:  . Also check out the list of ""Nonconforming Vehicles Eligible for Importation"":    
I may be moving there myself and have been looking at taking my Alfa Romeo 147 with me. I cannot.

So they do auction off the really low ones, but everything about a 100k is pure luck, nothing else.

			There's also the multiple day cards:   
They are open-ended I think and you just validate for each 24 hours of usage, so they're perfect for using three days for a friend one weekend, and then another weekend later on. 
You can also validate the same card multiple times to travel with multiple people.  They're great value if you have under 25's visiting!

			Hi,   
During Fasnacht and other events where the town centre is inaccessible to trams, the reroutings they introduce will have numbers like ""21"" and ""22"" and will actually follow older tram routes which have been taken off the normal schedule.   
I actually have an old tram network map from about 1980 which shows the old routes.   
To born and bred Baslers, the special trams will make perfect sense.

			As was mentioned, if you were doing 58 over, then you probably would remember this...   
Since the highway speeds in France are limited to 130, and you were probably doing 63 over the limit (but they removed 5 for errors sake?), AND on top of this the speedometer on cars is overtuned by 2-3%, you would have seen 200kph on the meter when driving, and even with a fast car, one has to be extremely inattentive to not see that their speed has crept up that far.   
Anyway, good luck... sounds like you're in a tough situation here.

(and would probably be a danger to themselves and others on the road if they did) feel the need to drop their $0.02 into a conversation that they really don't know anything about other then what they are spoon fed by certain organisations.    
We are not talking about people rally driving on country roads here, we are talking about going a few km/h over the speed limit. Constantly watching the speedometer to make sure that you are under the speed limit is more dangerous then making sure your attention is focused on the road ahead and driving safely for those road conditions.       I don't think in this instance its sour grapes, Papa G stated himself that he wasn't buying, so he did not get caught and had no sour grapes. He was however offering a public service to warn people to make sure that they do keep an eye on their speed on a particular stretch of road. All the radio stations here do that, why is it a problem if a forum member does the same thing for the people that don't listen to the radio or understand what the ""Radar meldung"" on the radio stations are saying.

			Yes, I almost forgot about this thread. I now have Swiss plates on my car, and everything went very smooth.   
Before my appointment at Strassenverkehrsamt, I went to a small mechanic here and he did a check-up, cleaned the engine and underneath the car, so it was in good shape. Cost around 400 CHF.   
At the Strassenverkehrsamt it was very easy. I had all papers so the check-up took around 45 minutes. Then I had to give them the German plates (they were destroyed and Germany was notified. I am still waiting for my money from the German insurance company) and I got my Swiss plates. This took also around 45 minutes.    
A few weeks later I got the invoice at around 450 CHF (including new driver's license). So I am fine and have hopefully taken care of all administrative stuff now   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	German car, insurance and customs	Mx2000	Posts: 55

Unfortunately, it seems that you ARE a business traveler and so have to fly on one of the weekend days... no? (Maybe in effort to save money, you can work it out so that your days off are Tues - Thurs instead of the normal weekend)

			Hi, not sure whether your Italian has improved since we were in contact but here's the link to the Cantonal administration section dealing with 'boat issues': permits, acquiring registration plates, etc.     
There are various places where you can take the course leading to the exam, it does depend also on whether you wish to sail a yatch or drive a speed boat. They may, however, be closer to Lugano or Locarno (are you still in the Bellinzona area?). Look up 'scuole navigazione' 
Hope it helps you focus on the right path.

The ones who want a fast, prestigious German car, feel too young for a Benz, need something more practical or cheaper than a Porsche and want something more emotional than an Audi. So they are one of the most likely group of people who really abuse their cars... and it does not matter if we talk about the manager who buys it brand new down to the 18-25 year old who just stretched his budget to get the used 3 series. 
My brother in law has an old 3 series (only God knows why). He is the type of person I would expect to buy a Toyota. In his hands, it runs like as reliable as a Swiss watch.... on the other hand I somehow suspect the widened and lowered 3 series with the Turkish flag where the BMW badge once was parked close to my work to be on the less reliable side.

			TCS are a mobile organisation, so they should be able to do an on-site check. 
The car will have a build up of carbon if it is not used much, driven badly ( as in not revving it high enough) or doing only or a lot of town driving. 
It is normal to race a car down the highway in 3rd or 4th gear to 'clean out' the engine before taking it for the emissions test.   
But of course no-one except the current owner knows about this car. 
Check the service history and the oil level in the car. Talk with the current owner and ask him questions like how much oil he has put in it between services etc. Buying a second hand car is always a gamble, so all you can do is try to minimise your risk.   
By the sounds of it, this is not an old car if you are asking about changing the timing belt when the car reaches 50KM, therefore it should be near perfect.   
If it is sounds all right, looks all right and there are no alarms ringing in your head about the car or the owner, it probably is all right. 
Sometimes you just have to hold onto your balls and take the plunge!  
If there is any reasonable doubt, then get a second opinion or look elsewhere. 
The world is full of second hand cars, no one is twisting your arm.

6348	05.01.2010, 10:13	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Winterthur	"    As the other posters suggested, go to the travel office to get precise prices worked out and information.   
However, here is my 2 Rappen worth:   
As Zürich and Winti are both within ZVV you cannot get strict train tickets. All tickets are automatically also valid within their zones for all public transport. Therefore a ticket from your local bus stop in Winti to your local tram stop in Zürich and including the train and everything in between will cost exactly the same (and in fact be exactly the same ticket in all respects) as the train ticket you would buy from Winterthur Hauptbahnhof to Zürich Hauptbahnhof. A lot of people misunderstand this and end up spending too much.   
If you are only travelling occasionally, you could also consider getting 6-er pack tickets (can't remember the name, Mehrfahrtenkarte maybe?) which you stamp at the ticket machine and which is then valid for one trip or for a given period (for example 1 day, depending on the ticket type, that type is called Tageswahlkarte). You can stamp/use that ticket six times and this often comes cheaper than buying six equivalent tickets individually. You can also conmbine it with a Halbtax which should save you a lot of money if you use it frequently.   
Another option is to get a monthly ticket for Zürich (remember to tell them you are a student as this can get you a reduction) and then get Anschlussbillette for the rare occasions you go to Winterthur. Anschlussbillette are also available in the 6-er format to stamp. An Anschlussbillet is basically an upgrade that tansforms your all Zürich ZVV pass to a Zürich and Winterthur pass for a limited period of time, and again comes cheaper than buying it as a separate ticket.

			A halb-tax will allow you to buy the mehrfarhtkarte for child prices.  If you don't have a halb-tax, you get 6 journeys for the price of 5 (12 for 10).  Make sure it covers enough zones.   
You can also get day cards covering zones 10, 11 and 13 - that includes the airport, but excludes Pratteln, and other outlying regions.  You can get 1-7 days cards covering the whole of the TNW region.  Prices  .  Note, you can't use halb-tax with these cards.   
You can buy them at most ticket machines.

			Usually, there are only complains or bad experiences ending up here (and I am no exception).   
I recently had a great experience with a Swiss insurance and think it is worth to be shared as well:   
I went back to Germany for Christmas at my parents by car. When we wanted to leave again for Switzerland on the 26th, my car started to vibrate and got very noisy. I told myself that it might be a bad idea to drive 400km like this. I somehow remembered that my insurance guy talked me into some extras and that ""EU wide help in case of a breakdown"" was part of it.   
I called the call center, did not wait for a second in a cablecom-like system, but immediately had an operator who took my details, was friendly and competent and promised me that a local breakdown service would call me within 15 mins to check how bad it was. I was waiting for twenty minutes and just when I was about to get annoyed that nobody called yet, the service car showed up without a prior call. 
The guy needed only five minutes to find out that I had some ignition problems and realy should not drive this far or risk to **** up my engine. I called the insurance and told them the story. They arranged with the service guy a rental car and within less than an hour, I was back on the road. On a holiday. 
My car was pulled to the next Audi center. The next working day, the insurance called me again and kept me updated, that the Audi center would need another day before they had time to look at my car and that the insurance has prolonged the rental car contract for me. One day later, I knew how long it would take and how much it was and the insurance made me the offer to choose: Either drive the rental car back myself to pick up my car (which was the faster solution) or let them tow my car to Switzerland in case I would prefer to get it repaired here. I drove myself as I did want my car back as fast as possible. The insurance did cover all towing and rental car costs.   
All in all a perfect service, competent, pro-active, friendly and very fast. I will stay with Allianz Suisse for sure.

			I really do not speed on purpose and sometimes it just happens while thinking about something, I'd rather have them go after the cagers that write text messages and dial phone numbers while driving 
...and I really do not care whether this is a sensitive (assuming that's what you mean) issue on the forum because I am the only one that is shaping my destiny and judgement calls 
I do appreciate your comment though

- You will find tons on information on the procedures or tips on good garages in your region through the search function. 
- You will find a great amount of 2nd hand cars on

Also, if you lose the unnamed pass, you can't get a replacement, but you can if you have a named one.

			It is two years for a car that age, and they do contact you. If they haven't it means you're lucky - they are behind schedule. You can call and ask them when it's likely to come up and they can usually tell you, if you're trying to budget for the pre-inspection check at a garage (my case  ).

If they decide on a new ballot, any strike action would not be until the new year.

			It would be clear, if that was what ""circulation"" meant.  However, it appears to mean ""duties paid / properly imported"".  So 4.6 means that the car can be kept for two years without being imported/registered.  And point 5.2 is negated by points 4.x as they are ""special cases"".   
Maybe I'm trying to be too smart and am bending the meaning to fit with what I want rather than what it actually means!  Thanks for checking it, FriendlyKiwi.

			Hmmm. When I registered my bike (which had been sitting around unregistered for awhile) I was directly given a bill for the road tax remaining for the year. I registered it in July and the fee was about half of what a full year's tax should have been. Perhaps as you registered so late in the year they are letting you off? (not very likely. I really can't imagine this being true.)

If you learn faster, that's great, still I would mentally budget at least 20 lessons with a qualified instructor and then see how it goes. You do not have to take 100 lessons with an instructor, though. As said by previous posters, you can practice in someone else's car if they will let you do that.    
I would recommend learning on a manual car. It is up to you, of course, and since you are investing already a lot of time and money into this, why restrict yourself to automatic cars only? It will take you a bit longer to master changing gears, then you will be able to drive whatever you like.

But while they copied the design, they sell them under their own ""brand"" unlike for example faked sportswear or watches. So you can get a cheap version of everything over there, but yes, I am sure they would sell them to you if you try to import them here... although I guess your chances to make money are far smaller than the chance to get into prison...   
Honestly: I would trust a large online reseller way more than the local tyre shop. If they were once in the media for selling a single fake, their entire business is gone. But if a guy can tell you that he can smell the difference between good and bad tyres, I could very well imagine that he could as well make some extra cash by selling Chinese ""Cuntinental"" for the real deal...   
For the fun of it (I heard that if you buy the fake x5 in China, many dealers give you a free set of real BMW badges for it as a present)...

			We have a right hand drive UK registered car on which the 1-year grace period expires at the end of the year (NOTE: much to our surprise, the year runs from when I came to Switzerland, not when my family and the car came, some 9 months later!).   
So, we have bought a swiss LHD car, but now have the problem of what to do with the old one. It runs fine, but is not worth a lot... 
We plan to go back to the UK for a holiday in the summer, so could drive it back then - if there is some way of keeping it in the meantime.   
1) is there something equivalent to a SORN in the UK which would allow us to keep it here (off the road) until summer when we would put it back in circulation and return to the UK   
2) could we officially export it from Switzerland into France (or Germany, but we live in Lausanne), find somewhere to park it, and leave it there with occasional visits?   
3) Can anyone think of someone who might want to drive it back to the UK who would leave it somewhere we could pick it up? Our preference would be with relatives around Oxford or Edinburgh, or perhaps Cambridge   
4) Would anyone like to buy it (presumably to take it back to the UK) - see Ad for Volvo 850 in for sale forum (  )   
5) Any other ideas how this one could be solved? Any suggestions welcome :-)

			Be careful on Ebay.  There are a lot of alloys out there claiming to be original BMW's but may be copies of poor quality.     
To make sure they fit, you need to be sure of the PCD (Pitch Circle diameter) (I think E46 has 5x120mm) and off set - i.e.   where  the outside of the wheel needs to be in relation to the bodyline of the vehicle.

			Hi all,   
I have moved to Vaud and am having a friend of mine who runs a UK courier company to bring over all our stuff.   
We have most of the things we think he'll need but have some questions we'd be grateful for any insight on:   
1. We do not yet have our permits as it takes a while but on the list of stuff it says we ned these or an official certificate. Will we have problems? 
2. Does the inventory list have to be in French? 
3. We did not do one before leaving the UK so it is all being done from memory - is this going to be a problem? 
4. Is our driver likely to get stopped and have to present the docs - unsure if this is documenation he needs to have or that he must present.   
Thanks all,

			Basically they are extending the current zone system that you have with monthly and yearly tickets to single and multiple tickets, in other words it will work like the system in Zürich. They are also introducing a 9 hour cheap ticket (valid after 9 AM weekdays, all day weekends and holiday, 11 CHF for the whole system)   
A-Welle extends all through AG and also as far as Oensingen in SO.

6398	01.12.2009, 23:25	Senior Member	Thanked 154 Times in 90 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Looks to me like the key point here is that Snow'n'Rail tickets have the rail fare portion discounted at 30% (according to the web). Let's check this out given a sample fare from Zürich HB to Davos Platz:   
Return fare (2. Class) - Fr51.00 with halbtax, Fr102.00 without. 
Snow'n'Rail fare (2. Class) - Fr89.40 with halbtax, Fr125.00 without.   
Looking at the fare differentials, this suggests that the rail fare portion is Fr35.60 each way, which matches the 30% discount. That would *probably* be hard to beat, but looking at the fare from somewhere on the fringes of the ZVV, say, Pfäffikon SZ - Fr41/82 (with/without 1/2 abo). Fr10 difference relative to the fare from Zürich means it'd only be worth doing if you were going to travel more than 5 zones across the ZVV to get there.   
The deciding part is probably that if you're on a journey that crosses the boundary of the ZVV or another fare union and plan to use two tickets to cover this, the ZVV (TNW, etc) ticket is only valid as far as the last *timetabled stop* within the ZVV area for the train you're taking. So for instance, if you're travelling from Zürich-Davos via Landquart, you'll need a ticket from Zürich HB anyway if you're on an IC as the first stop is Sargans. Take an IR and the last stop in the ZVV is Pfäffikon.

			Haha, quite so weejeem, great value at twice the price!   
I will go back and check, but i'm pretty sure the car in front of me was on hatched/crossed yellow lines, and mine was on blank road...this was the annoying thing, if we'd all got done for it, then fair enough, but the car in front was there longer than mine, as she was also at the dinner! (not that I wish her to be fined you understand!).

Did you insure your UK reg car in CH, if so was it cheaper? If you used a UK insurer did you pay a fortune because you are no longer resident in the UK?  
Many Thanks

			We just travelled with them. It is exactly like other compagnies.    
For the price it is very good and we had 30 kilos per person for luggages. The food is not included and the prices are not too bad.    
On a negative point; It was durty! I was very not impressed about it. Seats were durty: trace of liquides, dust, food, marks in windows...   
For my husband, it still worthed for the price. For my girly point of view? Eww!   
Bring wipes and do you little clean up if you are like me.    
In general, it was ok enough to take it again at this low price.

			A friend has been quoted CHF 2000- to replace the timing belt in her 1999 VW Beetle TDI.  This seems very expensive, even by Swiss standards.   
I wonder if anyone knew an independent garage near Basel (either in France or Germany) where she might get the work done more reasonably?  My gut tells me that parts should be about CHF 150- and about 4-5 hours labour?

			You won't get Swiss plates without a valid MOT or Swiss equivalent. Without MOT your insurance in invalid, ie when you have an accident you are responsible for EVERYTHING and you'll pay for the rest of your life. You'll need to use a garage  to take the car to the test centre, the garage will use their ""U"" plates which allows them to drive anything within reason. If they are taking the car to a test centre for testing, this is deemed as within reason, it's logical, just like the Swiss !

			I'd suggest that your husband checks with his HR department at work about any possible discounts. We have an agreement with a few local dealers who give up to 15% off (similar to a fleet discount) but it requires a special form from HR.

			I'm a ski tourer and go up back roads into the mountains a lot in a FWD diesel.  In all of last winter (a very snowy one if you recall) I got stuck only once when the Subaru (yes AWD) in front started to slide and couldn't go on.  Took a push for both of us to get started again.   
In my experience it's only Beemers and Mercs (RWD) that you see stuck in normal conditions.      We have winter diesel in Switzerland which will not wax at temperatures you will ever experience here. All diesels have glow plugs which guarantee starting as long as the fuel can flow (you might need to wait a few seconds). Anyway, below -30 is exceptional, even in the mountains.

			The night train isn't bad (at least it wasn't when I was younger). Have you considered driving? I don't know what your plans are down there but it's a pretty good area to have a car in to explore. Kind of a long day of driving though (~8 hours).    
You also might look into finding a cheapish flight to Barcelona and then work your way back up there either with car (2 hours) or train.

			Yes outside of rush hour will be great.  However I don't see myself starting at 6am.   
My journey used to be ca. 30mins (less during holidays / by motorbike)what has changed primarily is a shorter distance and easier journey (no more over the buchenegg) so less wear and tear on me and the car    
For me using the new junction at A.a.A means heading the wrong direction, but I know you (vwild1) live quite close to this.   
I'll try taking the old route to Wettswil and see how long that takes, probably not a big difference but will be shorter for me at least.   
Gone at least are the huge queues in A.a.A however it's still pretty busy.  Donwside might also be increased number of people coming to A.a.A for shopping.   
My neighbour has recently bought a place near Interlaken ca. 5km from Hasliberg, so looking forward to some ski trips over that way which the new motorway will be a big help.

We flew Baboo to Athens over the summer and the whole experience was great.  Assigned seating, no nitpicky luggage rules, free snacks and drinks (including wine) on the flight and all for the same budget fares as the Easyjet/Ryanair crowd.   
Seriously, if you have the choice, go with Baboo everytime over the budget alternatives.

			Hi there,   
Parking in Horgen is a tough one.  Did you see that there's a private car park opposite the station (looks like waste land) and spaces can be rented there adn you can park your car there whenever you like night and day. You would have complete flexibility then adn it's so easy for the station.     
That's what I did and the cost was around 60 Fr a month. However, I think there's currently quite  a big waiting list so you would have to phone and get put on the list if you thought this was an option for you.  The phone number to call is on the sign in or next to the car park.   
Otherwise you could put a little flyer in all your neighbours' mail boxes to see if anyone would be willing to let you use their spot. That was something I was about to do if I didnt get the place in the car park.

			Thanks for everyone's tips and advice.  I went, I saw, I conquered.  Or at least I got a taste and can't wait to go back.  Taking the train was easy and although it would have been cheaper, I'm glad I didn't buy a SuperSaver ticket because my flight ended up being an hour late and I would have missed my train!

			No buses that I know of, but for dirt cheap travel you may try to arrange a rideshare by looking at:       
Most of these rideshares tend to be more trouble than they're worth. You might try booking your tickets ahead of time on the SBB website. You can save a few cents that way.

			I live in St-Prex and the traffic on the A1 sucks.     Not as bad as it is around Montreux or Zurich but still, you wouldn't want to drive in it on purpose. 
If you don't have to drive during rush hour that helps immensely. 
If you don't have to drive to and from work, then I wouldn't.  If you could live in Nyon, Rolle, or Morges then you could have access to most of the faster and frequent lines that run parallel to the A1 between Lausanne and Geneva.  That said it is only about 40 minutes from Lausanne to Geneva on the faster lines so anywhere you like that you can get a decent house for a decent price is a good bet.   
Good Luck, 
Brian.

Maybe I never realised that bus time tables were updated coz they never arrived on time anyway and if the bus was cancelled I just presumed I either missed it or it was late!!  And they never bothered updating the bus timetables on the stops anyway, and the times were always from the terminus, not the stop I was at so were only a loose indication of when I might expect to get a bus. 
Now that I know the time they get here it made me pause for thought!! We don't have many buses and they all go to the station, so maybe it's to coincide with the trains! 
Thanks all, makes sense.     
Oh I love the transport system.  It's a revelation knowing you don't have to bust yourself running for a bus because you know whether you have missed it or not!  WONDERFUL!

It has a large wooden box in it for storage of camping gear with a clever folding lid system to sleep on it (using air matress).

The cargo area is then bare spare for some carpet on the floor and wooden strips against the walls (for easy tying of stuff).

I am wondering if there might be anyone interested in sharing the cost of my journey either by coming along for the drive or with transportation of stuff. I am in a Renault Clio so wouldn't have too much space for big furniture.   
Will also be heading back at the beginning of January but my travel plans are less certain.   
For security/safety reasons I would prefer to meet for a little reassurance in advance of setting out.

			Regarding Smart, I have to warn you. Most of them have a turbine which usually dies at 100k of km. So, buying a used Smart with kilometrage less than 50k is a good option.    
Otherwise, most likely, there is a chance to spend money on reperation of turbine. Also, take into consideration that the Smart engines are of low volume, that it is, ""engine resources"" are limited, and most likely the Smart engine would not last more than 150k of km.   
Good luck with the car!

			Both my wife and I passed the kontrolfahrt in the last two weeks.  Although it might seem unnecessary or expensive we really recommend taking some lessons.  We have been driving for more than 10 years but if you consider the consequences of failing it is worth it.  It was not only small technicalities we learned - also some things that makes us safer drivers here considering the types of intersections etc that we are not used to.   
And to be honest I think it has a 'sub-conscious' effect on the testing officer if he sees you have been taking lessons - mostly your instructor drops you off for the test.   
I can definitely recommend our driving instructor / school / teacher, Kirsten who works mostly from Enge: 079 608 8769.

Its better to be safe that sorry, besides I have now found out from AMAG after a return phone call from the Manager at Wallisellen/Oerlikon that the offset of these wheels are incorrect since they advised me that they are from a 2006 car and my car is a 2009, they siad that these have 42 offset and I require 39 offset.

There are also buses that will get you to Oerlikon station (which is then 5 mins from the mainstation) and go more regularly. Additionally, the new Tram 10 goes all the way into town, although due to the number of stops on the way is slower.

			If it helps at all, there is a park and ride at Haslimatt (Therwil) where you can hop on the no. 10 tram and be in the centre in 15 minutes or so. Therwil may not be the easiest place to get to from Zurich however.    
There may be other park & ride places that others might know of, directly on the tram lines; I'm not sure how easy it is to park up at most of the local stations.    
In all probability, it's probably quicker to get the train all the way.

			It's a lot easier if the particular model of the vehicle was available in Switzerland.  If you're importing a car which was never available in Switzerland it will be a lot more expensive.

			HI there, 
I have recently had a similar experience and wonder also if anyone could give us any advice. I parked on a side street in front of the Nash airport Hotel at Geneva airport. I have parked there lots of times before and never had a problem. This time, however, whilst I was away my car was towed. I had to pay over 1000 CHF to get it back from the pound and a fine of 40CHF. I spoke to several police officers and got different stories from each; it was a blue zone and I never displayed a disk, there were road works on the street and they needed to clear the cars, it is a private street. I paid up as I needed the car but went back and had a look and there were no signs indicating it was a blue zone or private street, there were lots of other cars parked there without disks. I feel we have been treated unfairly and would like to appeal, I have taken photographs and video of the street. Does anyone know how I go about making an appeal and who to write to? 
Thank you for any help, much appreciated!

As for TCS, sorry, never had a TCS subscription, but, IMO, they would drive you to a nearest garage. This should be written in your contract. Better just to call them and ask this small detail. They speak English. Once upon a time they called me back, because some person gave them incorrect number. So, I spoke to them in English.   
Good luck with the engine.

			I respectfully concur. If you have loads of extra time on your hands and you really enjoy talking to all kinds of possible officials and departments and being sent from one place to another, everybody telling you that this cannot be done or that maybe it can but it's some other guy who sould be doing it, but he doesn't knwo who and you need for A to get form B, but you can only get form B with a valid form A etc etc, sure. If not, I wouldn't recommend it. For example I even had to explain to customs officials (!) in my country that Switzerland is not, in fact, in the EU and yes therefore I need the export form. And then had to explain to customs officials here that my country is, in fact, in EU.  So yes they got what they wanted, I bought a new car here.

			I suspect the differences in experiences are related to:   
whether car : 
1 - imported as household goods 
2 - owned at least six months prior to import 
3 - is an ""old timer""     
and more importantly whether customs and SCN (registration & testing) offices have been asked for their advice before the event.    
Customs will specify the above and then scn will give you a check list of things to do to make the car comply.   
The check list of compliance items is fundamental to the ensuing experience - for example whether noise and emissions have to be complied with OR NOT (so very basic dramatic differences). Likewise constructors certificate of construction, or not.   
Follow the process is the right advice and check with the authorities BEFORE each step and do it in very good time. There are deadlines (such as 18 months for import of household goods declarations), but they seem reasonable.   
Switzerland in my experience so far is that one simply must ask the officials all along the way and they are helpful and patient, especially with my french.   
Snippet: Trailers have to be metriculated too and get their own reg number.   
The german names will be different.

But you must tell the ticket inspector of the Schaffhausen to Oerlikon train (if there is one) because he will clip your ticket differently (in a different place) to show that you haven't completed the journey.   
Also, you must watch the time validity of the ticket. So for example if the ticket is valid for one day then you must complete the journey on that day.

			When it comes to a car sale, all garages are good and reliable. Make sure you got the warranty from garage, and in 99% of the cases the car will be OK during that period. If not, they will fix the car. It is Switzerland    
However, when it comes to reparation of cars here, some of the garagists (not all of course, but some) can blow up the price at the end by speculating on prices for parts and amount of work it took).

			I am really happy with the car at the moment. I was on the motorway from Bern to Bulle the other day and it sounded like a whiring coming from the back. Up until now it's been quite quiet. I ruled out the road surface after it changed a few times. It was only at speeds over 100 km. Not sure what else it could be. I have it booked in this weekend with a local mechanic ( as I don't have time to get much further) to get the snow tyres put on. I've asked him to check it before I go from here to Geneva then up to Zurich. Will keep everyone posted on what he says. Thanks for everyone's help.

Most car manufactures say: 15-30 secs warm is enought. However, it is just an advertisement ... Depending on the type of the oil, the engine most likely will get micro injuries if you start to rotate it right away without properly warming up.    
What happens next. With time your pistons becomes not tight in cylinders, but you don't notice that. You just drive. Meanwhile, the engine oil happens into mixture of air/petrol and finally goes into pipes. Via catalasyer, of course. Which will die soon. Really soon. So the catalyser dies. The damage to nature in this case is amazyingly high if you compare to ""warming up events at morning"".   
So you ride with dead catalyser. Why? Because you don't notice that. You will noticed that only the next time you will fill the tank. Sadly, you will think - wow, it took 120 liters of petrol to make 1000 km, which is in two times more than usual. You'll go to garasit. He will say: you know, compression in your engine is low, so I think you should throw it away or throw away whole your car, because in CH it is kinda expensive to repear cars, especially making swap of engine.    
So, you think, I am gonna pay money and utilize this car. Which most likely will result in a rusted metal thrown somethere in swiss nature. Which is really worse than just making morning warm ups    
Let's assume the utilization process is about to perfect, and the metal of your old car will be used for manufacture of a new one. But the problem is that the car is not just a frame. There are a lot of kauchuk parts, and plastic parts, which cannot be esially utilized.    
You say: the swiss utilization process is perfect. OK, they utilize everything, and reuse. So you buy a new car, and drive it cold as usual, your engine get's injuries, you pay money. To get money you work. To work you use electricity (most likely). Electricity is being imported from Estern Europe. Which uses fuel to make it. Which poison the whole air in Europe contitent.    
You know, it is kinda hard to say: what is good and what is wrong   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Car Stickers / Strassenverkehrsamt / Annual Fees	The_Highlander	Posts: 10

			I wouldn't mind a bit of pavement riding if it is quiet and the road is busy or dug up but I absolutely hate that persistent dinging of the bicycle bell when someone is trying to ride past you on a busy pavement.   
The temptation to ram a stick between the spokes of the wheel is almost overwhelming but now I do make it my mission to get in their way so they have to slow down sufficiently to put their feet down.   
I always dismount on the pavement purely because I don't trust my bike to dodge someone as easily as I can when I am walking.   
I am glad they are cracking down on them, it's about time, too.

well a common one that comes up which I find has the same impact as far as I'm concerned is the flashing speed signs that tell you how fast you're going (these ones have been introduced in england) I find myself instinctively slowing down for those even though there are no fines, or anyone monitoring them, but somehow I feel obliged to slow down, why? it could be psycological but it works!   
furthermore these laws were made years and years ago as far as I'm concerned, and the car technology has advanced massively since then, and I think it can be argued that the laws are actually a little bit out of date, I mean the cars nowadays have better brake power, and are designed to take the impact whoever they hit!   
Anyway the ironic thing is, if the authorities didn't want anyone to speed up, they could easily bring in a law that restricts all cars! to stick to the speed limits! the cars will be fitted with a device that receives information of how much the speed limit can be, and actuate that directly to the cars computer which will make sure the car does not exceed the speed limit! it's a doddle! why don't they do it? well because they will lose money! even if they charge for all the tests etc it will be nowhere near how much they make on the speeding tickets! it's a joke!     
by the way I've never been caught by a speed camera (touch wood), still don't agree with the way they're set up and run.

			on't change ""ownership"", if your husband is caught speeding the fine is sent ...    
Well, you have to request a new certificate of insurance in the name of your husband. Take this to the ""Strassenverkehrsamt"" and ask for a new registration with the same license plate (otherwise your husband gets and pays a new plate). Depending on the date of the last ""MFK"" (""Motorfahrzeug Kontrolle"") he may have to submit the car to a check at your MFK.   
However, before you change the registration ask the insurance people what they think. They may not be happy with you in the USA in case your husband suffers an accident.

			Hi Dusty,   
Thanks for your comments. I have bought cars here before, so that's not an issue. Problem is though that there are not really many dealer fit options or accessories anyway, however yes some money towards winter-wheels would certainly help    
However what i was interested to know is if anyone managed to jack up the discount when buying recently (I'm looking for recent sales experiences).    
Doing a bit of research, i've seen that although Audi is offering 11% fleet discount, BMW are offering 14% and Mercedes 16%    
Which leads me to believe that there may be some wiggle room afterall.    
Nipping in for a test drive on Saturday, and we'll see now it goes.

			Take the train or tram number ten. If you're concerned about how much luggage you have then you could still afford to pay those baggage guys at the airport to carry your bags for you. It will still be less than your 40chf taxi ride.

			I've already imported one car , that i used for longer than 6 months, registered it and etc. But it broke down, there is no point in repairing it here, i want to move it back to my country, fix it and sell it there.   
Meanwhile i want to buy a new car, probably also from my home country as it is much cheaper than switzerland (due to currency exchange)   
my question is, can i do it, and if so do you think i could register it back in Poland and drive on polish plates in switzerland (insurance is 3 times cheaper in poland, and all registration fees etc.)   
i live in switzerland for 3 months only, so i guess i would have still 9 months of using my new car in switzerland legally ?   
what about import tax (duty or whatever) , how high is it? i know topic was covered, but not in case of somebody already importing other car, and then changing it to the new etc...

6545	01.10.2009, 02:07	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Scotland	"    Hi Jamie, 
Unfortunately there's no centralized vehicle registration office in Switzerland. Each Canton has it's own version of the DVLA so there are over 20 of them throughout the country. As rpf mentioned  
""Whenever a vehicule is sold the new owner will get a new number and license plate, unless he already owns a license from a former vehicule. For the state of Zurich try http://www.stva.zh.ch""   
Here's a complete list of the vehicle registration offices across the country. Just click on the icons for contact details:     
Re the BSA Owners club of Switzerland, I looked at the online Swiss telephone directory and typed in the name of the contact listed for Switzerland. Only one entry matching that name came up for the whole of Switzerland so there's a good chance it's the same person. I'll send you the link via private message and you could write to or phone him. If it is the same guy and he's no longer involved I'm sure he'll know who to point you to.   
Good luck with your search.  used to have a BSA Bantam and a BSA Starfire when I was younger. I wish I'd kept them too.

			Hi there,   
Some friends traveling from Holland with their older camper (sleeps 6), are wondering about the Swiss regulations for seatbelts in Campers. 
Their camper has seatbelts for 4, but sleeps 6.    the dangers of no seatbelt, but for the sake of knowing the law, any ideas what the regulations are? ...if you can take more people in the camper then there are seatbelts? 
The Strassenverkehrsamt site is all in German. I searched with google translate, but didn't come up with anything.   
Thanks for any input.

			One thing that I must mention is that make sure that you have a hat/cap when you drive. The reason I say that is that Mr S swanned around in his SL in the summer and had to have treatment for sun damage on the side of his head. My neighbour has a little BMW and the same thing happened to him. The dermatologist said that so many people get bad sun damage in open tops as they do not protect their heads.

Maybe it was because I used the word colleague, he is actually a friend but I was thinking in German on this point.    
And believe or not I said I would find out for him but that was a few days ago & I am very busy at the moment so I found it quicker to ask here rather than write a few emails or call around if that is my only crime. I think I have the best offer though here & quicker too as you know how slow companies can be to mail you back.   
It is sad that there must be so many trolls around that people jump to conclusions/groan so freely.

			I don't know too many people who carry wheel clamps for giggle, so would presume the person had some form of authority to use it in the area. As you stated you got permission from someone to park in this area, it says to me that parking is not normally permitted there, you then go on to say you stayed too long. So sounds like you crapped on your own cornflakes and got caught.    
Why are you whinging anyway, it cost you a little time thats all.

			Just make sure that you replace the part just after the test, and put a new ""swiss improved"" part just before the next test is due.   
The fact that the Swiss have decided that it is going to cost x10 as much in CH to replace brake-pads, has absolutely no bearing, whatever, on whether CH approved pads are safer.   
You know you've been in CH too long when you think Cartels are a good idea.

			My vehicle is already registered in CH and was type approved in Netherlands (e4).   
My vehicle was type approved with only one wheel and tyre size combination. I bought an extra set of OEM wheels identical to those it was supplied with only to find out that there are no 'e' marked winter tyres manufactured in that size, only DOT approved tyres for North America.   
I'm interested in finding out how a vehicle can get type approval for the EU when  winter tyres for it are unavailable in Europe.

			Hey there,   
It is quite economic if you have all the information you need.   
A few points to help you ..   
1. Always keep detailed time-tables for the destinations you intend to travel. Carry 'Lonely Planet' guides if you can. 
2. A fast train will invite a surcharge of around 10-15 euros every time. Same is true for overnight trains, but they are quite comfy. 
3. Usually, the pass doesnt cover any local transport or the open bus tours. So, take that into account in your calculations too.   
Enjoy your trip !!

			As previously discussed  , radar traps are placed with ""safety"" in  
mind.   
Knowing this, a sign warning you that a radar is ahead is also a form of  
""safety"".  Even if there is not a radar device ahead    Respectively, a 
radar without warning is especially profitable ""safety"".

			Funny you should mention that part about UK parking inspectors. I remember ten years ago standing in a coffee shop and a parking inspector came in and said ""does anyone in here own that red car across the street"". Someone did and apologised and the inspector told them they had five minutes to move it. Since I had just arrived from Australia I was taken aback at this very tolerant attitude, as Australian parking inspectors had a reputation for being complete bast***s.    
However, I've had it on good authority from several people that nice friendly parking inspectors in London now exist only in my warm fuzzy memories. A few weeks ago I was in Sydney and saw a parking inspector printing me a ticket. I walked up to my car and sarcasticly said ""thanks"", not expecting much in the way of sympathy. To my utter surprise he apologised profusely, explained that he had been there waiting for me to come back, and if I'd just waved to him as I had approached he could have avoided hitting the print button. I felt like a real idiot for being sarcastic to him. Perhaps all those nice parking inspectors immigrated?   
Well a bit off topic, but I think the main point is that none of us have ever actually met a nice parking inspector here (in Switzerland), or in my case I've never met one at all. It always seems to be the way that you come back to the car and find a freshly printed ticket - but the parking inspector is always nowhere to be seen!

			If you have been over here for longer than 12 months, but are then not intending to keep the car over for more than 12 months beyond that, then I think you need to apply for ""U"" suffixed plates   
If you go up to the Strassenverksamthingummybobbins (penultimate stop on the number 13 tram direction Uetliberg) they'll give you a loverly bit of paper explaining which plate you need to apply for.   
As for UK car insurance, I don't know of any that cover it without a green card, most of which you not only have to pay for but are only valid for a maximum of 90 days per year with a maximum visit of 30 days (the idiots)   
It's really not that difficult to get it converted although the chances are you'll need to fork out for new headlight units

6582	17.09.2009, 14:59	Forum Veteran	Thanked 1,097 Times in 546 Posts	Location: Adliswil (close to Zurich)	"    I test drove an Insight today. The biggest gripe I had with it was that the guy from the garage came along so the whole drive felt like a driving exam. Just because of this I will make a second testdrive with a car from a different garage...   
I am interested in the car cause it has a cvt transmission,  I don't really care about it being a hybrid. I found it drove like a normal car, I didn't notice any of the technology like swapping between engines and stuff like that. Acceleration in town was good, ride comfort was also good.   
The one thing I didn't like was that accelerating onto the autobahn the thing was screaming its head off at 6000 rpm ! And the noise was really loud. Up to speed it was OK again and everything quieted down again. Minot gripes were that it felt like a big car, not very nimble even though the weight is not big (less than 1300 kg). Maybe this was because the steering was rather heavy. Also I could put the steering all the way up as I would have liked, it blocked my view of the speedo.   
I am still waiting for a testdrive in a diesel VW polo with DSG. The DSG is not a cvt, I am hoping the changing gear will not be annoying to me as I am a big cvt fan (love my GF's old fiat punto and my dads B170, both have cvt)...    
All in all I am having a hard time finding a nice car for around 30000 chf, there's always something wrong with them...

			Hi guys,   
I am looking to sell my MT03 motorbike, and have received several enquiries from people resident in surrounding France.    
Has anyone gone through the process of exporting a vehicle from Swizterland to France? I am interested to learn about whether the full TVA charge is applied, and how long the process may take?   
I have made several searches on the internet, and am planning to contact the douanes direct, but a personal experience often sheds more light on the situation that officials may not mention.   
Many thanks in advance.

Make sure you have a copy of it in the car/motorbike just in case you get stopped.

			Hello Folks,   
I hold a Indian Driving License, but have not driven here since the last 1.5 years. I was recently told by my HR that I will have to start the whole process from the beginning.   
Can anyone share his/her insights on this matter? Do I need to take the written test apart from giving the driving test?   
Thanks in advance

Though I received the invitation letter for the examination couple months later. Unfortunately the date of my driving test was exactly on the day of my graduation ceremony, I had to write back to the traffic department requesting a later or earlier date. It didn't take a week until another invitation letter was sent with an adjusted date 5 days later than the original.   
On the day of the test the driving instructor who examined me was pretty ok, we almost had an accident during the exam!! but was the other party's fault! haha   
As for driving lessons, I took them in Luzern with a cool instructor, charged me 85 Swiss Francs per hour, I took about 13-15 lessons (1 hour each lesson) so do the math. I think the lessons helped me very much, for this matter I also learned way more than I had with my Dubai drivers license.   
The examination driver + the license + conversion fee + postage cost me exactly CHF 215 if I remember correctly. Passed the test and my Dubai license was returned with a white sticker on the back stating ""Invalid to drive in Switzerland""

I just checked Europcar, for a one month rental on a compact (VW Polo or similar) it returned a rate of 1,959.96 chf. (includes 3,000km) but a similar compact from Mobility costs 780.- chf. (includes 1,250km). If you absolutely need 3,000km then the extra 1,750km on the Mobility car will cost an extra 350.-chf (0.20 per km). That's still nearly half of what a normal car rental would want.

6598	09.09.2009, 18:16	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 8 Times in 7 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Thats the point.  with human intervention I wouldnt have been ticketed because it is unreasonable to ticket someone for staying 45 seconds in a deserted bus lane at one minute into the ticket window on a sunday.   
We do actually pick and choose the laws we obey for all but the most reserved people.  do you ever drive over the speed limit ? i mean ever, by 1kph ?  then that shoudl be a ticket.  ever drop litter even once in your life, then you should be fined under the military style absolute law your imposing.   
And why do we have courts ?  in a world where you break the law you get punished, what is the point of sentencing guidelines.  because in a world where you absolutely get the punishment for breaking the law there wouldnt be people let off for first offences because your saying its the law, take the ticket (or sentence).  What a judge does is humanize that into a suitable punishment, often letting people off under certain circumstances - one of which for example might be that a bus lane ticket at 7.01 is unfair when you look at it sensibly and not like a computer program.

			My first post on this forum comes with an answer to the author of this thread.   
A colleage of mine from my unviversity in Switzerland had the same situation. She had been living in Switzerland for more than 1 year, and recently drove her car from Bulgaria with Bulgarian plates on, and been driving it in Switzerland with a driver's license from Bulgaria. When she was stopped by the Kontrole / Random police checks, the police told her she has been living in Switzerland with a B-Permit for over a year already, and had to obtain a Swiss drivers license in order to continue driving legaly in the country. She said she had not known about law, and the police said, its her responsibilty to check the law rules. Well later, nothing really happened, and she proceeded to change her license to a Swiss one, but was also sent a fine of 600 CHF because she was driving with foreign license, and been in Switzerland for over a year.   
I had a situation myself, when I was stopped by controle, I showed them my UAE drivers license, then they asked for the international booklet as well, that time it was at my apartment, and forgot to carry it with me. They were so nice as to follow all the way to my house, and to my home lol. I showed the international driving booklet, and my B-Permit, and everthing was ok. The police officer advised me that in 2 months, I need to get a Swiss license, because I will have surpassed more than 1 year in the country.

			The oyster card is more like a pre-paid phone card, only smarter. You can travel most everywhere, and the fare gets deducted for every trip up to a daily limit. It's nice, I have two for the occasional trip to London.   
Our CH ""travel cards"" are not much like this. It's a card you purchase (pre-pay) for a certain time period (1 day, week, month, year), for a certain ""zone"" or for travel between two defined points.  
This is usually a good deal if you use it to go to work for example, 5 days a week. Any less and you may want to consider buying your tickets from the machines at any station as needed.   
Halb-tax (Half-fare) cards are usually nice to have if you travel often between cities. See sbb.ch for all the details in English. 
http://mct.sbb.ch/mct/en/reisemarkt/...te/halbtax.htm 
After a few trips to St Moritz or Zermatt, the card pays for itself.   
I'm sure if you search the EF, you will find a few references on this subject.

This entitles you to buy monthy tickets for 43 CHF (or 430 a year) rather than 70 a month.

			People doing this needs counseling. And yeah I agree that same punishment should be given to people caught texting while in the high way. But the problem is how can we detect people texting while driving?   
I know that most of us are aware of safety precautions while driving but we tend to neglect it maybe because of our confidence in our driving skills. Well it is still about priority. If we care for our life and the lives of other people then then don't drink, don't text, don't make a call, etc.. while driving.

			Well KTM may not make mopeds any more, but the company very definitely exists and makes some fabulous motorbikes. See  .   
I would try your local KTM dealer as a start. The three dealers in Aargau are:   
Bahnhofgarage Keller AG 
Hauptstrasse 76 
5326 Schwaderloch (Aargau)   
Moto Mader AG 
Ausserfeldstrasse 20 
5036 Oberentfelden (Aargau)   
Ulrich KTM Service 
Huettenweg 5 
5103 Möriken (Aargau)   
More info  .   
Might not be cheap, but if anyone can get a copy made I would have thought it would be them.

			Hi everyone. 
I am leaving Basel in a near future, and I intend to take my belongings to Spain. 
It is not much, a few boxes, and couple of bycicles, therefore when I have contacted a removal agency they don't seem interested. (Basicly they don't reply to my emails) 
Do you know of any company which would take my things?   
Is the swiss post a good option? I tried to read the information in their website, but I couldn't understand much.   
Any advice would be really helpful.   
Thanks!   
Emilio.

But as the law is written, you should stop at Swiss customs and present documents; the easiest way is to hire a customs broker to post a bond for you and then you continue on your way and your customer provides passport and visa information and signs a claim (if entitled) to duty-free entry.   
I use man-and-a-van enterprises from time to time, and on one occasion in each direction I have used professional movers. The man-and-a-van tends not to file papers. The professional movers do it right and send me the documents by overnight post for completion and filing. (The transport in each case is between London and Valais or Geneva.)   
I have never been asked to pay anything by Swiss customs when bringing in stuff in my car, although once or twice (since I have a Swiss passport and UK plates on my car) I have been asked for evidence that I live in the UK.   
Hope that helps.

Remember toi fix the paintowrk if drilling through side panels! But check the Euro MR2 - it probably uses the bumper sidelight as the indicator light. Change the light fitting and wire to indicators = easy!!   
2) The entire headlamp assembly needs replacing, if yours is DOT only. Replacement headlamps should be obtainable from a wreckers yard in CH or Germany. Of course, if yours says DOT / ECE then you'll be fine.

			Thanks for all the info everyone.  I was kinda trying to avoid having to go to Zurich or Geneva first, hence looking at Basel flights, but might look at the Amsterdam option more thoroughly than I did, and Newcastle is something I didn't think of at all.  Easyjet would be fine, but that's Geneva.  Lufthansa and Swiss are looking pretty good so far, via Frankfurt and Manchester respectively.  Heathrow was way too nuts last time I was there so will try to skip London altogether if I can!   
Plenty of time to do the research though I guess if I want the cheapest fare I'll have to book aeons in advance!

			Yep, exactly Boxman. Except, I don't see it as much of a problem - it's just a matter of following protocol. In fact, there was no hassle at all for us because we already new about the 3-year rule   approaching the DMV office here.   
Both my husband and I had been driving in California for 10+ years prior to our move, but had to renew our licenses within the last 2 years. Therefore, our current US licenses appear to indicate that we have been driving for less than the required three. This is precisely why we made a stopover at the California DMV during our vacation to pick up our driver's license histories.   
It amazes me that people think the process of moving to a foreign country is easy as pie. Yes, things are frustrating, but they can be less so with a bit of preparation.

You can't exactly request an English speaking instructor, but you can put a comment on the form you send off for the test and I'm told that they will try and accomodate you if possible and you might just get lucky.   
For lessons there are loads of English instructors you just need to ask around.

			Shouldn't be too difficult (well, actually everything is a pain in the ass to get done in Spain) if you follow Miquel's advice. If there is anything special about the cars that you think will create problems in the import process I can get you the name of an Asesoria that we used to import a car from the US to Spain a few years ago. He took care of all the bureaucratic issues for us for a fee.    
On the other hand, I've known people that have had foreign-licensed cars in Spain for years and have never had any issues. If you are planning on being there for several years, I wouldn't recommend that. If you're just there for a few years it may be something to consider.

			Well, I have now, thanks to a very helpful neighbour who saw me with the bonnet up, diagnosed my car problem.    
I do have small creatures messing with my car, but apparently they have 2 legs and are not at all furry.   
In fact they are otherwise known as *MY [insert swear word] CHILDREN*. The little darlings left the interior light on unbeknown to me and this has drained my battery. She noticed my light on in my car on Saturday when she came home at midnight, and then again on Sunday, when she very helpfully rang the bell to tell us - but we were out.       so no Marder here - at least not in the Marten/weasel sense - perhaps there may be some ""marder"" in the sense of Taggart version of ""murder"" when it comes to the kids tomorrow.   
After a jump start and a ride round town for a while it seems to be cured.

			I agree with PC A. Sell or give away everything that does not have a sentimental value. Replacing things in Canada (nor sure where you are going, are you staying with family to start etc.) with be cheaper than shipping stuff from CH.   
Then the next question will be how fast do you need the stuff. Since you only have a a flat's worth of stuff (less what you sell), it might make more sense to go with airfreight. Or you could look at using the CH post office if you can break stuff down into 30kg boxes (get proper boxes). Takes more time but can be an interesting option for stuff you do not need right away.

			I did the same thing a lot while living in Ontario, before moving here. I would sell the bikes I repaired / built for more than I paid for them, but this barely covered the costs of the tools and parts that I had to buy. However, it helped me to learn a lot about bike maintenance - working on the cheapest bikes and parts is so much harder than working on better quality stuff.   
I have a few lower-quality parts that I wouldn't mind donating to such a good project, plus I have many tools that may be useful for you to borrow occasionally. We should get together and discuss this over a beer - send me a PM.

They are 5 minutes walk from Zurich HB. The guys in there are really very good. I bought my Triumph from them and they have looked after me ever since, nothing is ever an issue and prices are cheaper than in London for sure.

I am looking to buy a Renault Trafic Generataion, 2nd hand in Germany and register it in France.    
Does anyone have any experience of doing this?   
Cheers,

			thanks much... this is already a great news because i think they can be quite harsh with the technical check... hopefully the paperwork wont be so expensive (as the scooter is more or less 900 euro worth...)

			Exact, plus you cannot transfer it so impossible to transfer it. You can still try to discuss with their customers service. I got refunded once but it was because it was an international trip.

			Hi all 
my husband and I are moving ourselves to Zug in a van shortly!  We have been advised that border controls are extremely strict and that all boxes need very detailed contents' descriptions, including value, etc.  Does anyone know if this is the case please?  I am asking, as a lot of our stuff is already boxed from our recent move from London to Germany and it would mean having to go through the whole lot again with a lot more detail, which would be simply tedious!  Any advice at all would be very gratefully received!  Thank you very much - Nicola

			Hi,   
where is the option, who needs a car with swiss public transport working so well ? I used to  have a car in the UK but I have never needed one in the 20 years I have been in Switzerland. My answer would have been zero...which does not seem to be option.   
It is one of things I really like about being here...not needing a car.   
Have fun 
Martin

			If you're renting the car in Switzerland, it will have a vignette on it.  If you are renting over the border in France, it probably won't.   
My guess is that a non-Swiss rental agreement will not reimburse you for the cost of the vignette.

			It's just the fact they were able to change details on my insurance. In the UK, the police and such can view insurance details, but never ever change them. Only the policy holder can do that. 
I guess I'm just used to a system where access to these sorts of things is, in theory anyway, much more restricted...

			Hi all,   
I just moved from Bucharest(Romania) to Geneva for 3 years and i found a motorcyle to buy in another canton for my wife. I have only 2 questions     
1. Which are the steps that need to be followed in order to register the motorbike in Geneva and if i would like to drive it to my address where i could get plates from (assuming that the seller will keep his original plates).   
2. I have also brought in my own bike from home and as far as i know i have 1 year to register it here. Could anyone advise a web link for the authorithy that is entitled to handle this (registration forms, etc)   
Thanks upfront,   
Radu

			Also ask your employer if you can get a   (fleet rebate) through them. My (Swiss) co-worker who I mentioned above wasn't aware of these and got totally excited when I told him, turns out it saved him an additional 1,000.-chf. on the purchase of a new Toyota Yaris.    
I joking say to the Swiss, if a Swiss wants to know more about Switzerland it's best he ask a foreigner as they're always better informed.   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Apr 2009	Groaned at 6 Times in 1 Post	Buyin a new car, what country?	benneesom	Posts: 216

			I'll echo what Mike Frewer says- come into Basel on the Autoroute, and at the border, tell the customs bloke you are only going to Basel and will not use the Autobahns. After the border, take the first exit off to the right (signed towards Allschwil). They will not make you buy a vignette. My parents do this every time they visit me. It will be quicker than taking a detour.

			thanks for the list   
but it seems there are not many places left, and are probably usually fully used. and also nothing in or near Oerlikon 'unlimited'. I also have friends coming for few days, but we will use our car, so we just need to park their car anywhere. Maybe you know a list of free parking places outside of city of Zurich, but inside a canton ? preferably just to the north of city borders    
besides parking in front of for example 'Oberhalb Waidspital' for a very long time, would be strange to me. even though it is listed in this pdf file, isn't it for patients or something?

			I guess it depends on whether you plan to buy it in Switzerland or outside.  If it has been registered in CH before, I guess the oldest you can find.   If not, then I seem to remember that import may be more complicated.   But someone with a better knowledge / memory might come around to clarify.

Nope, Megabus.com or Citylinks.co.uk do not stop at Edinburgh Airport! 
You'll have to come to Edinburgh city by bus (only 25 min bus journey), stop around haymarket and then take a Edinburgh-Glasgow bus (about 1h-1h30 journey).   
total probably 1h45-2h journey.   
it costs £3.5 single for one way airport to city, then Citylink or megabus it depends...can be cheap or up to £10 maximum (usually about £7...).   
Hope that helps!

 Alternatively, search this forum as there are sometimes offers from people moving to/from Switzerland who have space in their van/truck/trailer. Some even do regular trips between UK and CH so maybe you can get a cheap deal on a scooter sized space in the back of a van????

In Germany, for example, some farm tractors and also some ambulances, fire engines etc fall into this category. I'm not sure what the criteria are that the vehicle must fulfill. I don't think the Swiss system has a comparabale category.

			Train travel can work out quicker overall.  The check in procedures are much easier (almost non-existant).  There are no baggage restrictions to speak of.   
It is a less stressful way to travel.  At present, the price is the only downside as there are often very good airline prices, depending on the route.

			Patmi, you're supposed to bicycle on the right side of the road if there's no bicycle lane.   
The obligatory license costs 5-7 Fr., depending on where you buy it. It covers 2 m Fr. damages done to others (not to yourself). If you scratch a car or hurt a pedestrian without having a ""Velovignette"" you'll have to cough up for all the damages starting at the first centime because most other insurances don't cover it for you.   
According to the  , every bicycle must have by law: There you have it. Police controls are very rare but it's your safety, isn't it? One night, I've noticed a bicycle driver who managed to break virtually every other rule I've listed only because of the pedal reflectors!    
The license is common and accepted, in my oppinion. I'd have estimated that four out of five bicycles have one, according to   NZZ article (PDF/German) 83% of Switzerland's approximately 4 million bicycles have one.

			I have this information from a Swiss conductor's   which by the way isn't the worst way to practice your German  : It is allowed to interrupt a one way trip but you have to inform the first conductor before he devaluates your ticket. In the comments he stated that passengers not following this rule probably are a very rare occurence, but if you don't, by the book the conductor has to sell you another ticket for the second part of your trip.

			Hi,    
I just got a job in Lugano (leaving London) and I am asked to start work there on September 1st. 
All of this is great but I have been on benefit for some time and I am broke. 
What is the cheapest way for me to move me and all my junk there, considering that I don't have a drivers license.   
anyone knows of a reliable and not extortionate moving company or other ways?   
I would really appreciate the help!!   
XOXO

			have you seen this promotion ?    
do you know if it is of any use for people who recently moved to switzerland? i have my heimatort outside of switzerland    
some people at my company were suggesting, that it is also valid for foreigners, but only one-way and sponsored by SVP    
maybe this answers my question, but please confirm, i'm not sure:    so Swiss people cannot choose where they go, but foreigners can?   
also it says with residence permit it's valid only for SBB stations between Arth-Goldau and Göschenen. Which is only 50 km long, so maybe my question should be, is there anything worth seeing between?

Those are two fundamentally different ways of calculating prices.   
So, to re-use NotAllThere's example.   
The SBB fare from Basel to Bern is the price from Basel SBB station to Bern station. That ticket is valid on any reasonable service by any reasonable route between those two stations.   
Equally, the SBB ticket from Liestal to Bern is valid on any reasonable service by any reasonable route between those two stations.   
Now if you have an Abo that covers the zones of Basel SBB, Liestal and whatever there is in between, you can travel from any place in those zones to any other place in those zones. You can, for example, travel from Basel SBB to Liestal. Then in Liestal you can catch a train to Bern. If the train you used to come to Liestal continues to Bern you can even hop straight back onto that same train and into the same seat you were in before. Only you have ended one trip and begun the next by putting one foot outside the train. Now, rather then be pedantic and demand you put one foor outside the train, SBB says it is sufficient that the train has stopped and that you could have put one foot outside the train.

			You can bring your car with you as personal effect and use it with American plates up to 1 or 2 years (not sure which). You don't need to do any administration. It's as if you just drove it here.   
But, even if you import one for Swiss registration from day one you are still BETTER off than buying here. 
In that case you have to pay 4% import tax and 7.6% VAT a.k.a. sales tax. 
So all in all you are looking at a 12% premium on top of the US price. 
I give you an example: 
BMW 335i, US retail $40,000 
BMW 335i, Swiss retail 64k CHF = $59,000 
Even if you add the %12 import tax and shipping you are still saving around $10k.   
Plus, when you go back to the US and still have the car it's easy to bring it back and register it (being US spec model).     
just my 2c

			10 years ago an Italian colleague resident in Zurich at the time was getting Swiss fines in Italy (he commuted weekly for a year). So Italy is covered.    
I have been fined in 2005 in Germany for a Swiss infraction in Zürich so Germany is covered.   
Germany and Austria recognize each others points for some years now, like Ireland and UK are about to including bans starting with Northern Ireland.   
One of the open questions is if Switzerland will start with points and agree a points exchange program.   
It's all part of the EU driving license program to gradually exchange more and more info beyond just recognizing each others licenses. Even within the EU this is being done bilaterally for legal reasons.  
One of the issues is the multiple still valid versions of licenses per country (there's a document on it on the EU website).  
Another is the lack of consistency of points offences and fines for the same offences (see the table the TCS/DAS produces each summer).  
Finally the EU realises it needs to recognize bans EU wide as it's still legal after a ban to pass a driving test in another EU state and drive back home without going through special arrangements applicable in your home state (like in Germany).  
This is also possible as the rules on residency to qualify for license testing/issuance are light. In addition exchanging can clean your record from another state's point of view.   
I agree with the pragmatic motivation mentioned earlier for the Swiss probably best summarised as: ""Gibts geld?....OK"".

			Relatively new here but  also a dyed in the wool Series (older stuff) Landy Fanatic so this may not be the most unbiased of posts.   
The TD5 engine was and is a very capable unit as is the gearbox and drive train.   
The second generation of Disco's have the rust problem sorted and are complete galvanised body shell rather than a chassis. Due mainly to a huge management reshuffle at Land Rover as they recognised they were producing poor quality vehicles. Pre TD5, the 200TDi and 300TDi Discoveries are rust buckets unless you Waxoyle them regularly but the engines are bomb proof.    
Tales of gearboxes falling out I feel are exagerated and you could proabably say the same about most vehicles. They all have freak things happen to them (mainly due to poor maintenance)   
All but the most modern release of Land Rovers DO have their quirks but owners live with them.    
The Land Cruiser is an excellent vehicle too and the choice for many overlanders.   
I have  a 30 year old ex RAF 109"" Series 3. It's done 500,000, been to South Africa and back on its original engine. Plus we can get the tandem in the back.   
The disco also very capable off road not the same league as the Defender but still far ahead of the competition. If you can get a ride off road (non damaging please to the envinment and car) go for it. Is there a Land Rover Experience in Switzerland. If you buy a new LR product in GB you get a free half days training in off road driving techniques. Don't know if its the same in Switaerland.   
They are exellent towing vehicles too as they have stacks of low down torque.   
My brother has a Series 2 Disco (from new) and as far as I know has had no problems and the only trips to the garage are for scheduled servicing. He's been to Morroco twice and is in Iceland at the moment.   
Have a look on   and have a look on the Discovery Section. Lots of info here.   
Go test drive some.   
Hope this helps

When we lived in Basel (well outside the centre of the city) Mr. L had to cruise around looking for a parking place each evening  and remember where the car was each morning.      In some towns, parking regularly at the roadside has to be paid for, but a specific place is still not guaranteed.      In the blocks of owner occupied flats near here, one parking space belongs to each flat. Now that several of the flats are lived in by elderly people who dont drive, or no longer do so, there are parking places which are rented out to others but a few years back, getting hold of a second parking place was really difficult.      At the other end of the scale, I have seen apartments each with a double garage, room to park two cars in front of them, and a visitors parking spot as well!   	made some interesting contributions	Join Date: May 2009	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Two Cars , is it realistic?

			Dear all,   
I have just moved to Switzerland and still have my UK car - I'm currently planning to take it back to the UK, sell it and get a Swiss car, so I was wondering if anyone is planning a move back to the UK or knows someone who is, so that I could do a swap?   
The car is a BMW 328i, year 2000, very sporty, with all extras for the year, in very good condition and several replacements made recently (new tyres, shocks, brakes) and it has had 2 services in the last 10 months.  The value is around £3,600 (around 6,000 CHF according to Google).   
If anyone is interested in the next few months, send me a private message.   
Many thanks, 
Lisa

It fits into a Luton van - 14m3 
You deal with all the customs stuff, though I expect we will arrive through a non-customs point (or after it is closed). 
You pick it up on Sunday morning 19th July from Chailly, Lausanne.

			San Bernadino Pass is a decent suggestion. I would avoid the Gotthard tunnel at all costs unless you are travelling at 4 in the morning especially on a Saturday mid August.   
I do the route over the Gottard Pass regularly in the summer months, to be honest the tourist traffic is never that bad. The road is so winding that you can't go too quickly anyway. It can be a bit scary if there is low cloud and you are not used to travelling through thick mist however you will be rewarded with some lovely scenery once above the cloud! Also several nice restaurants in Andermatt or Airolo for some lunch, or do what we do and have a picnic near the lake at the top.   
Any more specific questions feel free to ask.     
Actually one other thing, the queues at the South Portal (your direction) of the Gottard tunnel will be much worse mid August. You just need to ensure you get off the Autobahn at the right place. I don't leave it to the last one at Airolo as the traffic often backs up way past there, the one before that is signed Quinto I think.

			With the learners license, I think you need a co-driver with the BE license (maybe he must've owned it for some time, too). I don't know what's the recommended or mandatory amount of lessons/driving experience before the practical examn. I suggest to approach the road traffic department of your canton to investigate, they have a good reputation on EF and might well answer in English. If you do so, please report back, I'm also curious about the regulation.

			Hello, I will be relocating to the Basel area in the next couple of months. I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on whether or not to bring my scooter with me.    
I have a 125cc Italjet, which my company is happy to ship overseas for me at no cost. I have heard that it can be difficult to import older cars into Switzerland without having to make expensive repairs to comply with Swiss auto standards. Would the same hold true for a scooter? I already own it, and it won't cost me anything to ship it, but it would would bug me to spend a lot of money over there to get it street legal and registered. Any Suggestions? Thanks.

			Just over a year now. I bought it over and declared it at customs over the new year, and it's already on Swiss insurance. At the moment I'm just working out exactly what I'll have to pay, to who, to convert it and my driving license, and then what taxes etc apply on an ongoing basis. 
Needless to say it doesn't look like it's going to be cheap!    
Is there anywhere you know of that will inspect the car and tell me what I need to do to pass the MFK please? I know I need to switch the headlights, but I've also heard from people I work with that you have to get your engine steam-cleaned, and have the car as spotless as possible inside and out, before they'll even look at it...

Wrong from your point of view, perhaps. But if you've rented a car, it's reasonable to assume that you're the one driving it, unless you claim otherwise. Is it really reasonable for the police to believe that you were switching drivers so often you can't remember who was driving on a given stretch of road? Perhaps, perhaps not, but it's not like you're driving across America here...   
You're obviously concerned about going to jail, which is an unlikely outcome. Just pay the fine and accept that one of you may not be able to drive in Switzerland for a while.

			Hello,   
I have to move back to the UK (Bristol area) mid July and after looking at one-way car hire decided there must be cheaper options! I don't have much stuff - probably about 3m3 (just books, clothes etc no furniture) and therefore wondered if anyone has space in a van? Alternatively can anyone suggest a good way of getting my stuff back? Swiss Post seems a reasonable option (?). Many thanks, Simon

			Hi,   
The more specifications about the model you have, the better it is when you speak to the Volvo garage.  
FYI, we imported a (2007) Volvo from the US last year, and all changes that had to be done were easy and inexpensive (I think less than CHF 2000), and the Volvo garage even took the car through the inspection at STVA for us for a very reasonable price.  
In our case, the biggest headache was to find out all the regulations for tax-free import, decide whether the move was worth it, arrange everything and move from a mid-continent location in the US (which brought up the moving cost considerably). But all in all, it very much depends on how much you value your time.    
Hope this is helpful.

			Normally lease cost does not incl. insurance and servicing - unless specifically mentioned.  For CHF 500 I would think not.   
I find fuel here cheaper than UK but insurance in our case was more.   In addition you have to pay annual motorway tax (CHF 40) plus annual ""road tax"" (verkehrsabgabe) depending on car I believe.   
No idea about servicing cost (yet).   
You should also factor in a set of winter wheels     
If I got something wrong, I am sure someone will correct me.   
Don't forget to push for discount when buying the car.

			Hi, I moved to CH about 4 months ago and as soon as I had my card for my residence permit I was able to get a credit card through UBS.  They did have a requirement to block the amount of the credit card in my savings (for instance if you want a $2000 CHF limit on your credit card, they need to block $2000 in your connected savings account) but I thought that was reasonable enough and a credit card makes things so much easier... 
Perhaps you could try UBS...?

So far I had no luck in getting a (reasonable) Van rental quote from other major companies. The best I have found so far is Sixt, they offer vans with flat mileage for decent prices.   
Searching the forum did not help a lot, it seems most of ppl here come from farther then rely on freighter or similar or closer, then they rely on ""man with van"" aka ""gregory"".    
if you have any other van suggestion, please share!   
Thanks

			Let me insert my 5 cents.   
People tend to buy cars at dealer shops because the reparation fees in CH are quite expensive. So its better to take car with insurance of 3 month and be relaxed for that time. However, in this case you overpay some extra money as-well.   
Normally, cars in CH are good. Because of strict rules and strict fines (people tend to drive maximum 120 km per h and this saves the engine, as it is not rotated that high), strict expertise (MFK) and all those tests like antipollution, etc. So, if the car has antipollution sticker, it passed expertise, its kilometrage is not above 120K it is a good deal even at private person. Special moments to pay attention when buying at private person:   
1)	Make sure it is not Yugoslavian guy (I do not judge usually by nation, but I have met multiple cases when yougoslavians tried to fool me and my friends; mostly buying BMWs)   
2)	Ask guy when it was serviced and ask clarification  bills, reports; if the guy has difficulties to answer when oil was changed, cancel the deal   
3)	Ask when distribution belt was changed. This is quite critical part of the engine, as on 16v engines the break of belt causes damages of valves. The change is quite costly as well, it is hard to change yourself, and in garage they will ask over 1000CHF for that. So better to make sure it is changed before. Get bills and check if possible. (P.S. All BMW from 2.0L and higher has the distribution chain, which is not breaking, but it can also be probablematic because of extra long shifts in chain, so listen the sound of engine : ) )   
4)	Check the underground part, more specifically the isolation of Constant-velocity joint ( )  this applies only for front wheel cars. If isolation is damaged, the unit might be damaged with dust and water, and it will pass away soon  It is also expensive. At expertise (MFK) they do not check that, i.e., if isolation is broken they do not fail expertise. So keep an eye on it.   
5)	Ask if guy has winter tyres, etc. Usually car is sold with two set of tyres. If there is no second set, this is a reason to ask to lower the price.   
If any of the above is met, this is a way to ask the price to go lower; or even a good reason to visit garage to make detailed investigation of car and its potential problems.

			Most curbside parking spaces are blue zones. If you search the forum area for blue zone you'll find heaps of information.   
""White zone"" parking space is explained here:       
The allowed time to stay varies from 30 minutes to several hours. As far as I remember there usually are periods where you don't have to pay, like Sundays, but I'm not sure that the time and weekday rules are standardised. Maybe somebody else knows more...

			Mike,   
If I'm not mistaken, if you imported the car as part of your household goods (and therefore didn't pay any VAT), you need to wait 1 year before you can sell the car. If you sell earlier, I guess you would still have to pay the import taxes/VAT retroactively.

			Don't worry, just apply for another learning license, take your time getting used to the bike, do the mandatory course and your license gets extended for another 12 months. So all the time in the world if you take it seriously. In case you fail at the first test just reapply. Depending on the canton you might be in difficulty if you have to apply for the 3rd time.. but then you have only yourself to blame imho.

			Hey Jmavatar, I am glad you were able to shed the CB 500, even though that would've been a nice bike.   
I love 80's bikes, used to drive a nice VF750F of that vintage.   
Now I am a bit more modern, I cut off the mullett and moved into the 90's with an XJ600S Diversion.   
Insurance ... Zurich came highly recommended and had the best deal for me.   
MFK ... I have mine coming up later this month and can let you know how it goes. I know they are very detail-oriented, including the protective gear you are wearing.

			I have some items (furniture, boxes with books etc) that I'd like moved from Holland (Alkmaar) to Zürich. There is no urgency in this as their present storage location is guaranteed for the next 2 years or so at least and I have no pressing need for these things (inherited heirlooms). However, if anybody has or knows of any van or truck going that way and you can offer to take these things for a reasonable rate I'd appreciate if you'd get in touch.

			I used to work with a guy who commuted from a village outside Schaffhausen to Aarau every day by train (almost 2 hours). He had a 1st class GA mind you, and he said it was the only thing that made that trip tolerable. This was special circumstances though, as his family situation wouldn't allow him to move and closer to work. He also had an arrangement with the boss that allowed him to work on the train and count part of that towards his total work time (quite a lot of people I know do this so its worth asking).    
However, if you can a way to live closer to work I would. Anyway, I guess rent, property prices etc must be cheaper in Biel than they are in Basel so why not consider the move?

			Hi all, 
I am hoping that someone out there will be able to help and or point me towards some people / information if possible.   
As usual it's a long story and I won't bore you all with it, but the general guiste of it is;  
I used to live in England and I decided to do a last tour of Europe on my bike before moving oversea's. 
I had a problem when I was in Switzerland in which I had to leave my bike in switzerland for a period of time. 
I am now in a position to recover the bike but I have since moved to Australia (tickets booked and paid for) and so can't back to arrange for it to be shipped over to me.   
What I am looking for is some names or contacts that may be able to help in shipping a motorcycle from Switzerland.   
The bike is currently in a wharehouse in Bern and I want to get my bike picked up and then get it shipped to me in Australia.   
There are a couple of options I think. 
1) Ask a local motorcycle dealer / mechanic to pick up the bike and crate it up for me. 
Get a freight company to pick up the crate from the mechanic.   
2) Ask a freight company to pickup the bike and crate it up.     
Does anyone know of any Mechanic's that might be able to pick it up on my behalf and then crate it? 
And does anyone know of a freight companies that may be able to pick up a bike, Crate it for me?   
Also, does anyone know if I will have a problem with this as the Bike is a UK registered bike?   
or are there any other idea's that people may suggest?   
Cheers 
Morgan

			Since you have been living in Switzerland for more than 12 months your Indian licence is no longer valid for driving in Switzerland and you can't convert it to a Swiss licence. In order to get a Swiss licence you will have to pass the Swiss driving test. Even if you apply for an International Driving Permit, this will not allow you to drive in Switzerland because the IDP is only valid here if your Indian licence is valid in Switzerland - which it isn't. All an IDP does is translate and certify the validity of your Indian licence and isn't valid licence on it's own.  I can't help on whether your indian licence on it's own would be valid for driving in all other european countries (though I can't see why it shouldn't be if it hasn't expired) or whether you would need an IDP in conjunction with your indian permit.

			Are you talking about a motorized quad or a pedal-powered quad?  My understanding on the pedal-powered versions is that they just have to be smaller than 1m wide (i.e. ZEM's version,  , but they are out of business) with pedals for everyone.   
For the motorized versions, the advice given here above is very sound.

			If you were nearer to Lausanne then I'd offer to help - I have a truing stand and a spoke tension meter, plus I've built a few wheels from the hubs up. It takes a bit of practice, but read a few guides about it and watch the instructional videos, then give it a try. Over time you'll get the hang of it and you'll learn how the wheel will respond to certain changes. The three things to be most careful about are:  Best of luck!

			Doesnt sound good really. Not sure you've any options from a legal viewpoint as you have indeed signed a contract.   
Go back to your dealer and ask him to provide you with an interim car until such times as yours arrives, as a gesture of goodwill.  If he's not co-operative, talk to the headquarters of the car manufacturers and express displeasure with the dealer's service thus far and perhaps they'll endeavour to  help.   
As I say though, it would only be a gesture of goodwill, I don't think you have a leg to stand on, from a legal perspective.

			Don't pester me to much, my Beetle knowledge stems from my days as a child and teenager, (around 30 years ago now) where my dad fixed our Beetles and Combi Vans himself.    
I remember fondly working with him to remove the engine using levers made from planks of wood to get the engine and gearbox out so we could fix oil leaks. 
We also had a beach buggy project built on a VW chassis and motor, sadly it never got completed.   
So to remove a speedo is a simple job in comparison. 
And these cars are so simple compared to what I play with today: no fuel injection, no digital engine management system, no multitude of databusses winding their way around the vehicle... a Beetle is a breeze to work on!!   
And yes, I strongly recommend you keep whatever parts you have to remove or change on the car for future use or simply for sentimental value :-)

			Hi,   
I am moving to CH in August (can't wait!) and want to get rid of an old car here and buy another another  moving.  My question is whether I can import the new car tax-free by importing it 5 months after I become domicile in CH??   
I've read all the threads I could find on import duty and I am still uncertain as to how the grace period of 'at least 6 months of use' for personal effects  is calculated.   
Assume the car is registered in June 2009. 
I move to CH in August 2009. 
I import the car in December 2009 (6 months after buying it)   
Which statement is correct?   
1) The car is  subject to tax since it was registered to me before I became domiciled and it's been owned for 6 months before the date of import.  (It may be hard to prove I've been using for those 6 months though!)   
2) The car  subject to tax because it was registered to me less than 6 months before I became domiciled, irrespective of when I actually imported it.   
The custom form  seems to imply that it could be the former and that you have 12 months or so to import all your personal effects.   
Thanks, 
Stu

			They've been doing road works there for a while, not sure how long it'll be closed but if you head towards Thalwil (on the Seestrasse, not the A3) then up the hill past Oberrieden See BH you can turn left at the traffic lights to Gattikon then pick up the Sihltalstrasse which will take you back to the Zug road. Saves you heading to town to the tunnel.

			Hi there, we live in France, near Basel, and will be hiring a van to bring some furniture over from the UK. As we can't do a one-way rental, we will be driving it EMPTY from Basel to Northampton in the UK. We can drive some items (furniture etc) back for you if you contribute to the costs (van hire, petrol, tolls, ferry etc). We can pick up from the Basel/ Basel land/ Alsace area, and drop off between Dover and Northampton. 
Date is likely to be a weekend towards the end of June/ start of July.  
Van internal measurements are 4.35m x 2.06m x 2.30m.

			What is difficult to believe is that in the between 6:09 and 10:09 there are no direct trains from Zürich HB to Flüelen/Altdorf/Brunnen. There used to be one at 8.09 but its been replaced by an ICN which even if it did stop at these stations is a reservation-only for bicycles. This train used to be packed with cyclists and hikers disembarking at these three stations.

			Many stores rent vans for around 35-40 per hour. Interio, Ottos and Lipo certainly do it. Biggest problem is parking the darn thing overnight - we ended up taking it back and collecting again the next morning. You may also need a permit to park it outside your apartment block when loading/unloading (I am not joking). Don't do any moving before 7am, between 12 and 1, unless you want to annoy your neighbours. Someone might call the cops on you too. Sunday is obviously forbidden too.   
One of my neighbours comes running out in his PJs and tells off the Coop delivery driver when he delivers at 8pm. Better to stick to the rules and avoid the nutters.

Tbh, I regretted my choice of attire the moment I arrived at my destination, but unfortunately nothing could be done by then as several km's seperated me from what I wanted to wear and what I was actually wearing. That being said I'm sure  I photographed well. Oh, my nails were fine too, except for one.   
There will be at least two problems with the portrait. The car was not clean as I had a choice of being on time or having a clean car with a certain amount of km's worth of bug juice on the windshield anyway (being on time was the chosen option) As well, one headlight is a little bit brighter than the other and I have yet to have that corrected by my friendly garagiste who actually likes Chihuahua's.   
I'm hoping it will be in black and white too.

			I also use Autop at Letzipark... Though, not being able to stop the timer, and not being able to get a low pressure flow is not very good... Sometimes, you wanna soap a part and rinse it before the soap dries and stains the body. Also I wanna remove some paint chip and scratches, got some Meguiar's products I want to try, a good hand wash before would be nice.   
This Tiefenbrunnen stuff looks fine, might be worth to treat the car with professional cleaning once in a while...

			Hi There,   
You should have the full range of Vespa's to choose from - even here! The S version would be my personal choice too, with the injection engine you will have that extra bit of speed and the vehicle itself is a hell of a lot cooler looking than the regular LX 50. However be prepared to pay quite a bit more for the extra aesthetics!      
If you buy the scooter 'abroad' you will need to   the vehicle, which I believe a local dealer can help you with. But be careful, as some countries have varying legaslation for small things eg: the angle/height of the headlamp. This means that your scooter must conform to the laws of the country you are registering it.   
It's easier to buy here is Switz, I'd avoid the Italian dealerships if I were you, but sometimes the models ranged   vary country to country.   
Check out this link for local Vespa dealers in Ticino -       
You could even try calling Piaggio in Pontedera directly, asking if they have any Press/Marketing vehicles they are trying to sell - they may sell to you directly with a discount - as the scooters will have been slightly used.

I am interested in buying a Vespa S 50 but it is not imported in CH. This might be for homologation issue. But when I see the specification it seams like new  the Vespa S 50 are fine. Does any one have an idea about this, or how to preceed, what it might cost if technical change hasd to be made etc... 
Please advise.

			You have to take the examn in the canton of your residence and as far as I can see there's only one center for examns in Ticino. You'd also have to inquire if they offer the practical examn in English or French, which is not a given. (I don't think they outsource tests to third parties or are even allowed to do that.)       
Hopefully somebody with more experience can post an answer.   
Edit: Actually, there seem to be two examn locations at least for the car test: Camorino and Noranco.

			I recently was looking at Swiss Miles and More and booking flights on Swiss with my air miles. We are a family with three children, ie 5 persons. On line I could book 4 places on a plane no problem, but with the fifth person I had to contact Swiss. Do Swiss have a problem with 5 people? Or do we have to pay for the fifth person.

			...other than the article linked above which discussed two of the people, presumably on the same event as you, involved in illegal road racing...   
It would seem likely that the police had seen, or were aware of, this article, and as such you and your friend were targetted as being ""part of the same group"".  It's really not that big a leap mentally from ""group of car enthusiasts"" to ""car enthusiasts involved in illegal street racing"" (as in the article above) to ""gumball rally where people died this year.""

			OK, called Honda America, but they would not give me any information with regards to what is different, if anything, between VTX1800c manufactured in USA compared to VTX1800c manufactured in CH/EU. They were basically no help at all. Only thing they would give me is a letter that says bike meets USA EPA standards at time bike was manufactured. Lot a good that does me. I am trying to figure out if it is worth taking bike to CH when I move.   
Can someone that has imported a Honda from USA to CH let me know what issues you had, what modifications you had to do. Also, if you know if parts for USA vs CH manufactured bikes are the same and/or available locally. (important to know if repairs are need in future).

			I hope I will not be totally distracting from the OP's dilemma as I have my own to share which comes under the same topic and would also like some advice.    
My husband got stopped by the police about 3 months ago for a routine check and he was informed that he has 800 chf in speeding fines on our Uk registered car. They took our address down, but to this date we are still awaiting the fines to arrive through the post. Whilst I am constantly reminding him about his speed and we are very careful now, the fact that the fines haven't arrived is worrisome and we have no idea what we should be doing, other than wait for the police to stop us for another routine check and ask them (?).   
I would also like to add that these fine have probably been picked up for a period of many months and because the car isn't registered here, the police did not have our address and probably didn't know where to send the fines, however, now they do and are still not doing anything about it and like the OP we are worried that should we leave the country , whatever happens to the fines... and how would we ever prove that we received nothing through the post.

			Hi, I recently bought a car from a garage. After a while, when people asked about it, I found out that I do not have a sticker or paper for the exhaust emission stuff. I went to the garage, and they showed me the warranty document of the car, where a service has signed for checking 'auspuff' for the diesel engine with EOBD. He told me that, as the car had on-board computer , this counts as the abgastest, and he gave me a sticker for two years after the checking date.    
I am still not sure, if this is right. Has anyone else got their abgastest this way? Is it valid, or should they do a check where they measure the emission through the exhaust pipe?   
Cheers,

			There are many car free villages in the area such as Wengen and Murren. Usually these villages have longer term car parks close to the last car access point to the village. This is certainly the case in Saas-Fee and Zermatt, and I would be surprised if there wasn't something similar for the car free villages in Berner Oberland.

I'm planning a weekend trip to Prague to visit some friends. 
I'll be driving there on my own so if anyone wants to come along just send me a pm. 
Sharing expenses this would mean a very chep way to spend a weekend in Prague (100-150chf/pax). 
Here's the plan: leaving Zurich on Friday the 8th of May in the morning arriving to Prague short after lunch time. 
Returning on Sunday the 10th after lunch and make it to Zurich around 10pm.

			At the more basic level the Swiss prices can deliver better value than German prices for German manufactured/finished items eg basic VW Fox 9550 (14400 Fr.) in DE versus 13,200 Fr in CH.   
Whereas a basic smart in DE is 9900 (14,400 Fr.) versus 14,600  Fr. in CH.

			It's one of the most scenic bike rides around - through the vineyards and beside the lake. So, why is it important how long it takes?   
Robban's estimate is right if you stick to the lake route. There are several other options that go up the hill into the vineyards a bit that are obviously harder work and take longer.

Paid the import taxes after 2 years of living here on the value of the car then.

			I'm shopping for a motorbike at the moment, and I found one that seems good in all respects except one: the colour. It's a dark green that doesn't appeal to me, and I would worry when riding that the bike is not visible enough.   
Does anyone know of a shop or garage that does respraying in Zurich? Would I have to pay so much for this (and decrease resale value) that I'd be better off just looking for a different bike?

Congrats on finding a place! It must be a relief after all the hunting!    
I may have a bit of good fortune with the flat hunting. There is a place right around the corner from where I'll be working - the price is perfect and it's child friendly... I saw it on immoscout24 and there were plenty of pics.... the estate agent didn't speak english but one of my colleagues over there called her and went to see the flat for me, she said it was lovely and perfectly located so she got the forms for me.... I filled them in on Thursday and should find out today if I have it or not! Fingers crossed...    
I could store some stuff with my dad... to be honest, I think I'll just dump it all or have a car boot sale or something. I'm heading to Basel for a complete lifestyle change, so I don't really want to drag all of my UK life over there with me.      
Cheers!

			it is no problem bringing it back to CH, since it has a Stamm Nr which is a number unique to the vehicle, so reimporting it is not a problem.  We drove on Swiss plates in the UK for 6 months, but we did get a nasty letter when we stopped the Swiss Insurance and Direct Line insured the vehicle on Swiss plates. Swiss plates means you are insured, so if you stop the Insurance the Strassenvekehrsamt send you a nice letter. We sent the Swiss plates back by post, not before going through the SVA test, which is a longer MOT. Lights, speedo will have to be changed, may cost a small fortune with a new car. Also you need to make sure you have a reversing light on the left side I think it is.

			Use a company that will pack and unpack in Switzerland and will also handle the customs papers for the shipment, plus the import of the car, if you have one. We got three quotes in the UK, had a survey done and then went ahead. The problem was we had more than they quoted, we refused to pay extra and the shipment was held up by this. Cut a very long story short the load was put in a warehouse near Geneva and then a local Swiss company delivered it. We paid for a full pack unpack in the UK, the SWiss company refused to fully unpack in Switzerland.   
Lots of minefields, make sure you know what you are getting for your money.

You simply have 12 months to change the plates from UK to swiss plates (and to get the car certified by the motor vehicle inspection authority)   
You will have to pay tax of some sort - I forget how much - search in the forum for ""importing car"" - there's a zillion posts about it.

			To follow up the thread:      
So finally I started my negotiations with the dealers... To tell the truth I do not see any difference between car dealers in CH and in Eastern Europe - only the Swiss kept me waiting longer. I visited two Honda dealers having my homework done - prices, official discounts, versions, options. In both cases the sales guys started with trying to convince me that what is on the website is not true and the whole thing costs ca 2000 francs more. One of them even brought a strange nicely printed catalogue with prices higher than in the pricelist that they had on their shelf nearby. He seemed to have no idea what they have in stock now. I do not see any ""swiss quality"" in what they do, but if they try to play tough tricks I will play tough too.

You need to have insurance to get the licence plates, which are issued to the owner, and not to the vehicle. ie: the seller keeps his licence plates, and you fit yours. No insurance = no plates. 
To get insurance you need to be domiciled / live in Switzerland   
So first come here, get properly registered and domiciled, then it is easy to buy a car.

			Hi there   
You can walk through the border into Kleinhünigen and catch the very regular No 8 tram directly into the centre of Basel.  It will mean a bit of walking for you both but it is definitely doable!  It takes me approx 10 mins to walk the route from the Extrablatt (a great little restaurant in Weil), across the border to the tram stop.  If you have a 5 year old with you, it may take a little longer...   
As I understand it, children in Switzerland don't begin school until they are 6.  Before that, they attend a krippe or kindergarten.  I don't know whether your son would be eligible to attend a Swiss kindergarten or school if you live in Germany but I'm fairly certain it's possible.  A colleague of mine's son attends school in Basel and he and his family live across the border.  I know that there is a krippe close to Feldbergstrasse - maybe you could drop your son off there on the way to work each day and there must be plenty of others on this tram route.  There is also a Steiner School in that area of Kleinbasel.     
Hope this info is of use.  Good luck with the flat hunting!

			Random question here,   
Due to my Jag being a bit unreliable, I am tempted to take up a friend of mine on his offer to buy his car.   
It's ""technically"" a kit car, but due to the donor car being from the 60's, he's managed to get it with a tax exempt historic plate, and it doesn't need a ""Q"" plate (UK).   
In Germany, it's quite straightforward to bring an oldtimer in to the country and you get an ""H"" (historic) plate.  Dirt cheap tax and insurance then.   
What about in CH?  Not having seen too many old timers about on my travels, I'm not too sure what the Swissies think of them.     
Any suggestions out there?

If you don't have any luck with the bike shops in Geneva there is a second hand sport shop in Lausanne that buy and sell used bikes (and other sports equipment). I was in there the other day and I know that are looking for more second hand bikes.

			Hi!  My husband and I have just moved to Staefa, ZH (3 days ago infact) and we drove our car from the UK (Cambridgeshire) here with one overnight stop in Reims.   
We have our vehicle insured with Stuart Collins in the UK.  They were really efficient, although seem to do everything by post rather than internet or phone, but very prompt all the same.   
Premium was higher than we had previously paid, but I guess to be expected when living outside the UK.   
If you have any questions, please PM me.   
Hope your move goes well

The magical mystery tour bus is out of operation :-) The van must be a 3 seater to accomodiate myself, Paul and Ringo.

			For those of you that have brought a vehicle in to Switzerland from the US, did you have tires that were not 'E' marked?    
I have a set of 255/70R18 tires on a spare set of OEM wheels identical to the 'E' marked tires I have in Switzerland. I know the DOT approved tires are illegal in the EU, but I don't know if they are OK for use in CH. It would be a shame to waste a perfectly good set of 3,000 mile tires just because they are not 'E' marked.   
An example of an 'E' marked tire. See the E 11 in a circle.    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Jun 2007	Groaned at 16 Times in 4 Posts	Non 'E' marked DOT approved tires	MoabMan	Posts: 199

I spent ages looking for a bike last summer and I couldn't find anywhere that was 'cheap'. I found that in general, bikes hold their value in Switzerland so you will probably have to pay good money. Best thing to concentrate on is warranty, service and any extras that you can get them to throw in. Good luck.   
Actually, I am getting ready to sell my 2004 R1 if youre interested? Most garages want around 10500 to 11500CHF for a similar one. You can have mine for 9500CHF or nearest offer! I'll be putting it up in the 'For Sale' section later this weekend.

			In the You Tube of the Day thread I noticed that Nathu mentioned the lack of cyclists in a video. Knowing his interest in cycling etc. I thought this site to be worth a mention:   
Coincidentally today, I saw reference to this website in the 'Inside Switzerland' Newsletter March '09.          Quote:      While good public transport is a given in much of Europe, theres been considerably less thought devoted to the self-powered  those who prefer to walk, ride a bicycle, or canoe. Once again, Switzerland is the exception: it seems the Swiss have thought of canoers, just as they have hikers and inline skaters. Recently the Swiss Mobility Foundation, a union of nonmotorised transport enthusiasts, began compiling a nationwide network of interlinked and well-marked routes for those who prefer muscle- to motor power. Sure, the feat is perhaps easier in a country of 41,285 square kilometres, but it does help put Switzerland at the top of Yale Universitys Environmental Performance Index.                 
I have seen this site before, and I am sure that it must have been mentioned before on EF somewhere. It is an incredibly comprehensive site with interactive maps and loads of other information such as accommodation in the area. It has sections for Cycling, Walking, Hiking, Mountainbiking, Skating and Canoeing.

			Hi, we drove the same route this summer - just to Brighton and it was recommended by my parents who have been driving over for 40 years! 
The petrol is the same price as here in Lux, and the tolls worked out to be about 10 Euros each way which helps the budget, and the difference is distance is very minimal. We had our 3 year old with us, and bought him a portable DVD player which helped with the long drive - I wholly recommend it if you have children. We chose to take the ferry - dunkerque to Dover so that we could stretch our legs and move around abit before getting back into the car. We have to go up to Manchester next year (with 2 kids in the back this time!) so I'll be interested how long you have in the end. 
However  you get there, I hope you have fun!          "	null	null	null	Driving to the UK from Switzerland	guest	null

			Nice.  So we will just follow in your footsteps  .  What is your time horizon?  We are looking at Sep/Oct.   
Yes, getting up at 5 sounds very familiar to me.  I have done quite a number of phone interviews that way over the past few months...  Of course the good think about that was that my schedule wasn't impacted much.    
Just checked w/ BMW F/S and - as suspected - they   require you to pay down the full amount.  Too bad for an organization that global.  I will check w/ the bank I work for to see if they allow that.  I can't imagine that refinancing makes sense, though, given the current rates.   
Good point about two cars.  It will be more of a pain that it is worth.  We are just so used to having to provide a car to our au-pairs.  And that probably wont be the case in CH.

Carry these in your in your coat pockets. This keeps your hand luggage weight down.      2. Step on the end of the baggage scale. This counter balances the weight and your bag weigh less. Only works for check-in desks that weigh the bag on the end closest to you. Some airlines are getting smart and moving the scale back, so they move your bag about a meter before weighing it.     3. Have a friend keep another bag or two away from the check-in desk.  Use duty free bags from previous trips. Looks like you went shopping on the way to the flight      4. Carry any books you want to bring in their own carry bag. You are normally allowed an un-specified amount of reading material for the journey.   
5. This is really cheeky   - use your children's allowance. Pack items in a pushchair box - this is not part of your luggage allowance.

			I recently took my Audi A4 (54,000 miles) to a dealer. within the last year, I have had the steering rack and pinion, a water pump, 4 coils replaced. this time I simply wanted a new Dipstick as it had disintegrated and could potential send parts through the engine. 
Audi replaced the dipstick and holder and then asked me to sign a peice of paper. they said that they had done a free inspection of the timing belt and found that it had cracks, that I must pay for replacement, otherwise all other warranties on the car were void. 
I was surprised I thought that a timing belt should last for about 80-100,000 miles as stated in the owner manual.    
What had happened is that woman's timing belt had broken at around 40,000, prompting a class action law suit. To cover themselves all Audi have to do is to give a free inspection, even if not requested, when you bring the car in for any other reason. They can then say that they alerted you and they are not responsible.   
We are fighting this legally, the timing belt will be taken out today, tested and compared.   
I would advise everyone to refuse 'free inspections'.

Most of the big towns in Switzerland that I've been to have a website like this one:

			We drove that exact route today, and went round the 'bottom' of the lake. This would actually be a much quicker and easier route than crossing at Pfaffikon (imho).   
The trip takes less than 30 minutes most times of the day (I do this route often). The traffic into Hinwil can build up towards lunchtime, but that won't affect your DH. Overall I would say Lachen to Hinwil would be a pretty easy commute, and would certainly offer you some great housing opportunities.

			I think the auto lock when you hit a certain speed is common on most cars now, it's a security thing, most have a buttton inside to over-ride it. Not sure about unlocking in an accident though.... and have know wish to test it either.

			Thank you for the feedback. It certainly would not be worth the cost to bring it over. I was considering bringing the car over if the shipping cost would be paid for by my employer. However I had no idea there are so many minor differences, sounds like a hassle ......   
At the sametime selling the car here and buying one in Switzerland would be a difference of around $10,000 from my pocket (if I did not have to pay shipping). I would not get more then $10.000 Canadian for the car here and I looked at 3 year old mazdas for sale and most of them are around $17,000 Swiss Francs.    
In the end I like to avoid hassles so regardless if Employer pays for it or not I think I will take the advice and purchase a car there, besides this will give me the oppertunity to buy a bit bigger car. A wife and 2 kids, the Mazda 3 is a bit small for travelling.   
Thanks everyone.   
PS: give it a few more years say by end of 2010 and Canada and Mexico and the US will be one.

In my opinion Geneva airport works a lot better than Zurich as it handles less passengers. Likewise at the other end, becuase I travel without luggage, from touchdown to getting in the car at EMA takes about 10 minutes. 
On another point, there is a new East Midlands Parkway rail station opening this month I think with a bus link from the airport and that would enable passengers to get trains direct to Derby or Nottingham.

			I have found an example of a vehicle that I am comfortable maintaining myself here in Switzerland. I have located a reasonably economical source of imported spare parts locally and the nearest main dealer has a knowledgeable parts counter guy.   
My problem is that I need to know what the legal pitfalls are to buying an old (1993) used car that is obviously not in the best of physical condition.   
What do I need to check concerning the MFK and ABGAS? Do both of these tests need to be redone whenever there is a change of ownership or are they valid until expiry?   
Will the STVA want to see the vehicle?   
How can I find out about the history of the vehicle? In the UK I usually get a HPI or AA data check.

			1) The swiss Police can not, under any circumstances, take away or ask you to hand over your australian drivers licence. BUT they can ban you from driving around in switzerland. So if you were found to be driving around you would be charged as if your license had been revoked.   
2) If fines reach a certain amount, they automatically go before the court, where you can be fined extra. 850.- is almost certainly a fine that would go before courts. What can happen (with a swiss licence) that the police takes away the license on the spot and courts then decide how long you will have to wait for it or extra fines (depending on your 'criminal' history or on the severity of the transgression.   
3) From my understanding the driving ban begins either immediatley after the incident or after the court's ruling. Since the policeman didnt inform you of any immediate consequences I would assume it's the latter. So three months after the ruling, your australian license should once more be recognized by swiss authorities - that is if you have paid the 150.- extra fine.   
Hope this helps.

			Good advice there Nev. I work in the marine insurance industry and believe it or not this encompasses Fine Art. For shipment of paintings packaging is the key. It must be done properly and the manner Nev describes is pretty good. It depends on what the item is worth but for high value or rare or sentimental worth items it's really worth using proper professional packers and handlers. I would not use a cardboard case and a man with a van.

Technically you're supposed to have the exhaust approved when you fit it but as I mentioned in my earlier post, a lot of folks don't bother getting every single alteration noted. The risk you run is that when you go to have the main test done (MFK) it could be another reason for them not to like your car. There is a certain amount of tolerance with the testers but they're not known for their sense of humour. I had the misfortune to have Captain Anal testing my car last time around and had to change some ridiculous things just to keep him happy.

			Hello,   
I consider buying a used car from an EU country to import back into Switzerland (buying form my brother at a really low price). What is the price taken into account for VAT and customs tax calculation ? Is the price of an equivalent new car ? Or the price of the car on the used-car market ? Or the price at which I got the car myself ? Or the price of a new car minus a deduction based on the age of the vehicle ?   
Thanks for your answers !

No problems - I always seem to be on a tight budget so always looking at ways to beat the system   (with out breaking any laws before any one else post something suggesting otherwise   )

			Normally airlines only offer flights for 300 days before hand.  One option is looking into an open-end ticket.  My friends who have studied abroad did this, because they were not sure at the time if they would want to travel around the US a little before coming back to Europe.  You can maybe call around a little for those options.     
As far as one way tickets are concerned, I would suggest playing around with the search websites a little (expedia, ebookers, travelocity, etc).  We have found that buying a round trip ticket in the intention of only taking the first flight and sacrificing the second trip can actually cost half the price of a regular one way ticket.

But I've been at a standstill in Montreux when the motorway is blocked with traffic ... other people have the same idea unfortunately. The advantage of taking the lake road is that one can always stop at a bar or resto and wait it out. As opposed as being stuck in the Glion tunnel (I hate that). The train is a good suggestion though.

			Halo Everyone,   
Sadly I have to leave Switzerland for Japan in the early 2009. For this I am looking for a good and inexpensive international removal company, idealy based in Basel. I tried Japanese removal company in Switzerland but they are expensive. I need to ship things to Japan.     
I do no speak German... so I will be pleased if any removal company deals with international shipping in English. Is anybody knows any company?   
Thank you for your help!!!

			Friends are coming from Belgium to Switzerland, most likely with (liquid) supplies for New Year's celebrations. Are the rules any different from the more usual question here of someone moving to Switzerland or a Swiss resident coming back in? If a group of 4 adults is in a car, do they each get the full custom allowance of 2l up to 15% and 1l beyond 15% ? 
Thanks for any insight

			There is no easy workaround for the Jungfrau that I know of (some of the more complicated ones involve Migros membership which sometimes gets you reduced price tickets, but that's the best I advice I can offer right now).   
On the Glacier Express the answer is definitely yes. The day pass will cover this trip but you might be asked to pay an additional supplement/reservation charge. I think this is 11 Franks but you should check at your railway station.

			Thank you Uncle Max, I took it to Fontana and was eventually pleasantly surprised.  The first time I took it to have the engine cleaned and went to the examination point afterwards and it didn't pass the engine wasn't cleaned...   I was soo mad... I went back to Fontana in the best German possible told them the problem, they apologized, fixed and it and took it to the examination point themselves and we got the stamp on our registration card.. whew.. they made up for their mistake and will definately go back for any more repairs.  Highly recommend them, however they do not speak English so it helps to have someone who speaks English to call first.

			Hi there, 
I live in Lachen. It's a very quiet little village on the lake and I mean.... really quiet. If you decided you are a city person, then don't live here.    
Also, you definitely won't be wanting to drive the connection as takes about a half hour and that is without traffic, which there would certainly be when you are on the return journey home - that is if you get an apt. in Zurich. You might want to take a look at the places just outside of Züri but this side, like Enge, Thalwil... Horgen...  They seem to be nice places and you could do the connection by train.   
Maybe others have some ideas also.  Am not sure as to the size of the places I mentioned though, I just know Horgen has a bit more to it than the obligatory church pub, bakery and Coop...   
Good luck!

Most of the tires listed have ratings and reviews that can help be helpful in deciding just which tire and in what price range you prefer to buy.   
btw: from your profile is says you're coming to Switzerland, or are you already here..?

			If she wants to leave Frankfurt at 6:50am then she can get a train ticket for 48 CHF thru the   deal (no further passes required). Coming back for the same price would mean leaving Zurich at 19:02 and getting to Frankfurt at 23:15. These prices are just to/from Zurich main station, but it should just be a few francs for an extra ticket to the airport.

			Ok, so slightly odd request but I thought I would try anyway as it never ceases to amaze me what EFer's know!   
My parents are coming over to Europe for our weddng in January. They will be renting a car from Peugeot in Holland (a large 'Tepee' van big enough for the whole family) and driving it down to Switzerland and giving it back in Zurich.   
Unfortunately, as they are collecting the car in Holland we have been told that it does not come with winter tyres. They will be staying in Flumserberg and Davos whilst here in Switzerland and as such, will definitely need winter tyres.   
Does anyone know of somewhere/anywhere (in Zurich or German speaking side) where my parents may be able to purchase winter tyres for 2 weeks and then the garage or wherever can buy them back or somewhere they could maybe rent the winter tyres?   
My parents have emailed Peugeot already and are awaiting their response but I thought I would try EF at the same time!   
I know it's a long shot but any tips would be greatly appreciated!

If you can rent one of those from your local Renault dealer.

7072	17.11.2008, 21:24	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Wülflingen, Winterthur	"    I live in Winterthur, it's a nice flat city, very cycle friendly.   
My TomTom says it's 33.4km and 29min to the centre of Neuhausen by car.   
Hegistrasse is around 3km from my house. It has a good road to the motorway, and then it's a short bit on the A1 and then on the A4 to Neuhausen   
I imagine Winterthur is a work destination, as Hegistrasse 35 is a commercial property (working for CADCAM Consulting GmbH are you?). So if you're going Neuhausen to Winti you are with the main rush-hour traffic flow. So expect up to around 45-50min drive, mainly depending on the A4 (which is am 80kmph motorway I think). 
The section of A1 that you'll use is always jammed in the morning - meaning around 50 to 60kmph speeds, instead of the 80kmph on that stretch. It's on the traffic report every day. 
I never hear of the A4 getting clogged though. But the jam is heading into Zurich, and you'll be driving the opposite way, so you can laugh at the Stau :-)   
But if you are going the other way (live in Winti, work in Neuhausen) then you're going in the opposite direction to the main traffic and I'd expect to take the 30min that my TomTom tells me.   
Neuhausen / Schaffhausen probably clogs a bit on the bridges over the Rhein, but it's a small town (pretty too :-) however Schaffhausen is bigger

			It depends on the community you live in. In each community (Gemeinde in German) there's a   who's a local police officer. Make a request for a parking place for your given date; they're also responsible for parking fines , should you need to approach someone over one.   
It also depends if your space is in a white or blue zone. Eg, 2 reserved white zone spaces for one day (7am - 5pm) in Seefeld, Zurich, costs CHF97. (Not sure how they calculate such a number, but it's a deal).   
During those times, the police will tow away anyone using your space uninvited, as there'll be signs in place. You're getting more than a simple reservation, they actually will look out for you   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	parking for removal van	bernicat	Posts: 2

			When the Swiss Franc had an extremely bad exchange rate against the euro, there was stoney silence from the CGN: now that the CHF has strengthened, on Monday 3 November the CGN put up the price of a return ticket from Evian to Ouchy from 9,80 to 10.90. That's a massive increase by anyone's calculation! This in addition to the normal price increase at the beginning of December, we are told. What makes those of us who pay in euros see scarlet is the fact that the price in Swiss Francs is still the same [14.70]. Can anything be done about this blatent and totally unnecessarily additional price-hike?

7087	07.11.2008, 09:18	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Switzerland	"    Not here in Switzerland obviously, but if I went home I would still drive my parents car or rent a car yes. There is no reciprocal agreement between Ireland and Switzerland and my ban would be in Switzerland on my Swiss licence. Of course if I drove in Switzerland or a Swiss registered car I would be in a world of sh!t, but across the border I am not banned.   
This happens all the time. Germans who get caught excessively speeding in Switzerland or Austria or escorted to the border or have a passenger drive them to the border then they are free to drive from there. There is usually a clause on their fine that they cannot drive for x amount of time in the country they were caught in.    
There was also the publicised case of Jay Kay a few years back where he was banned from driving in France (and Switzerland I think), but he could happily tootle around in his Lambo back in the UK or Germany because the driving ban did not extend across the border. Same thing happens with the cannonball drivers and those guys in the supercars who were caught in Zurich earlier in the year. The get the full brunt of the authorities here, but they still have not committed a crime outside of Switzerland. They can be banned from driving in Switzerland but not anywhere else.    
If you only have a Swiss licence and you are banned in Switzerland then tough, you do not have valid licence. But if you have a licence valid for another jurasticion the ban applies to your Swiss licence and driving in Switzerland (and for insurance reason driving Swiss cars anywhere). But if you own a car in your home country then whats to stop you driving there. Remember the stamp on the licence is ""Not valid in Switzerland"" so they have no control of what you do with that licence or in another country.

			[quote=Verbier;345091]Canyaver, you are asking a ""mutually exclusive"" question (quick, good and cheap). If you need this done quickly (today so the car does not get stolen or trashed this weekend) then you need to go to an Opel garage. If you know a bit about cars, you could try the fuse question first.   
Hardly think that anyone is going to bother stealing/trashing a '97 Opel Corsa.

			I have a new Golf. When I bought it for some reason VW do not paint the whole back bumper, so I decided after seeing on another car that I would get it painted. Cost to remove, paint and re attach 350.-chuffs...which I didnt think was that expensive. 
Answer to the other question. 
These boys can take most small dents out without repainting or sanding, I think up to 80mm. And are very quick with it.

			hi   
Any suggestion about the garages where we can buy a car which is not too old and have some warranty and reasonably priced. also are there any private dealers anyone aware of? I'm urgently looking for car preferably 6-7 seaters. quick responses will be really nice. 
Thanks       
Obviously the make, model, engine size etc will be different but here's what it has cost us this year for our 2004, 1.8 Mercedes c class coupe   
Insurance 1740.- 
Taxes 545.- 
Vinette 40.- 
Replacing brake pads and Service 800.- (this is probably expensive being a merc) 
Changing tyres from winter to summer 60.-   
I hope this helps

			You can do it for a whole lot less than 800 Swissies IMHO.   
Start with the customs office, then your insurance company, get proof of coverage, then a trip to your Strassenverkehrsamt for paperwork, then another trip there for inspection, and you're probably done.

			Hi Charde   
Just wondering how you got on finding a removal company?    
We ended up with 5 quotes and decided to go with OSS as they were the cheapest at 9k for a sole use container via Rotterdam. I think the lower Aussie dollar has impacted the price somewhat  . It would have been a little cheaper to get a shared container to go via the UK, but it meant it would have taken longer.   
I have to say OSS have been really great - very efficient and helpful. So now all our stuff is in transit and will hopefully get to Switzerland safely!

			I hear ya both, however its a bit of a paradox that I will have to train with a real motorbike in order to realise my ambitions to ride a large capacity scooter   To put it in perspective the entire year that I'm riding around on my 300cc scooter with L-plates will be a waste of time. So I might have to force myself to ride a geared machine for a few months to get the hours and practice in.

			There is a distance restriction of around 70km. If the trip is below this length then the return portion is only valid on the date of purchase, if it is beyond this length then the return portion is valid for one month. But, as Keith said, this should be printed on the ticket somewhere.    
The reason for the one day validity is to avoid people doing what you are trying to do - missing the ticket agent the first time and using the ticket again on another day. This is more likely to happen on shorter trips, which is why there is a distance cut-off.

The insurance agent initially made a mistake and used an old Lausanne address I used to have which resulted in my first fully comp quote being 410 CHF (Vaud may be slightly safer than Basel, but 80 CHF safer??  )

Not ideal - long and narrow, and no parking, but fine for two vehicles at once (with the odd bit of shifting about). They want 1500/month. Which seems a lot, but it could work out at 30 or 40 CHF per day per person if organised efficiently. Never saw myself as a timeshare salesman - but needs must.      Don't know - sorry. Good place to ask would be a local autospares shop. If you can find one.

			Ireland except for meat and Guinness is generally more expensive than Switzerland, at least compared to living costs in Carlow.    
Also taxes in Lausanne/Geneva will be slightly better than in Ireland although with health insurance about 50% more expensive than Zürich (your tax and premiums change with each municipality and canton).   
Expect to lose 30-40% in deductions.   
If working in GE and living in VD (Lausanne's canton) check out if you will need to pay double taxes.   
Also there are many ""indirect taxes"" like the many speed cameras with little tolerance between Lausanne and Geneva if you travel each day. (120 CHF for 13km over in a 50km zone with 3 km removed for margin of error, slightly higher margin of error applied on higher speed limit roads).   
Oh and a nice bonus, if you buy a weekend car, you can insure it for 10% extra if you swap the plates (there are removable numberplate holders here) and only drive one vehicle at a time.    
For example: Guinness 8.50-9.50 per pint (not 4-5 Euro). Cheddar/Stilton/Gorgonzola 25 CHF per kilo. Meat 20-60 (average 40) CHF per kilo etc.   
Petrol/Diesel comparable to Ireland 1.85/2.15 per litre.   
Car tax on a 1.6L between 350 and 600 per year canton dependent plus 40CHF for the motorway.   
Insurance for me on a 4 yr old 10kCHF 2.0 L Petrol GTi when I was 29 with my USA license since 20 (recognised by Allianz) 1200-1400 Partial comp without no claims (got some based on age somehow even though my UK license was only 3 years old).   
In Romandie there are may expats selling cars on various sites at short notice due to NGO ""move within 3 months from Geneva"" transience.

			Gesneralle (spelling) is pretty cheap and very convenient; only but a 5 minute walk from Globus. Given the cost of driving a car in London, Zurich is a steal, and even the parking Globus, at CHF 3 an hour, the equivalent of GBP 1.50 is nothing.    
Good luck

			I think you are right. In the Appendix 10 file the minimal brightness of motorcycle headlamps is defined and I doubt that a lamp that goes down to 20% intensity can fulfill that.   
Additionally there is simply no mention of modulating lights in the entire law (first link). And the list of lights is concluding. So any manufacturer or importer who seeks approval for his modulating headlamp at the office of metrology simply can't provide the legal fundament.   
I've encountered a biker who probably used a modulator last time I cycled around the lake Zurich, that reminded me of this thread... However that was a single incident and I haven't noticed it else since this thread started.

			Another one which I'm with in Switzerland is ACS < >. Reason for picking this one over TCS is that their schemes for European cover seemed simple to understand compared to TCS. Also to note is that my AXA Wintertur insurance also gives me breakdown cover in Switzerland (only).   
Not tested them yet, so can't report their service, but my Swiss colleagues said they are good (ACS that is).   
Oh and the keyword for breakdown is ""pannehilfe"" in Deutsch-Schweiz at least.

			This is a tad different - I want to sell my RHD car back in the UK and buy a new car here. My car is currently regsitered here, so I am I right in thinking that I just drive back to the UK, sell it/ reimport it, take my ZG plates and documents with me and then go with the new papers (ownership old and new, insurance) and plates to the Strassenverkasmt to sort. I am buying in Zug so presume it comes ready certified and tested?

			First of all hello all, I have lurked the forums for a while and they have aided me greatly through my first few months in Switzerland. Now to my issue: I have recently exchanged my Canadian Licence for a Swiss one at the strassenverkehrsamt in Aarau, and received my new Swiss licence the other day...only to find that it will expire in about a year and a half, and using my broken German I managed to deduce from the accompanying papers that due to some regulations all persons who received a licence post 2007 are required to take part in some form of 2 day course.    
Now some background, I only actually got my Canadian licence in the first quarter of last year, around March. And while this qualified me for the licence exchange program Switzerland has with Canada, it also made it so I have to undergo this 2 day training seminar/course. From what I can tell this is a list of the courses available:      
 Now some of those addresses include Geneva and such, but that is not my main concern. My German is not very good. In fact it is down right awful. So my question to you is this: has anyone had any similar experience with the strassenverkehrsamt and this phase 2 testing? Is there perhaps some way I could undergo this course in English? Or is my only option to bone up on my German skills in a rather rapid manor.   
 Thanks in advance, 
 Canada.Zurich

As grain prices increase, there is much debate as to whether it is appropriate to use land to grow corn etc. for fuel.   
In the UK the price of cooking oil has recently jumped in price to match the increases in diesel prices. The large savings that were available have generally disappeared.   
The same is likely to happen with waste oil as more companies see it as a commodity rather than a waste product.   
It is possible to run a diesel car on clean cooking oil, though it is not recommended. It is thicker than diesel and doesn't have the various additives to protect the engine. The most common problem is blocked injectors. There have been cases of people filtering waste oil and using that in their cars, often with expensive bills to follow.   
It has been more successful to mix clean oil with diesel 50/50 but the cost savings are negligible with the risk of higher maintenance bills   
Unless research comes up with an alternative production source, it is likely to remain a minority fuel.

			Check out the Gleis 7 pass - available if you're under 26 IIRC, only 100 CHF more than the half-fare card but also gives you free travel after 7pm (see link in fact sheet linked above). Also, try using   on the SBB website - you can get discount tickets on certain routes at certain times, and they are bookable up to 2 days in advance. The day-passes can work out to be a good deal for doing a lot of travelling in one day, if starting after 9am or on weekends, they are only 56 CHF I believe, but can be even less if bought through your local commune ( ), and are often on discount throughout November (see  ).

			Hi, I have a quick question about car leasing. I have an old car that needs a lot of work, plus I don't need it in the winter but still have to pay insurance, tax, parking etc. Thinking it may be better to just lease a car during the summer and sell my current car.    
Where is the best place to find out about leasing in Switzerland, the costs etc, would want focus/golf sized car May-Oct.   
Thanks

			There are no problems buying a car with an L Permit.  I was on an L Permit when I bought my car, and hadn't even transferred my license at that point.   
You must change your license before you have been in the country for 1 year.  It is 12 months from the time you enter the country.  If you wait until after that you cannot drive on your foreign license and must do a driving test to get your Swiss license.

			The Federal Office of Statistics has releases some numbers from a phone survey. According to the results, last year every second driver phoned at least once while driving. A fifth has read, and a tenth written SMS behind the wheel. A third of the drivers and half of the passengers in the back don't always wear the seat belts. ( )   
Last year, the city police of Zurich has fined 6000 drivers for operating a cell phone without hands-free kit (100 Fr. fine) and 12'500 persons for not wearing the seat belt (60 Fr. fine). (No online source, today's Tages-Anzeiger)

			This question came up on a car owners' forum that I visit. My understanding is that the Swiss regulations require two things before retro-fitting HID lamps: self-levelling lights is one and the other is a headlamp wash function.   
Having said that, there's plenty of people that probably ignore the rules anyway, HID kits can be fitted quite steathily and they are easy to remove for the Swiss MFK test anyway.      "	become a little unpopular	Join Date: Aug 2007	Groaned at 9 Times in 4 Posts	Xenon lights	hoover	Posts: 75

			Hmmm, I would definitely try to get a second opinion if I were you. Towing the car home could be an option but then you'd need to see if you could get a tame greasemonkey to come out to you for a look. 
I used to ""odd job"" work at a local repair garage as I wanted to learn enough about cars to keep my old classic on the road and base the following comments on my own experiences:   
The overheating could have caused a warped cylinder head but it might not be all that bad. It could be simply be a ""blown"" i.e. leaking cylinder head gasket. Bern's comments ref Mayonaisse are absolutely correct - also check for oily film on top of the water in the reservoir or radiator. Ideally, if you can't get a mechanic's 2nd opinion, get yourself a cylinder pressure gauge and check the cylinder pressures. That still won't tell you for certain if the problem is hte head or the gasket - to properly check the head it will need to be removed and properly measured.    
If you're not bothered about matching body/engine numbers in the car then you could consider swapping the engine - it's often far less work to swap an engine than it is to strip an engine in situ, repair and re-assemble. 
Good luck :-)

			I too was very familiar with the process of taking over a lease from my time in the USA and was interested to do the same here. But it was non-starter. I could hardly find any used cars that offered a lease - unlike the USA which has a very attractive and huge secondary market for leased cars, everytime I asked here I got blank stares.   
You are right that leases are more expensive here than in the USA. It seems there is neither the volume nor the subsidies provided by the car makers to move certain models.   
In the end, I bought a used car and financed it with a relatively inexpensive bank loan. Overall, the payments are much higher than a lease would have been for an equivalent car in the USA. Of course that is because I am financing the entire purchase and not simply the amount borrowed.    
From a financial point of view, your best bet is probably to buy a used car. There are many used cars available and the prices seem quite competitive (i.e. a 1 year old car is about 20% less than the new model).

We're taking a cargo van (Ford Transit) to Florence with some stuff, but will have to drive it back to Bern empty on Sunday, August 24.  Is anyone interested in moving something from Florence to Bern, or anywhere in between, in exchange for the gas and a part of the rental fees?  I would be happy if we could save someone a trip.

			not sure what you need the map for, but another option could be using the google maps(maps.google.com)...just click Get Directions, enter the address from which you leave and the one you are going to. once it gives you the directions, click Public Transit on the left.   
works very well, though it doesn't seem to account for the temporary route changes..

			Just thought I would give some parents a heads up who maybe haven't heard of this offer from the SBB.   
The SBB offers a card called Gleis 7 for people aged 16 to 25, which allows free train transport (and some bus lines as well) from 7pm until the last train of the night/early morning. It can be bought in combination with the Half Fare card. I bought the Gleis 7 and a half tax for my son this year when he turned 16 and he is thrilled with it. Saves him a packet on train tickets.     
Just thought I would share this with the forum.

Don't do what I did   I applied for the macaron online on a Monday. On Wednesday I got a parking ticket for my car which was in a bay which is covered by the macaron I had already signed up for. I have to pay it. The next Monday I got the bill for the macaron (CHF240 for 6 months) and paid it immediately online. Any tickets   don't count. I put the bill in the windscreen of my car with 'PAID' written on it and got no more problems. The macaron arrived on Saturday, so in total it was less than 2 weeks.   
Do this   Go to the Office du Stationnement which is near Place du Tunnel and next to the big police station. Pay cash, get a macaron, put it in your car and don't get a parking ticket!   
You get a list of all the places you can park in the same envelope as the macaron. Mine is an 'M' which allows me to park in 'M' areas only (Chailly).

Use the 'arrivals' info on the Swiss Website and you can find the actual time a flight is arriving, then be at the airport 20mins after that to allow them to collect luggage etc.. Then you can minimise your waiting time. I think you can even be texted when the flight arrives/lands.

			Hi All,    
I have two nice story for this topic.  
The first one, a bit more than a month ago I got a nice letter from the city, that although there are plenty of white free parking zone around the house, the night parking is not free in the city, and by the way I was caught two times (at least) during parking at night there (what a surprise)... So I have to confirm where do I park the car, if I have a private garage or do intend to keep parking outside, then I have to pay 40 chf per month. First I thought who the hell has money to pay these guys to check all the cars parking outside at night and if they are registered and paying this 40chf. My neighbour told me that most probably this was one of our lovely neighbours who informed the Gemeinde and that idiots are everywhere. He was right I think... Anyway I rented a garage immediately, I'm now curious if they will bill me the last few months or what will happen at all, as I did not know that I have to declare this before.  
The other nice story is that my boyfriend is visiting me for a month, and again, we were so ""doof"" that we thought he can park at the ""visitors parking place"" in front of the house, especially that he has a foreign plate number. Then again, one of the neighbours has drawn into his attention, that she is watching him and he is parking there already for 4 days (eh?). 
And he can be happy that she is just telling him this personally and did not went to the Gemeinde to inform them. Rediculous...  
Can anybody tell me where can I check the rules for the ""visitors parking place""? What I've found on the webpage of the city is not saying anything about visitors who are here for a couple of days or weeks.

			Thanks, Mark75.   
That's certainly an idea we toyed with for a little while.   
I've ended up registering, however.   
Interestingly, we were initially told that registration was going to be a 2-week process due to various paperwork I was required to obtain from my commune of origin - hence the need for a workaround for the car which did not require my registration (and hence this thread).   
Anyhow, luckily and thanks to some lovely Swiss people over at my commune of origin and at my present  (all of whom appeared to have worked through their 2-hour lunch break!), my registration has been fast-tracked and the relevant agencies have arranged for the necessary paperwork to get the car registered (hopefully) by Friday.   
We are slowly learning there are ways to speed up (and sometimes ways around) the paper-ocracy here in Switzerland .... one way is to have an Opa who speaks the language and won't accept  for an answer!    
[Also interesting is the fact that at one point during the flurry of phone calls today we were told that number plates were possible to obtain without being registered if we paid for the car and the insurance in cash, got receipts for each and then passed these on to the  with my passport details etc. We subsequently found out that this was the old way of doing things and was no longer possible.]

If you drive at such a speed that you cannot control your vehicle and crash after a ""driver error"" then your speed is obviously inappropriate to either your skills, road conditions or both. Seen as how unlike to aviation you have no lower limit as to what speed you can drive at. The speed being a preexisting condition at the time of the error - you do the math whether it's a contributory cause or not.   
I have pages and pages of professionally researched accidents if you really want to go into the deep of what constitutes contributory cause.

			Thanks everyone. Good to hear that it doesn't go any further than honking the horn. I am sick of hearing about people getting shot or stabbed around here. Though it could be worse. $2 a litre/$8 a gallon is not too bad considering what some others are paying, I believe I heard a while back that the UK was paying about $10 a gallon (of course much of that is taxes). If I do head over that way, I will more than likely walk or use public transit, for a while anyway. Always good to know ahead of time though. Again, thank you all very much for your insight.

Usually, for used cars, they provide you with the price that was listed when it was new as well as the price they want now.    
69K expensive? depends on what the price was when it was new with all the options.  A base line car with lots of options could well be more expensive then the next model up if the next model up doesn't have any (or as many) options. Mostly in Europe you have to pay for _all_ the ""options"". they don't ""throw them in"" like they do in the US.

My parents have asked me to arrange some car hire for them, picking up/ dropping off at Basel Airport, from 1 Aug 21:00 to 5 Aug 20:00.   
I've (a) never booked car hire before, and (b) never been to Basel Airport before! Does anyone have recommended firms, hints about which hire companies shut their pick up offices early (yes, yes, I know it's Swiss National Day!), anything that may be helpful, really..?   
Thanks very much.

			On a standard route like this, the only reason you would need a reservation is if you had a large group of people who all wanted to sit together. Otherwise, it will not be a problem, just buy a ticket when you arrive, hop on the first convenient train, and enjoy the ride.

			Also see these threads:       
Regarding ICN trains, the 5 CHF reservation fee does not apply in the winter, I think the dates are late November to late March. But if you have the bike in a bike bag then no reservation is needed.   
There are a few non-SBB train lines which allow bikes for free. There are not many, but I know that the line from Morges to Biere and L'Isle does.   
EDIT: One more thing, if you get a folding bike then it can go on all public transport for free once folded.

			I've heard of them doing this if you just renewed your license before moving to Switzerland.  A letter from the license department in Maryland verifying the date of when you got your first license should be sufficient.   
If it makes you feel any better, it's easier to deal with it here than it used to be to get a license when you moved to a different state in the US.  When I moved to Santa Barbara when I was in grad school, I had to take the written driver's exam.

			Thanks to everyone who replied.   
I'm not sure I agree with the ""no money down = verbal agreement = no binding contact deadline "".  I have something in writing, and no deposit is standard practice for a leased vehicle (company benefit).  In any event, a verbal contract is in most cases considered equally legally binding.   
I could ""threaten"" to cancel the order, but would prefer to get the car in the end. The issue is one of the hassle of waiting without any indication of a possible delivery date.  I find this very strange.   
The dealer has admitted in writing by email that there is a problem with the expected delivery.  Upon my request for a replacement vehicle, he has now indicated that they would try to arrange for a second-hand car if/when I needed one.

I was just illustrating the point that if you need more then a few bits and pieces you might be better off buying from one of the online stores in the EU, such as actionsports or chain reaction.    
Does the 30CHF per wheel include fitting or is that just for the pads? What kind of pads are they?

			Why not sign up with Mobility and their  'Trial subscription with Cumulus card ' for four months at a total of 40.- subscription fee       
They actually do have such a big car ( 7 seater) and  you'd benefit in addition from the insurances they have set up  too, which could be a bit of problem if you would get a  privately owned car and would have an accident,mustn't even be a big thing that could happen, only a scratch at parking can be sufficient  and result in a lenghty troublesome  story.

(Thinking of) Buying a Left Hand Drive Car in the UK with Polish Registration/Plates and in 3 weeks moving to Switzerland. 
 I'm confused on the following:   
1. If i buy the Polish registered car can i drive it for 12 months in Switzerland if i say i am taking it back to the UK within that time limit? 
2. I won't have to pay duty tax will I, as I am not officially ""importing"" it to Switzerland? 
3. If i do want to keep it in Switzelrand for more than 12 months, have i understood correctly that I would need to officially ""import"" it and then pay 7.6% VAT on it's current (then) value, and 4 % (of current value) vehicle tax. I wouldn't have to pay Duty as it's EU ? 
4. If after 12 months i want to sell the car, can I sell it over the border in Germany without having to worry about any VAT/Duty/Taxes? Would this be a simple purchase for a German buyer as its' all EU?   
Any advice greatly appreciated asap- may be buying tomorrow if i work out all the ins and outs. 
Thanks

			I'm about to sell my present car and buy a new one (it's a POS) but I'm debating on whether I should buy a CH reg or an EU reg.   
I can't see myself staying here long term and would eventually have to re-register the car back in Italy once I leave, which is a bit of a headache and I would have to pay 20% IVA.  
Would I somehow get the 7.6 swiss VAT back?   
Either that, or keep driving an EU car for as long as I can.

			Well the interest rates for leasing will be quite less. With leasing you have the option of buying it as well after paying the agreed residual value.    
With financing the interest rates will be much higher. You can have a look at   for various options.   
Hope it helps.

As far as I know you need to apply for the Swiss License within 12 months of the data of entry on your permit. And you have to take the test within next three months of finishing those 12 months.    
I would also suggest that you take a few lessons as well.

			New Zurich trams have low-floor easy access. These are progressively replacing the older ones. The new trams are longer. Hence, cannot be deployed on certain routes, which have length constrained stops or end-stations. Facilitating access for the disadvantaged can be a problem for a longer time.

			Its actually benificial to rather get your International license from your original country (issued in yr original country to you), and then to come here and drive a few months with an International License. I am not sure if it depends on country-country, but I was issued with a one year International License (South Africa) and that you can obviously drive her ein Switzerland for one year with. before the year is over, you have to convert that license into a Swiss license.   
You have to go to your license authority (swiss) and book an appointment, they will send you a letter stating the time and date of yr driving test. And...a few thinsg that you have to bring with for example...a stamped/signed eye test from a swiss optometrist. But the eye test is easy, walk into any optometrist and give them the paper that the license authority send to you, and they complete it and stamp it and also do a quick test. Does not cost much as far as I can remember. Also you need ID pics etc etc. Nothing strange there I guess in what you needed.   
So, here is yr questions to yr answer:l 
1) I think THINK you can drive 1 yr with a valid issued AA license, BUT..check on yr AA issued license or otherwise rather make sure and take a drive to yr local license authority. Its worth it, you do not want to end up on the wrong side of these things. 
2) Yes, you have to give an eye test paper in, one that they would send you to have stamped and completed 
3) I did not have to do a written exam/ test before the actual driving test. I think it might depend on yr AA license, and where you coem from...but I do not think that the US would be a problem. 
4) Look at my answer at top, I think its beneficial. Especially good that you get to know the rules and roadsigns.    
What I did, I took a friend with me to drive, and she woudl play the authority and direct me in driving where and when, and we drove around where the licensing place were...as you start obviously at license office and then have to go somewhere...so, take a drive there, ...on a quiet day, and just drive and test yourself, and notice things and check it out.    
But, from all the posts here...you can read that most say that you should spend yr money and go and get a instructor to drive with you. TRUE...do that, its money worth spending, rather than to THINK you have th rule right, and then later are sorry to find out that the Swiss treats teh rule different etc.   
Do not panic to much, I promise you also...if you are a confident driver and know your car and drive well, without any false starts and beginner things...that also helps. be confident, and try to be calm, he is only there to see if you CAN actually drive a car, obey rules and are not a hooligan on the road and will NOT endanger anyone. So, good luck, be yourself. When I got in teh car with teh authority, he told me very nicely that I should just drive like ai drive everyday and relax, as he is only looking if I can handle my car, the rules and be on the road legally! I hope that you also get a nice guy..

			Hi Sam,   
I'd just like to point out one possible case where you might prefer 2nd class.  On some of the main lines (eg. Geneva-Lausanne-Bern-Zurich) there's a ""Family Car"" which has a small indoor playground complete with a slide and either a dinosaur-shaped jungle gym or a moon rover.  It makes traveling with children much easier.

			Very helpful - thank you.  I've tried the 25 kph versions and they're much too slow (the top gear is much lower than with a normal bike for legal reasons), so I'll go for the faster one and get it registered as a moped.

			You should be able to get a discount on the trip going into Switzerland. If you cannot get the card until you arrive in Switzerland, then normally when you buy the card you can get a refund for tickets that you have recently bought and used. There is a limit on this, maybe 4 tickets or something like that, but this should be straightforward since you'll only have one ticket. The people at the train stations should be very helpful once you arrive.

			I DON'T KNOW any petrol station that does NOT have a night service.   
I know Switzerland does not have conveinence stores open till all hours, but as long as I've known it, all petrol stations are available 24/7 (with use of credit, EC or Post card).

Have you asked the hotel you're staying at if they have parking available? Most likely if they do it wont be for free. 
There is a Hertz Rent-a-car on  , couldn't you just pick up a car there for a days excursion?

			The main Audi dealership in Basel is ASAG by St. Alban-Tor (tram no. 3 stops right outside). Address is St. Alban Anlage 70, 4002 Basel. The dealership has just been refurbished and has some tasty cars in there (but not as tasty as the Porsches next door!)   
Not exactly shure how good a deal you will get in there however- someone has to pay for these nice shiny dealerships, the free coffe etc. etc.!   
Hope this helps!

			Back in UK, BP fuel is always a few pence more expensive as they claim that there fuel is better than the rest...    
Supermarket and unbranded fuel VS Branded fuel; there are differences. branded stuff burns a little better compairing to unbranded fuel. comes down to the additives that are put in the fuel.   
i would go for Branded stuff as it will be better for the engine in the longtrem and the car will feel better day to day

			Hi Angie,   
I'm also planning to buy Eurail pass, but my destination will definitely be more than 2 countries (at least 3, so I guess it will be worth purchasing). 
If you're only interested in visiting Paris and Italy, then I wouldn't recommend Eurail.  
There are lots of (cheaper) options to go to Paris. By train (many trains connection to Paris, just go to train station and ask, no harm just for asking, right? ), plane (easyjet), or even cheaper with car pool system -->   --> this one isn't really hitchhiking since you need to pay, but a small amount).  
Just make sure that you book the (plane/train) ticket really in advance to get a better deal. 
For Italy, if you want to go to Milan, Venice, or Florence, you can even buy an online ticket with a special price (SBB website --> click and rail, but you can only buy a week in advance and need a credit card to purchase).   , then click for the option ""Click&rail(Italy)"". It's only 74chf one way, even only 48chf when you are lucky. 
Or...try the car pool system too.   
If none of those options work, you can always buy the Eurail and explore more countries . 
Good luck and have fun travelling!!!

			Try the tageskarte.  It's an all day pass for anywhere in CH.  You chose the day you want to travel, but you aren't locked down to *where* you are going.  It costs in the neighborhood of CHF 40 per day, and can be picked up in the city center.       
I have used these a lot in the past.

			I normally use Europcar - downside though is that you have to hire it for a whole day - but then you have it for the whole day and can make as many trips as possible.       
Another option would be to hire a van from Mobility Carsharing. If the distance is only 20 kms, it might work out to be cheaper. However, Mobility offer vans only in big cities. (I don't know whether Mobility vans are available in Baar). If you end up driving a lot more than 20 kms (for whatever reason) it might work out to be the same as that for hiring a Europcar van for the whole day.   
Let us know if you have any queries.

			I am a new member living in the Netherlands.   
I want just to come one night in oktober (schoolbreak here) to Zurich for pleasure and a little buisiness.    
I am affraid to drive with my car into Zurich (a big MB 280S of 1982) so I hope it is possible to park my car in a small village West if Zurich and just take the S-bahn to the City Centre. Any tips which city has a free parking possibility after a walk of max 1 km are welkom.  
I could also take a (foldable) bike with me and bike max 3-4 km to centre At least if foreighn bikes may be used in Zurich (no number/tax plates)    
Normally hotels outside a big city are cheaper and I would take a hotel with free parking (public or hotel) outside the City.  
But strange enouf the cheapest hotels I find in booking sites are all close (NE from) to downtown and actually that is the best to go out eating at night but not good to drive to/to park.    
Most Zurich city hotels ask 15-20 CHF for an overnight parking which in my country would be almost good for a night at a campingplace.  
But the cheapest hotels have no parking place.  
So I need to get a more expensive hotel only for that stupid car ...   
Thats why I like to get info about a small village with free parking close to a railwaystation (S-Bahn) west of Zurich.    
I am Dutch. We are used here to have a beer served for 3CHF and a plate of dinnerfood for 18-25CHF but then again petrol (benzin) of 2.70 CHF per liter.

What leads you to believe the rotors warp? Generally rotors only warp if you are too hard on them, or they are seriously under sized. If so then the same applies to the T5 since the rotors are the same as I know it.   
As for the wheels and Geartronic problem do you have an sources that might show these specifically?   
The T5 option is available, however I lose my transmission warranty by changing the chip. Also, you sure just a chip change is the only difference between the R engine and T5 engine which equates to over 50hp?

But in this modern world even Swiss people are living on credit, so I guess you'll find some places willing to give you credit.   
Also make sure you ask your bank, they may be a lot cheaper than credit issued by a car sales yard.

			I reckon there will be no problems for your license. As for bringing the bike, just make sure it's economically convenient to bring it over instead of selling it and maybe getting a used one over here. If it's a model sold in Switzerland too, there should be no problems. On the contrary if it's a model for north america only things might get slightly messier.   
As for ""when not to ride"", weather in Lugano will never be as bad as it can be in Canada. Expect some snow maybe two weeks a year and 50 days a year of heavy rain where it's just stupid to ride on two wheels. The rest of the year you should be fine, provided you're careful on damp roads!

			With the exchange rate in our favour it may at first seem good, but if you are resident in Switzerland, you will need a certificate of conformity, which is quite difficult to get hold of,  plus you will have to pay VAT and possibly import tax. If you google UK car export  you will find some companies, but do your research and sums first.  From my perspective it pays to buy  an ex demo model from a local dealer.

  Of course the best solution is to get an underground garage space.  I ran an old Golf Cabrio when in Switzerland and never had any 'early morning,car frozen' problems even in the depths of the coldest winter.  Definitely worth the cash but garage spaces get  expensive in high-rent areas.

			Thank you Richard and Lob for your replies.    
Richard, your suggestion is interesting. Can I drive the German car in Switzerland for 2 years before officially importing it do you know?   
Lob, I am not relocating back to UK, rather permanently moving to Switzerland from UK in June 2007. However I need a car now so I thought to buy a left-hand drive and drive it back to the UK for a six month period.    
Having just received the bumpf from the DVLA I am beginning to think that is a non-starter due to the duty issue which is why Richard's suggestion of buying an EU car might be the way to go.   
Any further thoughts greatly appreciated and thank you again.

			Maybe I can offer a liitle advice:   
1) It sounds like you may have problems converting your license but I suggest that you go to your local Strassenverkehrsamt Des Kantons Zürich and they will be happy to tell you what can be done/must be done. Link:      
It's best to talk to them first before you make any plans so that you are clear about the situation with your license. If you have to take your motorcycle test in CH, then I would recomend that you do this as I think when/if you return to Singapore (or go to any other country) the entitlement to ride a motorcycle should be added to and remain on your license. (Hopefully, you will never have to take another motorcycle test)   
2) Once you have sorted out your license, I strongly advise you to look at getting a bike over 25kw. For touring europe, I would say that a good starting point would be around 55Kw. Personally, I am about to buy something like a Hayabusa around 125Kw. (I like to get where I am going in good time!)   
3) If your brother was to buy a motorcycle, then most insurances will have an option to allow any driver. However, be aware that even if he has full insurance, if you 'borrow' the bike and crash it the insurance will only cover third parties and they will not pay for any repairs to the bike. If you're lucky, they may transport it back to his home address.

			Given the fact that the bike is a Ducati, did you think of bringing to an official dealership in Italy? It's much closer than the UK, most probably cheaper and I would tend to think that since they make them, they can repair them too.   
The link to the dealer locator is:

It has not to do necessarily with safety problems.   
However there's no such legal thing as ""if we can't fix it after three times, we have to change it"". That may be company practice, but definitely not legal prescription. You can also think that if they can't fix it after three times, they probably do not know what they're doing.   
However, if you choose to go down this route, the burden of explaining in a court of law how you're deprived of the proper assumed usage of the vehicle rests squarely on your shoulder. Sitting down, whining and stamping your feet won't help much.

d'oh re licence   
Yeah, I've read the threads on transferring UK licences, seems simple enough - my partner has gone through this process - Swiss to UK and back again.   
Unfortunately this seems a blind ally for me due to language skills and a lack of a driving license!! never bothered with the car license due to city living and mild Winters.

			On Sunday I was watching TV and all of a sudden I heard huge KABUMMMM. I look threw the window and I saw my car on the grass and one car in it. So I ran downstairs, there was already police (they were driving behind) and my car was there, all 4 tires broken and the whole left side destroyed. So we wrote everything down, but cause the guy that was driving had to go to hospital they said to me they will send documents by mail. And they took my car to garage and they gave me the phone number of it.   
Till today no one did anything - I didn't have any contacts of a person that crashed my car - was calling police all the time and they couldn't say anything cause the person that was working on Sunday was on vacations!  Is that normal? Anyways today I got document saying which assurance guy has and I called to garage and they took my car to Ford garage to being repaired.   
So I called to assurance and they told me they will send someone there to see the damage. And I told him that I am without car now already for 4 days and why they don't give me the replacement car - and he said that they cant give me it until the police report is written, but I can get one for 40CHF a day!!!  So I called to police and they said that this report takes from 14 days to one month - for one little paper?!?   
So now I am stuck here without a car - going to holidays next Friday and I am also afraid that they will not repair my car good cause I have foreign registration. In my country I should get substitute car without any question - can someone tell me if there is some law saying smth about this. I wasn't guilty AT ALL and now I have to be even punished for god knows what!   
Thanks for all help!

The reason why they were so cheap was that the plane was in the air on the stroke of midnight when the Millenium Bug was expected to wreak havoc.

			You can rent brand new French car: Renault, Peugeot or Citroen from 17 days to 6 months plus.  Includes insurance etc.  Costs about $1,000/month. Check out Peugeot Open Europe program.     
The reason French car companies do this is they can make money on renting a new car and save the next buyer a very large amount on taxes by reselling them a used car.

The quickest way to get there is by IR to Baden, then catch a train from there. But as Mark75 pointed out, I would need to pay the full price (CHF 17.40 with half fare card) from Zurich HB, as this is the last stop on the IR before Baden.        
A train to Bülach, then changing to the S41 would only cost CHF 7.00 with half fare card, as I'd travel mostly through the ZVV area, only needing to pay for a ticket from Kaiserstuhl (last stop inside the ZVV). Takes 20 minutes longer though

			I figured out how this goes.   
I brought my tax free car to Switzerland few weeks ago from my home country. My car is registered in my home country (EU) and also insured there. It has foreign export plates that are valid one year. I had no problems crossing the border, no questions asked. After my foreign export plates expire next year, I will get the customs plates in Switzerland for another 12 months. After they expire I will pay the VAT and custom duties based on the value of the car at that time.    
I have not informed any authorities that I have such car here in Switzerland, should I do that already or at the time I apply the Swiss customs plates?

			Do some research yourself. I typed in ""Landrover TD engine cut out"" to Google and came up with :   
<<     
The information below was supplied by Saif Al-Noaimi. 
Recently I ran into a problem with my 2001 Defender 90 Td5 not starting and intermittently dying on me on the highway.   
I sent the car to the dealer 4 times and first 3 times they were clueless. The 4th time they replaced the ECU wiring harness because they feared it was the  . Thankfully the car was still under warranty. But 2 months after that was done (car is now out of warranty) it died on me again. I posted in the Land Rover Addicts Forum my problem and amazingly it turned out to be the relays under my passenger seat were just loose! Apparently they are saying this is a common problem so I thought it might be useful to others to include it in the KB.   
>>   
There are plenty more anecdotal stuff out there...   
Try posting the symptoms here too:     
This is the internet at its best. I had a niggling problem concerning the warning lights on my landrover, and found many many anecdotes pointing to a common mode fault...

			Glad that you were not injured!   
There is no point system in Switzerland. The vignette will cover the car damage but not your bike and the ambulance. It's up to the police if/how this case proceeds (I estimate, not far) but the fine for crossing a red light on the bicycle is 60 Fr..   
Some insurers have a form on their website that you can use to report the accident. If you have a copy of the accident protocol (Unfallprotokoll), the insurers may be interested in it too.     's a leaflet in German about what to do in a bicycle accident (PDF) (also valid for other traffic accidents). The most important points are to fill out an accident protocol if there's property damage, and to call the police if somebody got injured, which only then is mandatory.

			Tough question... There city starts more than hundred noticeable construction sites per year and although yours is a big one, the city doesn't distribute money left right and center.   
Your rights are similar like when the landlord itself causes the noise, as described  . The process to enforce them is different though. It is recommended that the landlady represents the interests of the renters and contacts the commune. Maybe she was already contacted by the city before the construction site opened.   
Anyway, here's the official   of the Hegibach/Forchstrasse construction site. You should look forward to the football cup, work will be interrupted then. And the residents who are sensible to noise should flee from Hegibachplatz on the weekend of 5./6.7 because that's when the most night work will be done, they'll replace the rails then.

			I do not know of any english language advanced rider training in Switzerland.  However, if you are prepared to travel a little, and would like to ride some of the great circuits of Europe, Ducati run their excellent (but pricey) DRE courses in France and Italy (in english) as well as other countries. BMW Motorrad offer similar. Details for both can be found under the manufacturers website.

			I know of a case where someone brought a UK registered car to the country and, unbeknowns to them, got a speeding ticket. Around a year later, the car was clamped. 
My point being, they do keep records. Whilst they might not bother to catch up with you in France (can't really comment on the likelihood of that), if you bring the car to Switzerland again, you risk giving yourself added complications. 
But as other posters have said, probably simpler to pay up, if you were in the wrong.

			It certainly sounds like you need a floor pump / track pump. I recently got a new one, and went with one made by Park Tools because all their stuff is great, it is the  .    
A couple of months later, I was talking to a guy who helps out at a bicycle recyclery in the US. They needed some new pumps, and so decided to buy one of the consumer-level floor pumps from each major manufacturer. They each took a similar wheel and one of the new pumps, then pumped in synchrony to see which pumped got up to the desired pressure the fastest and with fewest pumps. They switched the pumps around, then repeated the task. Plus, they tried with mountain and road tyres, and different valve type. They also each rated the pumps on more subjective criteria, and then tallied all of the scores up. Apparently, the Park Tools PFP-3 won the contest, and there was only one other competitor that came close to its score (but I can't remember which it was).   
Therefore, it's not only my bias towards Park Tools that makes me recommend this one, but there is also reasonable solid empirical evidence that its the best thing for the job. You can get one from   for 54 CHF. You may be able to get a different model for a little cheaper, maybe 35-40 CHF if you search hard enough, but I don't think it would be worth it, just go for the Park Tools version.

If you are doing 2000km then a 3 day rental fee of chf170 to chf200 for something like a Ford Focus is a bargain. You can be sure that you have devalued the car by a multiple of that when using a newish car.

			Tricky one..normally advice would be, buy the cars over here. The second hand car market in Switzerland is a lot cheaper than the UK, and ""unfashionable cars"" like Japanese and Korean cars are really cheap. 
Don't bring a RHD car over here, its a pain to drive and insure + you will never sell it unless you drive it back to England.   
have a look at   it will give you an idea of car prices.   
The exchange rate the moment is bad, which will affect your decision. I think you have to own the car for 6 months or you pay import duty on it..search the forum for import car..there are a lot of threads dealing with the subject.   
I would have snow chains (and do have) with me at all times...never used em yet though, my winter tyres are fine and cope with most road conditions. The Swiss are a lot better at clearing their roads than the British authorities, so buy em but don't expect to use them.

			Its almost certainly a scam. We check scams for Auto Trader via   and this is a well established one.    
The vendor offers a car which is priced far too low. The story is usually similar  - he or she is a foreing nations who worked in Britain - usually in the City and bought a (usually expensive) right hand drive car. Subsequently their employer recalled them home. They drove the car back to Spain/Italy/Switzerland (fill in blank) but couldn't get on with it driving on the right, but dealers would offer little for it. They now wanted rid of it but the local dealers would pay very little. They don't have time to drive it back to sell it in the UK.   
They are contacted by buyers in the UK, one of which will fall for the story. They will then offer to put you in touch with their ""shipper"" who will deliver the car. The idea is the buyer pays the ""shipper"" before delivery who holds the funds in Escrow, releasing them only to the seller when the car arrives. The shipper usually has a fairly impressive website and possibly a call centre.    
The problem is that the vendor and the shipper are in cahoots (may be the same person) and once the buyer pays everyone disappears leaving the buyer having paid the money without any car.   
I can list you numerous ""shippers"" who we have recorded operating this scam but there is little point - as soon as one closes another one opens up.   
If he plans to buy the car he should tell them he will not unless he checks out the vehicle, verifies the seller has clear title to it, pays for it by a recognised means within a secure environment and brings the vehicle home with him.   
If the deal provides for anything other than this he should not get involved or he is likely to lose a great deal of money rather than save it.

			For discount tickets from Switzerland to France, there is a special section of the SBB website where you can buy them.

I'm not a fan of the Rail Europe website, it does not seem to contain all possible times and connections. Some friends of ours were visiting from Canada and were trying to plan their trip across Europe with it. It was suggesting some pretty limited options. I gave them more info by using the national rail websites, and everything worked a lot better.

			I have found this way to be the most convenient for driving from Zurich to Lugano:   
- Drive on the A1 towards Bern (trust me) 
- At the Limmattal Kreuz follow for Urdorf 
- You'll be left near Affoltern Am Albis. Follow the blue signs towards Zug/Luzern 
- When you arrive in Steinhausen you'll find green signs 
- Get on the highway and drive towards Schwyz/Brunnen/Gotthard, NOT Luzern 
- At the end of the first stretch of highway do the Axenstrasse and get back on the A2 in Flüelen 
- Continue south towards the Gotthard   
With this little trick you save some good km, you avoid the Sihlstrasse and the traffic around Luzern. Additionally you save yourself the trouble of speed cameras on the S.Bernardino and the annoying 80km limit around Luzern, but be careful on the normal road between Affoltern a.A. and Steinhausen, there's a couple there.   
If you want to do the same on the way back, remember to exit the A2 in Flüelen, follow the Axenstrasse, highway from Brunnen and then exit in Cham. If you miss the exit and go through to Zug, you'll end in the Sihlstrasse, so you're not lost forever.

			The Europe maps seem to be very expensive to buy ""a la carte."" I was thinking of buying a Garmin Nuvi 360 last week at Costco in the US (US$250.00), but the European maps sold on the Garmin site are going for US$300.00. You can buy the Garmin 370 and it comes with both maps pre-installed for US$460.00. Better deal, but more than I am willing to pay for a GPS device right now.   
So, to answer your question, you can buy Europe and/or Asia maps for all of the GPS brands that I am familiar with (Garmin/TomTom/Magellan), but they seem to be quite expensive.

			A couple of people mentioned that a car gives them more freedom. I'd like to suggest that it is just the opposite in certain situations. When going for a hike, I love the fact that I can take public transport to one place, hike all day, and end up somewhere completely different and take another means of public transport home. Having a car would restrict this freedom and cause me to either do a circular route or one in which the starting location can be reached easily by public transport from the finishing location (not always so easy in the mountains).   
This is just one more reason why a car is only useful for me a couple of times per year, and in those situations I'm quite happy to rent one.

			The Smart has an uncomfortable ride but does well in NCAP testing.  As long as you hit something your height.   
The gearbox is snatchy, the ride like a go-kart and yes, you can do donuts in the snow.  Without trying!!

I am looking for a place in Basel that sells cheap, used bikes (bicycle store, fleemarket whatever)... The bike stores I found so far only sold new bikes... 
Thanks! =)

Back to second hand cards - as long as it's in good shape, and it has a guarantee, then it's worth the risk. But it's never going to be a top runner, so there isn't much point in trying to asses it's crash/repair status if you're not an expert.

			Importation of MOVING GOODS is free of tax or duty payments, as long as the items are not brand-new. In theory you must have had them in your possession for 6 months or longer.   
Therefore I would NOT label the items as OLD WHATEVER but as MOVING GOODS and declare them as such when dealing with customs.

			Travelling First Class will let you access the Hotspot WiFi connections available at certain train stops. The problem is that you loose the connection as soon as the train pulls out of those particular train stations, which means you will have internet access anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes (at least that is what I experienced during my last train trip from Zurich to Geneva).

			Due to everyone suddenly bringing skis, I need to know if an Opel Zafira (7 seater minivan) can fit 5 sets of skis as well as 7 people. The dimensions are 1.80 m wide on the outside but 1.10 for the width of the luggage compartment; is this true? Any Zafira owners out there as 1.10 seems small!  : it seemed more like 1.40 but skis do not fit this way, only parallel to the length of the car, see below.   
Also, can you slide things under the chairs lengthwise, as that would help with the skis? I had a look at an example car, but I cannot see if the 3 back seats have a gap below.      ok, we managed to fit seven adults into a Zafira, plus 5 sets of skis + gear. Obviously, it wasn't easy, and this Zafira did not have gaps under the centre back seats, so skis had to go next to the windows. Perhaps it is ok if you do not use the seats in the far back, and only have two people on the centre back, because then the skis can go in the middle, but otherwise, I do not like the way you can load luggage, as the space at the back is minimal as soon as you lift up seat 6 + 7 and fitting skis in that case is quite the nightmare.   
Note: this was the Mobility Opel Zafira Minivan and Mobility does not provide roofracks.

The train station to get into Zürich is in the airport itself, so you won´t get lost. There will be still regular trains to the city. You are looking for the one labelled ""Zürich HB"". Once you are there, you will see lots of signs with numbers relating to trams. Look for trams number 6, 9 or 10. They all have a stop on Bahnhofstrasse. Or get a taxi right outside the station. Serionsly, it´s dead easy! You would get out at the tram stop ""Uni-spital"" or ""ETH"". I think Zürich airport is easiest to negotiate that I´ve been to. You can do it!!

			Yes, I've just done this. There were no particular problems. 
The procedure is well documented elsewhere, but I think the first step after declaring your car to Swiss customs is to contact a Swiss insurance company for cover when you switch the plates, and they'll lead you through the process. I used Zurich Connect who were fine.   
Don't forget you need to get an emissions test done by a Swiss garage.

			Hello,   
I have parents travelling to visit us from France in their camping car, at the beginning of April. The local zurich campsite in Seebucht does not open until May so I am wracking my brains trying to work out how to accomodate them. From what I've read about the blue zone parking permits I'm not sure whether you can obtain them for visitors. Does anyone know whether it's possible to get a visitors parking permit for just a few days for a large vehicle? Or know of any long term parking in Zurich with no height restrictions? The other campsite I found was closer to Greifensee which I think may be too far away.   
Any advise would be much appreciated.

			It has been said about public transportation, but I agree that there are good reasons to get a car.    
However, the option to try to buy and sell again could really be bothersome; you would spend quite a bit of time getting the car, getting the insurance settled, getting it registered, etc.    
Not having a car myself, I found it to work well to go for a long-term rental (if you intend to rent for more than a month). I found the best deals and best service with Avis (specifically their Glattbrugg office); you might call them up directly and ask to be transferred to the long-term rental department.   
Other rental car companies may have similar offers, and you might check about rates if you get a deal from your place.

			Hmm, I'm sure that thing is a monster, but it's really an individual thing. Never been able to get up a passion for Audi no matter how hard I've tried.  Porsches are really the king of handling if all you need is two seats and room for a dog and a toothbrush, but I'd take a 996TT over that Audi any time. Thing is I like performance and handling above all, but some room and practicality too, so while that R8 is interesting, it's hard to get too excited.

			FWIW, we also bought our car at Auto Eberhard (A4 Kombi).  Their prices are quite competitive - at least by the comparison I did, but I thought their service is quite lacking.  It took me three return trips to get the proper winter wheels/tires (first time wrong A4 wheels, second time A3/TT wheels, third time finally right).  As long as you don't need to go back, they are a pretty good garage.

			Thanks so much for your response!  We have just had the car confirmed as being booked - and yes, it is a convertible so guess we will have to bring an umberella or two!  We are really looking forward to it - and the scenery looks absolutely wonderful!  We hope we get nice weather, but even if we don't, hey, we are not at work, so who cares!  We have decided to stay in Klosters for the duration now and drive around to see the scenery, but definately going to do the Davos/Stelvio pass!  Once again, thanks for your response.  Julie

You are let off with a 5CHF fine, provided you show them you have the ticket at a later date at some central place. Is this urban myth or should I try my luck, if I really forget it back home?

			Nick, the cheapest booking class from ZRH to MAN on Swiss (T) is only available at the moment on the following flights around the weekend you're looking for:   LX  390 T  19SEP ZRHMAN 0710   0805    OPERATED BY HELVETIC AIRWAYS
LX  391 T  21SEP MANZRH 0840   1145   OPERATED BY HELVETIC AIRWAYS 
Nothing else on the Friday (19th) or returning on the Monday (22Sep) is available. As Lob said though the cheapest possible fare is CHF256.50 per adult (CHF97 fare plus CHF159.50 taxes) 
Basically this is the cheapest you'll get on this route unless Swiss decide to have one of their ""promotions"" nearer the time. 
ZRH to BHX (Birmingham) works out a bit cheaper and there are more flights available that weekend (CHF996 for 4 adults). Depends where you're going around Manchester whether that would be worth it though or not. 
Good luck!!

			Plenty of them in Geneva.   
Go to the Acacias where many big garages are together, they have many used cars for sale.   
Or head to Lignon, on your way you'll find the ROC and near to it many other used car lots  ( ROC SA Route du Bois-des-Frères 85 1219 Le Lignon )   
Finally at Meyrin near to the train station you'll find many more used car lots.  You can also find what you search for just in front of Conforama in Meyrin.   
Or simply look for it at   and   you'll find a broad selection of used and new cars near to you.

He does not get carsick (as easily), which is good for the drivers concentration, and I do believe it is the safest place in most cars.   
But of course, they might actually be standing.   
BTW, in Denmark the rules regarding front seat and booster seat is height-dependant, 135 cm AFAIR. Only detail, the police does not have the power to measure children...

			Yes this is taught here.  My driving instructor (been a while now) used to say think of ZKB (Zürcher Kantonalbank) which stands for Zündung, Kupplung, Bremse - so ignition (turn off engine), let clutch go (with car in gear) and then pull up the handbreak...  also what is taught is to turn your wheels when parking at an incline so when the car rolls it is stopped by the curb.

			You can get a day parking pass (it's a scratch off kind of thing) for the blue zone in your area. You can pick them up at the address below. For where you are, I think it's CHF12 per day which is much cheaper then leaving the car in a parking garage.

			The motorway signs are very good and you can travel almost all the way to the border, where you'll enter a no-mans land type road in French territory with nowhere to go but the airport. Trust the signs!   
Also, if using the multistory carpark for several days, go a few levels underground as the ground floor parking is exposed to the elements. If you're paying top whack, you might as well return to a warm car...

			Thanks for all the great suggestions.     
There was definitely not any confusion between myself and the Garage.  The individual I spoke with clearly understood what I requested.  Even if the CHF 500 price included the oil filter and the air filter, it is still crazy expensive.  Those parts cost absolutely nothing.  I used to have the whole thing done in the U.S. for $40 including tax.  Now i fully recognize it will be more expensive in Switzerland but not this much.

			If you drive to Wetzikon, you will find that the big Sunday sport there is for the Swissies to visit the enormous OCCASIONEN garages (Stealerships are closed) that populate the area. Often identified by balloons etc., they are open and staffed on Sundays. My personal experience was that the only problem is that they hate you to test drive the cars on Sundays unless they   feel that you are a serious potential buyer. This is only logical when you see the masses of people looking and biding their time.    
Not that I personally have EVER test driven a swell car just to do something on a bleary Sunday you understand ..  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Car garage open on Sunday?	Beano	Posts: 56

			When leasing, also consider that the in Switzerland, ""lease"" means something like a mortgage. You'll have to make a 10-15% downpayment (or more) initially and in the end you get the choice to either buy off the car (by paying a remainder value) or giving it back to the leasing company.   
I also think that if you rent a car, insurance & servicing (e.g. changing tyres) are covered by the owner, whereas if you lease, you have to cover all these expenses.   
While you might get a lease on a Cayenne for 1.5k a month, it is going to be about 2-2.5k in the end if you factor in the total cost of ownership (insurance, road toll, servicing...).

To take the vehicle permanently out of Switzerland you just need to cancel the registration here which your seller can probably help you with.   
After that, you're on your own but I'd guess transit docs for France and customs forms for the UK.

			If anyone needs a driving instructor who speaks English or Italian, Spanish and French, I found a good instructor. He has instructed many foreigners for the kontrollfahrt and knows exactly what the examiners are looking for in the test.  His price per hour and insurance is quite reasonable. On my first lesson he let me drive for 80 mins and did not charge extra.

			Just to get this right, you are fully entitled to drive in the UK and it is not an offence to hire a car there. There is no misrepresentation or fraud involved in the hiring of a car as you are not banned from driving outside of Switzerland or Lichtenstein.   
However, you would of course need a valid license from somewhere as the rules of driving in the UK states that the driver must have a license valid for the category of vehicle they are driving. If you just so happen to have another driving license then you can use that entirely legally.   
At the moment no country can enforce a driving ban outside of its area of  jurisdiction.

7536	12.11.2007, 11:51	Senior Member	Thanked 168 Times in 90 Posts	Location: Menzingen	"    So here is how the calculation goes: 
200 CHF (price of car) (TCS actully used 320 on a car costing initially 32000 CHF) 
120 CHF (garage) =>average used by TCS, much higher in a city could be lower in the country side 
150 CHF (fuel) considering an average 15000 km a year (which is not very much these days) 
35 CHF (circulation tax) 
125 CHF (RC & Casco) 
150 CHF (maintenanance) 
Total= 780 CHF   
Of course you may have cheaper insurance, leave the car in the street, not change your tires, drive less etc etc, but this is indeed the average cost.... and... without calculating the potential money you could make if you were to invest the money you put into the car in the first place for the 6-7 years you keep the car... so, a car is indeed an expensive thing

			Dear All   
I am from Midrand South Africa, lived in Germany for 3 years, now my husband has taken on a job in Zurich. 
We are currently living in Balgach in ST Gallen with my father in law and have stored all our furniture in his garage. We have found a place to rent closer to zurich, in Embrach.   
We need to move ASAP literally. If any one knows of any company which is affordable to help us move our furniture from Balgach to Embrach please could you let me know. Our furniture filled up a 7.5 ton truck when we brought our furniture from Germany to Switzerland.   
Any suggestions would be awsome

			Don't be jealous... one day you will be able to get a V8 too.   
People who point out that to want a V8 means one is under-endowed in some way... are just plain jealous and themselves under-endowed in some ways. Normal people won't bother making such a comment.   
I love cars and love to drive. I don't care about the badge or the engine size as long as the car is exciting to drive.

			Thanks for the tips team, the route turning off after Rheinfelden onto the German A861/A98 to A5 was a winner.    
Sunday mid-afternoon traffic was light Zurich to Rheinfelden, but even lighter on the alternate route section, border crossing simple as well. Return was in the early hours this morning so traffic was light everywhere. Though the wind and rain on the German A5 was diabolical.

Additionally such insurance as Zurich 'Relax' will give you cover.   
Otherwise google TCS...

			I presume it took so long to find you coz you are not a swiss resident and the working with the english DMV and the swiss equivalent might have taken sometime to find you ,respectivle the adress of where the fine hadd to be sent to ,that's why you received it so late.   
Also they don't expire,after a certain time they will  also add interest to it,plus your name will be on a list and upon entering switzerland again you will most likely be stopped by customs and asked to pay the fine there and then.   
It is possible very often to pay this via onlinebanking, there should be details on the letter of how to proceed.

Plus usually a small basic charge. Some communes like Zurich city dictate the conditions to the taxi companies so there is no price competition.   
For long distances it is possible to agree on a flat charge in advance, so it costs a few percents less. But I don't think taxi drivers will give you a deal for Zurich Airport-Zurich city.

I found leasing to be a cheaper option overall than a loan but then I got a real bargain on an ex demo with the dealer offering a much lower price if I took the lease and helped his figures with the brand owned leasing company  .

			I fly Basel to London City all the time. City airport is one of my favourites- you can be in the car home 5 minutes after stepping of the plane. Way more convenient for London. Also cheaper and quicker (DLR, 3 quid) to get into the centre or to your next station etc than the other London Airports. And unlike Heathrow there's no circling around above the airport waiting to land, and no taxiing for 30 minutes to get to the gate. I reckon it's also cheaper 90 % of the time on Swiss than on Easyjet, especially once you take into account the ripoff train connections into London.

What I meant is that the insurance I had while driving US plates in CH did not cost any less once I got Swiss plates.  I have since switched to Zürich because we have another insurance there and it made sense. Anyway, I believe the insurance is somewhere around 1500 CHF a year.  Maybe its because my car was rated safest car of the year 2005.  I had a rice-rocket (Impreza WRX) before that, so I guess insurance would be higher on that.  The fact that I got my Swiss drivers license when I was 18 and have not had any accidents since probably also helped. If your insurance is still that high, you might want to see if you find a better rate on comparis.ch.  Good luck.

They could have told you to exchange the bulb, without all this administrative rubbish.   
For major delicts, there is a working coordination between the various cantons. For getting fines paid and other standard issues it works more or less ok.    
But maybe Basel police has no official form to state, that a bulb of a car has been exchanged, so this tends to a non-standard task. This creates headaches and becomes a terrible administrative challenge.

			Hello everyone,   
I started studying in Geneva in September and I was driving a borrowed car from some of my relatives who live in Zürich. 
I currently am driving on with my driving license (Bahrain) with an international license. I am looking to purchase a second hand car in January but I want to wait till February to exchange my license for a swiss one. 
My question is; Can you purchase a car and register it under an international license and then a month or two later change over to a swiss license? 
Or is it not worth the work/costs involved and I should get my swiss license before purchasing the car?   
Thank you very much for your time 
Best regards

(Won't help the broken bones of the cyclist but.... )   
So drivers have to have eagle eyes and lots of patience - ""all the time"" as your point out - for any crazy person on a bike - and some people on bikes take advantage of it on the road/in the towns.    
I'm sure A'dam aced the criteria for getting drivers to heel to bikes....

If you search for ""road pricing"" in Switzerland, you'll find that this topic has been around for a few years although it's not politically discussed right now (the governments still prepare some studies and arguments). In my opinion road pricing has the huge disadvantage that we spend much cash for a technological solution for something that already is taxable by comsumption (fuel tax), and autobahns aside it is a delicate matter to prove that some roads need to be protected from traffic while others don't. I'm not sure if road pricing has a future in Switzerland, but should it be tested, I think that Bern or another city will introduce it first, but not Zurich.

			There is a rather nice looking example of a TR nearby to here. I don't see why you shouldn't bring yours over, but you would probably want a garage to keep it dry and in good nick.   
Being right hand drive does mean that if you get stuck on a windy country road behind a bus or a truck you have to be patient. Motorway driving isn't too bad - it's actually a lot easier to see your blind spot. Does your car have door/wing mirrors on both sides?

			I have a Thule roof rack and find this to be pretty good for two bikes, and heavy bikes at that.  Though I have an estate and am tall so can load and unload them easily.  An SUV would be more of a problem.   
Back in Oz I had a rack on a towball, which is much more convenient and doesn't hurt your fuel consumption as badly.  But that was on a sedan, so I could still get into the boot.  With an estate or SUV, if you want to load them on the back you need a rack that swings out of the way.  The better Thule ones seem to do this, but the stronger one's only take three bikes, so depends how heavy your bikes are.  But this is probably your most practical option, though probably no the cheapest.   
I had no problem with the ferry with the roof racks.  I just rocked up and they put me in the section where they put the trucks.  I didn't even mention the extra height when I booked the tickets.  If there are two of you, and you have problems, you can always unload the bikes and take them on seperately.

			One of my German friend with a German plated car received a fine which he chucked in the bin. The fine, if i remember correctly, was 80 or 100 CHF. After 3 years he came back to Zürich for a meeting and parked his car in a proper legal parking place. To his surprise the car was clamped so he called to the police. Police gave the reason of clamping the car as non payment of previous fines. He ended up paying quite heavy amount ""on Spot"" to remove the clamp.

			Hello,   
I just received a fine for an event which I had long ago forgotten about.  In May I mistakenly crossed a white line on the road whilst turning into a car park.  My mistake was not only to do this, but not to observe the local police were just around the corner. In any case, upon parking my details get taken and I assumed that a fine would be issued.   
As the months went past however, I thought that perhaps my luck was in, and that somehow the police had decided to take pity on the poor foreigner ... but of course I returned to the real world recently when the fine of CHF180 dropped through my letter box.   
I've paid the fine already, but am wondering if there is a maximum time when these can be issued?

			Just wanted to say that The Man in Seat Sixty-One is a great link. Thank you.    
I guess I am going to try and organize my travel to India. The only way it will work is if Iran says I can transit. Guess I'll find out Monday at their embassy. Not sure how they will react to an American woman asking with no head-scarf wanting to travel alone ... we'll see.

Swiss authorities cannot take away your US-issued license AFAIK, but they can ban you from driving in Switzerland for a certain period of time (e.g. 3 months). 
Just let them know that you don't have a Swiss drivers license and most likely they'll ban you for a while, but that won't affect you since you'll be leaving the country anyway.      I don't know how good your German is, so please don't feel offended, but are you sure that they want to take away your license? I just noticed that you mention that you've been here for almost a year and since the letter doesn't mention any duration, it might be a about the fact that you must exchange your US drivers license after 12 months...

			I can only pass on what I have been told by BMW UK. Run flat tyres cannot ever be taken off and put back on again even if they are brand new. Once fitted they are ruined by removal.   
It is the BMW 2005+ actual breaking system's electronics which would be affected by fitting non-run flats on rims manufactured for run flats.   
 BMW reckon it would invalidate any warranty if the the braking system failed in any way. No BMW garage would fiy them for you.   
 On fitting new rims with UK summer tyres (not run flats) the jury is still out. Some dealers say OK, others say 'NO'.   
The run flats recommended by BMW are not wide. They agree they are not wise. I asked BMW CH what were fitted to a new BMW on delivery. They said run -flat winter tyres designed for year round use!   
Cost of BMW Lausanne winter run flats, fitted ex TVA, about CHF 310 each.

			Yeah Mobility is perfect for that kind of stuff. Also make sure you thoroughly check the car over before you drive it, regardless of how much of a hurry you are in! And report any damage to Mobility by phone. My experience is that some of their phone staff don't speak good English, but if you are patient, they will often transfer you to an English speaker if you're having problems. It's a great scheme, but it has it's drawbacks.

			Thanks for the reply,   
I agree it would be easier to just by a car here. This one is not very specialized, it does however have a good price and mileage and I just haven't been able to find 'the right combination' of these things while looking here in CH.   
Perhaps someone can recommend another shipping company that does cars UK-CH. Do they have similar arrangements as the five test days?   
Thanks again.

			Hi everyone,    
My partner and I have just moved to Zurich. We've found a great flat in Oerlikon (moving next week), but it doesn't come with a car parking space and we have a car. We've heard that it can be very difficult and/or expensive to get a parking permit if the car is not registered in Switzerland (it's registered in Slovakia - an EU country). Does anyone have any experience with this situation? We're not planning on registering the car here, since it's quite old and we're only planning on keeping it for another 6 months or so.    
Any advice or information about potential parking solutions would be gratefully accepted.   
Thanks!

			Hey Ivica, 
I can easily fix it for you  . It should be straightforward, I've repaired many broken spokes before and even built a couple of wheels from scratch, and I always enjoy tinkering with bikes. I have some spokes of various sizes laying around, but if none of those fit then you may have to buy one at a shop for about a franc, maybe less. Send me a PM and we can sort out when to do it. 
Chris.

			Many ski destinations are reachable by train from Zurich, there might be a few exceptions (Lenzerheide perhaps). One of the nearest is Flumser-Berge but it's not very high. I've been to Hoch-Ybrig by train a few times. The Snow and Rail offers are really a good point to start.   
The trains are even better to reach sledgeing destinations, some are painful to reach with a car and offer good sights, too (Bergün-Preda). Contrary to skiing, some sledge slopes are open longer than 4 in the afternoon, and illuminated.

			Hi    
I am looking to trade in my current car as it has become too small for our expanding family. I'm not very happy with my garage at the moment and am looking to trade my BMW in for another make of car. Unfortunatly my knowledge of cars is fairly limited so I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for cars (that can fit 2 kids and all their 'stuff') or the name of a garage in and around Zurich that won't rip me off and insist that I replace the airbags and various random car parts, and hand present me with a bill of about 1500sfr very time I put the car in for a service!

			The situation in canton Zurich is a bit complicated because every transport company of the ZVV organisation has different rules. You can find the   in German.   
 If you transport the bicycle only inside the ZVV system, you have to buy your ticket a second time. If you have a half fare card (Halbtax), the bicycle only requires a half fare ticket, too. If you leave the ZVV territory during the bicycle transport, or if the second ticket costs more than 15 Fr. (10 Fr. with half fare), you should buy the normal train-compatible day pass for the bicycle, which is valid on ZVV lines, too.   
 You can transport your bicycle in the trams if there is enough space left for the other passengers (this applies for all ZVV member companies that allow bicycle transports). All ships on Lake Zurich except the small Limmatschiff allow bicycles. The Horgen-Meilen ferry accepts bicycles, too, it costs just 3 Fr., cyclist included. In double-decker trains (S-Bahn),  bicycle transports are allowed except Mo-Fr 6-8am and 4-7pm.

Seems you were luckier than I m. This morning I spend twenty mintutes on the phone with my insurance company. The lady was telling me if it s just paint/loss then it s not covered, they only pay for serious damage ie, a bump. And I told her I think a big surface of deep scratches is more serious than a small bump.. 
They finally agree to send someone to take a look, we will see how it goes...

I normally just book the car in for a service and get them to steam clean the engine bay and take the car for testing.  I bit more expensive, but at least the car shouldn't fail as they know what is expected locally.   
And the ""about 3 weeks"" is normal, as this will be in a letter they will send you in the next few days.  They just don't know there and then the exact date.

			Hi,    
I have a mouse cage ( no mouse ) to give away and fellow member Goodhill would like to be the lucky recipient.    
Problem is, I am in Geneva and Goodhill is in Zurich.    
I was thinking, if anyone was driving between the two places sometime, any chance that the cage ( it's only a small one, for a normal mouse, not a huge genetically enhanced mouse or anything ) could hook a ride and maybe Goodhill could collect it at the other end ?    
Thanks, would appreciate it...  
Matt

Start  . The link you want is ""Vermietung"".        License of course - silly question?   
Insurance will be included like renting almost anywhere.      Depends on what you want and whether you're resident or a tourist.      It's one of the best ways to see Switzerland. Risky in what way? I wouldn't recommend some of the passes for a novice.

			Heyas,    
Last year when i first came over here to visit my brother i took the train, as much like yourself flying absolutely terrified me. I traveled from Cheltenham to Zurich, all in all it was 3 changes but should have been 2 (i forgot about the time difference in Paris)   Was a good trip as well, great views all the way (once your past paris)    
I used EuroStar and  www.voyages-sncf.com, total cost was a little more than a flight, but travel time was around 12 hours (including my paris mistake) So if you keep track of time i guess its about 9 hours. 
Thou i would recommend flying now, as i had a job interview i just had to get on the plane and go, Scared the crap out of me for about the first 15 mins, but once your up there and the free alcohol has been passed out it was great fun  also the view as you pass over the alps is quite breathtaking.

			I did it the other way in May, from Exeter to Zug   
Route I followed, from memory, was basically   
Plymouth - St Malo (overnight ferry)   
St Malo - Auxerre (via Reims/Paris ring road)   
Hotel overnight at Auxerre, was about 40 Euro.   
Auxerre - Zug (via Mulhouse/Basel/Lucerne)   
I'll dig my maps out as they still have the post-it notes on from the trip, so I can give some more info on ""travel via here"" and which roads I took.   
I think it was something like 60-70 Euro in tolls going through central France.   
Time wise, I was on the road maybe 6 hours each day? So I guess if you wanted to really push the limits you *could* about do it in one, very long, run - but for the sake of 40 Euro I'd grab a hotel and split it up. (this was doing 70-75mph all the way)

			Hello,   
I am looking to find a pair of wind protectors for the side windows of my Opel Omega. In German they are called ""Windabweiser"". They are useful to open windows slighty e.g. when it's raining or on the highway and have indirect air flow and therefore less noisy.    
Google/EBay has found me only non-CH dealers. They are not so expensive (EUR 20-30) but shipping and customs fees might be double as much.   
Any idea who in CH offers such parts or what stores may have them?

It seems there are several transport companies operating in the city.
1) SBB: National railway, long distance trains. No connection with city lines.
2) City Tram &amp; Bus lines, a separate company.
Tram lines 3,5,9 &amp; G. Trolley Bus lines 11 to 14 &amp; 20. 
3) S-Bahn: City subway lines, a separate company.
Subway lines under Bern Bahnhof. Z, SE, J &amp; W.
4) RBS: a company ???
5) DBK: a company ??? 
Further complications.
There is ""a day ticket for Fr.7.50 which covers the entire city and suburban network"". Question: Does it cover all the above (except SBB) ? I found the ""Libero"" zone map.  Question: Is that ""Day Ticket"" good in all zones?   Thanks,

			In Lausanne you can get a temporary parking pass. I.e. If I have visitors, I can go to the parking office & buy them a pass for the time they are hear. You should probably get one for the nearest resident zone. I don't know if Zurich has letter resident zones like we do here.

			As it is holiday season, just a quick note that may save you a blow out on the mototway back to  .   
If you have tyres that are more than ten years old (see explanation below) you should replace them. Your tyres may not be as new as you thought...   
All tyres should have a DOT (from US Department of Transport) manufacture date with the week number and year on them.   
For example, a tyre manufactured in week 40 of 2006 would have a DOT four digit value of 4006 (JAB4006 in the example below) JAB is an internal manufacturer code I believe.       
If your tyres are old and you need to replace them, pay attention to the DOT date of the ""new tyres"" you buy.   
Perhaps another thread, all tyres   be of the same type for the expertise (MOT).   
If they are older than two years it is recommended that you do not accept them. If you are happy to buy them then you should ask for a large reduction!

			I've made Reva del Garda in 6 hours quite comfortably before... both on a Friday evening and a Sunday evening coming back. Avoid the main route. I went through Davos then Flüelapass and Offenpass. There is much less traffic on this route and it is far quicker. The scenery is also pretty amazing if you go this way.

Did you ask the garage what the check consists of for CHF50 and if they have the exhaust checking machine?   
How ""pricey"" is the Blecherette check? I just had my car checked last week & it was 65 francs.

			Hi Andrew   
Its a 94' 993 Carrera 2.  I have done a little work to it over the years to enhance the driving experience - namely; lowered it 25mm, placed wheel spacers to fill the arches, k&n filter and just last week RSR mufflers (which incidentally probably make it sound almost as lovely as your GT3!).  Which year model do you have?   
I am really keen to meet some people in and around the area that are keen to visit race circuits.  Over the last couple of years I have made the trek upto the Nurburgring - but its a long way in a car by yourself (despite how much you like driving!).  I have visited a simple track nearby called Auxuilly (via ACD motorsport) and drove around in a formula ford..... but its not the same as driving your own car, despite the unique experience.   
I would be really interested to meet at either circuit - Dijon or Bourg en Bresse, as they are both within 2 hours drive from Geneva.  Are you based in and around Zurich then?   
Here is my personal email address - think it will be easier to chat over.     
Regards 
Rich

According to   website, electric tricycles require different licenses according to how fast they are. The linked dealer sells a tricycle that goes 10 km/h max., which only requires a vignette (bicycle license sticker, ca. 6 Fr./year). And a second one that goes up to 15 km/h and requires a   license (license plate, small theoretical exam).   
Contact the Strassenverkehrsamt, they'll help you and know some English.

			Natural person or legal entity means an individual or a company.  
For the date, I would just put in a year after so that it works for the system. It won't do much for the price quote. You can see which offers are lower/best for you, then contact the three you like best for a real quote.

Pads are dead cheap, maybe £30 a set, if you're unlucky they will be £50 
Discs about £150-300 a pair 
Tyres £100 each? (good brand) 
Service (Oil drain, Antifreeze, CAM belt (Major only, unless its a chain?) etc etc) - £200 - 400 if it includes cam belt   
So if they replaced x1 sets of pads, x1 sets of discs and 2 tyres you're talking £280, then add labour of about £200 for that then your service at £200 and you're talking £700 sterling.   
This sounds a bit steep mate. How many discs did they replace? Did you get the cam belt done (major service)

			You can get the train driver licence as you turn 20. Some people do look rather young when they're 20. The SBB are also hiring students from the ETHZ to complement the drivers staff on Sbahn line.   
Frankly, I don't see what the whole hulabaloo is about. You can also have a commercial flying licence by that age.

I believe that I can either import the car at the border or can do it a few days later at the local transport office. I don't really want to do it at the border as it took ages to do all the paperwork when we moved here in December - I hired a 7.5t lorry and drove it myself.

			You will also notice that some rear plates are squarer with two lines and others longer with the text in one line. You can ask for which better suits your car at the Street Traffic Office.   
I think it is how it was originally designed and since there is no-one in Brussels forcing continent-wide legislation on the Swiss, that's how it remains...

			I found that even if you (as a non-resident) cannot take out an insurance policy yourself, you can be named as the usual driver of a vehicle. So, you can have your local friend take out a policy for himself and include you on it.

			Hi all -   
The north-south strip is one I know very well indeed as my other half is just outside of Marseille (Aubagne) - and I am in Zuri! I am down about 2 a month or more... Door to door it takes me 7hrs 15 with 2 gas stops. I go via geneva - then over to Lyon and down the A7, cutting off to Aix so that I avoid Marseille. For Nice I have tried all ways, but find the Grenoble way saves me about 30 mins (now that the tunnels are all open again)... I did try going home via Italy once and swore never again!!! Apart from the great scenery, I found the traffic and Italian driving styles far too wild for my taste!!!! Nice takes me about 8 hours...   
And these times are now with BEHAVING more or less within the limits    
cheers

The reason it took six weeks had nothing to do with the fact is was home delivery - it would have been the same if you picked it up in-store. That's a general issue when ordering sofas from shops that don't keep every model in stock (most sofa shops have long lead times for sofas)

			Thanks to everyone that replied. To answer the questions. I am not sure we need a car, we have always had one. For the past 7 years we have lived out of England in countries where public transport is either unreliable or unusable (for a woman in Oman it is virtually unthinkable) or dangerous (Thailand). We are a family of three who would probably need to buy a used car - we've never had a new one in 20 years of marriage. We have a six year old daughter so safety is a concern. 
Hope this narrows it down a bit and once again, thanks for all the replies.

			The Lötschberg base tunnel is virtually complete. Although regular passenger train service will not start until the new timetables are brought in on December 9th, 2007, there is going to be an opening festival on June 16th, 2007. Every half hour throughout the day, there will be passenger trains travelling through the 35 km (21 miles) long tunnel from Frutigen, in Bern, to Visp, in Valais / Wallis. For a 5 CHF reservation fee plus the cost of the normal train ticket, you can get yourself a place on one of these speedy trains. The RailAway site has a page about the opening festival in   or  .    
Websites: 
Lötschberg base tunnel:  ,   on the tunnel breakthrough in 2005.  
BLS AlpTransit (the company building the base tunnels):   and    
The Lötschberg base tunnel (combined with the old Simplon tunnel) is the first of two routes that will allow traffic to pass through the Alps without having to do any significant climbing (the other being the Gotthard base tunnel, see an  , or the  ). The Lötschberg base tunnel will be the longest land tunnel in the world (i.e., that doesn't go under a body of water). The base tunnels are being built to help take most of the European truck traffic off of Swiss roads and put it onto trains.   
So, why not be one of the first to ride through the tunnel on June 16th? You can reserve a place at your local train station; they only started taking reservations on May 1st, and when I made mine this morning, there were still plenty of spaces available. There will be special festivities happening at the stations at both ends (Frutigen and Visp), and the trip through the tunnel could easily be combined with a trip down to   and maybe onto   via a rack railway that will take you to above 3,000m.

Fair enough, user pays and yeah, it is quite reasonable as far as that goes,,,still, I thought it was worth asking as, you never know, there 'might' have been a special rate for visitors or m/bikes,,, cos when you think about it,,, a bike only has two tyres to wreak havoc on the tarmac and weighs considerably less than any car,,, it wouldn't hurt them to be a little bit lenient now, would it?    
Takes a deep breath,,,looong sentance there.   
As well, the visitors might be given a more attractive rate,, but, heigh ho at the end of the day, she went the backroad route and got to see the prettier parts along the way,,, for free for that matter...   
Again, thanks all,

			We are moving from Mallorca, Spain to Switzerland in July. To avoid having to buy 2 cars when we first get there we were hoping to bring our 1995 Renault 19. It has just passed the MOT   and is in perfect running order, but we have been told it is very difficult to have the car pass Swiss emmissions.   
Question 1:  
How can I bring in my Renault and even use it for just one year or less to avoid having to buy 2 cars from the start?   
Question 2: 
Is it possible to drive the car around on Spanish plates for a year and then get rid of the car (we do have insurance here in Mallorca of course...)?

However maps are inclusive and my GPS can take it from there  Book did cover CH, France, Austria and Italy (well, lets not forget FL)   You can also check if Alpen Pässen are open on below link (they close in winter)  http://www.tcs.ch/main/de/home/verkehrsinfo/paesse_tunnels.html  Furthermore, I did not import my car from Canada, shortly I was sorry about is since generally cars are more expensive in Switzerland. Please note that some costs have to be considered like changing blinkers to EU/CH standards etc  Also I would import the car that has same engine like CH models  otherwise you may have to wait for parts to be delivered too long.   Grand Vitara is great SUV, in addition to it; it is under 2000Kg so you do not have to worry about new law that may be enforced next year (more then 2000Kg and CO2 more then 250 g/Km will have to pay extra 3000CHF/year), so I would import it, but that is just my estimation     User 3.1   	an excellent reputation	Join Date: Jun 2006	Groaned at 109 Times in 95 Posts	Offroading	DaveA	Posts: 5,608

			Before I swapped to a Swiss licence, my paper UK licence got me out of a speeding fine in the US. I was pulled over for exceeding the 55 limit by a few mph. As I started to unfold my antique falling apart UK licence, the cop took one look at it and told me that the paperwork required to book me would be too much and let me go with a warning.      
PS.. speeding is wrong.

			We have no GA but combine public transport with renting a car through Mobility and through AVIS / Hertz when we travel in Europe using the Mobility rates as they give you quite a discount and unlimited kms.   
Using Mobility maybe 10 weekends and another 10 times briefly over a year and for house removals and renting an Avis car through Mobility for week long trips in Europe, we spend between 1000-1500 to 2000 a year.   
That is not much compared to having to support your own car, and we still have all the benefits of using different cars when we need to, i.e., a Smart or  Fiat Panda when you drive far (cheaper km rates) and a large Mobility van when moving house, and a Combi when going to Ikea.

			Don't know what their called in italian.   
But in the german part of swiss,  MOFA.   
Makes are, PUCH, CIAO( or something similar), SACHS.   
My kids had a sachs and puch,they both lasted years and were very reliable.   
A really good used one should cost no more than 600Frs, but you can pick up ones from as little as 100Frs.   
Regarding licence, don't need one, but you must have the correct paperwork for the mofa,and you must buy the insurance sticker in the post office or at the traffic control office.   
Look in the local supermarkets at the adverts always for sale there, or in the local freebie magazines.   
Good luck.

			The scooter is a Honda SFX. Thanks for the links - both French and Italian are fine.  
Part will depend on how the scooter is classified - either as a cyclomoteur or as a moto. In Italy it is only homologue for one rider - hence not a biplace, so may not be category A. On the other hand, I can not find a definition of a 'cyclomoteur' for category M. With a 50cc engine, ouput is 3.9kW and Power: Weight is just 0.05 kW/kg.

			I'm hooked on a few ""carefully discovered"" treats available in US groceries only.  
(some of them maybe UK too, but not sure)   
-Hungry Jack's ""Just add water""-type Pancake Mix.  This is not your average el-cheapo european copy. This is the real deal for perfect pancakes and waffles. No substitue.   
-Folger's ground coffee (medium), comes in a HUGE plastic bucket. Nice brew with my Bunn machine.   
-Coffee from Dunkin Donuts. Beats the s**t out of Folgers.   
-Coors Lite beer.   ice cold baby... no substitute... yumm I got thirsty   
-Mountain Dew Code Red, Dr.Pepper (ok, this one can be had in coop on lucky days)   
-Cinnabon rolls, frozen     
**** As you can see from my premium culinary list these are some heavy and bulky products. 
I have a US mail forwarding address but can't pay Fedex rates for a box of coffee! (ca. ~$30 for one coffee!)   
When I travel I make sure to fill up as many suitcases as possible with the goodies. 
When some friend travels I usually ask them to pick up one item from my list    
Maybe somebody on this forum is just organizing a larger shipment (container?) where some free space is left. I could pay a proportional amount and load it with STUFF.

			Are Asian cars on the whole more expensive in Switzerland?   
Say vs an equivalent European brand. Also for insurance are these more pricey to cover (as in the UK my toyota cost a lot more than Euro brand)   
Am thinking Honda AWD or Subaru similar but will it cost extra to purchase  and then insurance make this a costly move vs say a VW somethingorother 
?   
Thanks

			Correct there is no problem.......   
However you must be careful about going in the black book, 'schwarze buch'.   
This is no joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
If you had a fine of more than 200CHFrs. you were automatically registered in the black book,and believe me,the people were terrified of this. 
The register still continues,however,I don't know what the limit is today,but I would reckon it will be in the region of 500CHfrs. to 1000CHFrs.   
And you are registered in the black book so they say between 3 and 5 years, don't believe it, once you are in the black book, it's for life.   
If it bothers you, then be careful. 
If like me, treat it as an honour,for it's not every day that you can say,          "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Do Speeding Fines Cause Problems during the Renewal of B Type Visa ???	lithiumfive	Posts: 3

			I can say it because I was driving next to another car that was also driving in the same direction as me. If they have cameras that can detect which of the cars that was going to fast, I think they should prove it to me. That's all...   
But it really doesn't matter since I already has accepted that I was the driver. I'm more concerned with the 300 CHF extra fee, that seems to come from nowhere.

			If you buy a car, new or second-hand, and own it for less than six months before you bring it in, you're liable for tax.   
You'll have to pay insurance, road tax, and parking.  Services and fuel will be variable costs as will speeding fines.   
Insurance - depends on the type of car, type of insurance and whether finance is secured on the car.   
Road tax - depends where it's registered, engine size, etc.   
Parking - on-street 200-300 pa.

			I recently bought a MB E class W 211, which unfortunately has a APS 50 navigation system, which in my view is pretty basic. I am thinking of upgrading to a COMAND navigation system, which I understand is the latest.   
Can someone please let me know what is the latest version of the COMAND for E class and where I can buy it at a reasonable price (my MB garage quotes me a price of CHF 7000, which I think is outrageous).   
If anyone out there has a used COMAND system in excellent working condition, I am happy to consider it as well.

			Hi,   
[ Most of the below are general car import/insurance questions - so please comment even if you don't know anyting on campers! ]   
We are interested in getting a campervan - well really a decent sized (6-7m) 'mobilehome' for exploring Switzerland and elsewhere - might as well take advantage of being in the middle of Europe. We have about 30000CHF to spend.   
i) Buying: Does anyone know of any good dealers - we've been to   who seem to be the main delears in Geneva. Also check   etc for sales. Is there anywhere else people can recommend? We're happy to trek across CH to Zurich find somewhere with a decent selection - so anyone elsewhere with suggestion?   
ii) We could also buy and import from Germany, where there is a much better selection. We're happy to do this but there is the obvious and often mentioned import taxes (4 + 7.6% I think ?). Does anyone know how the vehicle value is calculated?    
I assume the authorities will fairly assume if you've bought in the last 6 months (and so have to pay tax) you can produce an invoice for the purchase and base it on this - and would be suspicious of a unrealistic price from a private seller...(!). Or do they base it on original value + age as insurance companies seem to do?   
iii) Parking: We've heard there are some van parks dotted around Geneva - but we've drawn a blank with Ville de Geneve who don't seem to know about them.   
iv) Sharing insurance: You can swap plates and hence insurance over. When you do this does the 'off road' vehicle still have fire/theft cover?   
Any advice would be a great help!!   
Thanks in advance.   
Rick

			Generally a parking space will cost you between 120-200 per month for underground (I pay 140) but in the center of town could cost more. If you don't care about where they are they should be easy to find. I'm not sure if that is out of your budget for this (guessing that parking costs could easily exceed the value of the vehicle in this case). I'm not aware of any specific RV parking areas, but you could find an RV dealership (I think I've seen a couple around) and ask them - they would be sure to know.

			Depends on how many people. With a normal drivers license you can carry up to 11 including the driver, not 12 + driver as in the rest of Europe.    
You can get 7 seater minivans from Mobility ( ) or you need to rent a van.   
I don't know where you are, but if you are in the Baden/ZH area I got a minibus from Extragent ( ) who were fairly reasonable.   
The big rental firms are expensive, particularly if you rent from the airport.

			If that's the border I'm thinking of, they often watch cars crossing from a large hospital on the Swiss side. They sit with binoculars and take note of what's happening, and send the Grenzwache (spelling?) out to stop anyone that looked suspicious when crossing.    
Were there allotments and a BP station immediately before the crossing on the Swiss side?

			Hi Bill,   
I agree that it is easier to park at the airport.   
For future reference, there is a car park at Lausanne train station. It's just behind it (i.e. lakeside).   
Don't know the tarifs off by heart but it is quite expensive from what I remember (like all the car parks in Lausanne!)

			It is a much better trip by train, but you will have the problem of getting all your stuff on there. Whether it is possible to do a removal by train is another question.   
From what I've been told you need to have your registration or some other piece of paper before crossing the border, plus lists of everything in your boxes. Then the border crossing guards won't give you any grief about customs duties for things you've already owned for years. There may be other paperwork involved as well, but my experience is with doing this kind of thing via professional removal companies.

			Well,    
I was thinking of asking where driverx gave me the number to (zoll luzern). If they give me a whole lot of paper work and this and that, Im just gonna forget it. I know that I will have to change the lights on the car, (expecially since I put illegal ones on, by the brakes) I guess when you young you think you can get away with anything. hehe. I might just leave it in Macedonia and drive it when I go there on vacation. (even though it an't registered anywhere anymore) I can get insurance in Macedonia though for my car, so at least thats good (they dont ask for any kind of documents for it when I insure it) Sometimes those are the benifits of a poor country. Just give them money and no questions asked. eheheh   
Thank you guys for all your suggestions and comments, 
anyone planning to go to Macedonia? Need to rent a car?  
heheheheheheheeheheh

			The site posted by Lob is pretty good for estimating before you're going (or whilst on the way) if you're going to have a problem to get a space.   
I usually use P1 and P51.  P1 is convenient, expensive and often full.  P51 is slightly cheaper, 200m walk and full less often.   
I'm told that if you really have a problem and all car parks are full, to use the Valet Parking in P1, which although is more expensive again, guarantees a space.  However, I've never had to do this, so I can't vouch for it personally.

			Essentially, one third of the fines never get paid and it's too costly to follow up. Usually it's Germans who are not used to the concept of speed limits and if you are from abroad, then it's difficult to track you down. Still, 60% of fines sent to Germans are paid, whereas only roughly a quarter of those expedited to France are settled.   
If you want to see what you might be looking at:     
Consequences to be faced in your case depend on how well the Swiss and British police work together. There are agreements with certain countries to put pressure on people to pay up their bills.   
However, as you massively exceeded the speed limit without being arrested, what may happen is that, should you be in Switzerland and get caught up in a ""Verkehrskontrolle"", they may see the previous offence and hold you responsible there and then. This has been done in the past, as the archives of the city of Zurich show.   
I presume it is superfluous to say that you shouldn't be speeding in the first place and that any consequence to be faced should not be grumbled at.

			This won't help much....     
A few years ago I moved from Luxembourg unexpectedly (I was working on an IT project that was due to run for two years but got terminated after seven months when the company got investigated for tax avoidance). A couple of months previously I had leased a nice Audi (imported from Germany even). I then bought the car from the lease company who didn't charge me tax because I was exporting it from the EU. After a few more months I went along to customs expecting to pay Swiss tax - they weren't very interested and I ended up on Z plates for a year. After the year was up I again went to customs expecting to pay tax. Oh no. Because I had owned the car for more than six months I could import it tax free. I only wish it was a trick that I could repeat....

			Global warming is not such a clear cut issue as many scientists on the pro side make out. There are also many scientists who believe that humans do not have the capability of influencing the Earths weather patterns and that global warming is just part of the Earths cycle of heating and cooling. Personally I'm not sure what to believe anymore, I've read a lot on both sides of the argument and for every glacier thats reported to be shrinking you can find one thats  , the Antartic is actually   down and the ice sheets are getting thicker, sea levels are   and not rising. For each of the links I've posted I could find dozens more that contradict the global warming scare stories that are so prevelant in the media. In fact many scientists think we may actually be heading for an  /  and not the sweltering planet that has been predicited.   
As for planting more trees etc to off-set carbon use this in itself could have  . It is now thought that the mini-ice age that started back in the 14th Century was caused by the Black Death or plague. As many farmers died crops were not cut and land not cultivated therefore many more trees sprang up soaking up carbon from the air which caused the climate to cool.    
Regardless of whether we can or cannot influence the weather on such a global scale we should do all be can to limit polution in all it's forms and look after whichever small part of the planet we occupy.

Also, when you buy a new (to you) car, make sure it has a fresh MFK. They are valid for two years, and you want one done in the last few months preferably. The procedure for MFK is very very strict (spotless inside the car, under the car and in the engine), and repairs can be extremely expensive. My father in law once had his pristine-condition car rejected on the MFK because it didn't have a third shoulder belt in the back seat. This was in a car that didn't come equipped with one when his was manufactured, but they insisted anyway.

Directions from Oerlikon are head out to glattbrugg, go past the big UBS investment bank centre (UBS Warburg of old) and turn right out towards Rumlang, Oberglatt, Neerach etc. keep on going till the roundabout about 3km then straight on (fox town should be on your right) and take the next proper right and the first left which is not a proper street just a gap between two buildings. This brings you into an open area and they are just in front of you.

			Hi,  We  (My swiss husband and I) shipped our American Ford Taurus in 1991 from California to CH (OK, ages ago I know), and had to pay to alter the car to fit the Strassenverkehrsamt's rules. At the time it cost around Sfr2000 which included disabling the foresighted safety features which were not yet legal here.  It was well worth the effort to bring the car over and change it to suit.  We had already had had a previous auto insurance policy with a company, which were happy to insure the new vehicle. Good Luck!

7872	25.04.2006, 23:33	Junior Member	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	Location: basel	"    I would suggest registering it on time restricted import plates for the first 12 months and then officially importing it. This way you remove the need to pay duty and the VAT which is calculated on the present worth will also be reduced. Insurance is more expensive by the way and it therefore will be very dependent on the price difference between the German model and the Swiss one.    
So other suggestions why not try going and looking at EU imported cars on the web. Someone else has then had the headache.    
I know someone who would recommend Webo.ch in Oberglatt... Oh and with these guys offer them a few percent below the plate price they are much more likely to haggle...

			Most of the time the barging on trams, trains etc does not bother me; I see it as part of living here. But having said that there are times it has made me mad; I spent quite a long time on crutches after surgery and still people would barge me out the way and not give up their seat. The other time it has annoyed me is when pregnant or carrying my son in a baby carrier, still no bloody consideration from most people.  I have noticed this behaviour elsewhere too; when in Paris, my friend who is permanantly on crutches as she only has one leg was pushed out of the way by some guy deperate to get the disabled seat that she was aiming for on a bus.

I went to pick it up and the chap behind the counter gave me a bent and twisted lump of metal that may or may not have been my number plate.   
I laughed, like you would.   
""Hold on a minute"" he says and goes out back, there is much banging and grinding, and he comes back with a plate restored almost to it's former self.     
Now that's good service.   
The funny thing is the found report which said km 26 of the highway by Uster.  Hmmm.  Haven't driven up or down that since before January so I've no idea how it got there.

			I have been reading how everybody is desperate to prevent speeding fines and is worried about drunk drivers so I have to say who here actually uses the public transport system.    
Now I am not a great fan of public transport but I must say that I have never in all my travellings come across anything more reliable and better than the Swiss system (built by the British...) and to boot you do not always have to pay because the guys who check your tickets appear about as often as the unmarked highway patrol...   
So do you use the Swiss public network and if you do is it not the best?

Actually, I've just moved out of ZH to SZ; people there seem much nicer too....easier-going, more likely to help and be flexible   "	null	null	null	Public transport with a buggy	guest	null

			Yes it is that time of year again... the snow is falling the temperature has dropped and the roads are icy... Time for those winter tyres!!   
I tried to book the car in to have winter tyres fitted and there was nothing available for at least 10 days... So I hunted around to see if I could find a drive in and Q garage... Would you believe it I did!    
Adam Touring in Wollishofen, Seestrasse 500 let you just pitch up and wait. I didn't wait that long only 15min and then they changed my tyres! You can drop in between 8 am till 10:30 and then 13:15 till 16:15 Mon-Fri!
