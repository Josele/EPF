			I wouldn't buy expensive electronic equipment at Interdiscount. I know people who have witnessed similar things. They are just salesmen, don't care too much about after-sales service. Go to shops like digitec.ch or similar for cheaper cameras and better service. Avoid Media Markt too, Saturn is supposed to be better but can't confirm from personal experience.

			I had a problem with my Nikon D750: when there was a memory card(s) inserted, then the green memory card indicator/LED was sometimes together with the  top LCD regardless whether the camera was power on or off. 
Without any memory card the top LCD empty indicator was blinking. 
This activity drained the battery overnight. However it wasn't happening always :-) 
My camera was repaired by the Swiss Nikon service three times:  
the first time all the advisory/recall items were done (new shutter), but they claimed the actual issue doesn't happen.  
2nd time: they claimed the memory card I've enclosed was faulty, thus no repair.  
3rd time: "" 1A5G - TOGO PCB UNIT"" replaced, which seems to be the main electronic board. Finally it is fixed.

			I work as a kindergarten teacher very close to Zurich, my class of 20 is as mixed as can be, all shades and most kids speak at least two, if not three languages.   
Kids of refugees, asylum seekers, expats, immigrants and Swiss parents go to school together and have the normal quabbles about playthings and being first and so on. No bullying whatsoever, at least not about color or language.  
It is normal around here and I like it this way.    
In small cities or villages, this seems to be more of a challenge. Some people seem to be afraid of being overrun by ""foreigners"" and don't scold their own offspring for bullying such kids.   
I feel for you. It is heartbreaking for the parents.   
Most schools have anti-bullying-programs, just talk to the teachers and tell them. Most teachers are happy to help.

One Albanian guy complained so many times about various issues he just gave up. He actually wanted to collect signatures from all neighbours so the woman in charge at the agency would have to quit her job!! He told me recently we sort of became friends. The other neighbours are just either cowards or both actually! One guy who is in the Siedlungskommission told me the other day 'love it here improved my quality of life'. He used to live in the old complex which got knocked down and had been super old. Whilst he was telling me this I spotted a bag of flour full with mould (cellar issue as mentioned)..hence the people here are just bloody bizarre.   
My boyfriend who came here from a Northern country is actually saying he has not come across such weirdos before. For him this treatment we get here is beyond strange.    
Anyhow I just hope we find a new flat soon or else I will just sign up for a place at the mental hospital soon..!      Oh and I tried talking to Implenia too probably THE worst company I ever came across!    
They are just taking the piss excuse my language. They told me to open the windows when I complained about the dust and white stuff coming from the ventilation. Shame is we actually cannot open the living room window at all. Panorama window and all that crap. I should sue them for such an answer??!   
I will send another letter next week and will most likely withhold rent next time.   
Only thing I worry about is the baby. If I pop off tomorrow I do not mind just want her to get out of this shithole asap.      "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: Sep 2012	Groaned at 23 Times in 5 Posts	Dealing with a crappy flat and awful 'Genossenschaft'	Posts: 53

			My understanding is that health costs in the vast majority of countries are increasing at well above inflation costs, so nothing really Swiss here, except the way the costs are passed on. 
In countries with government run health systems, such as France or the UK, the increased costs are broadly just tagged on to government debt and left to later generations to deal with. In others, some attempts are made to balance the books. In Switzerland, where the health system isn't government run, the costs are simply passed straight on to the patients.

			It was written 1 week delivery, when I ordered my bed frames 6.5 weeks ago. I'm still waiting. I have both written and called regarding my order and have since received a new order confirmation and a returned product confirmation of my original order. My bill Now has  2 x delivery cost and other costs and Mahnung charges for the products I still haven't received. I was planning on paying the bill first when the merchandise arrived. But I am still waiting and they are continually adding to my bill, retuning items I never even received!! Terrible service. Wish I never would have ordered from them.

I thought I understood why they brought the barriers in, people used to abuse the pick up/drop off zone. The result at certain times was just one big traffic jam.    
Since the barriers are there it runs much more smoothly. Now with this 15 minute allowance, I reckon it'll get clogged up again pretty quickly. I thought the 5 mins to get in and out was a pretty good solution.

			Not everyone likes to receice gifts in general, or happens to like the particular gift. In this case the recipients are 2 or 3 people, depending how you count, and they may not share the same opinion about the gift itself.   
I offer this in some sort if defence, from memories of having agonised over how to possibly fulfil the dreaded instruction to write a thank-you note for something that I personally wished I had not been made to receive in the first place.   
For my own sake, if ever I give a gift, I consider it as having left my possession and having tranferred over to the other person, who is then free to do what they want with it, including giving it away or selling it. In my way of feeling (when a giver), a recipient who takes the trouble to write thank-you note is doing a good, upstanding, nice, respectable thing, but I try not to hang about expecting it, and try to set the recipient free from any such duty - most especially if they are parents of a newborn baby. I don't always succeed in being so noble, though.   
Perhaps a thank-you note is more mportant when the giver(s) acted out of a  selfless generosity that does not stem from any personal connection, just strangers who were hugely compassionate and generous.     
I know of such a case currently, where many good folk pooled together, contributing smaller and larger sums, even spreading the news of the need amongst friends even further removed, and only thanks to this amazing support by so many could the little boat (metaphorically speaking) be successful rescued from the storms and brought into safety.... and not one thank-you note in there, from the captain of the little boat, not even after a break to rest. 
I found it very sad.

			Castro - This is a bit different than your problem, but we have a Samsung refrigerator/freezer that does not have an icemaker. The problem we have is the freezer (at the bottom) had a defrost problem that was causing the cooling cycle (of fridge and freezer) to turn itself off quite often, resulting in a worse problem.    
I defrosted it myself a few times, using a hair dryer for about an hour. But it kept coming back. Eventually, I found that the ice had built up way back in the cooling system and I needed to let it thaw overnight for all of the ice to melt. Now that all of the ""cooling passages"" are unblocked, everything seems to work correctly again. The unit is at least 7 yrs old, so pretty happy with its durability now that I understand what the problem is/was.   
Good luck with the new fridge!

			Second bad experience with cheap mobile providers.  I switched to Coop mostly for free calls with my husband who is also on the Salt network.  It was a mess.  Coop themselves told me that Salt give them terrible service.  My first request didn't go through, they told me to cancel my other service too early so I ended up without any phone at all while I had visitors.  No one at Interdiscount or Coop had a clue what was going on.   
Eventually I got my SIM ""activated"" as confirmed by SMS using that work, but I found that I had to top up way before I expected.  I rang and found out that: 1, they can't, and have absolutely no interest in giving you information about your calls and SMS and how they have used your pre-paid amount. 2: although they sms that your account is ""activated"" they don't actually give you the 500MG first month free data.  That, they don't tell you, is a separate activation process.  The customer service person all but refused to tell me what was going on.  Because I hadn't done a separate activation that no one told me about, from the beginning I was paying for data.  He told me he couldn't add up all the usage, then suddenly he could, but the amount didn't make sense etc.   
A service that cannot tell you your phone usage is useless.  Coop seems to be held hostage to Salt, who care not at all for Coop customers and told me so when I asked them directly in a store.   
I am now, I hope finally, with Aldi Switzerland having had nothing but good service from them for the rest of Europe.  Their customer service people are fantastic and it appears, although I have not go that far yet, that I can access all my account information online, which I consider normal service.  And I have received CHF60 in sign on bonuses which makes up for the waste of time and money with Coop!

They basically sent me a friendly threat letter, giving me exactly 21 days to register, and again, for 500 CHF a year, I will not tolerate this in Switzerland, I mean, it is even below Angolan standards and we are talking about a first world country here.   
Billag can go do the following. they can go contact the government and see in tax declatations regarding vehicle ownership and models and if they have radio receivers. Then they can go contact swisscom and other companies with the consent of the govenrment, as well as my internet providers. They can go contact them, to find out if I have a radio and a tv. Because in the nearly 500 CHF, that is what I expect. Would they charge me 30 chf or something, no problem, i gladly go fill out internet forms.   
regarding the law that i need to notify billag, it is also the law that a ton of thing do not happen but keep happening but the law here does nothing about it, i do not need to list examples but apparently it is forbidden to make noise in switzerland after 10pm, and i called the police twice already to make some folks shut up that were too busy smoking drugs and drinking themselves, throwing parties, so that goes two ways with me. they do not send the police to make people shut up, so in my book they do not provide what i have the right to, so for the 500 chf that i am willing to pay btw, billag can go to work and send me the invoice. if the law fails to provide me my rights already twice, it can get back to work to send me invoices instead of me inviting them to send me one.

			The answer is no. Easy. As much as I'd like to believe otherwise, I doubt it'll be the first white lie you've ever told in an interview.    
As to the getting upset part (i.e. red face) - why? People are people all over, over, but that doesn't mean the interview norms are the same as ""back home"". Maybe he's making conversation in a thoughtless way, maybe he's trying to decide whether or not to hire you... but either way, getting upset doesn't help. Take a deep breath and let it slide.   
Have a look at Phil's point. If you hire someone who goes on maternity leave half a year later, you've spent a lot of money to poor effect (and will have to spend more to hire and train a temp while that person is out). It sucks from their point of view, just as it sucks from your point of view to be discriminated against.   
I say this not to justify, but to help you empathize - they're running a business and have to think about the costs. Realize that, understand it, and use that understanding to keep yourself calm next time it happens - it'll work out better for you in the long run.

			I take it all back, that's a genuine complaint, which are few and far between around these parts.    
I apologise for being flippant before - you are clearly feeling horribly disappointed and with clear justification.    
I'm no expert on these sorts of things, there are others here better placed for this, but I would definitely try to speak with them.    
It will never remove the anger which you must feel over this complete waste of time (at a huge expense) but the best you can hope for is a decent refund. Personally I doubt you will get it all (and you have asked for 75% which seems reasonable given the amount of attendance that occurred).

Well, this is correct, so the agent looks to be following  the protocol which is applied in such cases in CH.   
We did it here just the same, with the difference pets were allowed in general, but the tenants had to have the suffix to the contract, when they aquired their pet after moving in.

			You say you pay Fr. 300 per month to rent that parking space.  In that case, the fact that an unauthorised car is preventing you from using what you're paying for might constitute a shortcoming (Mangel) of the rented object.     
If this is the case - and I'd suggest you ask the Mieterverband whether this reasoning is sound - then it would be the duty of your landlord to have the offending car removed, so that you, once again, can used the space to which you are entitled.     
If the landlord does not do so, after you have requested in in writing, and set a date by which the shortcoming must be fixed, then you could threaten to pay your rent into a blocked account until they do.   
Next port of call, I'd say, is the Mieterverband.   
Edit: 
This article in the Beobachter  
explains that the police are not the correct adddress for cars parked on private grounds.  It goes on to warn that the costs of having the car towed, if for any reason not paid by the car's owner, can be charged to the person who called out the tow-service (you).  However, the article concludes with the remark that  
""Diese [die Vermieterschaft] ist dafür verantwortlich, dass Sie Ihr Mietobjekt vertragsgemäss nützen können."" 
The landlord is responsible for ensuring that you can use the object you have rented according the the conditions of the contract. 
(i.e., to park your car there).

			I had a couple of weird encounters over the years, but I believe it was mostly targeted at me for being German, not just foreign. I met a lot of nice Swiss and a lot of rather cold and unwelcoming Swiss. But I never had the feeling they were treating me any different from anybody else, but were generally not exactly the warmest and most welcoming folks around... particularly in Zurich for some reason.

			Hi,   
I know I am reviving a very old thread here. But, I have a very pleasant experience with Privera very recently when I moved in. I have requested them to give me the key before 1st of August as my rental agreement start date is as of 1st of August and they certainly obliged the request. That has really helped me furnish it quickly and move in by July 31st.

124	06.08.2016, 20:04	Member	Thanked 149 Times in 56 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Haha twenty years and nothing's changed       If you want another one:   
The room was to be rented out from the 5th August. This guy wrote to me on the 4th, by then the room was already gone of course. 
He was 41, even though we had stated that we were looking for someone between 22-35. 
He also only addressed me (female) in the email and not the other flatmate (male), making things worse by addressing me     (I have the name of a goddess/princess).   
Considering  it was the 4th and by then I had already received an array of silly  emails, I couldn't be bothered to write back to someone who didn't care  to respect our search criteria and was obviously a creep.   
On the  6th (keep in mind the 5th was the moving in date), he wrote me (again  only me) another email, asking how things looked, since he had not  received a reply. Again, I did not reply. Yeah, I guess I was in a  bitchy mood the last few days...   
And then, on the 8th, he  actually wrote again! ""I got it and I won't be bothering you anymore.  Shame you don't have the decency to send a reply."" 
Seriously?! And  you apparently don't have the decency to notice when your application is  not called for! If an agency sets specific criteria, say an apartment  is only for families with children, you don't apply as a single and  expect a reply! Why would you treat a flatshare differently?!   
As I  had the day off, I decided to pen a snotty little reply... In his first  email, he mentioned he had no flatsharing experience, so I decided to  give him 'tips' on how to procede for the future in a very business-like  manner  
Basically I told him the following: 
- He shouldn't expect a reply and even less a positive response when writing 1 day before the official moving date. 
-  He should damn well respect the search criteria and with his 41 years,  he would not have been invited anyway. I am not age-ist btw, I also  denied those who were younger than 22  
- He ought to address all flatmates, not only the female ones. 
- He ought to refrain from making creepy compliments...   
I ended it with a 'I hope our answer was helpful to you' as in 'don't bother writing back'  
Quote: Wir hoffen, Ihnen mit unserer Antwort gedient zu haben und wünschen Ihnen alles Gute.   
I did however get a reply: 'I shouldn't take the whole thing so seriously.'    Coming from the guy who thinks he needs to check up every second day for a flatshare room in Zurich

			Marijuana is not legal here. But no one gives a shit. Go to any city center on a Saturday night, you will smell it everywhere. No one cares.  
Selling has been illegal for a while now too. Not sure to what extent anyone cares about that, though.    
I don't quite know what your problem is. If it's the noise: talk to them, the landlord, or - if all else fails - the police.    
Other than that I'm not quite sure what downsides you're experiencing because your neighbor is selling and/or smoking pot, supposedly anyway as you seem to have zero proof. Personally, even if I had proof, I wouldn't care. Maybe before making accusations, you should be sure your accusations are actually legit.

			Here's a few explanations:   
The club was possibly a) full and/or b) didn't let in men that are not accompanied by women and/or c) you were wearing the wrong clothes. Especially b) happens all the time - when I go to a club with girlfriends, we are asked almost every time by a group of guys to go in with them cause otherwise they wouldn't be permitted.   
As for pools, you may have a) either arrived shortly before closing and/or b) the pool was overcrowded. Plus Longbyt's comment makes a lot of sense too.   
I also doubt you are a) an asylum seeker (based on your profile) and/or b) hold an F/N permit. And even if you are and/or do, I have yet to see someone being asked for their permit when entering a club or swimming pool.    
As far as ""bus, trains, Migros, Coop, gym etc."" are concerned, no idea how that is relevant as nothing happened in either.    
Oh edit, I just realized you're the same guy who thinks he's being controlled in the tram/bus every time whereas ""whites"" are not. Though everyone has said that is not the truth, you stuck to your opinion, so I guess any reasonable arguing here is a lost cause         Yes Basel (which is extremely liberal, so getting to this point must have a reason):   "	considered unworthy	Join Date: Apr 2016	Groaned at 14 Times in 4 Posts	Is such act allowed by the government and people???

The problem is that people simply go on autoscout and then try to price their car along the line of what dealers ask for a second hand car. Dealers here slap some 3-5k on the market price and indeed wait for 6-12 months till an idiot comes along. You can do the same as a private seller if you have the time and don't need the cash... but if you actually want to sell it do you need to understand what a realistic price is.     
We had loads of cases on EF where private sellers seriously thought they could ask for   money than a dealer, because their car ""is the absolute best kept one""...

			The initial urge to save money makes us go to these sites, which have many hidden charges...On edreams, one i paid extra for no cancellation charges. Later, it turned out that it was only for waiving edreams's charges in case of cancellation. As I was issued a non refundable ticket, I ended up paying extra without any benefit  
It is best to go with airline website or with US/UK based travel agents as the price in most cases is all inclusive...one may have to pay currency conversion charges though!

As per the subject. 
You can blame it on mobile phones. 
Back when there were no mobile phones, you actually had to keep appointments - simply because there was no way of telling the other party you couldn't make it.   
These days, with mobile phones ubiquitous, people can and do change their mind on a whim, often at the last moment ""because something has come up"". 
They could inform the other party, of course, but some just don't seem to have the guts to do so. Another trait of our times.

			Oh, and in my shopping list for bargains I forgot to add - check out Otto's stores, and the Radikal Liquidations stores - the latter is a variation on the UK ""pound shops"".  I think they're only in the German speaking part of Swissy - they have a range of groceries, booze and general household items; but for cleaning products plus Asian and Italian ingredients they're particularly brilliant!

			I wonder if a cordon of Tabasco sauce would do the trick?   
You can at least protect your bed by putting little coffee cans filled with petrol under each leg. That will prevent them from climbing up in the night and nipping your nads while you sleep.   
I understand that the little ants with which you house would appear to be infested are well known for such nocturnal nibblings, which accounts for their name in German: Schafseckelameisen. In days gone by, farmers would be forced to protect their rams by all kinds of arcane means, for once an army of ants had acquired a taste for scrotal scran, it was almost impossible to get rid of them. They would nestle between the little woolly hairs down there, munching away quite merrily, while the ram was rapidly driven to insanity, thus becoming utterly useless to the farmer, except as a source of wool or as a rather inefficient beast of burden (there is a wide selection of ram saddles and yokes in the permanent exhibition of the Sheep Museum in Wollerau, should you happen to be Welsh).   
Obviously, as a human, a good scratch is clearly a very satisfactory option, should your nether regions become infested by such formidable formicid fiends, so insanity is unlikely to result from such an itchy invasion.   
Precautions are advisable, all the same, however. There's only so much distraction a gentleman can take while enjoying a good book, a cup of hot chocolate, a game of Twister, or whatever else he might choose to do in the comfort of his bed chamber.   
You may want to lay off the cigars, though, at least until the ants have gone.

This was just before we moved here- and it is not that I 'didn't like them' it turned out that I have a condition (undiagnosed at the time)  which makes it impossible for me to wear them without falling over, or feeling sick. As we then moved to Switzerland and had lots of hassle with my parents demise, etc, etc- I was not able to return them to VisionExpress in UK on time for them to take them back and get a refund- they cost me nearly £500- so was not amused!   
We now go back to UK anyhow regularly (daughters, grandchildren, family and friends there) - so buying simple reading or driving glasses is much cheaper there. I would not go there just to buy glasses, but as we go at least 3x a year, why not? Clearer now? As for shopping in France from here- I virtually live 1 minute from the border, and about less than 15 mins to the big shops, so no hassle either. Our excellent French dentist is less than 5 mins away, so repeated visits not a problem.   
Some of us UK expats still love Engerland- and just love going back to see family and friends- and enjoy the wonderful contrast with our lives here too. For us, our lives here would never be as wonderful without regular visits to the best England has to offer. Does not have to be either/or- better or worse, etc. We have 2 lives and love it that way. Go 'home' when we go there, come back 'home' when we come back here. Wonderful.

			Yep, here, there and everywhere with mobiles. First thing we notice when we get to M20 and M25 then M11- every white van driver on mobile, and a large % of cars too- and how aggressive people are- same in Surrey at peak times. I think drivers are changing and have been for some years- in busy parts of - anywhere.   
My sister-in-law had an accident at a roundabout in the UK and was really shaken and didn't drive for a while. She took 4 driving lessons with a good instructor and it got her back on the road. Driving in a different country, different side of the road, different rules - and perhaps different drivers takes time and confidence- so why not. Perhaps avoid peak times in the near future until you know the town well?

Fish sold as fresh in UK supermarkets cannot have been frozen - it can only be chilled.  Therefore the availability of fresh fish is proven.   
My local fish shop in the middle of the UK collected chilled fish from London every day.  In Grimsby the Lincolnshire chippies collect it right from the boat.     
Of course, there are many F&C shops that use cheap, frozen imported fish.  They would only get my custom once - the difference in the product is obvious.

			Non-formal and somewhat shortened translation:   
you ordered a wardrobe in your branch xy.  Promised delivery in 3-4 weeks but actual delivery happened in 5 weeks.  Replacement door promised in 3-4 weeks.   
after 8 weeks you phoned,  got told they tried to contact you but no missed call on the smartphone.  Due to holidays and inability by Toptip delivery of replacement door got  postponed into the new year. Assemblers arrived unannounced, door  broken again.    
Again replacement promised in 3-4 weeks. Last saturday you went by the branch only to be told, takes another 5 weeks.   
you can accept the first delayed delivery and the broken doors, but not the service quality at all:   
You  still like the wardrobe, still want the contract be fulfilled by both  parties<to be removed if wrong>. but you will not accept further delays. Since they promised delivery in 5 weeks you take them by their word: 
You set a final deadline, delivery to happen by March 19, exact time and date of delivery to be agreed upon.   
Absent  satisfactory delivery by said date you reserve the right to cancel the  contract, with full reimbursement without any deductions. Costs for  getting the wardrobe back to Toptip to be born by Toptip.

			Note to self.     
Don't shoot from the hip on numbers.  There are plenty of smart people on this forum who will spot the anomalies.   
We live on a private road. Yes, I'm told it has a 40% grade (not degree - my error) in parts. No I haven't measured it, but was told that by the street committee (can't pronounce the correct name but basically the home owners group responsible for applying our funds for road repairs)     
Which is why we don't have removals trucks or garbage trucks here in the winter.  And why, when I needed a mechanic recently, he had to come to us because it's not safe to tow anything down the mountain in winter conditions.  And why most tradesmen and taxis don't bother coming here in the winter.  And why the tractor that kind of clears the road of snow, winds up with huge tyre chains on as well.   
I can assure you that I am not at 15kph when I am going down the steep gradients!  And yes, engine braking is a given, but still not always enough.     
My wishful thinking remains that the drivers that choose to ignore the private road signs and race up and down our mountain use some common sense for us in more cumbersome vehicles.   
Thanks to those posters for confirming those road rules.     
Safe driving all!

			Not able to help with your query.   
The Post service has an excellent reputation.   
I presume your post box has your first & last names clearly displayed.   
There maybe something a bit odd with your address, so would recommend as much information as possible including postcode and perhaps add the Canton (maybe you have a small Village/Town of similar name somewhere else).  Consider putting your mobile phone number.   
If you are ordering from Ebay UK, sometimes they are Chinese sellers and items come there, so need to allow extra time.  We check their feedback to get an idea.   
Good Luck.

			I understand all the pissed off people here, but I also understand that is hard to guarantee any delivery time for products that are not on stock (and even more so, that are directly delivered to you). It's (most of the time) not a made up excuse. Just try it yourselves with the products that are on stock!    
The problem with the suppliers is that sometimes they don't even have an electronic systems where online shops can check the stock. So they just take the ""general"" delivery time as an estimation (maybe it would help if they would specify this). Unfortunately, sometimes this delivery time is way higher than expected, sometimes the product is not even available anymore...

And yet, I know several couples who 'gave up' trying, after years and years- and got pregnant soon afterwards as they relaxed and began to enjoy life together. And several who did go the adoption route and then got pregnant soon after- for the same reasons. And some who did go the adoption route - and truly regret not having done so sooner. Like friends of ours in the UK who were already in their 50s and adopted 3 sibblings, aged 2, 4 and 6. They are so happy but wish they had not wasted more than 10 years of their lives being so stressed and unhappy.   
As Oldhand says- the couple, and it has to be as a couple, are the only ones to decide how they proceed. I say couple because I know in some cases one of the two truly wants to stop trying, but daren't express this- putting huge strain on the relationship and often breaking it.   
Hope you find a way, YOUR way, and get all the support you need. x

Anybody without brain should know that the best country in the world is CH. Everything is good here!  Schweizer Qualität! And do you know why it's so good?? It's because it's so expensive! Isn't that so ****ing obvious??  
Rule number one here: if it's costlier it MUST be good. if it's cheaper it MUST be bad. Performance and results are secondary. 
Why are you expats so objective and rational? Have you no imagination?   
Jokes aside: there could be a lot of reasons for the higher cost. Switzerland, from what I've read, spends way more than many countries on the transport network. Manpower costs are higher. It could also be that the number of trains operated or their frequencies are higher. Then there's the tax factor: I don't know if other European governments fund these institutions to a higher degree than in Switzerland.

However this has to be reasonably compensation and it is established that 500.- is over the mark.   
In practise they will normally ring you first, to tell you that they would like to offer the flat to you and to ask if you are still interested - so you normally only pay this kind of fees if you really mess up.

			Hmm.. I find service levels in Switzerland are excellent. What you mentioned appears to rather be related to language / cultural barriers.    
Personally, I feel awful for people working in the US service industry for having to regularly take crap and sometimes abuse from customers bc certain rules, such as the one that the customer is allegedly always right.    
The customer is king rule encourages customers to get loud and use abusive language to have their meals comped or get merchandize for free and that would just not work here, which I think is a good thing.

			Your belongings might not be lost forever... One of my suitcases was once misplaced by Air France during the Christmas holiday season (so full of gifts), and they had no idea where it was for a week.     
It ends up that they somehow found it in Milan, while I had travelled to Nice! We were spending Christmas with family in an area with no airport nearby, so they ended up delivering it via taxi to the place where we were staying!   
So you might have the same experience - I wouldn't lose hope just yet!! (even though it's super annoying, and I did have to call their customer service loads of time. One piece of advice, ask for a specific contact person and their direct line so you don't waste your time on hold...)

			Hi,   
I stayed in one of their apartments and I had the similar behavior. So, in other words, this is the usual practice they have. I have received my deposit 3.5 months later than expected and after I let them know I'm prepared to get legal help.  
The bad thing is that the deposit with this company is not the usual Swiss rent deposit in a neutral bank account, but directly in their own account. This makes things difficult. They also have a statement in their contracts that the deposit shall be returned in maximum 3 months if I recall correctly, so any day sooner you'll get it, consider it a personal victory   Everybody's experience with them is similar: slow answers, excuses, delays. Make sure you have a legal insurance ready and try to communicate with them on this term, but my advice is not to engage yet in discussions with a lawyer since the specified time for returning the deposit (3 months) has not yet been reached.

Most likely no duty as Traiffnumber 4817.2000  is duty free from EU and China.   
kartenmacherei.ch    Here, although most likely sent from Germany I do not expect any additional tax as they have a Swiss VAT number.

			I don't know about UPS or USPS, but DHL has bad conditions for one time customers: Last year I ordered shirts worth 84$ in an American online store. DHL charged me:   
- ca. 8 Fr. VAT/MWSt, as I expected 
- 17 Fr. administrative fee 
- 8 Fr. Vorlagenprovision (interest for their generousity to advance the VAT to the customs)       
Their advise for frequent importers is to open a ZAZ-Konto (""Zentralisiertes Abrechnungsverfahren der Zollverwaltung""), DHL won't charge you this 25 Fr. if you have one.   
There is nothing for you to get back because web shops from the US don't include VAT in their prices.

			We realised this a few years ago when we drove to the french side by accident, and when my husband mentioned it to colleagues, he was told it was ""well known"" so its clearly not an exchange rate anomaly.  A few weeks after this, I dropped a visitor off at depatures and used the short stay meter parking, where it was 2 Chf for something like 15 mins, or 1 euro for 15 mins at exactly the same parking meter (it was a while back, might not have remembered the figures right) I checked the exchange rate and thought it was 20% or so cheaper to pay by euros at the same meter    
Haven't checked regarding the price of coffee mind you ...   
Hire car prices were, a few years back, also cheaper on the French side, but we have not hired a car from the airport for quite a few years now, so I do not know if it is still true.

This is a bit like the German können / durfen thing - yes they can, no they won't.    Hmm, where did you see it well articulated by the SVP??    see above...    Mussen / können - no they don't, but they wan't to because it's the easiest cheapest most effective option.    Actually many people probably have no idea, or interest to find out - the only time they hear about it is probably via the SVP leaflets.    No, they're extremely creative at targetting just about anything that could win them a vote.    Because they want to win?    You're surprised SVP members aren't outraged at their own advertising???   
You don't think a significant proportion of the Swiss population believe they're ridiculous???   
This is divisional politics!  Compare with the UK - a big part of the population think Jeremy Corbin is the second coming, another big proportion think he's a luny Stalinist, and a majority think he's unelectable so don't really care anyway.    Money and votes.        By allowing debate and freedom, even if it means some idiots abuse that right.    How could you negotiate peace deals between parties who are in many cases infinitely worse than the SVP, if you wouldn't even allow open debate at home?    Bullshit - Switzerland has one of the most open and challenging political systems in the world. The fact it is representative of petty human fears is a fact of democracy, and the checks and balances seem to generally work.

			Okay, before I go into this, I should note that the comment above on the sudden shift in currency is really important in all this. by having the prices articifically spiked by twenty or more percent, it has really upset the apple cart on a lot of this. That said, as someone in manufacturing here, my $0.02 is:   
If the Swiss want to claim that their high cost of labor is offset by their high productivity, then it has to show up in their prices in the form of being competitive. It's really as simple as that. If something costs more in Switzerland than the higher cost has simply resulted in...higher cost. If the price isn't competitive, it is silly to ask a consumer to spend their money poorly. I see no reason to pay more for something because it is Swiss. If it happens to also be better, then yes.    
As a manufacturer, I   tell my customers to buy my stuff instead of the Germans' because we are Swiss. Either we get our cost out if we are competiting head-to-head, or we find a way to give the customer a unique value. But it is never sensible to ask a customer to pay more if you are not providing more for the money in some form. And, if you are going to rely on that strategy, there will be a reckoning for you one day, and, in turn, your employees, and their pension funds. Maybe it's when someone like Aldi crashes your market, or when the local economy shrinks and you can't diversify outside of your country because you are not competitive, or when your cusotmers simply stop buying from you because it no longers makes sense for them. But one day, it will come.   
But I would never support telling the consumer base that they should overspend to help support a little price fantasyland. It does the consumer no favors, and, in the long term, it does the seller no favors, either.

			Hello Again!   
Thanks for your quick responses, I feel much better now :-)   
Having worked here with Swiss colleagues for over 5 years, I think I can judge whether the extent to the rudeness was due to a language barrier. If someone was too busy or too stressed, they can simply offer to call me back or explain the situation nicely. And what was with the ""I am the boss here, so I can speak with the rude tone"" answer? No matter what your position is, you can deal with stressful situation calmly. I'd take it she just had a bad day and I'll forget about it. If someone can't handle a 1 minutes conversation over the phone on changing appointment, how can I trust them with a child which requires more patience. We originally picked the dr from a colleague's recommendation.   
I know dr Nina is back from Maternity in Dec, was intending to go back to see her once she's back. Sorry didn't add that on the original post.   
I'm happy to read great recommendations on sihldoc for kids. The receptionist didn't speak English but with my pigeon German somehow we managed to find an appointment slot. She was very sympathetic and said that dr's speaks English. It's actually closer to work. It's a win-win solution.   
Thank you all again for your helpful responses and I will contact admin to change the subject.

My Mother arrived in Oxford from the Irish Republic in 1946, joining her sister who'd married an englishman a year earlier.

			Whilst, I'm a strong believer that us mere mortals shouldn't always bend over to be shafted by the establishment, and, sometimes, it is important to stand up and argue our principles, I also think that it is also beneficial to apply a modicum of common sense to some situations.   
Whether it is right or wrong, 30 chufs is not a great deal to pay for something that was requested to be sent, especially as it could possibly end up in the commercial marketplace, anyway.   
The outcome of this situation, is that now that requested good have not been received and are (probably) being returned to sender - who could well end up having to pay additional costs, on top of initial postage, or goods are forever 'lost' in a huge warehouse, along with the Lost Ark.     .

			My sympathies are with Odile here, driving on or over the central line seems to have become a common problem everywhere, not sure why, although lack of attention due to 'distractions' such as mobile phones, GPS, music, etc. is quite possible. 
A few hundred metres from where I live there's a blind bend on a narrow road... it is wide enough for two cars but you do need to pay attention and keep to your side of the road.  
Three times in the fifteen years we've lived here there have been collisions serious for the cars involved to be forced to stop. Heavens only knows how many near misses there have been.  
My sons have learnt to keep as far to the right-hand side of the road as possible and (fortunately) drove classic Minis, which are tiny, narrow cars, as they've had several close shaves despite giving way as much as is humanly possible. If they'd met cars in the middle of the road and been driving a 'normal' car they'd have stood no chance.    
The men in my family are totally convinced that all new drivers (at least in the French-speaking part of the world) are taught to line the middle of their car up with the convienient white line some kind soul has painted down the middle of the road for that very purpose!

			Different viewpoint, Assuming that the pool did basic first aid and bandaged it, it is not life-threatening and could be sorted at the local doctor or 24 hour clinic and did not need 'emergency' treatment in the sense that it had to be fixed in the next two hours.   
Plenty of time to get the wallet, follow the paperwork and sort it out. The inability to produce Swiss ID (as insurance is compulsory in Switzerland) or some sort willingness to pay up-front, the hospital would consider them unlikely to pay...or deliberately trying to avoid paying.   
Did they actually remove the bandages and 'triage' the patient or were they headed off at the door by the 'admin' staff? When we go to the kids hospital for non-emergency, we go to the admin desk (admissions) but it's a different place to the triage for emergency...I wonder if they got assessed as non-urgent...and of course the patient could have stayed at the hospital waiting room whilst someone else went home to get the paperwork/bank card.   
Even if you had the paperwork, if the hospital is busy, you could be waiting several hours before getting treatment if it is simply not 'urgent'...   
Edited to add: triemli is a massively big and busy hospital. Sometimes the smaller hospitals are far less busy.

There was a suggestion some years ago, or maybe it is still around, to scrap the retirement age and replace it by a measure of the number of years worked (during which contribution was payed, so education doesn't count). If everybody needs to work (say) 40 years, somebody who starts at 16 will be able to retire at 56. A heavy construction worker who is in his late 50s will have a hard time finding a job if he gets laid off, whereas a university professor is still going to be a sought after expert when he's 10 years older than that. So I think it's a good idea seeing its unjust to ask all professions to retire at the same age.

They ""status matched"" my Swiss frequent flyer gold and gave me their version of Gold.  So now I get to use the priorty check-in, lounges, and even got some free upgrade vouchers.     
But I have never flown them, and have no idea if I ever need to.  But the gold status is valid across the whole Skyteam, so lets see...

			So to sum up this thread at the end of the page 1 stage:   
- OP is fed up of people crowding around the baggage belt at the airport   
- Some people think it is an exclusive phenomenon to Switzerland and the  
Swiss   
- Some people get uppity at anyone saying bad things about the Swiss   
- Some people think they might not be Swiss   
- Several posters point out the other airports in the world where similar phenomena occur   
- The rest of the world - me included - couldn't give a monkeys   
Is that about it?   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Just a quick note on the way things might more normally have gone.   
1. Post(s) reported by member(s) - lots of posts from a new member not really saying anything often means they're only here to flog something. We probably get 10-20 such reports every day. 
2. Mod takes a look, maybe once or twice per day sees a lot that are typical of this sort of thing, and deletes them with a short explanation. 
3. Occasionally, a genuine new member PMs the mod with a question about why they were deleted, explaining that they're not spammers at all, and were just trying to be helpful, friendly or both. 
4. Posts are reinstated with an apology and an explanation as to why we take such action. 
5. New member goes away happy, with a little more understanding of the way things are, all posts and reputation intact.  
6. Nobody else is involved in or even aware of the process; the original post reporter assumes we've looked into it and dealt with it appropriately.

			There probably isn't a lot the police can do - but I think you should still report it. It will go on their stats and hopefully would influence their strategy in where to have the heaviest patrol presence.   
If they are being thorough - and you can remember what the perps looked like, maybe they will have you go through a photo album of people known to them. A friend who had money stolen by distraction theft on the street was asked to do the same and she managed to pick out someone the cops had been keeping tabs on. I can't remember if it resulted in an arrest.

But I have to say the warning lights should have been going off when the money was asked to be transferred to a Romanian bank.   
Don't expect anything back, it's a cross-jurisdiction issue and the cost of investigating deeply into this case don't make sense. They will probably just report it to Romanian police.

I encountered the same problem before. You are using Safari, right? What worked for me was to quit Safari, and then open it again and then SBB worked.

Hope this helps.

You need to make sure that your Anwalt's costs stay within the cap permitted by the court. I guess that DCKI are would back down if you make a determined show of force.   
Have DCKI explicity acknowledged that you fulfilled your part of the deal in finding a child to take your daughter's place?   
Interesting that you signed the English version (the German version is irrelevant if you weren't shown it at the time). The English wording you posted only requires you to observe a cancellation   in order to get your deposit back. A period is merely a length of time, and is not the same as a  , because a Frist has the additional implication of a termination date. I have yet to meet a mother-tongue German speaker who can grasp this difference.   
So, quite apart from the fact that you found a replacement to take your daughter's place, it seems that you also fulfilled the literal requirements of the contract.

			See daffy99 above.    
This reminds me of another recent thread,  where the other OP repeatedly parked in somebody's parking lot,  eventually got her license plate stolen by the tenant, and some on here  insisted on reporting the tenant to the police - no reason to escalate  like that.   
With that said: 
Both coercion and extortion (  and  )  require threatening with ""seriously detrimental consequences"". I  completely fail to see how bad rep'ing on Ricardo would qualify. Use of the  office mail address may be OK, the government may allow that for  occasional personal use (or not, dunno) - however using it in a dispute  like this where she throws around legal mumbo jumbo certainly throws an odd light.   
Her being a policewoman  (or not) is completely irrelevant to your trade. If anything, as  mentioned by duffy99, that would constitute Amtsmissbrauch (abuse of  power of office?). Particularly, her trying to intimidate you by using  her (perceived) professional knowledge in conjunction with her police  email address.   
Subject to how you phrased your mail, I'd tend to  not apologize. I'd probably mention some of the above. But I definitely  would offer to start over, no reason for you to (like she did) go over  the top for some silly 10CHF item. Nonetheless I would try to get my  10CHF back. Once she realizes her over-reaction you have a fair chance.

Police work 24/7. The time it was sent appears to be meaningless.

Unfortunately having dreadful customer service and poor communication isn't a crime (in law, even if it's a crime against their customers), so the only thing the judge would look at is 19.90 CHF vs 85 CHF and their terms and conditions. Unless it's on a shelf in Migros with a bunch of other unwanted tat, 75% is a very high reduction; maybe if it was a real hard sell special offer, but it doesn't sound like it was.

Are non-registered letters (A or B Post) traceable these days?   
If not, you (your relative) can simply say she didn't receive the notice, but she wants to exercise her right now, thank you very much. If they send a Betreibung just dispute the claim (sign the forms back side at the Post office when you collect the registered letter), and that's it coz they won't be able to prove their claim (asssuming it's not traceable).

I too do not like the taste of Fresh Coriander.  Count myself lucky at least not allergic to it, like some people are with some foods and that have bad reactions, when something unexpected by a dish of food.   
Unfortunately Fresh Coriander is sometimes used as last minute garnish, not shown or mentioned on the menu. (the chef probably thinks he is doing something nice)   
by works canteen, I got used to asking what is that green stuff, as difficult to tell by sight what can be the green garnish chopped up with various dishes.   
But on the odd occasion by new restaurant, had forgotten to ask or say, I hate coriander and ended up with a dish of food almost impossible to eat, as just something by the taste Yukky.  Perhaps a slimming diet idea!   
I remember once going to a charity dinner event & every course had it sprinkled on.  think I got hold of some bread to eat.

I agree that taste is not objective. But then they need to be consistent about it. They do award points for some taste in *some* tests - such as their fairly frequent wine comparisons - but not in others.   
It's frustrating that they award points for taste in these tests (and for other criteria), yet neglect to do so in a host of other food/drink tests.

The crisis is in general practice, not specialities. The best and the brightest do not want to become GPs anymore - and those that do want to go into general practice don't much fancy the boondocks.    
A shame, because the GP needs to be the point person, he/she is only one in the chain who sees the patient as a whole person and not just a collection of discrete organs. We need our best and brightest in general medicine.

			Surely the more important and general question here is around insurance and returns.  With the likelihood of mail being opened on it's way into CH this must be almost a standard answer?   
Many sellers, insurers or couriers will only accept claims if the package is rejected as damaged without being opened/received or is returned in it's original packaging.    
So what happens when a legally entitled third party opens the package, touches it intimately and repackages it?  Hypothetically speaking.    
As a seller I might say tough poop, it was fine when it left me, deal with the third party who opened it. Same as a courier, it was fine when we gave it to customs/post, talk to them.  And as an insurer, we only insure from the point of sale until somebody opens it.   
Hopefully it works out well.

			You are going to quickly learn that to trust a company to do what their sales people promise is going to quickly lead to problems.  Hope you can fix the issues. But generally the companies your talking about are not that friendly.   Hope you can find that paper.  But since you are moving your number it will be done as 
their earliest convince and not yours.   By asking the number to be moved, thats is the the beginning. Sadly for you orange obliged and allowed the port to go through before the end of contract.   In hind sight you should have not asked UPC to move your number until you were clear of your contract.

			Just another word of advice, relevant to this discussion.  Never say yes on the phone when answering a call from someone you don't know. There are dodgy companies recording calls and then setting you up with different long-distance telecom, fly by night insurance, etc.  When consumers get billed and later sent to collection, they will say they have a recording of you agreeing to their services.     
Trust me, this happens all the time in DE and is happening more often in CH.  If it does happen, tell them to betreibung you...they won't.  We had to have Swisscom change our # due to one of these scams as they blocked our long-distance calling and even Swisscom couldn't fix the issue without changing our #.

			The Aer Lingus flight to Dublin arrives very late at night and you'd have to stay the night in Dublin anyway. Perhaps look at Swiss (LX) morning flights and then connect to the respective Aer Lingus transatlantic flight.   
Flying through Ireland can be advantageous as you clear both customs and immigration in Ireland. No queues on arrival, bags checked through and hopefully fewer issues making connecting flights. I know a few who've done it this way just for that reason.

It may help if posted at Greek Post Office, but best way I found was to put postcard inside an envelope from Greece.  Unfortunately local post boxes although they may pick up every day, they do not sort to the postal system, particularly postcards are put to one side on occasion, particularly towards end of summer season.

			Hello and thanks to everyone who answered my queries. Sorry I have not been on here for such a long time. Just to let you know that I did get my brother's urn returned by the undertaker actually going to that person's home and demanding it and threatening them with the police and he (the ashes) are now back here in UK. Also I did inherit my brother's house and the court handed me the keys and paperwork in February 2014 - so now the renovations start. My eldest son is leading this and he has already been fined when he did not stop at the border and declare a bathroom suite in the van!! There is a lot of work to be done and the local architect has drawn up the plans so we hope to get started this year so all the family can come to the house and enjoy it winter and summer. The house when I die will go to my two sons who have 4 sons between them - so the legacy will live on! My father's relatives in Norway and my mother's in Italy will visit too - so it should be exciting. Many thanks for everyone's replies. x  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Who governs funeral parlours?	Posts: 14

One shop assistant even seemed offended when I asked I they could order a larger size in!   
I get all my shoes back in the UK now, I know the shops that have my size and styles that I like.   
For formal shoes, Jones Bootmakers was always pretty good.  A previous poster mentioned Clarks, and they do have larger sizes, but I've never had a comfortable pair from there.  For truly comfortable walking shoes and hiking boots, I'd recommend   in Cambridge, I sometimes make the trip out especially.   
Added advantage is the pound is cheap and shops are cheaper anyway.

			IIRC BMW services are: 
Oil 
Service 1 
Oil 
Service 2 
(Repeat)   
They are based on driving and for your average person will be every 25,000km (or 2 years).   
An Oil service will include the oil being drained (not vacuumed), the sump plug replaced with a fresh washer, oil filter replaced and fresh oil added. That oil will be a high quality full synthetic oil. They will also replace the filters as per the schedule and also any other parts as per the schedule.   
On top of that they'll also give the car a good check underneath - looking for any wear on the joints, bushes etc etc.   
^^That can not be compared to a ""cheap"" oil change in the US/UK - where the oil is vacuumed out (dragging the particles from the sump back through the engine) and fresh mineral oil is added. That is OK for a OHV engine with low compression and 5,000km oil change intervals - but not for a modern car.

			Your best bet is to go to the shop with your receipts and their demands and for them to go through their records.   
Chances are they aren't tying up your payment on the other bed (not taken) to the bed you took.   
The fact you knew the bed was wrong, still built it and then used it without giving them the opportunity to correct the mistake would suggest you were happy with taking the original bed.

			Well, I've driven in Cyprus for years and then the Swiss motorways seem like heaven!    
However, Germany is still my favorite country to drive; people make far less sudden or dangerous moves on the roads (and if it happens, 9 out of 10 times it's a Dutch or French car). 
In Switzerland I'm always wary of people making moves that you wouldn't expect, like breaking when there is absolutely nothing in front of them, or suddenly changing lanes when you want to pass them. It doesn't happen constantly, but definitely more than in Germany in my opinion.

			Seeing as you have scored a job for the winter, I suggest concentrating on getting the Goethe Certificate of Deutsch (B1 level) or the easier Telc A2 certificate in your spare time. In fact I'd do the A2 as a warm-up in preparation for the B1 level.   
You can find some sample tests online and also get a book filled with practice papers.    
(I see no point substituting the English component of your high school diploma with German. This Goethe certificate is well-respected, it will look better than a pass from a German subject at a Canadian high school, it fills out your CV and it's useful for renewing your permit in the future. I can't see the high school in Canada allowing you swap it anyway. The English component is essential for admission into all further education!)         
Migros Klubschule hold preparation courses for the tests.   
Also while you are in the winter resort talk to people around the place, so you can hear about available jobs coming up.

			i've been trying to buy a guitar  for over 6 months now, the original ad was on tutti but it also turns up on gratisinserat and is currently on olx............   
always exactly the same text and no phone number.       
""seller"" seems to be either an english or american guy called mike from affolter am albis and despite several emails he has never given me his phone number and will not send me photos of the ""damaged"" parts of the guitar.       
i don't know whether it's some sort of bizarre scam or maybe he's just a weirdo. i've never had any suggestions to send money anywhere.   
the only mike with the same second name that he gives is listed in canton bern...........

When I said: ""If you indicate left then traffic knows you are continuing around"", that obviously refers to some mythical point in the future when drivers here would be required to drive like that and indicate what direction they are aiming at.    
I can't see it ever happening though because of the denial that exists about the need for other road users and pedestrians to understand what a driver on a roundabout is planning to do.

			You may think this is a luxury problem, because it is a pool, but in my experience, it could be anything. The trouble at the moment is that there is enough work to go around that very few companies seem to be in need of work.   
Tradespeople need to be closely watched. If you notice anything which is not as it was before, they will deny it. I now am in the habit of doing a walk through first to point out any damages before they start and one when they are done.   
When the work is not up to your expectations or standards, they shrug.  They have an excuse for everything.   
There are only a few tradepeople who have worked in my home who seem to take pride in their work and really care about customer satisfaction.

			Basically, as swisspea said.    
What's missing is:  
The addressee for your complaint by registered mail is management. They may be genuinely interested in your detailed  description, particularly including that nobody ever saw anybody show up  - what if there were an invoice without actual work done?   
The regularity indeed does make some kind of timer a possibility (including some external event causing a fuse to go off).   
Additionally, I'd mention on the letter that you expect the issue to be fixed  . Considering the time of year/temperatures  I'd give them until middle of next week if I sent the registered letter today - you'll probably need to accept one more cold day :/

			Hi   
how awful for you at this holiday time to be in bed with flu.  Yes if you can speak to the parents in the best way you can.  Maybe flatter how lovely their children are first.  I would explain that you work normally during the week, but now you have flu and if there is anyway they can try to stop the noise going into your bedroom it would be appreciated.   
this is always a difficult one and you sound reasonable.  I would suggest you are always charming and polite when you see them out and about & thank them for their efforts.   
Good luck and hope you and your neighbours will be friends going forward.

512	07.04.2010, 00:45	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 8 Times in 6 Posts	Location: Zurich	"      This description can be applied to many Swiss women and women in major cities around the world.  There is Nothing wrong with looking sexy if you can pull it off.  And in the work place, if management doesn't complain, who cares....      Oh YES they are....  When my wife, whom is an Estonian national, enlisted the help of a job placement agency here in Zurich last year, she was told that it was good that her last name didn't sound like she came from Eastern Europe.  And that she shouldn't put on her CV that she was from Estonia(Eastern Europe) because of the perception here of Eastern Europeans.  I see first hand how some of the neighbors in our Village here treat a family here, in which the wife and daughter are from Russia.  They've been living in this village for over 10 yrs and are referred to(by some) as that Russian woman.  I alway correct them and reply, ""no, I'm referring to.....insert name.""   
And what about the ""Respectable"" men that go to patronize this degrading industry.  These highly respectable men will go on holidays to these countries to exploit these women/children and then return home to their respectable family lives.    
But you don't hear or see the backlash against them for their part in supporting this dark industry.   My wife has told me how they've had, in Tallinn, problems with foreigners coming there thinking that they can treat all the women in the bars/clubs like prostitutes.     
Back to the OP: To hide your nationality/ethnicity to appease someone is a cop-out in my opinion.  Be proud of where you come from and who you are as a person.  You will never be able to please everyone, and if someone doesn't like you for whatever reason, **** on them!  Life is to short to worry about what others think.  Find new people to associate with, and if you are a good person, then they are the ones who are missing out on a beautiful friendship.

			It would be nice to know if a post office actually has the right to reject a parcel with a legible handwritten address. It seems to me that it used to be this the case before everywhere..

1) For a like for like purchase (IE 50k car) where you keep the car - a lease is more expensive than a purchase   
2) For a like for like purchase (IE 50k car) where depreciation is steeper than originally anticpated at purchase then leasing can effectively cost the same as purchase and provide added flexibility at the end of the lease   
There is the other option, which is focussed on monthly cost. Going back to our 50k car (again at 5.4%, 4 years, 30% residual and can do 7l/100km over 15k km per year) 
LEASE: 653chf + 166chf (savings) + 158chf (fuel) = 977chf per month    
If our monthly budget is 977chf to ""hire/buy + fuel"" a car, and assuming that the car will be older (less efficent 8l/100km) the numbers come out as: 
PURCHASE: 797chf (savings) + 180chf fuel = 977chf per month. This gives a budget of 38,400chf for the car.   
For someone who will change cars in line with the length of the lease and ""uses"" the car rather than considering it an asset, leasing can allow them to drive a newer or better or more efficient car.   
The car market in Switzerland is relatively illiquid and this means that transfering this risk can really be worthwhile

			For a holiday costing around 1600 chf the agent slapped on a charge of 60 chf without any warning. I was wondering if this is legal. I mean they could have added 100 chf or whatever they want as far as I can work out.          
It was like this. I went on a cruise ship web site and there was a trip we wanted to make and it was ""wait list"" so we filled in the form and clicked though and it and then a travel agent contacted me. We got the booking then on the bill was an additional 60 CHF booking fee, without and previous information about it, I back checked.          
Is this sort of thing legal here? Can I cancel now. I've paid nothing upfront yet?

			Outsider/insider. Expat/local. I think the lines are far more blurry than that - and criticism can sting if you feel it's aimed at you, no matter where it comes from.   
I feel like an outsider here, and after 12 yrs in CH, I'm an outsider back in the UK. I'd love to be able to say that I've gained worthwhile cultural insights that enrich my existence - and maybe I have - but most of the time I just feel tired out, unable to hit my stride due to frequently mis-stepping. I speak the language(s), have local friends, but still read 'that' thread with much interest.   
Some people are sure to find this 'in-between' feeling invigorating/character-forming, which is great. I just miss feeling at home. If I have learnt anything, it is that I probably need to sort that feeling out, rather than try to move away from it. I have a feeling that 'home' is what comes from within.

			Dont take any guff from lazy gardening swine. If this ever happens to anyone, find out who they are, take photos and complain to the Gemeinde/police. A lot of the gardeners are shoe string budget operations. The gardeners dont use proper equipment and are not always mindfull of others safety.   
A next door neighbour had a big pine tree cut down some years ago and the tree lopper was allowing the logs, each one weighing about 20kgs to fall onto our property. I went ballistic, phoned the police and they were paid a visit by the geminde and the police.

			This is a rare happy ending. I got my promised Viseca Credit Card flying blue miles, they just take a while because they want to see that you pay the CC bills.   
Air France also honored the necessity purchases and refunded me everything I needed to buy due to the delayed luggage about 700.-Sfr . The luggage was brought home three days later.    
They are also going to refund for all the extra incurring costs I had due to the cancelled flight caused by the September strike. Actually I'm getting more money refunded than payed for the flight ticket which is awesome, though I don't wish anyone the stress of your flight back cancelled due to strike without knowing when you can make it back.

But what about the artistic side of the director or screenwriter? They've sat long and hard to come up with an imaginative film title only for it to be bastardised during translation.   
I'd like to imagine that if I was a director and was all miked up with the translators whilst promoting my film on ""Wetten Dass..?"" that I'd throw an almighty luvvie fit live on stage. All because they renamed Cinderella Man, ""Das Comeback"".

I did briefly consider answering no, as I have never had any major treatment, but that would have been an open invitation to them to dig deeper (especially considering that I am no longer a 20-year-old), and at the end of the day would have been untruthful... and you definitely don't want to be giving insurance companies the opportunity to latch onto half-truths.

In fact, you can open the package and use it, gift it forward, or throw it away (selling the contents forward may be a bad idea, not sure). An exception to this: If you may have received it due to an honest mistake, e.g. if you're John Doe and the package is addressed to Johnny Doe.   
However, since we're on an eglish speaking forum, you may have inadvertantly accepted to be sent the package on the phone, and thus sealed a contract. Unless you're sure you didn't it might be a good idea do send them a letter (""Eingeschrieben"", Registered Mail, keep the receipt) and ask why they're sending you this, and tell them to provide any proof they may have that actually a contract has been agreed upon (note: recording a phone call is illegal unless you've been told that it will be recorded).   
From the relevant law, Obligationenrecht §6a 
Art. 6a2 
1 Die Zusendung einer unbestellten Sache ist kein Antrag. 
2 Der Empfänger ist nicht verpflichtet, die Sache zurückzusenden oder 
aufzubewahren. 
3 Ist eine unbestellte Sache offensichtlich irrtümlich zugesandt worden, 
so muss der Empfänger den Absender benachrichtigen.    
Art. 6a2 
1 The sending of goods does not constitute an application [meaning this isn't grounds for a contract, the counterpart to an offer by the seller] 
2 The recipient is not obliged to return said goods, or to store them. 
3 If the unordered goods have been sent due to an obvious(apparent?) mistake, then the recipient has to inform the sender.

			Helena Paris   
You say of the contract that you were in a hurry and accepted it... and you evidently didn't fully understanding what it meant.   
So I can understand that you now feel amazed that the bill is much higher than you had anticipated.  However, I agree with other posters here, that Fr.1000 sounds fairly standard for the service you purchased.   
I hope that, in future, you go through every further contract (of any kind) before you sign anything.  And you can do this together with the service provider, reading each paragraph and confirming with each other what you each understand it to mean. 
A good, solid, honest contract partner will most likely be content to check each section with you, since he/she will want clarity, too, so that the agreement can work smoothly for you both.

			Hi everyone,   
I used tax filing service of this not so wonderful team called ""Feduciair LEGISTA"" in Lausanne in spring of 2013. They did not do a good job and I had to go back and help them with the dividends I have from a US broker. Still local tax office found errors in the filing. Anyhow this all was fairly charged and paid for and I decided never go back to them again. 
They sent me a few ""please we want to do your taxes again"" letters which I just ignored as marketing. Big mistake on my part... 
Now I've got a bill for 110CHF plus VAT on 6 things: Yes, there are 5 items, but they call for 6 ...   
I called them up. The guy passionately explained me that this all very important and additional services. That I will be off the hook if I just pay. And I'm not in big supply of free time to fight back for this.   
So, I'm trying to share my lesson and hope nobody will step in this pit again. 
P.S. My friend is billed for very large some as he continued tax filing with them this year...

Naturally it takes a few years, and a certain amount of enthusiasm, to learn any language to the level required for voluntarily sitting through lectures in it, but still: language is most probably not a barrier to the sort of people who would otherwise be interested in attending.

I thought they'd finally ironed out their IT issues.  Apparently not.   
I was overcharged for 4 months in a row, despite a stream of complaining and nagging them.  The staff themselves seemed completely clueless and rude.  Forget any possibility of compensation or (gasp) an apology.   
Oh, and I cancelled my Direct Debit with them, and   them that I refused to be charged ""random numbers"" each month, yet they continued to send me bills, with no manual payment method, as apparently, I was still paying via Direct Debit.  Sigh.

			I have used Deindeal to buy vouchers for online stores wich is hard for them to screw up, but i would NOT reccomend buying physical products from them.   
I ordered a Lamp, and got emails 2 times that it was delayed. Around 3 months after placing my order, i got an email that they cant deliver at all and refunded the money.   
I ordered a gymbag, that also got delayed and 2 month after ordering i get an email they cant deliver the color i wanted but offered a much uglier one or a refund.   
My guess is that they have to reach a number of purchases in order to get the good price from the supplier, if they dont they will re-negotiate (dealyed) and ultimately cancel.

Isn't it a shame that a square situated right next to the Museum should have become a place of depradation?

Does the guy who suggested Dublin to you think he could get you a resident permit for Dublin?         I have to agree with this in a way. When ""they"" want someone they get them. However, they will go about it backwards. They will make the job description fit the exact person they want to hire. So, let's say the OP worked in Kiribati for a summer, they will put ""experience working in Kiribati"" in the job description. (Ok, that might be a slight exaggeration.) But that is how the game is played.

Biggest mistake - you are right. You can't just handover the key and a form ( that only states that a person is keen on renting to the agency) and leave. The agency requires atleast 3 potential renters and then they choose. You basically put the apartment at risk by giving the keys without a formal contract to a person about whom you did not know much apart from the fact that she was nice and left.   
I won't do this back home, forget switzerland. We all make mistakes and yours proved really expensive. I guess the landlord is very upset with this and is doing everything in his power to hold you responsible. In our experience MV has been very helpful.

			I don't know why people go through the grief of getting the apartment cleaned themselves/by a 3rd party. 
Makes more sense to use the landlords cleaning company if you want control over the bill, or just wait for the bill from the landlord afterwards.   
Coming back to your 11.5 hours though.   
I thought a quote should be the price you pay, whereas an estimate can run over?

You don't have to write this in an email. You have to write it onto the actual form ""Zahlungsbefehl"" (if you get one). Just write ""Rechtsvorschlag"" - usually at the bottom where you have to sign the form.     
edit: as information for people living in the French speaking parts of CH: a Zahlungsbefehl (payment summons) is called ""commandement de payer"" and instead of Rechtsvorschlag you write ""opposition"" onto the form.

It usually would be, but of course I only realize this at the end of the summer

			We had a similar situation here. There must be an official notice next to the car park, stating it is private land and only for visitors (Which you were) and the notice refers to a judgement, and the amount of a fine. If this doesn't exist then forget your payment demands.    
I suspect these accusations are not from the police, go and ask the police if they have sent them!

I purchased a cover with a pop-out backlight for a Sony E-reader last year (as a gift), but the recipient of the gift could not get the backlight to work (neither could we). So, I took it back to Brack and that they sent off for repair as they had no more in stock. A couple of days later, I had to write them an Email sheepishly stating that we had actually bought it from Digitec.   No worries, they said,  it's with the supplier now. A week or so later the repaired item was sent back to us by A-Post (it works now) and with NO CHARGE!

			I agree with Odile.  There`s lots going on, but you have to scour the newspapers to find them.   
End of summer, and during Herbst there are endless festivals of various kinds, markets to go browse  - before the big shut-down for Winter (after Christmas) and then it all begins again with Springtime.   
So, not a festival goer? ...... then that idea of MusicChick`s,  of chummying up to your local farmer and doing noisy work in his barn could be an idea? 
Save the noisy installation work at home for other times? ...... Saturdays, evenings until 10pm.   
Think like a Swiss and programme your noisy work for when you can (allowed to) do it      
Other stuff, that is work but makes no noise, like gardening ..... my son enjoys working in his garden on Sundays, and nosy neighbor made the remark ""Ah so ... you a working on Sunday?""

			I wonder if you have finally received your 300chf deposit?   
I am experiencing the same with my 300chf deposit. I paid the deposit as I was a L permit holder and now we have a B permit so we are supposed to get our deposit back. I have sent in the refund application form in Jan and still haven't heard of anything after a couple of months. Going into the store was useless as the staff told me there was nothing they can do. I have had emails back and forth with the customer service, they told me why it has taken so long as because my deposit was never being registered in their system (what????). And they are processing it now but it has been 8 months already and still waiting.    
My husband's case is worse, he has paid 1000chf for deposit as he wanted to have roaming. Back and forth email exchanges for a couple of months and now they are finally telling us that his was a pre-payment instead of deposit so they are not able to refund the amount back to us. We are completely frustrated, any suggestions?

			As a Publican here in the CH... here's some help.     
Firstly, most Kantons have strong drinking and licence laws! Most have a curfew of Midnight thirty for outsiders with drinks in hand and on the table (which means you can't do much about smokers yabbering late at night, but they're NOT allowed drinks outside after 00.30!)     
Just up till two o-clock (?) sounds strange to me. Late licences (after 00.30) continue on till 4.00am. Check with the local council if the Bar/Restaurant has a late licence. If not, phone police after the drinking up time. They'll get the picture very quick, as each violation becomes more and more expensive with the loss of licences in the end.     
Bars have to pay an expensive premium to stay open longer, so if someone is selling 'after time' it's not fair on the ones who pay and stay legal. Do the sods!     
To sum up... check with the council about the drinking up and no drinks outside times, and then check about his late licence, or lack of.     
If they're breaking the rules, it wont take very long to put a stop to them.     
Good Luck     
GREG

			not to attend is not the answer! 
You just exclude yourself and even worse they could think you are bitchy...   
I am native Swiss, my wife is Russian. So the ""Amt for Migration"" suggested that we should speak Standard German to each other, not Swiss Dialect, not English. For me: it would be reason for a divorce. Honestly!   
You have to understand that we Swiss have mentally by birth a handicap with the German language. It makes us feel bad, my tongue starts to hurt, the gum swallows, spit productions increases to an uncomfortable level. 
We call it a ""neck disease"". Yes, we can speak Standard German, but we get goose bumps doing so. This is not against you, its our nature!   
I even can speak German without Swiss federal accent, but I shiver doing so.   
...and throughly: if I go to your home country, who should adapt?  
Language is training and getting ""an ear"" for it. Just patience and heads up!

Regarding your myOne card: According to the terms and conditions, there are two payment options: (1) Full payment each month or (2) partial payment (10% or at least 50 CHF each month, 15% interest on the remaining amount).   
I have no idea why they mentioned a minimum payment of 0 CHF but I would simply switch to another credit card …I had a similar issue with the Coop credit card (from Swisscard AECS). I rarely used it, however, I did not receive a monthly invoice once (or maybe missed it, who knows, their invoices look like mail spam, probably by intention!) and a month later, I received a invoice for the amount I had gone shopping plus interest. OK, I paid that … the next month, in spite of my full payment of the invoiced amount, I got another invoice with interest (and interest only). Since I have no lack of available credit cards, I simply cancelled it …I am happy with my Migros (Cembra Money Bank, domestic use for payment only) and PostFinance credit cards (fair conditions for use abroad and in foreign currencies).

			Well, I have read quite of few of these threads relating to police searches, unfair assumptions, etc. and I think there are a few things that come to mind when I read the responses.  I have only been on the forum for two months so I realize that I don't have the perspective of those who have been active here for years.  This response is more about the topic of authority in general than a specific response to this particular search. 
     It seems that quite a few people are not interested in debating these issues, but rather want to end the possibility of a balanced discussion as quickly as possible.  Perhaps this is because it has been discussed so many times, perhaps people feel strongly that authorities should be able to use their powers how they see fit.  I find the topic pretty fascinating and don't see exactly why people seem so sensitive about this as a discussion.  To me, a free society or a free forum should not shy away from such discussions and it is definitely possible for authority figures to behave improperly--even in the most civilized, ordered societies.  I mean, I am an American, and have seen authority misused in my country time and time again from authorities ranging from law enforcement, teachers, government officials, etc.  I fully realize that these same authority figures have also saved many lives, locked up dangerous people, and helped many people .  But, I know that if their mistakes are not brought up and exposed to society, they are unlikely to improve and more likely to abuse their powers.   
   From what the original poster wrote, it is difficult to know exactly how the encounter with the police went down.  But, I think most police are good at asking questions and figuring out who is lying--so I think that is the first step they should take in such an encounter.  I think searching may be within their rights, but shouldn't be used unless they still believe it to be necessary after questioning exposes doubts in their mind.  If the police believe they or the public are in immediate danger, than they can act more forcefully or quickly.

But, I am just looking for the part that made you so upset with the service before I make any comments positive or negative.

			of course it is more expensive than at home; and if you don't care for cats you would think it is a waste. But the charged sum is not exaggerated considering the wages here. By the way, a vet in Belgium is also more expensive than a normal doctor.

Someone extracted his wallet from his backpack at an outdoor bar, stole a credit card, and returned the wallet with the remainder of the contents intact. He only discovered the loss a few days later, and there were charges on the card from that same night at a gas station on the other side of town, and then some high end shopping in Bern.   
We were quite fortunate, as we were able to cancel the card quickly and were not held responsible for the purchases. It was a U.S. credit card, so it was not chip or pin-protected.

			So, your child had motion restrained for hours, was underfed, called names and you were harassed by them at work. I'm glad you withdrew your baby from there. Write an official report, signed by both parents, send to the centre for childcare in your commune. They need this information, just state the facts.

That's not what you do with a child who has fractured her leg when skiing. You don't let them lying down screaming, without assistance. You check for what is wrong with them. You don't wait on them to ""pick themselves up"", while she cries...this really calls for having that person sacked. So, a child with fractured leg was was expected to pull herself up? And made to ski down the hill? That child was already hurt, could have hurt herself even more, what if the fracture was open, or she was bleeding internally. It gives me shivers. You need to keep the health report copies, and I would seriously work on contacting some bureau that licenses skiing schools. It was unacceptable, don't talk to them anymore, but deal with a lawyer. If there is a cantonal institution that deals with safety, kids and health issues, I am sure your lawyer will tell you. I am sorry for getting worked up, but I would in no way ask for an apology, I would want an official explanation and that person not training kids anymore.

			This week I had contact with both microspot and digitec   
Regarding microspot.ch, I ordered a BRITA filter pack on Monday and found them yesterday in my mailbox. Microspot send me an email, that ""the package has left the building  "", gave me a package number - I would rate them 5/5.   
The other one - digitec.ch - on the same day(Monday), in fact, 5 minutes after the BRITA filters, I ordered a laptop from digitec and got ""the package has left the building"" today. So it took the microspot less to deliver, than it took digitec to process my order!   
I ordered more items in a bundle and paid immediately for all of them All of this has happened Monday evening.    
Microspot is one of the largest and cheapest online stores. At the moment the send everything for free. On the other side, customers are more likely to share negative rather than positive stories. I guess for every problem, that you describe here, there were probably 100+ deliveries, where everything went fine, which gives them a satisfaction rate of 99%+

			I don't think a very large percentage would describe the Swiss as rude, pushy, etc, quite the opposite. They may keep a distance, but are actually very polite, even if that comes across as A4 polite. And how many expats come across deaf and dumb because they can't remember the name of the person who just answered the phone, to say Danke/Merci/Grazia Frau/Herr in all those same language variations.   
Bars can be crowded, but that isn't the same kind of pushing (I know you know that, but the OP does come across a bit desperate ) How many people actually meet their real friends in a bar or nightclub?? - quick fling maybe, but once the buzz wears off, the lights go up, and the music stops, it was probably just an expensive night out.

			Dear All, 
Thank you very much for all your comments and input.I really appreciate the inputs and advice. Fortunately I did not have any serious injury and there were no signs of injury. 
The talk we needed to have was on them disturbing us every now and then on baseless noise complaints they have agaisnt us. Their claims have been also dismissed by the immobilien agency many times. On the night when she came to complain about the noise we were just two people eating dinner at 10:15 pm, she said that we were dragging chairs around which is anyway false. Thats the reason we went to her to tell her to stop disturbing us at night. In between that argument her partner came and physically assaulted me. 
We did go to the police today and filed a complaint today but as one of you have said the police did say its their word against ours. However I would want to document this incident and keep records of it at an official agency. I am not sure what is going to happen next but I just want to ensure that me and my family stays safe. We have also informed the immobilien agency and have strictly told them to take an action as well. The long term plan is to move out because this person is certainly mentally unstable and I am not sure if there would be any serious action against him.

The US supported condemnation of the eritrean practice because it funds destabilization in other countries with the money.

We had an issue with an SBB ticket sold to us for the Glacier Express.  That travel was all in Switzerland, which was a plus as we only ever dealt with SBB.     
The ticket sold to us was only valid on certain days of the week, but the counter representative sold us that ticket, plus a seat reservation on a day the ticket wasn't valid for.       
We did not realize the issue until we were on the train and the ticket checker came.  On the train, we had to pay full price for a valid ticket, but I kept copies of everything and later filed for a refund of the original ticket with SBB.     
One hard part is that I had to plead my case at a ticket counter and in writing, and it was sent to their office, where a refund amount was decided and issued back to me without any consultation again with me.     
It ended up working out, but it was a little frustrating to have so much be out of my hands without being able to talk to someone who had the authority to issue the refund.   
So, if they do advise you to use the work around--I'd document and keep copies of everything in case some issue arises and you need to fight it; as you will need to have that information.

			Hello everyone,     
I undoubtedly understand your situation; however, after an indept research we have found a very nice apartment in Bulle and very conveniently priced.   
However, I would like to inform you about several RIP-OFF companies in and around Bulle city. There are various companies such as Poya Hotel and other which charge around 3500CHFto 4500CHF for an apartment, promising a first class service and cleaning; however, the cleaning is miserable (barely existing - a bit making the bed and sometimes the floor a bit, the rest is untouched) However, please compare this tremendeous amount first with some local agencies, its more than double of the normal apartment prices in switzerland, I mean Bulle is certainly not a pricey/ big city; therefore, the prices are unreasonable. Also, we had several issues about services not provided or insufficiently provided; however, the only thing u receive are excuses.   
Luckly, I already graduated, but after hearing several feedbacks from still studying friends and family, I see myself commited to give u those information as a past student and devoted leader. Stay away of these agencies, which are just taking advantages of students in a hurry, you better stay on-campus; at least, the money somehow comes back to the students life and program. Contact Gruyere Immo, the always appeared as very helpful and provided great guidance, also they have apartments in their database, which are thought for students, also check on facebook about the apartment glion group, where graduation students hand over their apartments to next students.   
Just avoid the rip off agencies; you will be super dissatisfied after staying with them.   
I hope u ll have success in finding an apartment,   
Chuck

			I am frequently finding letters and smaller packages in my letter boxes that are addressed to my neighbours.   
I then drop them into the correct mailbox at the earliest opportunity.   
But I don't know whether all my neighbours are returning the favour. There have been a number of items that were never delivered to me, and nothing I could do about it.   
I would have thought the post office is liable if they drop something into the wrong mailbox but apparently it isn't so. When I complained to the manager all he said was ""that never happens. we always put stuff into the right mailbox"". So I must have imagined it. Great attitude.

			Did you pay by credit card? Just inform your card issuer that you have not received the goods and ask them to cancel the (financial) transaction.  Technically, it's called ""disputing a charge"". Don't pay the invoiced amount when you receive your credit card statement. If you have paid already, still dispute the charge -- you will ultimately be refunded.

I should cost you about 35.- to 50.- (depending on a bank) and you'll have the printouts in your hands about a week later.       Yes, unfortunately it can. This year tax authorities sent a letter to a friend of mine, saying that they've noticed he hasn't paid his tax in full in 2010... Needless to say, he had to pay the outstanding amount.        Don't take it personally. Very often it's the electronic claims system that words things this way, so there isn't a 'human touch' in there at all. I once had an accident and received a letter from my employer referring to it as a ""claim no 123"" and what should be done. There was no word of ""we are sorry you suffered a major injury and would like to help you."" I had a chuckle!       Here's where asking nicely might play in your favor. Don't write any emotional letters back. Instead go and have a chat with the front desk staff or a manager, if possible, and try to sort things out nicely. It might be that their acc dept made a mistake, so it's def worth asking!    
Best of luck!!!

For all those who apparently didn't read to the end, the points she was actually making by the end of it are:   
1) Cultural differences exist, but they don't explain everything. Some people are just grumpy or cheery and that has nothing to do with culture.  
2) Your willingness to generalize about ""the ____"" is usually a projection of your own attitude.

			We get an F13 fault on our Miele dishwasher occasionally but it's got nothing to do with the machine - it's the mains water pressure.   
Due to a stupid pipe layout by the plumbers, the kitchen sink (and hence dishwasher) is the last outlet on the cold water so pressure is lowest there and if other taps are running, especially the kitchen sink one, the dishwasher starts beeping.

			I have to ask the obvious question....   
What the heck is she washing all day for 10 days a month.... PLUS sessions on most of the other days??   
Surely she is running some sort of laundry business there? This must be against the rules.   
As for rotas etc, I don't think most people like to be told that they have a regular day / slot but surely it makes sense to do what we have in my block i.e. a blank calendar on the wall outside the washroom where we can book time in advance?   
Why would this not be a good idea? As it happens, about 80% of the time I can do washing as and when I need to without booking but it must make sense to be able to reserve a slot if you know you have limited opportunities for washing.

			There are many monoparental households or sole providers that have to ""dump"" their kids into a lot of child care if they need to provide, no choice there. More equal salary or a system providing fewer glass ceilings would definitely result in fewer childcare hours necessary, more quality time. Things are changing here but very slowly. Young generation possibly desiring more equality does not mean at all they actually can have it yet these days.

			After quite a few minor catastrophes I probably use the necessary technique to keep even Züri sacks in one piece.  
Softer, 'padding' rubbish goes round the edges, I ease the bag out of the container gently and afterwards push the contents down firmly but giving time for the air to come out too. I always hold them underneath when taking them out to the large container. 
I was probably one of the ones who made the town council here complain bitterly, when the bags were first introduced, that 'housewives were putting too much rubbish in the bags'!?!   
Not even an expert can get more than 35 litres into a 35 litre bag, but I don't pay to have 'air' disposed of so I make sure I only put it out to be collected when it is full.

			Thanks.   
Have you had any similar experience where this has worked??   
To be honest, I am avoiding the shop like the plague (hence the email) as I already had a run in with them before over this jacket. The poor customer service meant the woman advised me to buy the jacket one size larger so I could ""fit more clothes underneath"". She didn't bother to look at me wearing the two different sizes. Unfortunately, I didn't realise I looked like I was wearing a potato sack until I saw a photo of me in the jacket. I tried to exchange it saying I'd only worn it once but they refused and basically told me to get lost (not in that many words, of course).   
Now if I could get them to agree to exchange it due to the faulty toggles, I don't really want to exchange it for another of the same size! But what would it look like if I asked for another size? That I deliberately damaged all 4 toggles so I could exchange it?! And they don't even seem to sell that jacket anymore, since it was from their winter collection. Ugh! (Yes, I know, I know, first world problems...)

			I've dealt with them before and the impression I got is that even if they're not shady per se, they don't have their shit together to an intentional degree. Enough for me to avoid them in the future, even when they do have the lowest price. The 50% cancellation fee appears to be just as desired an outcome for them as a successful order. In my experience one order went smoothly, but another took forever and I was lied to repeatedly. They want your money as quickly as possible whether shipment in the near future is a realistic possibility or not.   
They have a 0900 paid customer service number, which is ridiculous in itself but, as you say, it's always busy. They were unresponsive to my e-mails until things got heated, then they magically were able to respond very quickly.   
What was the availability of the items when you ordered them? If ""in stock"" can you prove this in your order history? If they were listed as in stock, IMO you wouldn't be out of line filing a fraud report. Threaten them by e-mail first and give them a delay of 24hrs to give you a refund voluntarily.

			Ducko, I'm so very sorry to hear about your dog.    
While the trainer was within her rights if she listed a cancellation policy in your contract, or if she had posted her cancellation policy in her AGBs and you had checked a box saying that you agreed to those...   
... can I just say that I am shocked.    
My trainer, too, has cancellation a policy - as do the sports club, my dogsitter, and my various vet practices - any dog-related service I use.    
And none would ever even   of charging me if I cancelled an appointment in such circumstances.    
(And yes, I've had to cancel appointments for health care emergencies many times, and even cancelled whole contracts when members of the Muttley Crew died.)   
Boggles the mind - Surely a bit of humanity is called for at such a sad - and clearly exceptional - time. Moreover, treating a bereaved customer this way would make me think that this trainer is not the kind of person I would want around my dog.    
I hope that, when your heart has had time to heal, another four-footed friend one day finds his/her way to you. And when that happens - find another trainer.  I can assure you - what you experienced is not what I would expect from a fellow dog lover.   
Again, I am sorry for your loss.     
ETA:   
RE: The financial side:   
Dog training is about building a relationship with the owner - it's a business dependent on repeat customers.  The death of a dog - the whole reason the business relationship exists - is not the same as a 'simple' missed appointment. All the dog service providers I use understand this - which is the reason I'm happy to spend most of my disposable income, year after year after year, with them. IMO, the OP's trainer was being 'penny wise and pound foolish' in this case...

			I don't know about UPS or USPS, but DHL has bad conditions for one time customers: Last year I ordered shirts worth 84$ in an American online store. DHL charged me:   
- ca. 8 Fr. VAT/MWSt, as I expected 
- 17 Fr. administrative fee 
- 8 Fr. Vorlagenprovision (interest for their generousity to advance the VAT to the customs)       
Their advise for frequent importers is to open a ZAZ-Konto (""Zentralisiertes Abrechnungsverfahren der Zollverwaltung""), DHL won't charge you this 25 Fr. if you have one.   
There is nothing for you to get back because web shops from the US don't include VAT in their prices.

			Good news! Last night I emailed my social worker expressing my concerns. I then sent her a second email as I'd found an ad for furnished studios available for short term lets on anibis.  
When I'd had no reply by 2:45 this afternoon I went into the offices determined not to leave until something was sorted out. She saw me straight away and explained her boss had said the hotel was too expensive and that she hadn't been able to get hold of the person who'd posted the studio ad. She tried again while I was there, surprise surprise she got straight through and so I have a place to stay from Monday. I can camp on my parents' sofabed over the weekend so everything has worked out fine. So relieved.

			Glad you're feeling better.  Had salmonella nastiness a few years ago so I feel your pain  .   
It might be a good idea to report it, purely from the fact if it is that particular kebab shop and there were other cases also reported around the same time, it will help to pinpoint the source.   
Although, having said that, I didn't report my food poisoning at the time purely for the reason I couldn't concentrate on anything apart from the sick bucket and the crippling cramps as well as the overwhelming feeling I was going to slip off the mortal coil, so maybe other suffers (if there are any) won't bother.

It wasn't like how we do it in the hotel. We go through product fairly carefully, checking dates and inspecting products, and things are only thrown away when they are bad. I mean that is a loss of profit to have to come down to the last straw, and dump it. So when I watched them, not looking at all at dates, and hard at the vegetables, it was like someone told them to remove 10% of each section minimum, as part of a normal regime.     
Which it might be possible these people want to go home at a certain time, and just sweep all that is in their way, to meet their hourly time schedule. I have seen cooks do this as well at times(they normally get a warning though or fired after a couple of times). There seemed to be no oversight about the way they tossed items.

Now new contractors convert offers received into their home currency at the current rate (as someone already posted) & think the Swiss offer is good - but as the OP now understands it is the buying power of the offer that is important - not it's equivalent value in home currency.

			Thank you for all the comments here on this thread especially concerning the Arbeitszeugnis. It is really reassuring to know that the employer is obliged to give a positive reference. I am in a situation where my ex employer very reluctantly gave me a Zwischenzeugnis which was not all that positive. Even for this I had to exchange several e-mails. My ex boss refused to give anything fair or decent and finally I just politely indicated to  my him that he should give me whatever he thinks fit and I would then decide what to do with it.   
In the mean time, I consulted the lawyer at DER KAUFMÄNNISCHE VERBAND ZÜRICH ( ) and based on the advise I received I wrote to my ex boss (registered letter) asking him again politely for the final reference letter. The lawyer had drafted the reference letter as it should have been and asked me send it along with my letter, which I did.   
It has been a few months since but my ex boss has not even acknowledged it. The lawyer says that the next step is to give him a notice for a mediation session at the Gemeinde where the office is. If this session is unsuccessful, the next step is to take him to court.   
Has anyone gone through this process? How does this work.   
I am very concerned about the expenses and hence this question.

In my experience, the cashiers are very patient and friendly here - in Germany you get scowled at - by them and the customers behind!          Bring your own bags and tell them they can load them up.  Of course, it helps there, too, if things are well organized on the belt...      I find it the opposite - at Aldi and Lidl much more pressure to be done fast.  I think it is the way the discounters work and they are supposed to process customers as wuickly as possible so they can get back to stocking shelves and the company saves on personnel costs.  But the one here are still friendlier compared to the ones at the same stores in Germany!

I think I'd be uncomfortable too if I sat on my balcony and someone started taking photos of me - though I'd have to concede they were't doing anything illegal (just antisocial).   
Are they doing it regularly? (You make it sound like they are)  I can accept someone taking an occasional photo - a sort of ""this is where I live and this is my view"" thing, but how often do you need to photograph a bog standard garden.

In any society there is a section of people who will complain about something 'just because they can' and not because it necessarily has any impact or bearing on them (or anybody else).  It seems that this tendancy is particularly rife in Zuerich society.   
  I say that, because outside of Zuerich things seem considerably more relaxed.  Swiss people from other parts of Switzerland always tell me that 'Zuerich doesn't represent the real Switzerland' when I tell them that I live there.   
   It's just a pity that people feel the need to pick at others for the sake of doing so,  I guess it makes their lives feel somehow better.  I wouldn't let it get you down.  If that's the law in your Gemeinde you'll either have to work on getting it changed, just accept it, or move to another Gemeinde.  Just let your sad old neighbour stew in his own miserable misanthropic existence.  Your best bet is to be as cheerful (and patronising) towards him as you can possibly be.  That'll really wind them up.

Setting the focus to 5.14m at f5.6 will give from 3.01m to 17.55m in focus, probably a great shot . If you want all pin sharp f8 will give you 2.6m to infinity sharp with the focus to 5.25m perhaps you should turn your camera to Manuel & see what happens    
No need for f16 to achieve your shot as in your example the person is in frame head to tow, the background will always be recognisable but soft rather than  completely out of focus.

			I too have not had any issues with Digitec, however the Warranty is usually with the supplier.   
i.e. last year I had a fault with a digital camera.  I returned this to Digitec, they then informed me that it would have to be sent back to the Manufacturer.  I then received a new camera a few weeks later (the latest version as my version was replaced :-).   
Some companies give longer than standard warranties on some goods, i.e. 2 years on TV's from Hawk, Manor etc.. (I know this as a friend was recently looking to buy a new TV).   
Other places allow you to buy extra/extended warranty.

As you seem to be acknowledging yourself, there are degrees of aggression, so isn't the answer that you describe each aggressive encounter how it was, expressing the level of aggression (same as you would the level of violation)?   
Perhaps the words are shocking because most descriptive words inherently are within this context. A lady has suffered a repeated unprovoked assault.

			my 2 cents..   
I highly doubt whether you will get the money back for your 2nd trip as you already used the service, the best in this scenario is that you at least get your money back for the 1st trip that you paid for..   
If you are really serious about pursuing this, you should start your communications in writing. From what is written by and you and looking at their website, its clear that you are dealing with a bunch of con-men.   
If you can somehow get them to acknowledge in writing that they owe you the money, then you can possibly activate the debt collection route (betreibungsamt)

Thankfully with the cooler weather coming, at least you can shut the windows without being overheated, this should help with the noise as well.

It contained a couple of credit cards, easily cancelled, but also my passport and C permit. So I went and did the police report and started the process of getting replacements, but in fact the originals, with an inner part of the wallet, were all returned within a couple of weeks. Seems like the thieves had a conscience and had just put them into a post box, knowing that the ID docs would be able to trace me.   
Hope you get as good (or as not-as-bad-as-it-might-have-been) an outcome.

The sole idea of ""standard"" in building is so alien on continental Europe that there is no point even using that word.    
However, I do have a huge inbuilt wardrobe in Basel and like it a lot.

You have every right to defend yourself or your dog from a dog attack, and if that involves beating another dog to prevent yours form serious injury, then as far as Im concerned beat the other dog half to death if you have to. If the owner then decided to beat you (like Niamhe daydreams of) then the police will have a field day with them, and they will be looking at criminal charges.

			I agree that the flies are a real pest in CH. I think it's got a lot to do with the fact that the farmers seem to spray some kind of stinking cow/pig mulch all over the place before it rains (which almost means daily during summer). As I live in the sticks (couldn't afford anything in the city if you could call Zug a city) it's all the worse as the farmers are my neighbours.   
Worse still, each time I get on my motorcycle I have to ride with the visor down or I get 'bug-faced' with all the flies - and the thought that they'd just been sitting on the cow pooh.... yeuch. Not much I can do about that but amongst other things, I have organised a job elsewhere as I have truly hated living here and instead of complaining again I am off to a place with people, life and way less cow-pooh & flies.   
In my apartment I have managed to keep flies at bay by having fresh basil (usually live plants) at the windows & on my balcony. It has made a huge difference. Thanks again mom (she gave me the advice).   
Occasionally it's also good to take a few leaves in your hands and rub them and leave them on the sills as it chases the flies off.

			Aiyt, MSG is a chemical crap that most people I know will react to. The fact it is so spread here does not surprise me, they only eliminated some other stuff very reluctantly. The biggest nuisance is when one talks herself into having a healthy salad out since things are expensive here, and aside of vegetables you crunch on, you get a dressing that gets your skin scrawl. Big companies lobby and all, but look, Knorr has started selling a lot of the MSG free stuff in here last year too, that has been on the EU shelves for years. I am happy.     
Where is my additive free mod stick..   
One or two groans since you want to manifest you disagree are ok. But continuously groan one poster's views is like chasing somebody yelling   after them, relentlessly. I am sure none of us would do that. (Well, douches probably would)   
Posters will understand your opposing opinion from one groan quite well, more so if you verbalize your arguments efficiently in your posts.    
I know it is hard to abstain when one has been groaned a lot too in one thread, but reporting it instead of retaliating will keep your internet karma pristine and will keep the discussion more likely clean from pointless personal jabs.

			Concerning amazon.de there used to be a help page on working out how much you could order in books and CDs to keep the VAT below 5chf, the deminimis level to trigger duty.  If you searched ""schweiz"" und the help pages it was there, but last time I looked for it, it was gone.  Either the CH complained or the amazonians realized it was costing them buckets of postage for small orders.   
Anyway I think it was: 
- for books 5chf/2.4%=208chf=c135eur 
- for cds etc 5chf/7.6%=c66chf=c40eur

			In all the places I've lived when growing up, while this was not exclusive to certain types of communities, it certainly was more prevalent...  The type of community was one where generations of families tended to be born and die in the same town or cluster of towns.    
Hardly anybody new moves there, and hardly anybody leaves, so they have not needed to develop the type of social skill necessary to be welcoming of newcomers - after all, they've known all their friends at least since kindergarten.   
All is not lost though, these folks tend to be very friendly once they get to know you, and very inclusive, but it takes a while (sometimes a looooong while).   
Think back to the party, or ask your hubby, if there are any particular who he'd be more likely to socialize with in smaller groups. Invite them around to yours (maybe in pairs or so), so that you have a chance at conversation and getting to know them in a setting where YOU are the one who is most comfortable and at ease. This will help you and them at the same time, giving you a chance to shine and be yourself.   
On the bright side, at least it seems your Swiss hubby is social, mine is not, so I've had to find friends where I may (not a bad thing, but not easy either).   
Good luck, and best wishes for the three of you, including of course your little one.    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2013	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Posh Swiss...	Posts: 6

			Had a similar problem but with Avis at LGW. Clipped a gutter while parking and scraped the paintwork on the front left bumper. £250 excess charge, thank you very much, for something that could have been fixed with a bit of cut and polish. Next time I'll drive into a wall and get value for money.   
The worst charge was from Avis France. We hired a car in Corsica for 2 weeks and had a few chocolate bar wrappers and a bit of sand from the beach inside when we dropped it off. We got a €50 charge a week later for ""cleaning"" - apparently giving the car a vacuum between customers isn't standard practice in France.   
Still, I rarely take out full insurance and in 10 years of rental hires, I've had to pay out twice so overall, I'm probably ahead.

On the other hand I left the car one week at Zurich airport car park, and I just knew it would be banged up when I got back. Consider the hundreds of cars that would have come and gone during that period I was amazed to find not a single scratch, and someone had folded in the wing mirrors for me.

			I've had mainly positive experiences with other runners.  Often they smile or nod or give a quick flick of a wave.  Cyclists can be a bit stubborn wanting to stay in the middle of the path and I've had twig-whip a few times as I've squeezed between cyclist and bush but on the whole they are OK.   
My worst experience was being clobbered by a length of chain brandished by one of a gang of lads who thought it was highly amusing to smack a passing jogger.  Gave a me a proper dead leg but other than the gobful of war-mongering Anglo-Saxon I gave them I didn't linger as there was nobody else around and there were 4 of them and a dog.    
Other than that my route is fairly uneventful.

			Another thing to be wary of is that if you pay for more than one hold bag, your weight allowance DOES NOT go up.                  Each passenger who pays for a hold bag can take up to 20kg of luggage.  This weight allowance applies to the passenger rather than to the bag so  purchasing extra bags is possible but will not increase the weight  allowance. If you think youll need to take a little bit more with you,  you can buy some extra weight   
The real kicker is the prices for the extra weight:         Currency   Per kilo (online)    Per kilo (at the airport)     GBP  ............                      7                                        ..................... 11     EUR  ............                       9  ....................                                       14     CHF  ..........                      14   .....................20  "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2013	Groaned at 61 Times in 33 Posts	EasyJet -- Hold Baggage Price	Posts: 1,846

			This is absolutely true. Arranging day care or, for school age kids, someone to be at home for the lunch-break, is a huge challenge here. My boss has an 11-year-old daughter and lucked out with a ""Tagesschule,"" where the daughter stays all day. Still, this is quite rare, and gets infinitely more complicated if you have more than one child because because the school schedules invariably don't match and someone is effectively tied up all day looking after the kids.    
As to Swiss womens' typical lack of desire to work after putting so much into good education, this has always stumped me as well. The cynic in me suspects the fact that Swiss grads don't have a heavy college debt burden to pay off might have something to do with it...

			Oh, and to add to my previous post - if you have in fact talked to two lawyers, undoubtedly they have also advised you that 20 emails are useless and you need to send a registered letter. So my advice shouldn't really come as a surprise.    
And - be careful of publicly slandering a company. That can have expensive consequences too. Wild guess here based on your post, is that you contracted someone to handle moving of items for you and they then subcontracted to Keller. Odds are your contract with company A covers the subcontracting to company B, so read your original contract carefully.

You signing something that you don't understand is not the fault of the club, neither is you failing to handle the cancelation in line with the contract you signed..... so it's not really their fault if you assumed wrong is it. I agree that when they got the email they could have let you know the situation, but unless you can speak with them (rather than email) I don't really think you really have a leg to stand on.

			I'm sure a complaint will get you nowhere other than getting it out of your system. It's true that sometimes there is an agreeable inspector but generally they have a set of rules that they expect paying customers to follow. Also, a lesser point, this country is statistics mad.

			Not really sure I understand the issue, but I don't think the thread is going anywhere.   
All I can say is that when one of the Mods is involved in a personal ""spat"", we don't really moderate the thread or the person. We are here as members first though, and mods second....so if one of us thinks a member is talking cobblers, we are happy to point it out. Its well within your rights to disagree and we'll usually be happy to debate it. It won't head towards a ban as long as rules are stuck to.   
If - hypothetically - a mod groans you and you start groaning back....repeatedly, then Mr or Mrs Mod will usually drop you a line as a warning before you run off the ban cliff...that's not victimisation, i think thats good modding   
Anyway - drop him a line to discuss further. He's pretty reasonable on days that England aren't winning the cricket

			That's interesting; I thought laundry rotas were unique to Switzerland.  I've lived in places with shared machines before (Germany) but they provided roughly one per 4 apartments and there was never a rota.   
Luckily where I am now there is also no rota and we have access to it 24x7.  It is shared between 8 apartments though.

			I don't know if it's just me but I think that the Swiss that I've encountered are quite nice in general.. obviously there are exceptions.. but where's the place where EVERYONE is nice?    
I met the first Swiss in my life, ironically, back in Mexico. He worked for my company and he was really good friends with my coworker. At first, I must admit, I thought he was a snob and that definitely he didn't like me. But with the days passing by I realized that he was just very shy! Once he got to know me we used to meet for coffee every day in the morning, and he'd be quite nice giving me tips for Switzerland and joking around, he told me about his family and all... He never really came close to me as a ""I'm going to invite you everywhere because you're my friend"" type, but I saw how he interacted with my coworker and he seems to be a really, really loyal friend to him. He also told me that he was from a small town (near Basel I htink) and that his bestfriends were all from elementary school.. so he explained to me that Swiss are quite closed in the sense that they tend to stay around and keep the same friendships and all.. I must admit even if I considered him a friend, the first impression that people took frm him wasn't always positive... when my trainnee met him, she thought he was a snob and that he didn't like her (and to be honest, I'm pretty sure it wasn't the case), so I think it's just the mainly look they appear to be until you get to know them..   
So after that introduction to the Swiss people, it made it so much easier to come here and see it quite often.. The language is a wall that I need to conquer but even if I don't speak at all and I jsut like to pretend I do by saying a few words here and there.. well.. they are nice with me..

You have driven 20 minutes home instead of using the restroom at Barnes and Noble?  I have spent thousands of dollars at that store and felt totally happy to use their clean, public restrooms when needed even if I wasn't buying anything.   
All grocery stores in America have bathrooms you can use. If not public you can ask and they always let you use them. Especially if you have small children! As for the grocery store in Switzerland...you can understand why they didn't let me use their restroom? Like I said I'm 8 months pregnant. I had a full basket of items from their store worth 100 CHF. Sometimes it takes a while to shop and if you need a restroom it makes more sense to use one in the store rather than walk two blocks to use a public one while deserting your full cart for 20 minutes.   
When I'm out and shopping in a city center, I am usually 30-45 minutes away from my toilet at home. Sometimes further if I took the train or tram.   
Not every old lady or pregnant woman or 3 year old child can wait 45 minutes to use the bathroom.

			One thing I discovered through the years is that cleaning - how, what, and when - is extremely culturally related. Expectations can vary widely depending on what you've been used to.    
I've had a cleaning lady from an Asian country in the past (I won't precise which one as I don't want to stigmatize anybody) and she used to clean the floors so well, actually kneeling down to scrub them, that I could have eaten there. But it never once crossed her mind to clean the bathtub. From her terrible sweaty smell I suppose she wasn't very find of using one. But my floors were spotless!   
My actual cleaning lady cleans very well, but technology is beyond her. Something like the dishwasher is too complicated for her to use. It took her one month to remember where my mailbox is to drop the keys when she leaves.    
But I refuse to be condescending about all that. She cleans much better than me, and this is a hard job, physically demanding and not very rewarding socially.

Or look at it another way, for 200 your wife received clear information in 10 min which helped to make a clear informed decision about her work her, so 100 for that and a 100 for learning to ask a price before engaging any services. This may be a bitter pill to swallow but a lot of others here have learned the same lesson and it has cost a whole lot more. I would still call them and politely question the amount.

See the recent ""investigation"" into ""Apple's"" Foxconn factories. Never mind that that Foxconn is independent of Apple (major manufacturer for many companies), earlier this year someone did an investigative report of the horrible working conditions there and blamed Apple. It was all over the news.   
A while later, it came out that he lied about his report. Witnesses he supposedly talked to never existed. Etc. The station in question did the honorable thing and broadcast a fair and comprehensive rebuttal, where appropriate, but the point is the original broadcast was fabricated.   
If that kind of thing can happen to Apple, a company with insane cash reserves that can quite literally buy whatever it wants, why is it hard to accept that it can happen to Glencore as well?

Think of it dispassionately - why should a company jump through hoops for a non-EU candidate when there are several equally qualified EU candidates also applying? This is the crux of the issue - unless there are no CH/EU candidates, it makes little economic sense for a company to pursue a non-EU permit. It isn't discrimination, it's economics.      Again, you need to understand the market. There are plenty of quants looking for work who have those skills plus years of experience - and some of those don't need work permits either. Again, not discrimination, but rather market conditions.   
It's a tough time for non-EU folks in Switzerland - one needs to understand this, and deal with the market as it is.  It seems like every month for the last year or so I've been saying good-bye to yet another friend who has had to leave Switzerland, as jobs in the field you are looking to enter are cut.    
Your best bet is to concentrate on what it is that makes you an outstanding candidate - what do you have that no one else can offer? This is what you need to motivate a company to go to bat for you.

			Newsflash - we're not here to win the approval of pompous whiners.    
As for blocking - we have masses of graduates (from all nations) who are useless in the workplace because they have never worked in a non-academic context. Those with parents who can afford to send them to the UK/US to learn English win out over the bright but financially disadvantaged ones. Many economics students, especially HSG ones, think that the business world has been waiting for them and their theoretical knowledge. Well, you don't know jack and everyone you work for will probably outsmart you with experience before breakfast. Wax on wax off.    
What we are MISSING is people who do technical apprenticeships and proper craftsmen, there is too much focus on academic pursuits.

Your shoulder is not hers, neither is hers yours - whinge like a ninny?   Perhaps she's actually hurt.   
So far as the tit-for-tat though, I agree. However, I think the mistake (in Switzerland) was to go in for the confrontation in the first place. Notes back and forth may be ""passive aggressive"" but it also avoids the possibility of a confrontation becoming physical, as happened. Since I know MY temper leads to physical means of release, I think notes are the smart thing to do. (Maybe I've been here too long?)     
In the original post, I laughed to myself a bit (sorry) at the idea of suing someone here for being pushed... I thought for sure OP is one of my countrymen, but I was wrong. HOPEFULLY there is nothing actually wrong with your shoulder, and you'll be alright. I'd skip the idea of suing though, unless it is dislocated or you are found to have a long-lasting injury which proves debilitating to some degree.     
Dear OP - Have a chat with the hauswart or some other source of mediation (preferably someone who can translate back and forth) to discuss things with your neighbor. What she did is uncalled for yes, but here it is simply ""not done"" to have direct confrontation as you did - she may have felt threatened and that's why she reacted so over-the-top. Get someone else there to witness, and to help mediate.   
Meanwhile, maybe get some method to hang your laundry in your apartment, rather than leaving it in to dry in a common area. I wouldn't trust her to not dump your laundry again if she ever thinks you're over your time again - better to simply avoid the issue.

During husband's appointment, I didn't ask about my bloodwork results (taken previous week), doc brought it up and just said ""oh btw, bloodwork normal"" - only when outside while making new appointment for me did he look in file and see value 3.1 - my reaction ""OH, that's not normal, that's high, explains why I've been feeling crap.""  He said ""oh you're feeling bad, take more synthroid"" and had his assistant get more medication. I resisted a bit, said oh, but i wanted to talk to you about the combination therapy, etc."" at which point he made said comments re. success stories and pill bazaar.

Also to have alcohol and tobacco on offer, Migros first allied with and later bought Denner, which is on the same price-level as Aldi and Lidl. To counter Migrol, COOP started COOP petrol stations. To counter this, Migros bought the ARAL -CH petrol stations and the ARAL shops.  The ARAL shops were turned into   but still sell tobacco, beer and wine. To get a heavier say in regard to   they recently, in conjunction with SOCAR, purchased the former ESSO shops who continue to sell tobacco and alcohol. To outdistance COOP in regard to Germany and to improve its purchasing power, Migros-Zürich purchased TEGUT in Germany. The   of COOP according to rumours is full.  But in the past few years, COOP purchased InterDiscount, Fust.  It will be interesting to see the next move of COOP.   
Back to Migros. The present plans of the Migros group see a big expansion of Denner, but not much expansion of the mainline shops   
On the side of COOP, it was amazing to see how Hansueli Loosli between 1997 and 2011 (14 years) heavily transformed COOP into a modern enterprise   
At Migros, Mr Bolliger will step down in 2017.  He in his time gradually DEcentralized Migros and gave the various M-cooperatives much more independence, which gives more flexibility to the group. Quite along the ideas of Gottblieb Duttweiler.  COOP at the other hand grew out of the cooperatives-section of the SocialDemocratic Party and so has a different legacy. In order to break the influence of party-people, Loosli rather centralized the whole structure. The challenge to his successor(s) is not an easy one.

			The shower did not leak during our 3 year stay at the apartment. The agent checked it and it was fine too. He denies he did.  
The cleaning company broke the rubber, which we found out about on the day of handover, as they finished cleaning late the day before. 
The light bulb over the oven was missed, as we did not use it at all. 
Fair enough, we agreed to pay for it and signed it on the paper.    
The apartment owner or building owner came to check the apartment 2 weeks before the handover inspection. And he said everything was fine.   
I'm going to send a registered letter. Thank you for the suggestions. I sent an email.   
It's really frustrating as when it comes to paying rent, you need to do it on time. When it comes to getting a deposit, the agency can take ages to return the money.   
Also shows that dishonest people can be found in Switzerland. I must have been wearing pink glasses:-)

MY times are the defacto-timings when things start to go wrong.  I back in 2002 was in the Jebel Ali Hotel and for the transfer to the airport including return of the rented car needed less than an hour. But on arrival in Dubai on the same travel, I needed a transfer-taxi of the travel agency, and so discussed with the manager, a Syrian from Damascus, about Damascus and Beirut and Köln for about 40 minutes. Before that I had sat with some folks for coffee for some 30 minutes. The transfer-driver, as a result of some discussions, made some slight detours (free-of-charge) to show me some new buildings of the town, which added roughly half an hour.

			""Die Post"" is actually doing something strange with their shipping costs. 
A very light enveloppe (I believe up to 250 grams) may be up to 5 cm think. 
A heavier enveloppe may only be 2 cm thick. In other words: a thin enveloppe may be up to 1kg, whereas a thick enveloppe may only be 250 grams... 
If you drop off an enveloppe in the yellow mailbox, it may be that it was too thick and/or too heavy and then it is suddenly treated as a package (which will suddenly cost a lot more).   
The only thing that I find surprising, is that I thought the sender would be charged (and not the receiver).   
Surely the post has their reasoning, but as a sender you have to be carefull to always check the weight and the size    
Nontheless, I understand that you feel **** - I would feel the same way, too!

You might not find exactly what you're looking for when you visit a shop, but you'll find so much more.      Books are about discovery and sensuality and expression. You can't find that online. Classic bookshops are vital, books need long rows of shelves to be all lined up, or piled up, one besides the other, so that you get a chance to find the one you weren't looking for and didn't know. 
Bookshops should have corners and deep soft sofas and little old librarians to who leave notes on the front cover with their thoughts.

From our experience, hotel prices seem to be better via third parties.

			Based on our recent experience, my advice is as follows. Contact them by email/phone and confirm the item is in stock. Pay and pick it up at the warehouse.    
They do have cheaper prices on many items so this ensures no waiting weeks on end for delivery. In our case, they moved the item from one warehouse to another, which took less than a day. We got an email confirming it was there and my husband paid for it and picked it up the next morning. =)

1) Some of this depends upon airline.  Swiss and Lufthansa have slightly different internal electronic procedures than United and Air Canada.   
2)  Make _sure_ that your frequent flier status is properly in your seat allocation, as some of these will prevent you from being in the unhappy box of ""ticket booked, seat unallocated"".  I have been in that box, and it is not a good box to be in.  But it usually occurs on an airline where either: (a) I have no frequent flier account, or (b) low status on the airline.   
3)  My recent experience with Swiss was a case in point.  I am a 1K with United (Gold Star Alliance), and the travel agent put in the wrong frequent flier number for me, which meant: (a) I nearly didn't get a seat; and (b) the seat I was given was next to the toilet in the last row on the 12 hour flight to Miami.  I emailed Swiss in advance of my return to Switzerland from LA, explained what had happened, they corrected the information in the system and within 24 hours -- but 10 days before my flight back -- they issued me an economy seat that was in a respectable part of the plane.  And apologized for the seating error previously.      
I suppose I wouldn't have minded being in the last row of the plane, but: (a) I had a business meeting scheduled and needed to exit the plane as fast as possible; and (b) I was surrounded by about 40 drunk Swedes heading on a group holiday to Miami.

I can't say that I've noticed worse food hygiene here then anywhere else. I also think that some get a little overly concerned about things but once I did see a guy go straight from the toilet to serving food without washing his hands. After I'd finished I walked straight out.

Interestingly, she did say ""Please do not sign a reservation contract without getting the mortgage approved"" for which I responded ""well there are two lenders already backing the purchase so if I do not get a loan from UBS, I will still buy"", she had a golden opportunity to mention ""oh but if you don't go with us, we will charge you for all that we have done so far (like doing the above evaluations)"" but instead my UBS mortgage advisor chose to say ""oh that is good, just wanted to be sure"". So to me - I was clear she was in a competitive process and there was no agreement on them being the sole supplier. So an administration fee would have been reasonable if agreed upfront (or even better paid upfront as you mention).    
They are doing this to me simply because I have an account with them.

			There's obviously a demand for a similar business, that I saw being started up in London:   
- an old office or warehouse type premises is leased, and filled with old redundant office furniture and equipment, between being discarded and recycled;   
- then, those in need of therapy (often City types), can pay to enter the room, by the hour ..... often during lunch break or after work;   
- on the way in, they are given strong gardening gloves, eye goggles and .....   
...... a long-handled sledge hammer.

			Slightly off topic, but we have had a problem with Interdiscount and the extra warranty which my partner paid for when he bought a Samsung Note.     
It has never worked so well and would often crash and turn itself off.  Well just after christmas it stopped working altogether,  would turn it on and as soon as he opened an app it would crash.     
We took it to Interdiscount expecting then to fix it, so they sent it to there service centre, was told it needed a new battery,  3 weeks later we had to go to the shop to pick it up, we took it home and guess what? it wasn't fixed.     
We took it back to the shop, they have told us that we will have to incur the cost of the repair with no reason to explain this other than it wasn't covered by the warranty, and that if we want it back broken we have to pay for the shipping and battery.  So we are having it sent back broken.     
I would recommend that you buy your phone directly from the network shops.  It seems like consumers here do not have as much protection as in the uk.  Sorry for the long post, it is very frustration dealing with these people.

			At the risk of getting lynched, I think one of the recurring themes with EF ads is that they are posted by non-tech-savy people (not being sexist, but from my observations over the years it seems to be mainly housewives, who are organizing the moves/sales while hubby works) who greatly struggle with things like using forums in general, uploading photos, or giving basic details and accurate descriptions. Then promptly seem to forget that they have posted an ad, or in the case of selling multiple items can't seem to regularly update it or respond to people.   "	null	null	null	sellers on EF	null

			First, congrats on your fresh PhD degree!   I just graduated with one last month in the US. Tremendous feeling, right?   
The interview could have been worse. I know of colleagues in the US who were flown across the country (missing out on time to work on academic projects, etc.) and had to solve problems on a whiteboard but before even beginning to write anything, the interviewer left the room to answer calls/e-mails and never came back, never followed up. The entire day and a half was dealing with similar apathetic interviewers. A complete waste of time for them and I imagine for the company as well to book all the travel arrangements and logistics, etc. Absolutely nothing came out of it except maybe the chance to visit a new city for a few hours before heading back.   
Don't be discouraged. Most likely it was some sort of miscommunication. Is it a company you really wanted to work for? If not, then move on. They just missed out on a highly-qualified candidate. If it was your dream company, give them a shot again but first question their hiring practices... perhaps it's just an HR problem. Check to see if there are other internal problems. I use   to gain a little insight, particularly for US companies. It helps but it should also be viewed with healthy skepticism. See if the company ranks anywhere, I'll admit it's tough to get such information if it's a small company but then again, I'd put a lot more negative weight on miscommunication for a small company.   
Anyway, best of luck! I'm sure you will do fine.   "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: Jul 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Job interview from hell	Posts: 135

This was the reason why in the late 60ies and early 70ies, uncountable dual citizens who lived in the USA came over to Switzerland and did military service, in order to keep out of the War in Vietnam (I was the defacto translator of such a chap in the ""RS"", and learnt a lot of English that way) 
B)  if you as a dual citizen lived in the USA for more than 10 years, you could visit Switzerland without the risk to be charged with military taxes. THIS was checked up by my uncle and his wife (based in Marshall/TX) in 1958, He had lived in TX+LA since 1905 .  Things between 1955 and early 58 were checked up with the CH-embassy in W-DC and the military command of the Canton of Schaffhausen. As the NON-CH wife of him did most of the work, it was Mum who did the translating for the office in Schaffhausen.   
BUT then two major questions : 
> How old were you when coming over to Switzerland ?   If less than 20 years old you are considered a CH citizen who has to do military service ! 
>  Have you done service in any part of USA armed forces ?  If not, then you have to accept to be up for military service here    "	become a little unpopular	Join Date: Apr 2012	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	Military Obligations in Switzerland for USA/CH dual nationals	Posts: 23

However it is not always so easy. A few years ago I arrived at Geneva in the evening, and the rental garage was very dark. I checked very carefully all around the car- and all was fine. I am 5ft3 (1m62) so I couldn't check the roof. Drove in the dark to my friend's house 100km away- parked and went to bed. In the morning, opened the window (first floor) and saw that the roof was peppered with what looked definitely like hale damage - and it had definitely NOT haled overnight. Rang the rental co, who basically said 'tough'- you will be charged. Asked police to check and confirm no hale overnight - it took me months and an official complaint via 'WHICH' consumer association (UK) to get my money back.   
Never ever just hand in the keys without them to sign the NON damage report.   
Re upgrade. We did have a fabulous up-grade once in the US for our journey across Arizona, Utah and Colorado over 3 weeks. Never again as it cost us a fortune on petrol!   
BTW, wheels and tyres are normally not included in the extra insurance is you read the small print!!! If you ever have a flat tyre- get it repaired and don't mention it. I once had the wheel changed due to a puncture and returned the car with the flat tyre in the boot - they charged me for a new tyre!

Even within those broad communities, first-year students tended to live together (wild, debauched evenings and not too much serious work) as did final-year students (a much more sober bunch, as exams loomed on the horizon).   
Since you're doing your second degree, it seems natural that you have more life experience and that you're more mature than some of your younger housemates.  But rather than trying to force them to grow up, why not try to find a set of housemates closer to you in age & outlook?

			Hahahaha, love this thread.   
I remember having a conversation with a Swiss colleague about the serious work needed on the variety of crisps here. I told her, ready salted and paprika just doesn't cut the mustard and in the UK we have LOADS.    
Like what she said, well, there is Monster Munch with their pickled onion, flamin hot, beef, there is Walkers with their usuals and sensations range, Chicken and Thyme, Mint Lamb, Sweet Thai Chili, Hula Hoops are an awesome crip too. Beef and mustard is a well missed flavour.   
She responded that we in the UK must need those things because our food is so crap   I firmly told her we too do hash browns (rosti) and sausages, and quite frankly, they are better in the UK   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: May 2011	Groaned at 47 Times in 27 Posts	Flavour disappearing	Posts: 1,504

But I agree, a battery over a few  years old (or even one in the case of a bike) can go at any time. My OEM car battery lasted about three (new car), the second nearly 10 (from Migros). I've had motorcycle batteries last 1-8 years, 3-4 being the average.

			Here they refuse to take paper/cardboard unless tied up neatly with string. If you package it neatly in a box or paper bag they will simply leave it with a big green sticker on it. I also once I put some of the free news papers from the mail box underneath a few bundles of other peoples paper, thinking that would hold them down until collection time. They took the bundles and left my untied papers. When I came home, there was newspapers blowing all around the street. I guess when you do such a boring job, the only authority you can demonstrate, is leaving a green sticker and not taking the paper.

 First of all, the waiting period for the legal protection insurance (not just legal counseling) is mentioned both on the website and in the papers you get when you apply for the membership.   
Plus, there is nothing fishy about that. A yearly membership costs 90 Francs, while the insurance protects you against costs (legal fees etc.) of at least 8'000 Francs (if the case has merit). If the renters association were stupid enough not to exclude certain costs, they would go bancrupt in no time, as people would only become members when they need the insurance to cover their fees.    
All insurances work that way.

Yes, asking a bar in the Langstrasse area to turn down its volume would stand only minimal chance of success, but the problem is not just regular music at too high a volume, or getting used to the noise, it is active persecution, to drive me out of my flat, so that they can take it over.   
All during the summer the male proprietor would wait outside the ""bar"" at around the time that I normally come home from my sport training (underwater hockey -   or   - quick plug!) and then a minute or so later the latin music that had previously been playing in the ""bar"" would suddenly become hardcore drum & bass music at a greatly increased volume, just to make life miserable for me, and sleep next to impossible.   
And I don't know how much money they make as a bar, because most of the time the ""bar"" seemed to be virtually empty. Presumably there weren't any real customers in the bar each time the music was changed to persecute me, as I presume that real customers wouldn't tolerate the change of music to something so loud and unpleasant every time the guy upstairs came home.   
But yes, all recommendations of quieter areas would be gratefully received!

The fact that I habitually arrive at the last second and the 'wrong' train was leaving from the platform at exactly the time the 'correct' train was supposed to leave meant that alarm bells started going full blast only when we rolled into the tunnel. There was light at the end of it (pun intended), since that morning was beautiful in the mountains. Shame I couldn't stay and had to go to back work in the end.

			It seems in Zurich that there's only one manufacturer of gipfeli. I'm a great fan of schoggi gipfel, and it seems that regardless of which retailer I go into (eg Kleiner Feiner, Jung, ...) they all sell exactly the same type.   
I asked my local shop about them, as they also sell the same type, and the guy said: yes they are all from the same place, but the manufacturer does make them very well.   
Is this an example of how small the local economy is, ie that Zurich can only support one frozen baked goods manufacturer, or an indication of cartels in action, or a sign that no small bakers make their own products these days?

He did point out he regarded the incident as a one-off.   
You often get situations where you're so taken aback you don't do something about it right away. But sometimes...   
I was on a Basel tram many years ago with my then 2 y.o. son when a busker got on and started playing accordion. At that moment a skinhead got up and started threatening the busker and making remarks about folk from the Balkans - an scaring the bejeezus out of my son. So I got up and told the skinhead to button it as he's frightening my son. The skinhead actually apologised to me.

			I have the copy of the handover protocol when i entered. But i did not get the one when I handed over the key! We checked the apartment together, and I gave the keys and we agreed to have the kitchen cleaning ( 3-4 hours ) , and some walls to be repaired ( small things - no holes! ). But i did not get it written down. I wish i did, really.  
I told the landlord that I want to know the exact places of the ``holes``  painted. I guess he was not expecting me to object, and he said may be there is a misunderstanding and he will check again with the painter!   
He said the tube was blocked and the water flooded to kitchen. I cannot really believe this happened. I used all before the day i left the home, and i did not have any problem.    
I will request all the bills, and call the company and ask to neighbor if this really happened!

1139	null	null	null	null	"    I spend lots and lots of time playing basketball here in Switzerland. Thats not normal for some one my age. But since I hang out at the parks here a couple of evenings a week I do get a chance to meet these ""problem teens"" all the time and have made friends with most of them.    
In my experience they are almost all the children of foreigners. In my area all yugoslavians, Algerians and a couple of Polish kids. They are not bad kids. In particular the Algerian kids take care of their brothers and sisters very well.    
But you cant expect a child to raise its self.    
In all of the years I have lived here and known all of these kids not once have I met any of their parents. From talking to the kids their parents all work one or two jobs in order to have 2 cars and an apartment. They spend almost zero time with their kids. Do you know who talks to these kids about smoking? Me.... Im not their fuking mom. Yet Im the only one who has ever addressed that issue with them. These kids are 15 years old.    
I made one Albanian kid (Who I know his father very very well) return stolen porn mags from the local BP. These kids arent criminals, they are just bored out of their minds. I personally think these kids dont get the love they need. Mom and dad dont get home until 9pm most nights.    
But thats just my experience. Many of these kids dont drink or smoke or do drugs. They just get bored and want to show off for friends. They have no life inside their house. The job of parent is the most important in the world. You cant expect anyone or anything to raise your kids for you.

			Hi All, 
Thanks for the replies. 
I have spoken to the Mieterverband, and I managed to get some information from them over the phone. 
Basically, if I annoy the agents enough, they can kick me out after 3 months. 
I can dispute this, and then be kicked after a year. 
The agents have no right to do this lift thing, but it seems they can get away with it. 
I can ask for a rent reduction, but they might well consider this annoying, and kick me out for that. 
So, the Mieterverband told me what I have already surmised for myself, but for them to actually give me written legal arguments, I will have to pay 150 chuffs, as it is a business. Great. 
Rainer, I don't have access to the door, so I can't shut it. 
It is an issue, would you want to drag half a tone of gear, PAST a lift door, and up 2 flights of stairs? 
It is not appreciated, I can tell you. 
We finish when we finish, my record is 5am. 
I have tried talking to the Lady, I did that at the start, I explained all my points politely, she would not listen, just kept on talking over me, saying over an over ""I can't sleep"". 
TidakApa, I know all about her business, she is the premiere purveyor of lollipops in Switzerland, with a chain of shops. 
The music biz is hard enough to make living, I am certainly not going to pay for lunch for this............lady. 
Though I get what you are saying, I don't think it will help. 
So, all in all, screwed again, like the tag says. I find this extremely annoying, to say the least.

She began in Finnish, switched to Swedish and then finished in English. Apparently there's a old crab in every building who exists only to share their misery with everyone else (there is a specific name for this in Finnish even   ). It also helped that she was completely bonkers. I should have just slapped her before she made it to Swedish but....I let her go on until I rolled my eyes and walked off (and then crumpled on my sofa in quiet sobs). Hang in there and don't let the old hags get you down.    
And *pfft* to the 'eco friendly' rubbish. WTF - with the number of people who light their damn ciggie up as they are walking out of the train and into your face without a single person smacking them upside the head? The number of women with infants in prams who smoke right over them without retort? Please. It has nothing to do with the environment or exhaust. Noise, probably. Fumes? Very unlikely.

			Every teenager needs a band. I keep tellin' all kids I teach.    
Anyways, it's not so easy..there aren't so many places to be cool, everything costs cash and most kids don't really have it. Sports, music and hobbies are acquired tastes, if you have kids, better start doing those things yourself and show them it's cool to invest yourself into stuff that makes you better. Then you can show up and nag about the low quality youfs who are bored.     
I just been to a conference organized by world trade union headquarters, about teen involvement and engagement. What was actually shocking were local authorities, who are waiting for kids to come up with something. Now, in the era of instant anything in your room, where you don't have to move from your bed and pc in order to be in touch with likeminded souls, there is pretty much zero interest in being active in the community. Community should reach out to them. I know there are centers for hem, etc. but it does not seem enough. I just feel since ze youfs doesn't bring immediate profit, it is a bit forgotten. If community doesn't nudge, there aren't bands around, scouts or church activities, it should be parents to nudge. Eventhough for teens it's pretty much the last source of inspiration, innit. You can help, though, get them instruments, help out building practice place, do funky sports with them, organize dance camps, chess..sci/fi...wait, that's probably no longer in    
Kids told me today, suspenders and bowties are in, hahah, jayyysus.

			One of my more surreal customer service experiences here:   
Saw something I liked in a baby clothing store in Zürich, asked the assistant if she had it in size 12 months.   
Sales assistant: ""Oh yes, we have that size.""    
Me: ""Wonderful. I'll take it. Would you gift wrap it please?""   
Sales assistant: ""Oh no, I can't sell this one to you. I can't have one size missing from the display.""   
Me: ""Do you have another in stock?""   
Sales assistant: ""Yes, but I can't bring it out if there is one on the floor.""   
Me: ""But if you sell me this one, there would no longer be one on the floor and you could bring another out of the stockroom...""   
Sales assistant: ""But I can't I sell this one to you. I can't have one size missing from the display...""   
Me:    
Fearing entering into an endless loop, I left.   
(And ordered a cute baby outfit online from Hanna Andersson.)

			I have noticed a similar incident happening to one of my friends. This guy had just landed in Zurich airport and we took him to the SBB counter to buy a ""monthly"" Zurich Zone 10 ticket. Before him, another friend of mine renewed his monthly and then we bought his. 
But we did not notice that he was issue the ticket on the customer ID of my friend (the counter guy forgot to change the ID). 
After couple of weeks we were checked in the S-Bahn and this guy was caught because ""he was travelling on someone else's ticket"" and was fined (No fault on part of the ticket inspector though) 
He was issued an invoice to pay. 
Next day we took that invoice to the Airport counter and explained the matter to the same guy who issued the ticket. 
He understood his mistake and cancelled the fine then and there. 
We were lucky that he was brave enough to admit that it was his fault and we didn't have to go through the process of calling/writing to the SBB.   
But, this things happens and you have to accept uit. But at the same time do all the calling and writing to resolve the issue. Its not about some CHFs, but its about the principal.   
I wish you all the best and yes, you should also claim for all the cost you have incurred to resolve this.

			Friends,   
Just to caution you about Permanence Oerlikon and the quality of staff. My close friend's wife went to the Clinic for some minor ailment. The doctor advised a blood test.    
The lady who was supposed to draw the blood messed things up completely. My friend's wife was sitting there bleeding and the attendant had no clue how to extract the needle from the skin leave alone the blood! Another lady came down and ultimately extracted the needle. My friend told me that the previous attendant just said sorry and disappeared completely. The 2nd attendant who extracted the needle, very curtly told my friend's wife to not make a fuss as this can happen anytime! The doctor also told the same to her but thankfully with a more polite undertone. :-)   
Hence folks, please be careful. Even if it is a pain, I would suggest the HB Permanence which seems to have more experienced staff.

Latest update - after replying to the last email from PATHE, accepting their offer for 6 entry passes, this morning I got an envelope in the mail with aforementioned ticket replacements.    
That closes this chapter of our relationship with PATHE and unless something changes significantly on their side, I think for the time being it will be the final one.    
I want to thank you all for the support, all of you. Those that posted links pointing out the fine print, too. I should read the fine print always and ask, should enough info is not immediately made available.

			I suspect you'll dind he answer here:  
This is the important  part   
Your non-EU spouse, (grand)parents or (grand)children do not need to get a visa from the country they are travelling to if:   
the country they are travelling to belongs to the passport-free Schengen area (see list below) and they have a residence permit or visa from another country in that area, or 
they are travelling with you or travelling to join you and have a residence card issued by any EU country (except the country you are a national of).   
The residence card should clearly state that the holder is a family member of an EU national.

Normally I'm up front taking photos (which often means a head in a speaker...and that's usually during extreme metal gigs), but even if I'm in the back I wear my plugs.    
Back when I was 18 or 19, Motorhead played a gig at an old theater in the town where I grew up - it ended up being in the Guinness book of world records as the unofficial loudest concert ever. The ceiling started to crumble and plaster was on everyone's shoulders. I stayed in the lobby of the theater, maybe lasted five or six songs and left - I could still hear it clear as day inside my car with the windows rolled up blocks away. I was deaf for a few days afterwards, all I could hear was ringing. I remember going to lectures at university and not hearing a thing.    
My dad, who worked at an auto factory, brought me home earplugs after that, and I've worn them religiously ever since. I still have hearing trouble and can't make out what people say when there's loud backgruond noise.    
Personally, I'm always grateful when the security guys have extra earplugs to hand out when I'm up front.

I don't understand why you are shocked that there are so many smokers here, and therefore, they would want to keep smoking going. I was suprised too when I got here about how much smoking was part of the daily routine here, like maybe how it was in 1950 in the US. But I'd say Switzerland today has a lot in common with the US in the 1950's; as can be seen by a number of complaint thread on this forum.   
I don't see why this country should hike up taxes to 25 a pack, if people are perfectly fine smoking tobacco. They know the health risks. I mean they are allowed to smoke pot here as well. And for the country most people think the world over as having some of the cleanest air and great wide open spaces to enjoy it, I don't know why you are concerned about those who do get together and drown their nights away in a cloud of smoke.    
I mean seriously, who cares how smoking is regulated in Australia? What does that have to do with the people here?

			Just complaining... 
There is a real estate agency GPM in Lugano. I had very unpleasant experience with them. 
1. They delivered the key to my apartment 1 week later without being sorry at all. I did not know what to do, lived by my friend, put all things in a garage  and actually paid for that week. 
2. They charged 1 month payment from the previous tenant, when he already left and they did renovation during that month(changed the kitchen and windows). He refused to pay, I do not know how that is finished. I guess he had just verbal agreement and his contact was not terminated yet. It is stupid to trust someone, when it comes to money. 
3. You need to call all day every 30 minutes to catch someone in the office. 
4. They send the yearly expenses bill with Cablecom included, even if I had it cut off. 
5. I asked to send a new bill, and they did not. 2 years after they called and asked why I did not pay for the bill. I asked to recalculate it again, and finally they did. 
6. I called them to declare damage from the building renovation, executed by the building administration. A technician came, took the note, and then nothing happened. When I called again in 2 months, they asked me to call the building administration. The building administration said they do not deal directly with the tenants. After 5! calls GPM (always tried to get rid of my request) finally reached agreement with the building administration. 
7. I was looking or a tenant and asked if animals allowed. They responded that the small ones allowed. A new tenant applied and was accepted, paid the caution. At the last moment, few days before the takeover, they rejected the tenant for the reason he has a small dog, Min Pin. Now I have to pay extra month, because there is no time to find another. Not to mention the new tenant frustration. They would not accept a family with children too. The house is full of children and dogs however. 
8. What else can they invent to make my life harder? I am in anticipation...

Cigarette smoke is widespread enough in this country that we don't need people ignoring the law where it's forbid. God help if I want to take a train to and from work (which I must) and try and avoid smoke from work to the train, train to the tram, and the tram to my house. Because it's all legal, I have to shut up and enjoy the nauseating smell lingering for hundreds of meters without even the culprit in site... so I wouldn't feel any remorse in reporting people breaking the law on a smoking matter when it's applicable.

That is my opinion too.   
Now it seems US and UK warships are massing in the Gulf in the expectation that Israel will soon attack Iran. It'll never end. (Or maybe it will - completely).    
It's amazing how eagerly the western world TVs show the destruction and death in Syria and the 1000s of refugees. Oddly enough we were hardly shown anything of the 100 times worse death, destruction and fleeing people in

It's very easy to reach wrong conclusions when you don't see the full story.   
Saying ""go somewhere else"" is not a good way to resolve an argument, and if the other person retorts ""go somehwere else yourself"" you can construe that as racism, or you can construe it as a stupid retort to a stupid remark. To paraphrase Freud, you can see racism everywhere if its in your own mind, but sometimes a snappy response is just a snappy response.

What do you consider a reasonable rate? You should just be businesslike and tell them your terms and conditions are.   
You are not forced to do business, it is your choice. Just be clear on your terms. Perhaps you can create a document outlining your prices and what work you will and wont consider. It wont leave much room for negotiating.

			Hi, I just had a strange experience with miniBoo Ricardo Shop:   
I order a ""Windeleimer"" from them, both the title and description stating that ""6 cassettes are included"". So far so good, though I got a great deal. The package arrives: no cartridges included. 
I contacted their customer services about the issue.    
Their answer was     I was like: WHAT???  
They advertise an item on Ricardo with false description and they correct the ""mistake"" AFTER the order has been placed/ paid for and delivered?   
And let's not forget it was not a minor difference but actually would have led to three times the original price!!   
Anyway, I sent it back of course and made sure I will never deal with miniBoo.ch again

			Well worth a challenge! My dad once sent me a cd and mistakenly wrote the value at £200 and not £20.The receipt with the correct value was inside the parcel. The postman rang at the door to charge me the customs charge but when I realised what had happened I refused the parcel. I emailed Swiss post and they asked me to retrieve the paperwork from the parcel at the PO and email it to them which I did.  
They then told me to tell the PO to send the parcel back to the sorting office after writing on it 'please re-evaluate ' and it back to me no charge a few days later.

			If you can build a website I will give you a challenge !   
I own the domain name   ( Wii on TV)   
I will let you use it, you can find videos on Youtube of almost every game there is, you can embed these videos on to your site as your main features (good free content).   
You can use your writing skills to tell readers and watchers what you think of each game (they don't all have to be Wii) make sure that you let your members leave comments too, they could become your customers...   
Make sure you link up to facebook etc, it might go viral    
Your biggest challenge would be to see how cheap you can buy games for and how much you can sell them for, I will host the site for you and I will only want 15% of net profits.   
If you cannot build a website find one of your friends who can and go into business with him.   
If you want to talk about it in more detail PM me.

			I must confess I too can see both points of view.   
I'm English, but I was brought up not to flush the toilet at night unless it was... necessary... to avoid disturbing the rest of the house.   
I would suggest that if you can leave it until morning, do so.    
On the other hand, there are times when you need to flush. And I'm sure that most people appreciate this. When I've had a stomach bug, for example, and have been flushing the toilet frequently in the night, no-one's ever complained. Or sometimes I just forget, if I'm feeling drowsy, and I flush without thinking.    
So perhaps your neighbour is getting frustrated that you seem (from her point of view) to be flushing the toilet at night on a regular basis in disregard of the conventions here.    
I suggest a positive approach would be to write a polite note to all your neighbours (i.e. not signalling this particular lady out) explaining that you work shifts, and that you may therefore disturb them when you have to leave early / come home late, and that you hope they understand that any noises you may make are not due to a lack of consideration but due to your work circumstances, and that you will try and keep such noises to a minimum. No need to go into details.

			I don't know why people don't think about these things before they rent:   
Here's an easy guide for those who need/want an apartment rather than a house:   
1. For those with young children, get a newish, concrete apartment   flat, preferably with a garden or nearby park.   
2. For those who want a quiet life, and who do not have young children, get a newish, concrete apartment   flat.   
I appreciate that it's not easy to find these but anything else will always be a massive compromise.

			Right now I have the cable connection going straight to a PC in my office, where I run Microsoft's Media Center to let me record as much TV as I want, and I use a Media Center Extender to watch recorded/live TV in the living room.   
If I upgraded to the Netbox package (to get faster speeds) am I forced to use the Netbox device, or could I just put it on a shelf, unused, and ignore it, and continue as I am now?   
Thanks,

1. Access is easy from London Bridge Station   
2. It isn't a huge area so it is easy to find all the different things.  Staff were handing out leaflets with details of the whole area, including a plan   
3.  Agreed, the staff weren't actively engaging with visitors but were approachable and friendly.

			Toppreise equivalent: try idealo.fr   
Steg computer: what was the issue? You will not get the sort of service you can get in the US (or with large shops like amazon) with these stores: they can take forever to deliver, and they do not have to take the items back. They are very slow to answer, and you may feel at times that they think you should be grateful they let your worthless self shop at their magnificent store.   
But ultimately, within the above bounds, I found most of the shops on toppreise to be reliable, honest and often very quick. A real complaint is generally handled in reasonable time.

			I know I'll be seen as a miserable bast^% for this but I grew tired of the same old cars driving round with folk hanging out the windows screaming and waving flags and beeping incessantly well after midnight on a Sunday night, especially when kids manning the closed off streets of our place woke us up at 6.20 on Sunday morning by them playing at being polizei with walkie-talkies set on 'stun'.    
Going back to last night's football -this was NOT even the final. I wouldn't have minded it so much for 10 minutes but it eventually became all one flew over the cuckoos nest in its derangement.   
And this bit of Switzerland is far and away the NOISIEST place I've ever lived - I've lived places where live gunfire and car bombs have occasionally woken me up but not with the regularity that some crazy driver, 'special' event or whatever has here.

1331	null	null	null	null	"    Just to put a couple of things in context for you to hopefully make you feel a bit less frustrated:   
Firstly, The 10 stop filter or Big Stoppers are in huge demand & the production of them is having trouble keeping up, this was compounded in autumn last year when Cokin went into administration. I heard that Lee Filters took over some of their business, but didn't yet have the production capacity to fullfill back orders very quickly  - also the other major maker of 10 stop filters is HiTech & they were caught on the hop by the Cokin thing as well.   
I needed a 10 stop for an advertising job i had coming up in October last year & very luckily I was going via London to it & was able to grab one from Teamwork, but even they only had 1 left after the one I got & no-one else in London had any coming until Jan/Feb 2012. 
I probably don't need to tell you how far behind London, Zurich usually is on the supply chain      
Secondly, on the shops that were shut on Saturdays: which were they - the pro ones?  
ProFot, Graphic Art & Lite & Byte are all profesional suppliers & kit rental outfits & as such they only run Mon - Fri business hours. They are 1st & formost a business to business supplier - It's a bit like you needing a a bit of metal cut for a DIY project & being suprised that the Metalwork factory is closed on a Saturday.

			i do not usually complain about people, i always give the benefit of the doubt but the latest events really drove me mad!   
just to cut the story short, I have been looking for a handyman for more than a month. I have used the search function here on the forum, read the feedbacks and contacted the most recommended handymen.   
Some did not bother to reply to my PM, others took more than a week to answer (but it's not a problem, i understand people is busy and have limited access to mail), few are charging more than 100 chf just to come to my house (still no issues here, it's the market baby...)   
However at the end I managed to get  , who has nice feedbacks here. 
He came once to my place, attached a light to the ceiling although it did not work properly, a buzz was coming out of it. 
""it's the switch, i'll change it when I come back"" he said, ""cool"" i replied ""check your agenda and book your time for me"". So the day after I sent him an email asking for another appointment, which he could book only for 2 weeks later.   
So i decided to wait these 2 weeks although i had all the stuff laying around the house and could not invite people over for dinner as the light did not work, but I assumed he could come and do a good job. 
So the big day is coming, I am expecting him at 11 am...then 11:15...11:30 and still no signs of him. So i txt him to ask what the story is and he replied ""sorry i have your appointment down for 3pm, however I am sick and I cannot leave the house until i get better""... OK, I understand he was sick but he could still let me know he was not coming, at the end I was waiting for him for the last 2 weeks.   
2 days later and still no news from him, so I did send him another txt ""i hope you are well, please let me know when you can come over"". This was last Saturday, today is almost THursday and no reply whatsoever.   
So Richard the brit handyman just let me down like that! I was pissed!    
So i had to look for another handyman with short notice and everyone was booked for the next 2 weeks... Fortunately I have managed to get this   over and he did a brilliant job!  
and guess what? the light that Richard installed is defective, there is nothing wrong with the switch. I have to return it although more than 1 month from the purchase is gone. I could have done it on time if Richard spotted it and if he didnt make me wait 2 weeks for nothing.    
BTW this is another lesson learned, never trust 100% positive feedbacks as some people can really prove them wrong.   
end of the rant.

First one was a male dog, the second and third bitches.  
I talked about de-sexing with my vet, but she was rather against putting my bitch through a surgery if it was not needed (=if I was not responsible enough to watch her while she was heating). So I didn't.  
I keep my bitch in leach at ALL times while heating and never go to places for toilette where there are normally other dogs. Since we don't live in a perfect world, accident   happen of course, but never then less you should know if there was an accident and you could have it sprayed out.

if they ask in the form whether one does have a pet or if one plays an instrument, you can write in your cover letter that you like it quiet and that you hve neither a pet nor a musical instrument.

			Thank you all so much, for the quick and sometimes very detailed replies I am always amazed how EFers manage to help in absolutely any situation 
I think in my case its with 98% probability will go well. What I will do: 
 -will have accupunktur before the birth 
 -talk to a midwife 
 -when something starts, call my hospital and ask when they think that I should come 
 - take the train during the day or call for a taxi in the night and not forget some towels    
But still I was wondering: 
 - if i have not only waters but also blood, and i am not in good shape, will taxi drive still take me in the car? 
 - if it were the second or the third birth? Even a fine gratis russian ambulance barely managed to deliver my mom to the hospital, when she was giving birth to my sister 
 - if its total disaster, like the head already showed up or there is a lot of blood, or something else, still the woman can call for ambulance on a usual 144 number? Birth is actually a risky process - it happens that waters are gone too early or placenta started to dettach or the baby cant breath. They can not say for all cases NO, you are ok, go by yourself. I cant believe it..   
This question is not only a practical for me, but also interesting акь the cultural point of view. Thank you all again for giving your opinion!

To be fair, they did state when the search results came back - but before you get more details on specific times - that the surcharge has gone up, and that some of the dates won't have it applied to the fares yet.    
But the point is, they don't tell you it's CHF88 until you're virtually on the point of paying. I saw that the surcharge had gone up, but given I'm only going 1000kms, I didn't think it would be more than CHF20!

			update: the plumber and the agency boss have just left.  According to them the main pipe is old and has a lot of calcium deposits and will need to be replaced. However the plumber says that it is fully cleaned now and will work until they replace the pipe.   
I won't believe that until I am able to take a shower tomorrow morning without standing in feces.   I also just ran a washing machine full of brights so that I can send pictures of bright blue washing machine water in my bathtub as proof, again.    
The agency has also only offered cleaning, which is nice, but I cleaned the poo myself last night, and for the moment they refuse any rent reduction.    
That is nice to come with the cleaner 24 hours after a cleaner was needed but I am stopping payment on June's rent and putting it on a blocked account anyway until I get a couple hundred francs off the rent for wasting three days of my life and calling into work when I really needed to work. AND i'm still missing class tonight. *grr*

Also look at local tourist places, they often give coupons, discounts and the like.  Another possiblity, your bank or if a TCS member, often have offers from time to time as well.  Once you know where to look, you will rarely ever have to pay full fare.

Thanks for letting us know. (saying that my suitcase is lime green, florescent lime green, so if anyone tried to make off with it, I'm quite sure I would see it a mile away, but still!)

			What a great response.  Thank you to everyone who has taken time out to help me.  I really appreciate it.  I received an email from the guy yesterday, and it sounds like he's been having a bit of a hard time, however hopefully everything will now get sorted.  I will, however, post the (hopefully happy) progress on this. 
Once again, thank you for your kindness, knowledge and help.    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: May 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	can anyone in lausanne help?	Posts: 10

1396	17.04.2012, 21:36	Member	Thanked 44 Times in 25 Posts	Location: Samstagern	"    Short answer: it's a cultural thing, pure and simple.  Knocking on your neighbor's door to ask him to turn it down is seen as   of a potential escalation, if you don't know him well, than leaving a note in his mailbox or calling the landlord/police.     
Seems upside down to most English speakers but it's just how it is.   Going through official channels (whether that means the landlord, the police or a letter in the mailbox) is simply  good manners, anything more direct smacks of aggression and vigilantism.  According to the Swiss way of thinking, this is what landlords and police are put on this earth for - so that the rules can be upheld and fairly applied without the need for personal confrontation.     
If you're already on friendly (and I mean friendly, not just amicable) terms with the neighbor, it's a different story. In that case the informality of   making an official complaint is appreciated.  You still don't go downstairs and knock on his door immediately though, that would be an intrusion on his privacy.  Instead, the Done Thing is to ignore the disturbance if at all possible and then mention it to him the next time you see him.  ""Last Tuesday evening between 10:30 and 11:15 PM you seemed to be watching TV at a loud volume. Do you think you could turn it down in future as the house rules state that these are supposed to be quiet hours?""  (Note that you still have to refer to the rules! This is important, you want to avoid any whiff of ""because I said so"".)   
Again, this is really difficult to grasp because it's still completely backwards for us... local custom is what it is though, and the sooner you can get to grips with it, the less mad these encounters will drive you.   
If it's any comfort, once you're friends with your neighbor you can explain it to him over coffee some day and watch him try to bend mind round the difference.

			should be an easy one - if Postfinance transferred your money although the recipient's name and the acct number did not match they have to reimburse. 
No Ombudsman needed unless you seriously want to pi** both companies off    
If you were not debited ask Orange to send you a new payment slip, compare the two entries and if the acct numbers are different - there's your proof. 
If they insist their number is correct forward them the answer you have received from Postfinance and let them deal with it.   
I know it's annoying, I am a banker and am having trouble with companies claiming nonreceipts of payments simply because my bank does not reverse payments made in error but books them as ""credits"" and I don't really check my credits when looking for a debit..

			I know the answer to my question is call them but was looking on here for info first.   
My old company used to pay my health insurance. It was shown on my payslip as a benefit and equated to roughly 200-250chf.   
Towards the end of my time there they scrapped this benefit and had a Swica consultant come in to discuss this with us so we could manage the plan going forward.    
There was little to discuss from my point of view. It's a hassle that is a legal requirement and I just wanted to continue as normal. My plan involved a pretty mediocre coverage as far as I am aware and included a money back gym fee, though that's pointless as I don't have time to go, so that's one amendment I could make.   
Anyhow, there was some issue, the woman said she would call me to gain clarity and the usual Swiss customer service entailed......no call. I attempted several times to call and resolve but was passed around with little progress and then changed jobs and forgot about it all.   
I noticed 200chf or thereabouts being debited every now and again each month as I checked my transactions at ATM. Note ATM, as credit suisse still have yet to provide online banking after nearly two years and despite numerous exhausted attempts to simply receive paper statements I have never been able to monitor my account.    
Well today I notice Swica help themselves to 355chf. How??? Surely it's illegal to increase a direct debit without notice or approval. I have never received any corespondence other than the initial welcome pack, nor have I ever claimed. I am rarely sick and would probably just fly to the UK for any health care if needed but find this pretty outrageous and expensive for the service I don't use. I appreciate one day I might have to or may find it very helpful in an unfortunate episode but I trust you get my point.   
Any ideas before I call ???

So the Coop website tells you that they stock a certain sort of ice cream and the others don't. There you are - problem solved. Go to the Coop.    
What am I missing here?   
If you really need white chocolate ice cream, and are ideologically opposed to buying from the Coop, then you have a choice. You go and look in Migros, or you do without, or you buy something else instead.

			Hmmm...I can't really get so worried about these little differences, just that if there is a cranky bus driver, I know from a family member who ran the entrance medical tests, these dudes must have very regimented psy entrance tests. It's a super stressful job, I know it does not seem like it, one sees the drivers as some nice museum guides or flight attendants who smile and serve, but to drive around in messy traffic with bad drivers around, have cranky passengers, animals and crazies, and have routine that is always the same, I do have patience with their nerves. They don't mean it and their work is not your usual customer service, it is a lot more responsibility on their shoulder.    
If you have your AG, just don't worry that you would be penalized, that's all. Whatever doors. Morges, I take the middle doors, nobody has ever said a word to me, LS I tend the back or middle, Nyon whichever, too. If you smile, people will most likely smile back. I also say bonjour, which people tend no to anymore, it's nice to say hello and bye.    
It's not the passengers with AG that drivers worry about, so cut them some slack and just use the nice public transport system. Things could be better, but it is still pretty darn good. A car is always an alternative, too.    
I also probably never ran into any crap since I watch where people usually line up. Front, I line at the front with them. It's easy to see and if I don't know I don't get on first, watch others. But I never thought about it. I wonder if they write about these things on each city public transport webs.

Anyone know if the GP does co-ordination of cancer care (regular blood tests, scans and eventually palliative care)?  Or do we go to all the specialists (medical oncologist, surgeon, haematologist) and co-ordinate ourselves?     
Any one moved here with cancer....how did you get referral to the oncologist? or did you just make an appointment and recite your medical history?   
(Not an urgent question as no treatments ongoing and cancer care is currently still being co-ordinated through UK, but do need to at least start the process here too before the inevitable emergency happens!!)

Never happened to me. I have never even prepaid even a part payment on those new cars I have bought over the decades. Always waited until the car was in the retail garage for me.   
We have to be careful that we don't slip into the habits of other countries where you have to pay when ordering - a certain way of lowering quality.

			Ah, just go live in Copenhagen for a while, especially in winter. Then the Swiss will seem soft, slow-moving and apologetic. You'll really appreciate getting an occasional ""sorry"".    
It's just cultural norms; I really don't think it reflects a greater or lesser amount of consideration for fellow humans. I've had the experience of feeling like a rude, unfriendly foreigner in some places I've visited, when the norms of friendliness or politeness were different and I just couldn't adjust quickly enough. Is everyone in Tokyo a better person than me, just because they apologise more?    
Survival in cities always requires ignoring the presence of others to some extent. (You wouldn't stop and give everyone on Oxford St a friendly greeting.)  So, the extent varies a little from place to place. Don't let it spoil your day.

I can see that in some situations, particularly if the finder has to really go out of his/her way then it might be handy to have a rough formula for wanting to give a reward (a bit like the 10% tip in restaurants), but the idea that something like this should change from being a simple act of kindness into something more akin to a kidnap/hostage negotiation, is depressing.   
Fortunately, I suspect it's not too common. I once left my wallet in a shop quite a way from where I live here. The shop assistant had looked through the wallet and contacted my bank, the medical insurance company and even my gym, trying to track down an address. The gym and bank had already called me and left messages by the time I got home. There was quite a lot of cash in the wallet but of course it was all intact when I got it back, and the shop assistant refused a reward. I later wrote to her boss to thank her, and learned that she had been given an extra day's holiday as a reward! We all ended up happy, unlike all the participants in the poor OP's tale. There, everyone ended miserable and annoyed. There is a moral in there somewhere!

			Hi,   
I know it bites to be hit with these fees, especially if you're new and don't know how the ""system"" works.   
When we moved here, there were a number of items I didn't want to send on the boat and brought over later, but I declared them on our customs forms. Later on, when i brought them into the country, I had the copy of that form and showed it to the customs guys and there was no problem.   
There are forms to fill out if you want to have more things shipped to yourself. Contact the customs office (link below has some info) and ask them what you need to do.       
The other thing is if your family sends you a package and it has a declared value of 100 dollars/francs and is marked Gift, it should be exempt from any charges. BUT bear in mind, here they will charge duties/fees on the postage costs as well. So anything above that will be tacked onto the declared value. For example, a declared value of your package contents is $100, and postage is $120, Customs will value the package at $250 and levy duties and fees accordingly.

			There was an article about that in the last PC-Go re. tricking internet users into subscribing, when it appears to be free. I usually give them fake data like ""Fred Flintstone"", and an email address, that I only use for spam purposes. I get the password sent, and they can not go after me, if they are scammers, and if they are genuine, and its just newsletters they send, i may read them, when i occasionally browse my spammail.   
But Pc-Go has a DVD, where they offer a subscription blocker, and if the site has been reported, you get warned/blocked.   
For us here in Switzerland, I would simply ignore the german scammers. I doubt they do enough homework to figure out, how it works with launching a claim through Betreibungsamt.

In the US they will tailgate and have no hesitation to undertake you. I drove to work in the UK at 90mph no fear very relaxed, NJ I drove at 50 mph on edge all the way.

There are certain quirks of the transport system here that one can hardly expect the weekend visitor to grasp (after all whilst us residents naturally take the time to plow through the rules and regulations, terms & conditions - only to inevitably still come a cropper at some time or other) it is understandable that a casual tourist is unlikely to invest hours in doing so.   
If the desire was to communicate effectively with the visitor then signs saying 'even if you have a 24 hour pass you must buy a night pass after x o'clock and this can be achieved by entering the following magic code into the ticket machine' would be far more user-friendly than fining the obviously confused. That rule in particular seems to be a nice revenue earner given that it is not communicated clearly on e.g. a platform.   
The other would be 'tickets must be purchased BEFORE boarding'. How hard would that be? Or is the short-sighted inclination to fine as a method of revenue generation and communication going to lead to further damage to Switzerland's tourism.

			Most of what has gone before is correct.    
Maybe there is a misunderstanding, the tenant is required to pay the rental until the next resignation date. If the original tenant finds someone willing and able to take over the contract & to pay the rental, he is still responsible for the payments! If the new tenant defaults and does not pay the rent during the notice period, the original tenant is still liable!    
So maybe this is what the landlord meant. It doesn't really matter if you find someone, you are still responsible for the rent being paid until the contract is correctly finished.    
To get around this problem, the old tenant must make a sub-let contract with the new tenant until the original contract finishes.

How would he have ever thought to call in advance when he did not even realize that the store would maintain that the ""contract"" was between he and the sales rep?  This is completely counterintuitive.     
That sales rep is not at home weaving the rug that the OP ordered.

			I have this theory about parents that they just don't realize how loud their kids are.  I don't even think it is bad or negligent parenting in some cases, I think they are just so used to the ""ambient noise.""  I can't even pull the bad parent card, I just think some don't even get it.   
As a non-parent, and one highly intolerant of noise and fidgeting, I do realize that sometimes I am harder on bouncy gleeful kids than other people. But at the same time, I think there is a give and take involved and a certain amount of noise is an unpleasant consequence of living in society with small humans who will one day pay our social security. Even if I have to take migraine medicine after listening to them. Anyway.   
What I can't handle are the parents who allow their kids to run. I was on a train once and I swear this toddler was about two inches from falling OUT of the train at a stop in Solothurn. It was running up the aisles as the train came to a stop, and stumbled in the little steps thing at the door. Of course some other person picked the kid up.  Personally, not even a discipline issue (e.g. do I let my kid run around or not): in a stopped train, I would be more worried my kid would get kidnapped- that would be so much more important to me than anything else going on.

So apologies if my complaint seemed aimed at Sixt- and indeed the WHICH report clearly highlighted EasyCar for the problem.   
The warning still stand though to all renting from Geneva in Winter - prices on French seem cheaper - but for good reasons. Getting caught without a vignette in CH will cost you CHF500 I believe - but getting caught in heavy snow and ice without snowtyres can cost you an awful lot more.

			Most insurances like these are just a rip off imho.  The European standard warranty is for two years (which applies in Switzerland as well despite what they may tell you) and frankly if the stuff breaks down just outside that period I'm not going to be buying from that manufacturer again.  It seems like the Swiss are trying to jump on the same bandwagon that the British have been on for years.  When we bought our freezer back in the UK in the early 90s the shop tried to sell us extended cover, but we said no thanks.  That same freezer has made two moves since, one to Switzerland and one recently to our new house, and it's still happily working keeping my food nice and cold.  It's only problem, the green indicator light on it is beginning to get a bit dim.     
If stuff is built properly you don't need these insurance scams.

It's a boring job but it really doesn't take that long to do. I hate the ""modern car"" excuse used to justify higher bills used by dealer/shop propaganda. It's just untrue. Where modern cars become more expensive and complicated is with the integrated electronics/ECU systems. They use brand and model specific software which can make tuning the fuel system a real pain.    
Just about everything mechanical on a modern car is fixed with the same procedures as an older car, except where the use of special tools is deliberately and unnecessarily required to force the owner to take the car to a dealer. Mercedes Benz and Cadillac are notorious for this.

			Im in need of advice regarding my new netbook that I bought from digitec.   
  I bought the laptop online and it arrived in my mailbox. After I opened it and started it up, I noticed imperfections in the assembly of the machine. To be more precise, one of the hinges was skewed so the lid and the body of the netbook werent in line when closed.    
  I complained right away by sending an e-mail with pictures illustrating the problem. Since a reply wasnt prompt, I called them, but all the information I could get was that if I wanted my money back, I could get the full amount, minus 150CHF (because I already started up the system), minus shipping (also at my expense). After I tried explaining again that I didnt want my money back, but just a replacement (since I paid for a new one), they told me I should wait for a reply to my e-mail.   
  After a couple of days the reply arrived, and they said I should directly contact the manufacturer (Acer). I did so, and they told me I should send them the laptop (I paid for shipping). They ignored my question about the possibility of a replacement netbook.   
  I got the fixed laptop back 10-15 days later, just to find out that the camera doesnt work.  Already at the end of my tether, I wrote an e-mail again reporting the problem, and asking again for a replacement. My question was ignored again, I was asked to send a laptop back for repair.   
  Now, the question is  is this normal? Shouldnt it be normal for them to provide me with a brand new netbook instead of fixing this one? Can I also ask for reimbursement for shipping? In the end, its not just money....I ordered this netbook at the beginning of January, and I still havent be able to use it!   
  Since I am not sure of what I can demand and what I cant, I am hoping to hear from someone with more experience.

			I personally have no problems so can't really join in - but I'd like to say that for me the choice is too wide. Why, for instance, are there so many different sorts of rice - Coop apparently has 25 sorts!   Personally I'd be happy with a choice of about a quarter of what is on offer, this would save the retailing business a lot of environmentally damaging global and local transport, space, packaging, various fix and flexible costs and help to avoid wastage. I know that the excuse is that the consumers demand everything, but it's just ridiculous. (Anyone who has ever seen the plastic-covered south of Spain will know what I'm talking about.)   
What I do miss though at my Migros is being able to buy ham and sausage and luncheon meat freshly cut and freshly baked (or at least pretending to be) bread. And a number of other things. This universal pre-packed stuff's packaging fills our world with rubbish - not to talk about our pavasacs.    
I recall going into a supermarket somewhere in California and leaving dumbfounded: my wife and myself were the only people in it, the choice was tremendous, and we left feeling as though we had just been in a cathedral.    
I can't that I was impressed with the shelf layout either.

You couldn't sell a damn thing if there wasn't a whole bunch of back and middle office staff that actually do the hard work that make your deals work. Not to mention the IT staff who write and maintain the systems that enable you to make these deals that make so much money.

			Good afternoon all,   
Well, this is a very weird situation.    
My car was totaled in September. Other driver's insurance company compensated the value very quickly and everything was fine. I assumed everything went well since I received a copy of canceled registration card.   
Then at some point in December I received 65 chf fine from Cantonal Auto Office for not returning the plates and they also threatened with police. I never saw the car after it was towed after the accident.    
I got in touch with the guy who was estimating the damage, and he told me that somehow plates were lost and it's not a big deal. He said I should pay the fine, go the auto office and report them as lost/stolen. Then I should submit the fine/invoice to the claims and it will be sorted out.   
The visit to the Car Office was very quick and pleasant one.    
Now, it seems as claim department doesn't want to cover it - since it's not part of the damages, but a ""administrative thing between you and Car Office"". I have already received 2 emails from them rejecting the claim. (after follow-up)    
I also called the adjuster and he said he can't help, since claims department rejected it.    
So it seems as I'm shafted from 2 sides now.   
Common sense tells me to just forget about it, however, I'm wondering if there's still a way to get my 65 chf.    
Lawyering up is definitely not a way to go here :-)

Each snow event we had gave us a nice amount 10 cm or more, but it was ALWAYS followed by a day of super warm temperatures and pouring rain, and that is at 1083 m. My thermo says its 10 out. That is WARM for mid January at nearly 11 at night is it not?

And there is NO comparisson on food choice.      This is a fallacy. Portugal, for example, is maybe ""less developed"" than France, Italy or Switzerland, and the food rules are so strict that is driving restaurant owners crazy - to the point of each knife has to have a specific colour depending on what is used for. But you still get to eat awesome specialities from all over the world, when you get tired of the local cuisine (as if!).   
I heard the same speech when talking about the fire department ruling of construction (as a 3rd world country, Portugal must have pretty bad and non-existant rules, right?). It's completly wrong to assume that everything in Switzerland is more regulated and restrictive than everywhere else, and that this is a good excuse for lack of variety/originality in food/art. This is nonsense! (no offense to you, just a bit touchy on the subject).

			Travel time can be a killer. When my ISDN setup stopped working one day, I got a contractor sent by Swisscom and it cost CHF 180. Although he did some tidying up of wires in the ceiling, that didn't cure the problem - it was down to bad connections on the main distribution board in the cellar. I was convinced that this was caused by whoever installed the phone for some new neighbours who had just moved in, but couldn't prove that.   
For comparison purposes, here are the prices for a local company who will do PC installations and whatnot:   
- Travel: CHF 60 / hour 
- Private customers: CHF 110.00 / hour. 
- Business customers: CHF 130.00 / hour.   
These obviously aren't approved telephone electricians, so it depends what needs doing.

			I can't speak for the rest of the insurances, but my health coverage through SWICA and my accident insurance through.... through... well, I can't remember who... have been pretty solid.   
Accident insurance is a no brainer. Sprained an ankle pretty badly while doing sport, and simply walked into Permanence at the HB, got the necessaries, and never saw the bill. All directly sent to my insurance.   
Health insurance I always have to pay first and get reimbursed, but it's never been a problem. In fact, I often get more reimbursed than I'm expecting - I simply send all the receipts in an envelope with my policy number to their office in Luzern and I'm done. A couple of days later the money's in my account. I have a pretty high bridge (2500, I think) but some of things such as the share they pay towards my contact lenses or fitness membership get reimbursed without regard to the bridge.   
You have to remember that in Switzerland a couple of thousand is not a lot of money. In the US and probably UK, where debt is king, it's hard to come up with that kind of scratch - but for a Swiss person, it's not at all unreasonable to have the money set by for this kind of thing. If it's difficult for you, then when your next round of insurance negotiation comes up, you should make a point of asking how to pay large bills. Most of the companies I've worked with are pretty reasonable and can come up with some kind of solution.

			Well, in the end we got a replacement, although the whole process took about a month (total lack of communication from the company). When we put the new one up we realized that the bike they tried to give us the first time was not only broken, but a much worse model, the worst being a mechanical system of resistance, not a magnetic one, although the ricardo auction photograph clearly shows the latter. Maybe you got one like that too? I suspect that they were not happy with the money they got out of the auction and tried to see if they could get away with delivering c**p. My advice is to stay away from this company. They sell other fitness equipment as well and also electronic bikes and scooters under the brand e-move.

			Hi Ross.Alan84,   
I can understand you don't want to go the medication route. Have a look at EFT (Tapping). I was very cynical about it, but my wife tried it for a number of things and it works for her. I also have a good friend who had been 'tapping' for years and I didn't know, and it made a big difference to him.   
Just type Gary Craig or EFT into google.   
As I say, I'm very cynical but for some strange reason against depression the results I have seen speak for themselves. Don't try to understand it, just try it and maybe it helps.

			You are making me feel guilty. Not only does Husband have a party where Significant Others are invited, they also have a children's party too. The children's party was yesterday, Father Christmas put in an appearance with little goody bags for all, there was cookie baking and other activities. Plus a little sandwich tea was provided but we all moaned because the sandwiches were so small and not very children friendly (tuna mayonnaise) whereas last year there were mini Hot Dogs, nuggets, chips, ice cream etc.    
I guess the company never realised that the real treat of this Children's Christmas party is that you didn't have to feed your children that evening as tea had been provided. Getting out of preparing an evening meal ranks way ahead of any fancy parent party in my book. We took our two to McDonalds ( ) next door where we bumped into rather a large contingent of party refugees.

For me, it really depends if the concert was more of a family/kid friendly affair. However, the general rule of courtesy really is to remove any screaming child from a concert/cinema as other people are trying to enjoy the performance.    
Also, to credit the kids here, I've seen kids sit through quietly the Tonehalle's performance - both first and second half. Obviously not too young, more around 5-6 years old but kudos to their parents as it cant be easy.

But I think that the ""scolding"" is a more culturally accepted thing here than I am used to as well.  Before I moved here I had never been told by a stranger how I should be dressing my children. Here I know that if certain items of clothing are not on my children when I leave the house, and I cross a woman over a certain age I will get a tsk tsk.  Sound like overgeneralizing?  Let's do a study together and see!      
At the same time... their culture, their country, my problem, not theirs.   
In the Swiss German case I said, ""Wiederluege"" and the person responded in English with, ""you don't need to use Swiss German, it sounds a bit ridiculous."" Understandably, that is just one person, and doesn't represent the sentiments of the entire Swiss population.  But for a ""sensitive flower"" like me, it has molded my experience.     
Somehow, it just doesn't feel like they are trying to be helpful by switching to English when I attempt German and sticking with German when I go for English. But you're right, it is all in one's perspective and maybe I just need to try to see it differently...

			Hi NicoleCZ,   
Your neighbor may not be doing as many rounds as you think!! I have noticed that people just leave their laundry in the machine and are out for the entire day and pull out the clothes when they have the time.   
We have the same problem in our building whereby people book all 3 machines for the entire day and then let the laundry sit in them from morning till night    
Our building manager says we should just pull out the clothes when they are done and run our loads....once the cycle is done.    
Good luck!! I can imagine how frustrating this must be for you.

			I know how you feel, for me things changed quite a bit once I had a circle of friends and I have to be honest when I moved to Allschwil it felt a lot better as we are close to the city but we have a lot of green around us and peace and quiet! I would really recommend creating a network of friends there are a couple of expat groups for ladies in FB and a lot of activities organized also by the EF really!   
Best wishes!

			I vaguely remember someone telling me that our water couldn't be turned off for this flat alone.  However I think there is a sneaky little screw on the underside of the back of the tap, just before it goes into the wall, which switches off the water supply just that single tap. Run your finger over the underside of the bolt and see if you can find anything.

			Basically a run flat tyre has a far thicker sidewall - this not only make for a firmer ride - but if the tyre deflates supports the car.   
The problem is that because the sidewall is so thick it is much harder to lever over the rim.   
They are a pain - and the benefits don't outweigh the costs (in my view). The only tyre I had seen be harder to remove was a VERY VERY cold Yokohama A048 - a cup tyre that I had had in storage for a couple of years.

			Just to be clear, the CA license shows when IT was issued, which is probably not the date when you were first licensed. In my case, I had just renewed my CA DL one year earlier. I happened to have my expired licenses from the last 2 renewals with me in Zurich, but the person at the counter said it was not necessary. Again, YMMV.   
To the OP, if you do not get a lenient clerk the first time, you might try coming back on another day. But I found the Strassenverkersamt to be quite easy to deal with and they sent my new license (with my CA license) the next day.   
I had a slight issue when my car needed to be registered, and again, they took care of it quickly AND in English. Great efficiency and friendly service!

			Hi and welcome.   
Consider towns just on the border of Zurich city and you'll save 20-30% on ZH rates. Examples apart from the already mentioned Adliswil (recommendable) include Wallisellen, Regensdorf, Kloten all with good S-bahn links to town and Airport. Otherwise less desirable parts of Seebach, Oerlikon, Schwamendingen, Höngg, Affoltern if you really must stay in the City but have a comparable neighbourhood Gemeinde commute.   
FYI Zürich city only has approx. 200+ vacant rentable apartments at any time.   
The last time I could rent in Oerlikon for your budget was 1999.   
Finally with the new Tram-West areas past Alstetten will become more commutable......

1) I'd certainly let the manager know that you have extensive retail experience and therefore know the signs and what to look out for in such situations.    
2) You've said it yourself already, but do be very careful not to directly accuse the shop staff of being involved.  Based on your own retail experiences, I see nothing wrong with mentioning it as a possibility, however...   
3) Be bold.  Tell them this situation cannot be allowed to go on and ask them what, if any, plans they have in place to deal with this ongoing criminality.  If there are none, I'd certainly want to know why not as the resultant escalating negative publicity for the shop won't do it any good at all in the long run.   
4) Take someone along with you.  Preferably with good German and English language skills, to act as an independent witness to the conversation.

			When I want to freeze bread, I slice it first with my awesome bread knife (it's purple and cuts through bread as if it was butter), takes about a minute to do. I never slice Zopf, by the way, as I like how it tastes when you re-crunch it after freezing, crunchy on the outside and deliciously doughy in the middle. For those of you with combi-steam ovens, use the interval steam option, it makes even Aldi bread taste fantastic!

			I hate the church bells with a vehemence. I hated them before arriving here - back in Paris, the church there used to go crazy at 10h45 at the weekend (and I used to go crazy then as well - especially if it was the bells that woke me up - dreaming up plans for blowing the damned thing up to kingdom come...).   
Church bells are something else here though. Not convinced it's something I reckon I'll get used to (let alone appreciate), but I must admit I think I notice them less now. That or I'm going deaf.   
Anyway, just wanted to add my name to the list of church bell haters. Oh and a few flats we were considering had to go immediately when I realised how close they were to the church and the racket the bells made from that distance.

			Other criterias than recognition of a diploma can play a role:   
- a waiting list (more candidates than places available) 
- number of foreigners already enrolled (UE and non-UE) 
- candidate resident/ non resident in the canton  
- previous experience with bachelors from said university 
- the marks you get 
- language 
-etc...   
so it would be good to clarify things with unige.

			We got a letter from the school not too long ago telling us to please keep our kids at home when they are sick. I count myself lucky, because I do not work outside of the home so it's no problem for my kids to stay home. But I genuinely sympathize with parents who both work and need to work out solutions when their kids are sick.   
Although I have been at home nearly 10 years, I do remember what it's like to feel the pressure to go in to work when you're feeling miserable (from co-workers or the boss). I just see it from the other side more now- from September until April, it's just one infection after the other in our house and all those sleepless nights of being up with the kids can just about kill you (especially if you are sick yourself and have to take care of other sickies!- but I guess I am not alone in that!!)

			I don't know if there is, but it is worth a check, if there are consumer protection laws that allow you to rescind an order within 24 hours.  It may apply at this price range.   
Also, I assumed you paid with cash, and not with credit card.  With a credit card, you still have leverage to contest the charge, and the hassle for the store is oftentimes not worth their time.  A credit card company might be able to exact some cooperation from the store.

			Grar. I've been all over the menus (in English, though that seems like cheating.) and have found no such option. One assumes this is because everything is already presented in the original format as far as the TV set is concerned and it's being sent wide zoom from the cable company or the broadcasters. When I get two different formats on the same channel, I'd say it's their fault.

			We had this the other day too- I thought it was very cheeky that they send out something that looks like a bill. Fortunately I understand German and registered quickly that it was not a regular bill- so it got filed in the waste paper bin. Not surprised if it caught a few exPats out. And I can't quite see what you would be covered for- damage due to electrical powercuts- if you did pay them- The only thing I can think of would be fridge/freezer contents, which is covered by household insurance anyway.

			I fully understand that one has to follow the house rules but one also has to live. Hopefully my neighbour will not continue in the manner she has started off. My landlord has actually told her to stop! Nice to have him on my side. Apparently she rings him every time something bothers her so she phoned to say I didnt remove ALL of the fluff after using the tumble drier....lets see how the story continues!! Hopefully she will just stop.

			Cultural? I wouldn't say so, if you'd ask some Spaniards they'd most probably would day it's annoying and they wouldn't do that. Still, when in Spain you'd notice a lot of people do that. Why, because people are more laid back, they don't feel the urge to point a finger at each other, thus, one can easily get away with this sort of ""rudeness"".. 
I personally would not be too quick to conclude something is ""cultural"".  
It also must be something related to one's age, and it is known that older people know better good manners. Ah, and with the increasing ""strong ego syndrome"" that becomes more and more prevalent nowadays.

			While we were away on a long week end our refrigerator cum freezer decided to quit! 
Under duress I opted for LIEBHERR CNP 4056 and paid dearly for it. 
Must say I am rather disappointed to find out:  
a) the refrigerator door is not a swinging door 
b) although it's of the same dimensions than our old one ( from a different brand name) if not slightly taller and deeper, the freezer compartment is much smaller than the old one,  at least 30% smaller; and so is the refrigerator. 
c) it's rather noisy.   
Is it still worth it to pay premium prices for big brand names considering that appliances these days don't last more than 10, 12 years?

I think the reason you think this way is the PRIMARY problem.   
You think there is one way to live and it must apply to everyone.   
Everyone can't work or do anything or everyone must work and do everything.   
Why don't you give people a choice.   
I had a few low level jobs in America as a teenage, a waiter (IHOP), worked a video store, and was a bagger and cashier at a grocery store (a bagger is someone who packs the bags for you at the store, you don't have that...)   
I knew a girl who was a Muslim. She never worked on Friday. Later I knew a mormon, he never worked on Sunday. All of this was arranged when they were hired. No one complained.    
In reality we always had people who wanted to work Sunday or Saturday evenings for extra money, and those who did not.  Some folks just wanted days off during the week for school, but were willing to work weekends.  All this can be arranged and negotiated.   
Allow the individual the option to choose to work at a given place and let the boss decide the hours, negotiate.

			I just had my first Swiss Christmas season experience and it charmed me.  Sammiclaus visited the office, with mulled wine, nuts, chocolate and oranges and candles.  He had one of those little cakes with the Santa sticker on it for each of us, and his assistant Schmutzli had a broom for smacking those who hadn't behaved well.  (I was the only one   )

			I appreciate the comments and recomendations regarding when to replace different things in a car.  Having rebuild a few engines myself, studied car mechanic and being an aircraft engineer today I do keep my car in a good conditions because I understand what the consequences can be.   
Heading back to the reason of my post, it is my responsibility to keep my car in a safe and good condition and not the dealers.  Manufacturers come up with various recommendations of how long they feel it is practical and or safe to use a certain item before it needs to be replaced.    
But the dealer has no idea if the items were replaced the week before or not.  And even so, they do not have the authority to change what they feel like and send me the bill for it.   
Its like being forced to by 2 liters of milk every time you go to COOP because the farmer recommends it.

AND at least in the Canton of Zurich, repeat offenders do not get away with financial fines. This is what judges are for. To make a difference between this and that. And to differentiate. This is what Mr Schmidt had (has) in his mind, that the judiciary is not a medieval revenge apparatus but an independent judiciary trying to help the law through in a correct and decent and adequate way. Yes Sir, this IS a challenge. A cousin of me for a few months had to act as judge in a ""Bezirksgericht"" of the Canton of Berne and found the job extremely challenging and tiring. What he told me about brought me to the conclusion that he did not believe in lengthy prison sentences but most of all in the simple point that the culprits had to face the court and had to face justice. Yes, he in a few cases was forced to be tough, not by anybody in particular but simply by existing laws.

			Bashing Greece - or any other country - is fine. I'm happy to have a good moan about Switzerland from time to time, and Greece has certainly never been exempt from my sharp tongue, even if I do love the country to bits.   
What is out of order, though, is banging on about it in the presence of someone  that country. I never say rude things about Switzerland to my Swiss friends and colleagues. I might joke a bit about their inability to come out for a pint without three weeks' notice or somesuch, but I certainly wouldn't launch into a rant about how crap the country is, or how horrible the people are (it isn't, and they're not, but I'm sure you get my point).   
The same, surely, should go for anyone else. It must be a right pain to come from a country like the United States or Israel or Serbia, which everyone and his dog think they have a right to slag off in your presence. Now the Greeks are getting it, too, and it can't be very pleasant.   
Having said that, I don't mind at all when people slag off England in front of me as a) they're usually right and b) all the moaning in the world won't make them English.    
So, yes. Let's be nice, shall we? You can't blame Crimson for the fact that quite a lot of business in Greece is done by plain envelope.

			Yes, I have rejected/opposed to the ""command to pay"" [English translation of ""Commandement de payer"" in French], I didn't know I have chosen to take a civil court appearance .. :-|   
Ok so this is a kind of a plan which will work out if still Intrum Justitia are sending letters with incorrect fax and telephone #, I will get those letters and try to check them out tomorrow if those # work.   
Well, I have had contact with cablecom many times regarding even after their confirmation of the contract cancellation. And they gave me no better response. As I had mentioned, I have already sent few letters to intrum justitia and they have replied back with the same bills stating that ""since the client has provided you all the accessories necessary for the connection, you are required to pay!""   
So the next best thing to do is to wait until I get the future registered mails from intrum justitia and reply to them...   
By the way, I called to the federal office of consumer affairs and spoke with them on the phone and they told they will call me by tomorrow to give me more info on this....

I used to find those posters fairly offending and frankly speaking very bad advertisement for Switzerland - Millions of tourists have seen them and any Swiss politician makes an idiot out of himself when he talks about tolerance and openess to an international audience now. Most European countries have some radicals putting up similar posters, but here it is the largest party... I personally think that it does backfire but unfortunately only in a hidden way.   
I don't think that protesting about them to the SBB is the right way. Telling the SVP ""I am actually conservative and agree to many of your values, for example that Switzerland should not join the EU. But I won't vote for you as I find your campaigns and speeches to stupid and populistic. If you'd only be a little more reasonable..."" might be a better approach.

 Yes you Must report the theft to the police, so you can easily justify the reason for the replacement with the immigration office. It is also for your own protection, in case someone uses it. I don't think that here in Switzerland is a problem, but I've heart enough bad stories during my previous job that i tend to be overzealous when it comes to official documents. You should also follow Swisspea advise to report it to the Coop, not only in case they dumped the walled but it is also important for them to know what is going on in their shop so they can act accordingly if they find out that this happens on a regular base.   
Good luck!

It is a classic and I've seen it and suffered for it as well.. and the reason ? Person C (and lets say it is a manager because otherwise, who cares) rarely has the time/inclination/guts to taken person A to lunch to check if there's any truth in what person B is saying and to get person A's perspective. Instead, Person C will just add it to the plus/minus knee jerk perspective they have of underlings cos, hey, isn't their time better spent 'managing upwards ?

You will be billed in  . The Tarmed (or medical tariff) sets the standard time and number of points per procedure. Then each clinic / hospital / doctor has a certain CHF value assigned to a tarmed point.   
In principle the bill details both time and tarmed points. Even if the consultation takes 2min 45 sec, if the tariff says the minimum is 10 minutes, that is what you will be charged for.

Apparently, in France if you consider the noise a nuisance, then technically it is - no matter the time of day. Have you checked with neighbors to see if anyone else feels the same way?   
You could check with the local prefecture to see if they can help work out a time schedule with this neighbor. It's not just a noise issue but also a health issue.

			I regularly work in parts of the world where dogs have rabies.  Even in the U.S. and Europe, rabies shots are expensive (up to $1000 for the series).  And, a handful of stones and an aggressive demeanor is cheap.  Some of these people come from parts of the world where dogs can and do kill you.   
So, it's beyond even an issue of taboo, which you are, of course, right about that.  But you could argue that the taboo is a result of the danger.   
My question is (and I'm by no means suggesting that you are in any way a person who would do this): why do people who have dogs think that I'm going to be as delighted about the presence of their dog as they are?  (or people with kids for that matter)  And, especially why do they think it is okay to give their dog enough leash  .  Or worse, jump on me or lick me. This happens all the time and I find it incredibly disrespectful.  Don't even get me started on dogs in restaurants or people who have little dogs in purses in places where it does not seem the case to bring a dog, i.e. doctor's offices or tight public space.

Just wondering if you know that when they changed their packages, did they get rid of the satellite version?  When I go on their website it looks like you can only get it through Swisscom or Cablecom.  And the real bummer is that I believe where we will be moving we are serviced by cablecom and you can't get the full program with them through Teleclub like you can with Swisscom (all the Bundesliga games, the Formula 1 with multiple channels)   
We had sky in Germany and I am wondering if we should just keep our subscription and bring the box over and set up the satellite (would that work).   I think we could get the basic sky plus Bundesliga for 25/month and then I think HD is 5 extra   
Anyhow, I am trying to figure out if I can live without seeing my Bundesliga and other Sky (germany) programs/channels we got used to.  Pathetic, I know, but change can hard    
Thanks for your help!

A single to Heathrow which is in zone 6, is £5.00 (£4.50 with Oyster). A daily travel card (only useable until midnight of that day) is £8 off peak & £15 anytime use.   
As a loosely comparable situation, a Zurich city Tageskarte from Zurich airport, and usable anytime for a full 24hrs is chf 12.40 full fare/6.40 half tax. 
A single fare to Zurich HB is 6.40/3.20   
It also can also take over an hour to reach central London on an often overcrowded, hot & sweaty tube train.

			A new twist on an old subject regarding our downstairs neighbours whom I wrote about in   back in days of yore.   
Not really a complaint - more a bit of commentary really but this didn't really fit elsewhere.   
The laundry room downstairs has a single washer and tumbler - and the system is a calendar on the wall where people book slots - Sundays and Bank Holidays excluded as usual.   
The same neighbour books the washing room on average for 13 hours per week - most people in the building average 3-5 hours. She also has her own washing machine in the apartment which gets used even past the 10pm watershed. The other night we were in bed at 11pm and got a perfect chorus of the spin and drain cycle - meaning Mrs nickatbasel was kept awake.   
Honestly they must never have a single item of dirty laundry in the house!   
Since the incident described in my original post they have been sweet to us, but lately it's getting a bit strange. Every few days Mrs Downstairs comes to our door with some naff piece of junk that their teenage kids have grown out to give to our 4 y.o. Mrs nickatbasel always gives a polite ""no"". I am sure it is all very nice but given their previous behaviour towards us I prefer to keep such people at arm's length.   
Oh well, it provides an incentive to find a place of our own.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			How about you just stick to the rules and avoid all this drama? Seems much simpler to me. Just because other people seem to think they are above them, doesn't mean you have to be a law-breaking lemming. There is not much space here and a lot of people in it, the rules help keep everyone sane. Or some semblance of it...   
As for not sorting out issues, well, sadly, people have this new thing where they call lawyers when you do something they don't like. I'm going before the magistrate on Wednesday because calling someone an Italian (which he is), is apparently a personal insult. So again, it's not just a Swiss thing, other cultures also think higher authority AND asking for money because their feelings are being hurt is how you do it. Hang on, wasn't that the American way?

			To all,   
The experience I share with you is acting now.   
I signed a contract with Wonnxx AG two weeks ago. We made an agreement that I could move to the new place at 9/1. And the contract mentioned that if there was other people planning to live with me, I had to notice them. At that time, I told them my wife would come in next few months. They did not say anything.   
Yesterday,8/29, I called the agency to confirm the date they will five me the key. And at the same time I ask them to give me an agreement for my wife staying. I need to send out this agreement to immigration office for visa processing. Do you know what do they say?   
1.Sir you can not move into your new place until next week because it is renovation. I can not tell you when you can move in because I am not sure. 
(So it means I have to sleep on the road for one week at least?)   
2.Sir we may not give you the agreement because the room is too small for two people.(Why you did not tell me when I sign the contract? And it is not your business to decide how big a room my wife and I want to stay)   
I was very angry yesterday. The agent said she would ask for the exception for the 2.   
Today just now she sends me an email.   
1. Sir you need to pay extra CHF 50 if your wife wants to stay.(So after I pay the CHF 50 the room will become bigger?) 
2. You need to keep quiet at room.(I could make lots of noise even if there is only me at room) 
3.You need to find a new apartment as soon as possible.(So you want me to violate the contract and pay you extra chf200?)   
I am so frustrated and annoyed. I can't imagine I will face this situation in Swiss.... Just let everyone knows the situation and avoid renting house from this agency.

			Yeah, it's not so much the heat and humidity, it's the deadly still air without a breeze for miles. If you're sweating, a breeze feels ever so nice but without A/C and without a breeze, it's just a sweltering misery. Fans will at least keep you comfortable if not cool.   
I'm not a big fan of A/C either, even having grown up in one of the parts of the US where it's A/C or die in the summertime but here where there's little relief to be found, it's a bit less tolerable. Last year, in July, it was something like 96F+ in Helsinki and Stockholm where there really isn't A/C *anywhere* and I damn near passed out in a grocery store as it must have been well over 100F in there without any circulating air.

			Wait a minute. Sublets are not illegal & you say you had a contract. So although he should have informed the agency (and you don't know if he did or didn't) nothing will come of that. He certainly won't ""get in trouble""....    
Anyway, you didn't want to fix it cuz you didn't want any ""agro"" but you think it's fine for him to go through the ""agro""?    
The two of you should have gone through the apartment together to decide and agree on any damage. Since you are no longer there he can, if he wants, decide all on his own lots of other damage and you have no proof.    
If I were you, I'd be nice to him. Apologize for not fixing the fuse, that you didn't know how, yada, yada, and of course you'll pay if he needed an electrician, and then be happy that's all he charges you for.   
Also, although it wasn't nice that he lost it, it's true, you want him to trust you but you don't trust him. Can't have it both ways.

			I guess that is relative to each person's taste. I know cinemas usually reduce the showings of films with negative customer reviews to a few days and places after 2-3 weeks of showing regularly in the cinema but my rant with Green Lantern is it is showing everywhere but just German mostly and very few EDF viewings which is unusual.    
That being said, I was shocked at the whackness I witnessed when I finally watched GL back in London last week. I really cannot believe or even begin to describe the level of crap, pretty much ruined one of my favourite super hero (I am comic head). Oh the anticipation, oh well. Anyway, Captain America redeemed it all. Saw that in UK last week and I thought it was pretty good.    
Saw Beginners with Ewan McGregor last week at riff Raff cinema and that is very good. I highly recommend it if you have not seen it and it is showing in lots of cinemas in EDF.

so i think it very reasonable to not mow your lawn between 12 and 2pm. you should be eating your lunch, whilst discussing the mornings happenings with the family.

To provide some clarity, food along with language, music, ethinicity, history can be distinctly divided into North and South India.  Sri Lanka falls within the sphere of South India.  More specifically, food from Sri Lanka is very similar to food in South India.  Even more specifically, the food in North, West, and Central Sri Lanka (Kandy + the Tamil areas) shares much with food from Kerala.   
And I should also add to the OP, that curry/kari is a Tamil word, now gone global.  So lecturing a Tamil restauranteur on its meaning was a poor choice.  Further, a word of advice, pissing of Tamil Tigers as you label, is a very poor choice.    
Regardless, talking of Indian food is a bit silly, as it's a large diverse continent.

Thanks thats really nice of you. When I say boot cover though its not the mat on the floor but the thing you pull from the back of the back seats to the boot door so people can't look in your window and see whats in the boot (kind of like a window blind but horizontal). Don't suppose you have one of those instead?    
Just be careful with these Auto Discount people. I hope you have a better experience than me.

			Peterg, I am very sorry that my family name looks like a classic spam name for you.    
It seems not a complaints corner here, but a being complained corner.    
I found this Forums while looking for some ""Rights"" information on the google, and I thought someone may help me to clarify the statement I have posted.    
I had the last teacher from June, and I didn't like it, so I asked for the refund of rest lessons only, not the refund of whole lot.    
I changed the class in Feb. because of the level, nothing else.   
You said:""The contract should state the finishing date as well as the number of lessons"" Yes, I couldn't agree with you more. But unfortunately only the start date and number of lessons were written on the contract, and they changed my start date. They calculated my first contract wrongly, and then they changed my second contract without informing me. This is truth, I don't need to make up anything.

			You need to discover when he sleeps and then disturb him back.   
I am a light sleeper and what works for me is white noise. 
I have a cube clock radio which has a usb port. 
So just load some white noise(eg. sound of a fan running) onto a 
memory stick and plug into the clock radio. 
You can download off the internet.Mine last an hour and then repeats so 
will run continuously. 
This serves to block out any other unwanted sounds.

1772	29.06.2011, 06:30	Junior Member	Thanked 16 Times in 6 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    I have problems believing we live in the same country. Last time I saw a group of ""gazelles"" coming out of the train, not only they were spitting on the floor, they dressed and acted like ladies of the night trade (but with the trademark fake Louis Vuitton bag to prove otherwise), shouted out loud, and banged their vodka bottles on every single metal rod around.          Skinny dipping is a fun thing when doing it together with boys. Because they like to show bravado daring you to do it, but once you get inside the water they refuse to remove their trunks. Pansies!        Not totally sure how to read this one. Obligatory female military service is not common on most countries of the world. Not sure what that would bring.   
  I also dont believe there are more housewives here than, say, the USA. But I come from a country where NOT being a housewife is flagged and shouted, because it means we have evolved since the dictatorship.   
  And to be honest, so much fight for women to vote, but when you look at the numbers, most women dont actually use that right that was so painfully fought for. Sometimes I do believe we do not deserve the fight our mothers/ grandmothers made for us.     
But I have to say, bleching is just plain rude. On boys or girls. Same goes for farting and screaming with no apparent reason...

1776	18.08.2010, 23:57	Junior Member	Thanked 16 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    Yes ... and no. I'm from London and the buzz (night life, bars, restaurants, cafes, shops, just walking around) is very obviously missing from here. But that's to be expected as the population of London is greater than that of Switzerland.   
However, and this is a personal thing, I like meeting new and interesting people. Admittedly not all expats fit into that category but a lot do. I've got friends in Basel from this forum, from couchsurfing.org (they tend to be a bit wacky!), the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars in Basel (don't ask), Facebook and the University. A very diverse bunch of people, most of whom have travelled and worked in many countries.   
In London I sometimes find my ""old"" friends a bit boring, especially once I'm back there after a few months of living abroad. Here, I can meet people who, for random examples, own a chain of restaurants in Belgium, are studying neuroscience, are musicians, teachers, IT consultants, a Japanese guy who'd spent 3 years cycling around the world, a chef etc etc.   
Now, all the above must exist in London but when the population of a city is 8 million people tend to clump together. In other words, I don't meet such a diverse bunch of people all in one group/place when living in London.    
So, (wow, what a long post and not even one sarcastic or witty comment about shop opening hours!) it's not being in Switzerland that I find exciting, it's working away from home. You'll also notice that all my friends are expats or travellers of one sort or another. I don't speak any German and haven't integrated. I don't feel I need to, or want to. I'm happy as it is. Of course, I like to think that even without integrating I'm adding to the richness of Basel in my own way.      That I can believe.  I usually move on after 12 to 18 months.

			It's my understanding that one can, of course, put ANYTHING in a box and mark it with gratis, but that whoever put it out there is still responsible for it.   
In other words, if I dump a broken chair on the street and no one takes it, then I have to dispose of it myself.  Of course, if no one knows who the chair beongs to I'm in the clear - but that's the same as illegally dumping stuff anywhere in the world.   
So if it were me, I'd take all the broken crap and put it back in the box.

			You should go to the Arbeitsgericht (Court of Employment). It is often joined to the Debtors Court, the Betreibungsamt.  
On Friday I was at the Arbeitsgericht in Solothurn with a friend, getting some help. They will be calling the ex-employer 
in for an interview...    
However in your Canton they have different names,

Rosenbergstrasse 22  
9000 St. Gallen   
Phone:	* 071 228 88 09                
They are usually open every weekday morning. Take your contract & all your documentation with you. The service is free.  
Take your passport & Permit. They have the power to stop a company trading if it is breaking the Swiss employment laws.

A Static problem in the back is like a Static problem in a house: it relates to bodies at rest or forces in equilibrium. The muscles on the left are underdeveloped and because of it the body had problems keeping the balance. To compensate the imbalance, it distorted the position of the column, causing an asymmetry on my shoulder blades that is creating a painful strain on the vertebra. Good news is, if I make some extra training on those muscles, I will be able to correct the problem without having to go to the knife. Anything curable without a knife makes me happy (specially when it comes with a doctor prescription to use a jaccuzzi regularly)

BTW this is how many robberies happen these days. They send in the kids through the small windows, make em grab everything and climb out. as they are minors they face nearly no punishment.....

			It is also a safety issue in my view. I think it was probably better and safer for you 3 to miss the tram rather than get caught in it.   
Just yesterday in Vevey a teacher with a bunch of students had her arm stuck in the train door and got taken with the train to the next stop, by miracle she survived.

			If we're away for just a couple of days we park at the airport. Otherwise we take either the Glatttalbahn (Tram No. 10) directly from the the main station to the airport (37 mins) or the train from Zurich main station (approx. 15 mins) - cheap and cheerful! 
If the weather's terrible, a taxi (around Fr. 75.00) is still cheaper than parking.

			The stretch of lake near us is a disgrace the evening after a nice sunny day, with a liberal scattering of food papers, disposable barbecues, beer cans and even discarded nappies.    
However the next morning, usually when I am on my running circuit around 6.30, it's nearly all cleared away thanks to a fleet of ride-on vacuum cleaners, and chaps with bin bags and grabbers.   
A couple of years ago a load of bins were installed in the area but it didn't do any good.

Concerning talking about religion: Religion is considered a private thing, and people don't want to be bothered with others' religious views, i.e.: do not talk about religion outside church or religious classes. Any attempt to do so, especially if done by someone of your kind, will be seen as an attempt to evangelize.

			Now, I came back from the garage. Greeted my infamous servicemen who mumbled short gruetzi (at least they didn't murmur today  ).   
To cut the long story short... The steering wheel doesn't make a single squeak and no more rattling. All nice and under control. I double checked with them if they were sure that's the last time (already third time I paid them a visit). The guy assured me that it's ok now. He said if I had problem I could always come back (is that something ominous he felt it again in the air ;( ). I will drive and test it. Hopefully it is the last visit before the next service due in 2012.    
Anyway, I will let them get away this time but if it happens again I will use Carlos's suggestion and address book of Dr Herr Ing.

			1) On most buses (in zurich) the buttons relay to the closest door - press the button and it signals for the driver to open a certain door. I suspect though that it opens a gate in the circuit so that when the driver flicks the ""open door"" switch the right doors open   
2) If he was running slightly late (maybe as much as 30 or 40 seconds) he might be a little annoying for someone to wait until the doors almost close before trying to get out.

Failing that ask at your Gemeinde/Commune and/or Local Police.

			There isn't a smoker in the world who would want to be seen dead smoking from a packet that says ""amateur"" on it - trust me I'm a smoker. (and yes I'm aware of the self fullfilling irony of that last sentence)   
Secondly as far as this appealing to the teen (or even pre-teen) market is concerned then all they're doing is preaching to the converted given my experience at Zürich HB and especially Baden station bus stop. Pretty much all the teen schoolkids are at it. The biggest marketing influence in the teen market is peer pressure. It always has been and always will. A pretty packet isn't going to get anybody started - which is really the crux of ths discussion.   
Should any non smoker suddenly get the urge to buy a packet because of a pretty design you can be assured that the victim upon smoking their first cigarette will blow chunks big time and, in the absence of external pressure, will never touch a cigarette again. It's only through peer pressure (and in my case pure stupid bloody determination) that you get hooked.   
Not to mention that the current pictures on cigarette packets should prevent any sensible non smoker from even trying. The fact of the matter is that tobacco industry markets to the smoker, encouraging them to switch brands. In this day and age marketing to the non smoker, whatever age, simply doesn't work.   
If cigarettes were to be sold in plain white packets it wouldn't matter to a smoker. The only thing that would happen is that possibly the smoker wouldn't switch brands so often. As far as the peer pressure goes I doubt it would make any difference whatsoever.

They might be right.. Being from Norway, I have been brought up fully aware of the dangers of the draught.   
The rule goes as follows: 
-A breeze (outside) is healthy and good for you. 
-Airing out a room (opening only one window) is ok. 
-A draught on the other hand, meaning two or more windows open on opposite sides of the house, creating an airflow through the hous, and ""indoor breeze"" is you will, is sure to kill you off almost instantly.   
No idea why this is, but my grandmother told me so, so it must be true.

			I would like to have the shops open on sundays. Would it make me go more often and spend more money? Nope.   
The shops are open today and I don't feel the need to go since I don't have anything to buy. But I do like the option to go if I want or not. At least the choice is mine.   
I could do more with coffee places and nice terraces thought. This is a big lack in Basel (in my book) Something I see it is not missing in place like Zurich, Freibourg, Geneva....

			That's seems to be very common behaviour at our workplace as well. When I see clients or new faces in our departament, I always instictively nod (saying hello). Since it had similar effect as menitoned by OP above i.e. either it left me with friendly smile on my face or grin (made me looking silly). Soon I started adding proverbial ""Grützi!"" or ""Hoi!"" and the whole situation changed dramatically to my vantage point. Overtly friendliness might be misunderstood as notion of utter audacity, arrogance and lack of respect by some but not everyone. If blue collar workers go passed, then it is less formal, relief of easiness. But then every now and again you might stumble across a pompous buffon who wants to take over the world and then you need to bite your tongue. No particular rule there - me think.

I had to show some sort of proof that I had owned the laptop and they paid me when I showed them the training manual and a bill for a repair I had had done.   
As for household contents insurance, we went through our entire house and priced up the contents. We then got insurance to cover Xthou CHF. I even offered to provide the insurance a copy of my inventory, but was told no need.   
I guess you need to check what options you have on your insurance - if you aren't sure, then speak to an insurance broker who can fully explain it to you.

1861	30.04.2011, 22:29	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    This is true, no one has a God given right to work anywhere.  Governments first responsibility is to their citizens.   
That being said with my experience, although I got a work visa, I think that Switzerland might improve the system to make industry specific quotas.   
Some industries in Switzerland likely are at risk of ""labor dumping"" from abroad, which is what the quotas are set up to prevent, this is understandable.  That being said, blanket quotas on the entire job market makes it harder to get works in industries, like mine - IT-, where there is a shortage on only in Switzerland but the Germany, UK, etc.   It is not a benefit to the Swiss economy to make it hard for companies to hire IT people.   
This all goes to politics far more than economics.  It is just politically incorrect to be seen as a pro-foreign labor politician when the job market is not good and their is a general anti-immigrant wave going through Europe.   
I'm from the States, but I think we have a similar system to Switzerland and I don't care for that either.  I prefer Canada and Australia's system, a point system based on qualifications.  Just get that out of the way up front.       
From what I read, U.S. business is against the Canadian model, because they just want the right to choose anyone they want, not pick from a pre-established pool...I would get 75 points on that model, the cut off is 65, and I'm not ""super star"" or anything. LOL   
not sure how Swiss business would feel, but I know how the SVP would feel. As  a recruiter told me a few months ago when I was looking for work, ""Do you have any idea how MANY Indians I could get good paying jobs in Switzerland if not for this damned quota nonsense...""  That's the SVP's nightmare.  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2011	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Employment of the non-EU	Posts: 13

			The whole reason I started this thread was that many times it is expressed here that it is all but impossible to live on anything less than 80k/yr.   
I still stand firmly that it is nowhere near ""impossible"" for one or two people to live on less than that. Would it be great to live on that or more? Of course... but the tone that to live on anything less than that is crap is totally unrealistic.    
People CAN and DO ""live"" on more than that here in Switzerland all the time.   
Someone with expensive habits of course can not but spending money is not the same thing as ""living"" for everyone.

			If I may be blunt Mrs D, I think its a little premature to write this off as a bad experience (inconvenient, no doubt - I totally am with you on that one) without having contacted the buyer after you've sent the email containing your details to her, to follow up on whether the money has indeed been sent through to you - regardless of whether its payment from a third party/whether its your job or not to chase for payment. It wasnt very clear whether you've done that and gotten zero response. My 2 rappens.    
Also, as you are aware already,  a 200 CHF note isnt uncommon here. The issuing bank's ATM machine might have ran out of small notes - it has happened to me before. No one bats an eyelid when I had it  over for something less than 100CHF and they give me my change promptly.     
I empathise with the inconvenience that you've been put through, but its much more effective calling/writing to her about the payment. Good luck!   
EDIT: just seen that this member has also responded to a iPod Nano sales thread. Wondered if it was her who was the successful buyer in the end. Why not PM the seller/OP of that thread and ask?       "	null	null	null	First Bad Selling Experience on EF	null

Easy we decided, that's what hacksaws are for. That was a flight of youthful innocence. Having gone through that (and it did work in the end, but only at the price of some pretty advanced carpentry and several trips to the DIY store and several minor injuries and some broken tools) I learnt that IKEA don't just not intend you to do that, they do everything possible to make it difficult for you. So if you choose the IKEA lifestlye, be warned and select your apartment to fit IKEA furniture. Never expect the opposite to be possible.

			nickatbasel,   
I hate what happened to you and your son.  Having large breed dogs, or any size dog, run at you child, even with no malice, must be terrifying for him.  Dog owners should always have control of their animals, it's their responsibility as good owners.   
But equally I can not condone your advice to your son.  The Dogs are not at fault, the owners are.  An aggressive action could have unknown consequences when dealing with an animal.  I would hate to think your son could act upon you advice and wind up a victim of a dog attack by provoking a playful dog.   
IMO its best to teach your son not to be afraid of dogs.  And to teach him the difference between a dog who is playing and one who is aggressive.

They were excellent too, it was quality meal in CH.   
Perhaps I should have taken the hint that any town such as Zug with its Ferrari dealership in the main street was going to have restaurants out of my league.  Perhaps the Big Mac Index needs to change to the Cordon Bleu index!

			Last year we moved from Basel City to Zürich, and we had a year left on our BS-issued C-permits - you're supposed to renew every 5 years normally.   
Having moved to ZH, we duly re-registered at the local ""Kreisburo"" (district office) and stumped of SFr160 for new ZH-issued C-permits which were valid for...a year.    
And today (a year later) we stumped up another SFr160 to have our permits renewed for another 5 years. I am guessing it is too much to ask to be given 5 year C-permits on re-registering in ZH...   
No wonder taxes are low here!   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Not really a rant, more of an annoyance that I've developed about big brother and it wanting to collect information.   
So I am leaving Switzerland in a few months and recently gave up my flat. I am  now living in a flat share for 3-4 weeks. After that I need to find  another flat share for another few weeks before I finally leave. Because  of this I thought I'd use my old address for any correspondence. I have  arranged with the post office that they collect my mail for me--I  simply just turn up when I feel like it and they get my mail. I am even  ensuring that I do not move out of the city/even postcode so I am above  board with taxes etc.   
However on leaving my old flat my agency required me to give them a new  address so they could inform the kreisbüro. I also have to inform the  kreisbüro with 14 days (which I did today). As I don't have a contract  in my name I now have to get a form signed by the contract owner of the  flat share where I am to show that I haven't just used anyone's address I  guess.   
Fine but makes me think. I am not happy about this big brother actually.  I am above board but still... registration with the authorities is how  it's always been in many countries on continental Europe but the UK and  other anglo saxon countries don't have it. I can now understand why people  didn't want the ID cards in the UK--because it came with a big database  with a £2000 fine for not keeping it up to date. Having said that the UK  does have a serious CCTV camera problem.   
Just think about this next time you get a text message from Stadt  Zuerich detailing to the nearest 1 how many citizens live in the city. Scary stuff.

Security firm Websense has been tracking the attack since it started on 29  
March. The initial count of compromised sites was 28,000 sites but this has grown to encompass many times this number as the attack has rolled on.   
Websense dubbed it the Lizamoon attack because that was the name of the first domain to which victims were re-directed. The fake software is called the Windows Stability Center.   
The re-directions were carried out by what is known as an SQL injection  
attack. This succeeded because many servers keeping websites running do not filter the text being sent to them by web applications.        
The fake security software warns about non- existent viruses on victims' PCs    
By formatting the text correctly it is possible to conceal instructions in it  
that are then injected into the databases these servers are running. In this case the injection meant a particular domain appeared as a re-direction link on webpages served up to visitors.   
Early reports suggested that the attackers were hitting sites using Microsoft SQL Server 2003 and 2005 and it is thought that weaknesses in associated web application software are proving vulnerable.   
Ongoing analysis of the attack reveals that the attackers managed to inject code to display links to 21 separate domains. The exact numbers of sites hit by the attack is hard to judge but a Google search for the attackers' domains shows more than three million weblinks are displaying them.

			I have been using Switzernet.com for the last 4 years without problem. As the amount of CHF9.- is small, I usually pay CHF60.- upfront every 6 months or so.   
I would recommend Switzernet's services without reservation.   
To the OP: your problems are nothing to do with Switzernet, but, as you explain are self-inflicted. Presumably you have other services that you were unable to pay for any we can expect posts on how bad their services are too??

I am an EHO (back in the old country!) and you absolutely cannot rely on taste and smell when it comes to food safety. Food poisoning organisms may well be rife way before taste or smell is affected. The dates given tend to be there for good reason and 'use by' dates especially are not generally ""highly conservative"". Blimey, people will be vomiting all over the place if they take this advice. I agree though that the most important factor is hygiene, especially hand washing. The majority of food poisoning cases originate in the home so don't say you weren't warned.

			Recently a school colleague confided in me that she is trying to fall pregnant for the first time, at 36years of age, its a bit late. She was asking for advice, 
the first step any woman should do is to get to know her body and her cycle.  
I told her about the Base Body Temperature, and that she should take her temperature every morning in bed and chart it, after 2-3 months you should see a pattern. Her response, 'Gosh no, I dont have the time for that!!'   
No really, and that is the problem, they just dont have the time!  and then they whine about feeling like a failure, ect, ect.

Anyways the point is never send your skis or board to chain store or anywhere else where they send it to a central location.  Mostly because multiple people will be handling your stuff without any care in the world if it gets dropped or scratched.  The less hands that touch it the better.        Painters plastic sheets catches all the wax.  Plus to make it even less messy I tape a plastic bag on the tail and scrape all the wax into the bag.  All the little stuff that doesnt make it into the bag is caught by the plastic sheets .       I am on my 9th season (over 600 days) on a preimer.  LOVE IT!  Every year I look at my board and all the scuff marks and think ""I need a new board""   Then I ride it and think ""why?  It still rides like a dream""  Sure the base is half full of p-tex and even has a base weld on it but it still rides like new.  NS bombproofablitiy  
However the new rock and camber technology looks promising.  And if I try a new one then I will buy a new one.  I am thinking about getting either an SL or a Heritage.  The SL destroys EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING.  Park, powder, trees, back country, high speed carving, cutting through the rough crap, it does it all.  The heritage leans a bit more on the freeride scale but is still able to throw down in the park.   If I had the money I would get the SL and the Summit split board.   But for now I think my Preimer should last another season or two......or three or four......

			It is true, I have never seen people try to haggle so much in CH as in other places it can be ridiculous! 
I had a spot on the fleamarket here in Basel and I was selling some clothes which included a dress with the tags still on for 50 euro, a woman comes and asks me how much do I want, I say 15 CHF, she says I will give you 2...I turned around and continued chatting with my friends...like, really?   This is only one example. 
Anyways afterwards comes another woman this one elderly, asks how much I said 15 and she said I think that is fair and gave me the money.  "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2010	Groaned at 85 Times in 43 Posts	Swiss and purchasing habits	Posts: 371

			I would make them very aware that than any delays on their part would be heavily penalised by you. Make sure you pay with a Credit Card, this way it's not yolu directly who attacks but the credit card company    
If you have paid withg a credit card, it maybe possible to cancel due to ""unforseen circumstances"" by asking the Credit card to do chargeback on your card. Best bet would be phone them and see.

			Hum - sounds like a genuine mistake by the hairdresser, who then apologised when the customer clearly wasn't happy (albeit under duress).   
I'd say common sense here is that the salon is at their own discretion to offer a discount or not in the interest of goodwill / customer service - clearly they decided not to.   
Personally I'd chalk this up to ""everyone makes mistakes"" and ""this place has crappy service if things don't go 100%"" and leave it at that - not sure that getting your police chief business contact involved over a petty case like this is going to reflect too well on how you deal with minor issues that occur in your line of business.   
And for the record, I really really dislike the suggestion of ""What?  They made a mistake?  Wow, now you can sue them for 5000 CHF...!""  Not everything in life has to have blame and a price tag apportioned to it.

			send them registered letter, written in german (since you are in the german part). If you write the letter in english, it is not legally binding in Switzerland and they can always claim they did not understand what you wrote them. They have x number of days to respond (10 days comes to mind, but not 100% sure on this). If they do not respond within this period, you can take further action (legal, complaint, etc). Save the receipt. You may need it later.    
If they do not respond to the registered letter, they are clearly ignoring you and you have to persue it further yourself.    
If you do not have legal insurance, get it. It can be useful for other things. It costs between chf 250-300 per year.    
sales != service, in CH. Customer is not the King, in CH. The furniture is bought and paid for. You found the problem a day after. What is to stop them from saying you did not cause the damage after it was delivered and signed off?    
I am not saying that you did, but that may be one way they are looking at it.    
Often stores outsource delivery and installation to a 3rd party and perhaps there is a mix-up or the store is getting a different story from the delivery people.    
I would suggest (again) you send them a registered letter, and also discuss the problem with someone local (someone who has been here a while and gone through the ropes quite a bit) and get their opinion too.    
Hopefully you have not been ""Switzerland'ed"".    
Good luck.

			I had a very similar experience with UBS. They lost the copy they made of my passport and two months after my arrival gave me a call on a Friday that they need to make a new one. I went there directly and they copied the passport and Ausländerausweis. However, my card was locked on the Saturday. I was sitting without cash in a (back then) foreign country. I went there the first thing on the following Monday morning and the lady told me that this was ""absolutely correct"" to do so... I explained her several times that they already had the new copy and if they were not able to stop the process to lock my card on Friday anymore, they should have told me so when I visited their bank and let me withdraw some money. After I demanded an apology for three times, she put some UBS branded writing set in my hand and walked away without a word. Aparently, a low earning idiot like me was not worth it... today I am earning four times the salary from back then - and I do not bank with them anymore.

			For me it's not about how early or late lunch is, but about avoiding it all together. For the vast majority of my working life in England lunch was simply not an option. My work required me to be in places at times where people were not actually working. That meant lunchtimes and evenings were where I could get things done. Simple I hear you say, just take lunch earlier or later. Well it didn't really work like that because the ""normal working times"" were where I had to do the ""hand holding"" part of my work.   
To cut a long story short I gave up with lunch when I finally realised how much money I was wasting on sandwiches with just one bite out of them before the phone rang again and I was off to another ""emergency"". As a result my body got into a rhythm which I've found difficult to break. I really do not feel hungry until around 8pm of a day. If I actually do force lunch down me, then I end up so tired I might as well not bother going back into work for the afternoon.   
My Swiss colleagues think I'm weird. I think I'm weird, and probably you lot do as well.

			Stupid country. The trams rattle around from around 5am. The Swissies all slam their car doors and drive around like loonies at 6am. At 7am the builders start work and the factories and shops start their deliveries.   
Then they all fall into a coma at 7pm ready for the 5am start.   
I'll never get used to it, but luckily living in Basel people are flexible with the rules and there isn't a lot of ""shhh""ing going on.

			Last April bought a Kenwood breadmaker from Zihlmann in Basel - it came with a 2 year guarantee. Just before Xmas, the bread pan developed a fault - the spindle assembly has come loose so it just falls out. This is in spite of correct use / washing according to manufacturers instructions.   
We've moved to ZH in between times so emailed Zihlmann to report the fault and to ask about the cheapest way to get the problem resolved (i.e. get a new bread pan). Was told to contact the manufacturer - Kenwood CH.   
Emailed Kenwood CH - they first tried to get me to buy a new bread pan (cost SFr37 + SFr12 postage). I reminded them that the guarantee is still in force (I did tell them this in my first email). Now they want me to send the broken tin back so they can hum and har over whether the defect is my fault or theirs.   
Have just mailed them back to say that I don't really want to ca. SFr10 to post the broken part when a new one costs SFr37 - and I am of course happy to send a photograph.   
I've just been looking on beobachter.ch for info about Swiss consumer law in such circumstances as I would like to quote this at them if possible - so far drawn a blank. I'd be grateful if anyone has a link to such a site of page.

			Ok me being totally dumb in this matter, please allow me to ask something;   
Why should the airlines companies give money back to their customers for a natural disaster or weather condition out of their control? I find it great if they do, but I would understand if they don't.   
If your house is destroyed from a natural disaster, insurances are not covering what it calls  (in french).    
So is it under the airlines responsability to refund people who had been touch by cancellations due to natural circonstances?   
How does it work?

I have sent out items to forum members, I think some were newbies, and I sent some items without payment in advance, and I have always been paid. Status means nothing to me. I trusted people to pay. Why shouldn't I? I think some of the recipients were surprised that I would take the risk of sending something without payment. I have never been let down, not once. I am sorry you have not been paid, but the person's status is irrelevant.    
Are you forgetting that you have a paper trail, a name and address? Transactions between members are private dealings and unfortunately there is nothing a moderator can do. I think you can name and shame here as long as you publish all the PMs (leaving out the name and address) and prove that there was a transaction. I would do it.   I can't see why you would get banned. If you have tried everything else, without success, go for it.    
In the real world, what you can do, is send a registered letter with a copy of the post office receipt and the correspondence regarding the transaction. Give them 7 days to pay up or else you will take further measures. It will cost you but you will get that back plus what they owe you. The debtor will have this on their credit history and that is going to make their life a misery.

2002	27.12.2010, 16:41	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	Location: Hunenberg	"    Well actually my comment came after the airline offered me   for a luggage worth 250chf 2-3 years ago.   
Also, even a few months earlier than today, I had to pay a luggage staff for an official report on how much costs similar item.  He created a report showing the market price for a new one is 250chf. That report costs already 15chf something (maybe more I can not remember accurately).   
That is simply because they reduce the official price in the report with years.   
Now you will tell me how fair is that, also knowing that this is the airline legal duty to be responsable for your luggage until delivery.   
My luggage was completely damaged and had to be replaced.   
Can you legally complain/defend about the low price estimation they make? Yes with accepting to lose extremely ridiculous amount of time, going to small claim court, etc...     
They have the power to make you give up and they certainly are using it.   
Ho and also when do they ask you for the luggage ""AGE""? At the airport, when you just landed, find your completely destroyed luggage, and had to queue for another half an hour for creating the damage report.   
At that time tell me if you accurately remember the age of your luggage. I said randomly 2-3 years, the guy wrote 3 years, I signed, and hop I screwed myself.     
In addition, let me remember that they are BIG BUSINESS and they have insurances to protect them for such situation. So do they really have to crook customers like that?      
So if you wonder why they are so reticent to pay out, I do not.     
PS: The value/age of your item is also double checked by a professional (the luggage shop assistant) who will create the damage report.  And that one you are not cheating him and you have to pay him.

Pity, because he is a good looking guy and would be even better looking with a good haircut.  But I guess it is his hair and he can have it as he likes!!  Sometimes he wears it in a ponytail which is ok.

			For me it's:   
Mirror-Signal-Blindspot check-Manoeuvre   
I check the mirror and won't signal if there's something coming up first but if it's clear, I signal my intention to pull out. Next, I quickly look over my shoulder to check and then if it's clear, I  pull-out.   
I had a friend who never indicated - he said he didn't need to as he knew where he was going.    
I think people tend to forget that indicating is to signal your intentions to other road users and should be started before the manoeuvre.

So, in the end, it is better to have this ""I will always do things way the way they are traditionally done here. Minus the tiny changes, but don't let yourself be concerned with those""   Everything works here if one smiles and is polite. They can be grumpy all they want, but smile and superpositive attitude is disarming. And pretendind to be clumsy, too. Who wants to have a lady hanging above, with a child tripping over and falling, they always let you sit so you don't fall on them and step on feet, especially now in muddy snowy yucky boots. And they get a nice big Merci for their help. I think people should always let older and people in need sit, even with kids. But mostly, those people are so nice, they would be the ones to start thinking about others first. Since they know how much empathy is needed.

2017	null	null	null	null	"    - let's look at some aspects :   
*  legislation :  The revised legislation no longer making it necessary for pedestrians to show their intention to cross the road in reality is a disadvantage for elderly and for handicapped people as well as children 
*  ""the Swiss ignore pedestrian crossings"" ?  No, not really. Not even those who caused the accidents mentioned. 
*  Fashion:   unfortunately, winter clothes against all logic tend to be dark. I just have to look at me in the mirror from the back. I wear a black leather jacket and have dark hair, which means that the upper half of me in bad weather is invisible for the cardrivers. It so is fairly important that my jeans are not too dark and that my shoes are at least partially in light colours be that white or yellow or orange.  
* putting the foot onto the gas pedal ....  ?   I think that this claim simply is rubbish. 
*  bad planning and not very intelligent signalling of zebra-crossings ?  yes, very often these zebra-crossings may be very useful for the pedestrians, but a car-driver may after the second one think to be through them and reduce attention. There are signs for those zebra-crossings anyway. Why not add to those signs the number of those coming within 100 meters like  ""3x"" ""4x"".  There would not be more signals. And then there might be additional things to be done like fluorescent markings being placed on upright things standing right in front of the zebra-crossings.  Many accidents happen in bad light in the dusk of the evening and often at bus-stations with many things obscuring the sight of the drivers 
* sight contact*  ?   To me still very important. As pedestrian you profit from getting into sight contact with approaching drivers. Waving them making it clear what you intend, and thanking them for allowing you through (even if they never really did do so ! ) will help you in every way. And very much the same applies to drivers. I a year ago was on board a car driven by a nephew of some 20 years. It was very warm, and so I put down the window on my side, and supported him with very clear hand signs. We spoke about all moves and the pedestrians well understood what we were doing !   ........................  What I have seen, for many decades, in the Mediterranean and in the USA is that there, the handsigns in actual practice play a far greater role than in inhibited ""north-of-the-Alps-Europe""

The model I showed is inserted between the door and the door frame then it is armed. When the door opens the clip opens and the contact is broken. The alarm then sounds. Another popular model is like a door wedge/stop. When the door opens the wedge on the floor is pressed to make the contact.   
These alarms are loud enough to wake you up and scare the person off.

			I was in a store (SATURN) last weekend where there was a Swisscom TV  demo set up. I already have Swisscom TV, but I noticed they were showing  a channel that I didn't have (ESPN America), so I asked the guy and he  said they have a new HD channel package for 9 CHF per month for 9  channels and this was one of them. He then showed me how I can  immediately subscribe by pushing some menu buttons.   
Exctied by this, I ran home, sat on my couch and followed the menu  sequence, only to become dissapointed when this new HD package wasn't in  the list of options    Since it was new, I thought maybe it just somehow wasn't in my menu  yet, or maybe it wasn't available in my area, or whatever. So I called  Swisscom, they said it was available, but that my connection speed was  16Mbps and that a 20Mbps connection speed minimum was required. I said,  oh ok, it's probably the wires in my building, and just forget it since  I'm moving out of this apartment soon anyway, no big deal. Then the Swisscom guy started to insist they send someone to my  apartment to troubleshoot (huh?  ). Since he said it was free, and seemed pretty adimant, so I agreed.    
The following day the Swisscom technician shows up and is there for 2  hours (!!). He replaced the modem, then the socket, then the phone  wouldn't work anymore, then an hour later he finally got the phone to  work again   After all was said and done, he said he couldn't find the problem, but that it was probably the wiring in the building (doh!  ). I said we are moving soon, and he said then it didn't make sense to replace the wiring in the building (gee, ya think?  ).      I have no hard proof, since I didn't see him touch them (he was there 2  hours, I didn't watch him every second), but I do know they were  working before he came, and not after he left    
So what is my ""Complaint""? Well, on the one hand, I like Swisscom and  I'm glad they have a customer service team that is ready to go at the  drop of a hat....but on the other hand, why do they insist on wasting my  and their time when it's not needed and unecessary? ...and breaking my  xmas lights, well, i'm still baffled by that one. The lights were kind  of old anyway, but still... Hmm, maybe I should request another Swisscom  tech to come out and repair them?

There are some that are solely interested in extracting every dollar they can out of your insurance.

			I wasn't really expecting anything to come of the complaint or get a refund, I was just mightily annoyed by it. As I told the poor woman who answered the phone, the fact that I have my parcel is not the point. The point is that I paid them to do a job and they not only did it incompletely, but lied about it as well. They insist that they have a signature   Actually, if they'd just left it in my letterbox, then I'd still be annoyed (and would have complained simply because it was something expensive) but would kind of understand, after all why should the delivery person know how much it costs. What really gets me is that someone falsified a signature.    
I did look on the online tracking thing and it just says signed for. And I did tell the company that I bought it from that the firm they chose for their delivery contract is incompetent and they should look into it. Anyway, rant over, can't complain to the other half as it's his Xmas pressie!

			Gidday bud,   
I've been  working ing Switzerland for the last 8 years and I can tell you that it is not at all like New Zealand.  It depends ofcourse on whether or not that you are working for an International, (english speaking), company or a german speaking company.  The thing with the german culture is that they have their heirachy, (bringing cause to Du und Sie).  My company is german, and I have never once heard from my boss that I have contributed good ideas or done well in my job although I am constantly one of the highest achievers!  I always had to go and confront my boss about any pay rises aswell.  For me, it doesn't matter if you are an apprentice or a boss, you need to have mutual respect for one another.  But don't expect them to be all buddie buddie, lets have a joke etc together with you, they are far too formal for that.  Sorry mate, it's just the culture.  I still haven't acclimatised after so long and always love it when I challlenge my boss and he sh1ts his brain out of his bum cause he doesn't know what just hit him!!!! Take it easy dude.

When you apply for other flats I'm sure you'll find it in your advantage not having kids.      Haven't really heard of such comments.         I have a dog too, but to be fair, this would give you less options in every country.      Okay, when I found the apartment I wanted to live in, the hauswart said something like ""I just don't want any Turks""   My face was literally like this:   cause it felt so wrong and I wanted to say something - but having a dog, being a foreigner and have a chance to get the nice flat, I kept my mouth shut. It's the first time I have taking it this extremely in advantage that I am a white girl with blonde hair. Didn't feel good about it though.

			Sorry to hear you are in this dilemna but didn't you realized that you were not getting taxed? Was you pay being deducted for other other stuff, ie unemployment, pension and it was only the income tax that was not taken out?  Nevertheless, it sucks that you have to pay a year's worth of tax in your next paycheck(s).   
Its correct that you need to pay your taxes, usually at source (straight from your paycheck) if you are on a L or B permit.  Why don't you speak to your employer to understand  how much they are need to take out for taxes and see if you can come up with a plan that does not require you to go without a paycheck. I am not sure if they have that option but its best to speak to them about it.   
btw - what do you mean you rely on the money to get out of the country...do you mean Switzerland?  and why would getting a bill for your taxes be an advantage? (btw -getting your taxes in a bill does not make it easier not to pay, versus it being taken from your paycheck)

			Sorry for your troubles, hope you can resolve it.   
For real estate issues, these are very local issues and you really need someone local who is involved in the swiss market, not a british person living in France.  If in St. Cergue, there are many swiss real estate lawyers in Nyon who speak english, so would recommend you look there.

A) of customs authorities who sit on packages for minimal reasons (had to investigate such stuff several times) 
B) the airlines carrying the postal bags (all grey) and possibly sending them to some wrong places (Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Mumbai come to my mind !).  The stuff will turn up again within 6 years for sure

			Hi, 
it says it's for ""bestehende Kabelfernsehkunden"", ie existing customers.    
If I look at the prices and compare to my existing contract, they're more expensive (maybe more channels are included or the box is better...), so by signing up for a new contract, I would be paying more after the 12 months with discount and therefore it makes sense that they would be offering something like that for existing customers with different contracts. If you already have a ""Classic"" or ""Confort"" contract, I doubt you can sign up for it again.   
That you get two different answers when contacting Cablecom, doesn't surprise me.Their customer service desk must be the worst one on this side of the Mississippi.....I had daily contact with them for a a couple of weeks in order to get my internet connection up and running after moving. Now it works, but not as well as before....but I guess that's a different topic.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2008	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Cablecom offer	Posts: 161

There is no national minimum wage here. The unions have negotiated minimum salaries for certain sectors.    
The minimum payment for a single person on Social Security is about CHF 1'750 tax free (including: Rent, food, health insurance, transport, entertainment). In Bern a family of 3 (Single parent plus 2 older school children) is calculated to need a minimum of CHF 5'600 to live on (including: Rent, food, health insurance, clothing, transport, entertainment). Many jobs in Switzerland pay less than this, e.g. supermarket worker, elevator mechanic, so now you might begin to understand how well off you are.    
To read that the ex- boss of UBS, Marcel Ospel, moved from Basel to Wollerau to save 3.5 million on the tax bill of his CHF 26 million salary   makes me want to bring out the guillotine again.

			This has been discussed in the forum before, but...   
When I first moved here from the States, I was immensely frustrated with the lack of choice. I guess over the past seven years, I've just become quite used to going to Coop for this, Migros for that, occasionally Denner for something else and since I'm in Basel and have a car, the luxury of going to France and Germany for everything else as and when needed/wanted.    
When I go back to the States and end up in a grocery store there, I am overwhelmed. It feels like sensory overload and I do what I can to get the heck out of there quickly. Oddly enough, though, the large Tesco near where my husband is living in London doesn't quite do my head in like the American massive stores.

			Maybe it has nothing to do with where you're from and where you live ? Maybe it's just you didn't fit in to that particular spot and that something better is waiting for you ? I believe this happens to all of us. What is difficult is that long strech through the desert until you reach the shore. Then one day it does happen, and you may be completely amazed to find something where you are really well.   
Everybody falls, it's how we deal with the obstacle that made us trip up, that makes the difference.

			A couple of weeks ago, I came across some promotion for what seemed to be really good event, Kids City in Baden. Pony rides, face-painting, bouncy castle, the city of Baden transformed into a world for kids. Given the importance that the swiss place on children I thought this would be a good event. 
In reality and in hindsight, this would have been one of the most p**s poor festivals that I have ever seen in my life. 
A memo to the organisers, a tiny bouncy room outside Mcdonlads, a tired looking carousel outside Manors and face painting 2 stories up in the co-op toy section makes for a festival not. And whoever thought to put the pony rides next to the street that has buses every two minutes, what were you thinking  .  
The whole thing lacked focus, atmosphere and seemed devoid of anything that I would describe as fun and to me seemed more like a cynical exercise in getting a few more people through the doors of the sponsers.   
I dont know, maybe I expected too much. Did any one else go to this shambles of an event, which could have, should have been so much more.

Tell that to the cops who charged me close to 1000 CHF in fines and admin fees for causing an accident.   
If you cause enough of an accident and enough disruption - and an accident in a tunnel would count as this - I'd expect to be fined.   
Heck, you get fined for running out of petrol in a tunnel...      ...or - in my case and also an offence in the UK - driving without due care and attention.   
In the UK, it is worth at least 4 points on your licence, or more if the Judge doesn't like you.

			Hang in there OP. I doubt this is about your nationality but its because you are a foreigner.    
We went through more apartment applications than I can remember when we first got here. I cant remember the number of applications we've made because I've simply blocked it out of my mind. Post traumatic stress syndrome, me thinks.    
But I remember that it was not just foreigners but Swiss people  (yes I had a chat with some of them) that were going for apartment viewings and bringing along documents as well. Letter from the Germinde showing that they are debt free, references from previous landlords etc. I've likened finding a house here to applying for a job. You just have to find a way to stand out amongst the sea of applications.    
I was totally frustrated and even thought of throwing in the towel loads of times (oh the number of times I've given my poor husband grief) as I remember spending almost 2 months every day looking at websites for new apartments as well as visiting them. On the other hand, my husband's colleagues who are Asians like us, and also new to the country, took only 2-3 applications before they found housing outside Zurich. It might be the high demand for housing here and not your nationality. Sure I had people stare at me on trams like I've just stepped out of a spaceship but I usually smile and they either smile back or look away embarassed. It doesnt bother me because I have more important fish to fry.   
Its easy to fall into the ""Is-it-because-I-am-xx-thats-why-i-am-treated-this-way"" mindset  being in a new country, but I find that going into that  will only make you miserable and resentful of your surroundings and that chip might prevent you from truly making a life that might otherwise turn out to be wonderful.    
Good luck and I really hope you find an apartment soon.   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Nov 2008	Groaned at 37 Times in 21 Posts	just a random whine about discrimination	Posts: 425

			I recently was lucky enough to start a new job. It took me a long time to get an offer but finally got there - so keep going if anyone is struggling.   
But what amusing and is relevant to this thread is that my boss was saying that he had to have a potential candidate for the role I interviewed for and then put forward his case to HR and department heads before he was given permission for the extra head count on his staff.   
So in effect I was interviewing for a role that didn't exist yet but wouldn't exist without me applying......    
I was applying for a non existent job....... doesn't seem to make sense to me, but never been a big fan of HR departments. Very pleased to have been given the role which was created for me though!

In Britain I believe an article has to be on sale previously for 6 weeks at the higher price, before a special offer can refer to it. At the end of the day, the customer has to beware. Today I did some shopping at the Migros in Lörrach! Several items were much cheaper there.

I was also trying on a pair of trousers last week when the sales lady came at me with some pins for alternations. Like I was going to pay for altering the already expensive trousers - they should fit!!   What's worse is when they want to come and ask you how it fits when you are in your nickers. Perfect timing. Now I just tell them to please wait, then I get the feeling they suspect I am steeling stuff.

			Perhaps the answer given was a bit rude (mostly because I think the guy didn't have manners, but most likely he didn't do it on purpose) but I don't find this to be that strange if understood properly. First of all, a shop owner has the right to decide what kind of customers does he want to address their products to. In this case they might not want to have english-speaking customers because their staff might not be ready to deal in English or because it would be too complicated to prepare everything in English.   
On the other side I'm worried by reading some of the replies given to this thread: email bombings, coupons given in front of the shops, other forms of boycotting etc..   
If I have a shop and decide to not deal with English-speaking customers it's my right to do so and to decide to which public should my products be offered to. It is not discrimination if I don't want to adapt to a foreign language. It might also not be convenient for them to do the effort to translate a product offering in English if the customer base does not justify the effort put in the first place.   
Perhaps the deli manager was a bit rude, but the cultural arrogance shown in this (like in many others) thread I find it to be much worse.

			After over 20 years working with both, I'd say it's a matter of approach rather than outcome!   
- On US lead projects it all action first, then it falls over, followed by some thinking followed by another crash, followed by a lot of thinking leading eventually to getting 'something' in production   
- On European lead projects there is endless thinking, followed by something which falls over followed by a bit more thinking leading eventually to getting 'something' in production   
In both cases it's followed by 12 or 18 months of hot fixes, rewriting (sorry I should say refactoring) eventually leading to something fairly stable    
The longer I'm in this industry the more impressed I am at finding an application that actually does what it is supposed to do and has been up and running for a few years with a major crash    
Good luck with that,   
Jim.

			Just a shot in the dark here. You said you're not bad looking but mentioned lack of flirts, conversations and eye contact.  I would venture that your lack of pull power could be due to poor clothing choice, including shoes.     
Take a look at your wardrobe compared to the locals that pull. Do you look scruffy or like you might work as a janitor?  Sharpen up!  Do you look like a banker or the father of a girl you're after?  Take it down a notch to elegant casual.     
I only say this because I notice a dramatic difference in how I am received when I am dressed differently.  When I bike from work, I dress down (a suit doesn't fit nicely in a bike bag) = few eyes, few flirts.  When I'm on the train I dress a bit more elegantly, but still cool for the 30s = all eyes + flirts.     
And shoes?  Major.  A simple, elegant, age-appropriate wardrobe can work wonders.   
Just a thought.

			I have to agree with the ""no headsets either"" idea, we did attention tests and working memory tests with people at the university and it's shocking how much ""another thing on top of the task in hand"" will influence your performance. Once I walked past a guy in a soft-top car who was clearly having a massive fight with someone over the phone. Sure, he was using his headset but I think his attention was pretty much zero for the road around him.    
The one possible exception I could see is using a headset on a long, more or less straight road with not a lot of traffic, such as a motorway outside of rush hour. But certainly not in the city with people running into the road, cyclists randomly ignoring red lights and generally idiots abound. If I call someone and hear they are in the car, I'll cut the conversation short and say I'll call back later.

I was out as usual on Friday and this time the night out stretched all the way through to Saturday afternoon.  Congrats to the Team for Powering Through as we call it.  It was the usual mish-mash of our favourite bars, favourite drinks, favourite chat / arguments, favourite tuunes stuck on the internet dukebox etc.     And all this before trying to strut your stuff at 10am in the morning with no sleep and lots of beer to Shakiras Waka Waka in your best African Stylee whilst being seriously seen off by your friend M from Cameroon (as he can do it properly). PS Thanks C and yes! Lets jump on a train to Amsterdam to carry on partying! was a good idea but I am glad we left it to another weekend.     As per the norm our group is a random mixture of couples, singles, races, sexuality, creeds, differing football supporters / sports fanatics etc .  We do all the usual stuff:  Everyone agrees who they are having around for dinner next, who is meeting for lunch / shopping trips, stroller pushes in the park, where are we getting ratted next whilst watching the sport and singles where are they going on the pull.....  All this is fine....     So what is my problem?      Trouble is I am just so pissed off with the reaction of people outside of our group of friends when (in this particular case) one of the single girls had just pulled (in this case another girl or a couple are just being affectionate).  The rest of us have got (or tried to get) used to the voyeuristic reaction of people both men and women but what is just out of order is the blatant invasion of our circle of friends by some random drunk male openly harassing the girls.  I had to move on the same drunk prat 5 times on Friday night / Saturday morning away from them.  Thankfully me at near 2 meters and he at almost 30+ cm less it was not a problem...     If I was out and got the same level of harassment / comments on a night out I would be chinning F§$kers left, right &amp; center....  Thankfully (like odd inappropriate comments by border guards / police) it does not happen all of the time and I suppose we just had the wrong crowd in our usual hang out....     I am sure a few fellow EF Members have been in a similar situation when you had to defend your friends on a night out?

			It's all a silly game.  The last thing appraisals are used for is employee development.  They're either used to justify moving someone they like up or someone they don't like out.   
I'm afraid that's the end of the discussion for me though.  I'm well aware of the hazards of posting about one's work life, even if I'm using a pseudonym and I haven't mentioned which company it is.  Frankly though, most large companies are pretty much the same when it comes to this kind of thing.

			I have a very old UK Orange SIM from when they used to match other companies' price plans; must be around 10 years old.  It costs nothing per month, never expires, free voicemail and is post-pay.  I never use it apart from texting ""241"" and at central London cinema prices (around £7 a ticket) it's a worthwhile saving!

There is a reason behind the Ups rule.. in the passed they left expensive parcels such as computers with the neighbor.. ( happened on my shift)    
Long story short , Person A living beside person B ,they fell out some months ago as he damaged his borrowed lawnmower, and now refuses to pay for it.   
Mister A orders a Pc online, worth 2000 chf, but is not home to receive it. 
Ups driver thinks ahead and says "" i don't want to be here again with this heavy parcel tomorrow, ill drop it off with the neighbors ""   
Mister B happily accepts the computer but ""forgets"" to inform Mister A ,whom he fell out with .   
Mister A rings Ups, gives out, gets the proof of delivery and notices the name of B on the paper..   Ups done their job, its delivered and signed for.   
This was brought to court, Ups had to pay a sum as settlement, the pc was returned to the correct owner after court came in between.   
The parcel needs to be delivered to the address and signed for by a member that lives there. ( for private deliveries only, not companies), this is why a delivery guy can ask you for proof ( bill or something in your name at the address ) to prove that you actually live there.   
I actually, last week , couldn't sign for a parcel on my girlfriends name  because well..i was not her  ,Moobs or not, i couldn't fool the guy , she had to go and collect it.    
So just to be sure the goods don't come in to wrong hands, they can not deliver next door, as to many issues cropped up doing that before.

			Here's an idea: 
..... glue a few ""1 inch nails"" upside down on the line.   
The cost of a few new tires should swing his wheels in a bit tighter.       
Of course this has other more serious repurcussions as to why you shouldn't do this...... but I feel your pain with having to deal with people who can't park (it's really not that hard).   
Just talk to the guy (or girl). Especially if it's the same person, I'm sure it won't be a problem.... however, if it continues (see my initial suggestion (super glue should be a more than ample adhesive)).

			I'm thinking that attempting to compare a ""normal"" airline with an ""economy"" one is not altogether correct.   
The economy ones seem to have a lot less invested costs within their own business, that's exactly why they can ""pass along the savings"" to their customers.   
Meanwhile, the normal airlines still have quite a few ""additional"" bills they need to pay for the (standard) services (""additional"" to what is provided by economy class airlines) which they have to pay for as if provided on flights no matter of the actual flight status.    
While I certainly understand the desire (and in many cases actual need) for the refund asap as unexpected expenses were incurred for customers, for a normal airline to come up with a direct refund probably takes some internal financial maneuvering on their part.   
I know, I know... a lot of folks think ""well, that's their problem, not mine"" but I beg to differ. IF you do not allow for normal businesses to take care of business in ways  , the only choice left will be the economy class businesses.... and   where will we all be.

For example... a post at 10am on a Wednesday with a complaint about noise may be taken more seriously than a post at 10pm Friday night. After all, there may be spirits involved (both the alcohol type and the ""excited about weekend"" type) on a Friday evening which would perhaps be absent on a Wednesday.   
Sorry your post was not met with the seriousness which you desired.     
To the topic of post though: 
As others have said, for private citizens, outside of specific days, in some places (Basel for example), it is required to obtain permission for the use of fireworks. 
The reason the shops sell them ahead is to help ensure that there isn't a huge ""impossible to deal with"" rush on the dates of intended use.   
Meanwhile, if folks - regardless of age - are making unreasonable noise past 10pm, simply call the police. Even the police though will likely take the complaint more seriously on a Wednesday than a Friday.

			The way it works in our case is that we call the cleaning lady for 3 hours. If the lady finishes before time she can spend time with kids or do some ironing. If she doesn't finishes in 3 hours then we leave the remaining for the next time. It generally works out.   
The rate is CHF 25/ hour based on estimates but if the person takes more time, the extra time has to be paid @ 25 / hour or if one doesn't want to pay more, you could always do remaining on your own.

			I was once checked on a tiny little back road between Rüti-ZH and Esslingen on a Sunday afternoon. 2 patrol vans and 9 or 10 coppers on a 1.5 m wide road mainly used by tractors and cyclists. I couldn't believe it. Looking for pig rustlers? Moonshiners?   
The number plate thing is very common. If you have ZH plates (as I do), and you are out in some rural wilderness, (anywhere outside Zürich, Basel or Geneva) you will get followed / picked on, as the assumption is that you are up to no good. I was once followed by a police car for 50 km from somewhere in the backwoods west of St Gallen to the motorway. I don't think I have ever driven so slowly for so long.

After 12 years of driving around New York City and the region, I can be a very aggressive driver. But I don't see the point of trying to push someone out of the way with the front end of your car...   
Recently, an entire family was killed due to a tailgating truck. Over the summer a family (in Belgium, I believe, not sure but I believe it was Belgium or the Benelux region) was killed as their car was instantly accordioned (is that even a word!?) between the tailgating truck behind them that was going too fast and the tailgating truck in front of them who was going too slow. Just plain dangerous behavior.

			Currently going through something similar. I practically have smoke coming out of my ears. After a few months of back and forth emails about the papers I have to provide to get married here (to a swiss), we finally thought we got it right only to find out this morning: ""why is there this stamp on the notary paper but not on the birth certificate""? This was the one thing that has been constant on the numerous papers that has been going around but never flagged. Well, on the bright side, at least Fedex is getting something out of it.   
Sorry for venting out my frustration. It's early and I should have had that coffee before reading ""that"" mail.

			The OP might want to open an account with (brokerage house) Charles Schwab bank.  There aren't branches, so only electronic transactions are expected.  They also offer a VISA card.   
One note of caution -- some states (like my former, Maine) will use continued use of an in-state bank as evidence that you are planning to return and so will tax you on all income as a resident of that state still.

I remember once replying at great length, including information that I don't normally share, to someone who wanted to find a job at an international school. Did I get a reply? Did I heck!   
She was still on the forum, of course, posting and moaning away as before. She just hadn't the courtesy to say even a simple 'thank you'.

You could try and stick the seller with the costs but I doubt you will have much success.    
There is no cost to recycle fans. There are depots where you can take them (or to a store if you buy new ones).

			We were told have half the payment before delivery and half after -  they wanted 25% to secure the date and we assumed 25% on moving day. But, on moving day they wanted 50%....in otherwords, they wanted 75% of the payment by moving day. Very misleading.   
We were very clear we had a budget for shipping and we agreed to a set volume of goods. The packers arrived and they said we had more room budgeted so we added things - some time later got invoice for volume beyond the agreed amount.    
After we arrived in Zurich, we were notified that the goods had not left storage in NJ because we owed them money - really? Yes, they lost our check!!  We had to stop payment and figure out how to wire money - not easy once you leave the country.   
Before they had our things we were told the shipment would arrive by Mid-April. What they appear to have meant is that it will arrive in the UK by then (really, the UK? No body mentioned, but whatever).   
While our goods were in the UK we were told to deal with their subcontractor (EuroUSA)... a group we didn't hire but that was now in charge.   
EuroUSA (the subcontractor) invoiced us for ""handling"" the goods in the UK. We also were told we got selected for a security inspection and that we had to pay them for it.    
The subcontractor's (EuroUSA) bank didn't exist according to our bank so we were forced to wire to the original company and pay the difference in currency and fees.   
AFTER our goods arrived in the UK, we were told we needed to provide (by snail mail only) our lease agreement and other documents that should have been requested earlier to prevent delays.   
EuroUSA is attempting to invoice a premium because they reserve the right to charge for deliveries over two floors - our apartment is modern and has a large elevator. The difference is a matter of 3 seconds between floors.   
No body at either company is accountable and they have all the leverage since they have our goods. We are now looking, with luck, at delivery in early to mid June... Not Mid April.  If we'd known about Omega/EuroUSA we would have not used them. At this point we wish we'd not shipped anything but just started over once here.

			What amuses me is men who accelerate and brake HARD all the time to show off how loud the engine is and how quick their reactions are. Mate, all you are showing me is that you are an exceedingly bad driver. When guys have done the whole ""engine rev at the red lights"" thing and grinned at me in the past, I smiled sweetly and made the international ""you must wear very small shoes"" sign with my thumb and middle finger. It was with amusement that I later watched an Australian campaign against that kind of driving - it used the exact same symbolism.   
Bikes annoy me too, I live on a straight stretch of road that is immediately after the slow messiness of the centre of town and, goodness, do the like to accelerate. It even wakes me up sometimes. I wonder why the police haven't put a speed camera there yet, they'd make an absolute killing.

Those two are the two that catch me... it spoils the movie for me if there are too many continuity errors and it spoils the movie for hubby if I can't manage to keep my yap shut about it. Sometimes the errors are really bad though and it is quite tough.   
Weak editing... I think the worst I've seen with respect to this issue (complete with continuity problems as well) was Dragon Wars as the story kept leaping forward without any idea of how they reached this or that conclusion. Progression flow through the story was almost completely nonexistent which I assume was a case of poor editing and huge sections got cut for whatever reason (timing?). 
I saw it at the theater with my sis and her hubby... it quickly turned into a real life version of MST3K. This evolution was fun enough for us (and actually a bonding moment between myself and my sister's hubby - we didn't tend to get along) but probably some of the others in attendance were more than a little irritated.

			Think UM and AbFab have both hit close to home in that   
a) It is a very popular system for all kinds of companies to advertise their businesses - everything from charities, telecoms companies, utility suppliers, they all use ""direct marketing"" or ""the human advert"" to promote their offers and try to beat the competition. Figures (of dubious accuracy I freely admit) show that about 10% of people are at least ""open"" to the concept (referred to as ""positive logical people"") but in reality less than 10% of people actually do buy/donate via this method.   
b) The person you were speaking to earns a commission, not based on how much you donate but on how many ""contracts"" they get completed per day. Probably something like 40-50 CHF per form goes to the ""salesperson"". (Although that is not normally directly from your donation)   
I used to work in the same job, for nPower in the UK, and I know how soul destroying it can be to be the guy with the clipboard, ignored by many, abused by about half, told by a few how you are the devil incarnate and should be ashamed, and then on very rare occasions someone actually stops and has the human decency to listen to what you have to say.   
So generally I at least stop and listen to anyone, and if they explain it well, and the ""deal"" they are offering makes sense, and the company is one that I can associate with in some way, then yes I also usually sign up to these things myself. Currently I donate to Save The Children, Greenpeace, Pro Juventute and Pro Infirmis an an annual basis, I think it's 120 CHF to each company debited direct from my account.   
If I'm honest, then for the sake of 40 CHF per month, I really don't feel that pinch, and the regular cash flow to these charities / organisations helps them to budget financially year on year - certainly any amount however small as a regular payment is of much more use to them than a one off cash donation (sorry to sound harsh, but that is the reality of it)

I have to share the paths with those on horses, cyclists, runners, walkers (they usually have those sticks that frighten my dogs) and other dogs. I try to be considerate of others but on several occasions when picking up dog poo I blocked the path temporarily and this agitated someone trying to get by. I am sure they would be really mad if they stepped in the dog poo so if they were inconvenienced by having to wait for me to clean up, so be it. I find runners and cyclists to be very impatient. I get it...they are in a hurry .   
I believe that no one should be walking more dogs than they can control. 12 dogs does sound like a bit too much for anyone. I think you would be justified in making a formal complaint.

			Hi, I can sympathise, having just noticed a chunk missing from my favouriate pashmina.  However, I have just found the following advice that you may find helpful:   
- Ensure all your woollens are washed before storing. This is to  ensure any eggs have been removed and odd as it may seem, it appears  moths are attracted to human scents. 
 - Wipe out all containers or drawers to be used for storage to remove  any existing moth eggs. 
 - Ensure clothes are thoroughly dry before storing 
 - Store clothing in well sealed containers 
 - Try one of the following in a cheesecloth bag; but ensure the bag  doesn't touch the clothes: Bay leaves, cedar shavings, cinnamon sticks,  cloves, eucalyptus leaves, lavender, peppercorns, rosemary, wormwood. 
 Cedar balls and blocks are also said to be effective in repelling  moths, but need to be sanded occasionally in order to ""refresh"" them.  Cedar kept popping up when researching this topic and many people  reported it to be highly effective. Some people even go as far as lining  their cupboards with cedar panelling.   
Good luck and I am joining you in the battle!

			Hi everyone..   
I am having a hard time with Cablecom and don't know how to get out of it..   
I had the bad idea to switch the whole package of services (TV, telef, Internet) from my current provider (Swisscom) to Cablecom. A seller assured me that I don't have to worry about giving notice, because there are agreements in place between the 2 companies, and pushed me to sign the contract asap.    
I agreed: after a couple of weeks it turns out that there is a notice period of 2 months with Swisscom. This means that I will have to pay the overlap: pay twice even if I am not actually using the service!!!Of course, I tried to call Cablecom helpdesk to discuss options (discounts, changing the starting date of the contract) but no one wants to take a decision: they told me to put the request in writing, and never came back..   
Now, I might have been naive in trusting the seller, but unfortunately she lied to me orally so I am not sure there is something I can really do..any ideas would be super appreciated!   
 Cheers,   
Tania

I was thinking more along the lines of an EMP device that you can hide in a hurry and do it while they are watching TV. Hang it on the wall your side of the offending TV, discharge those capacitors, snatch it off the wall and hide it in a cupboard for when they bang on the door and ask ""what was that loud bang?"" and ""why has our TV exploded?"". Then you could pretend you didn't hear a thing and fake regret over the demise of their TV. That would be truly the Swiss Way of doing things.

			Sounds like you were just unlucky.  I would try to get it straightened out because not only do you have to pay the fine but your details are now on record and if it should happen again it's going to be an even higher fine.  Tell them the facts as you wrote them here; you were in a rush, inspectors held the door open for you, you got up and attempted to move as soon as you realised your mistake but it was just too late.  The fact you had a valid ticket, albeit for second class, would probably add weight to your argument.  Good luck, though.

			Yeah.. I doubt it's the shops policy or anything, it's just the bad/selfish employees who don't give a damn about sales but just want to go home asap...  
But about the OP... people not crossing the street when it's red ? That's a novelty in Switzerland, never heard of it tbh... or maybe it's just that they're all Swiss and follow me like sheep when I cross it illegally ?   But seriously, go to Germany, it's much less common there, or so I've heard.  
About the bus thing... the (automatic) doors can't close when someone's standing too near the entrance. So take the next bus and don't harrass others next time!  
Bus driver has a schedule to follow, it's not as bad as in Japan, but they do have to be on time!

			Hm, growing up in one of these commie housing estates     
which were absolutely normal and most people lived in them, I recall the warm fuzzy feeling of belonging to a community of apartment folks (which also meant meeting hairy and ugly neighbors in undies in the morning fetching papers, ick). You share your life, help out, etc. It is so nice to hear your neighbors, giggle, run around, talk, I am so used to it. People were discrete, no extremes. It feels good to hear people around me, one never feels lonely. I'd flip in the house.    
I have to say the animosity between neighbors sometimes surprise me here, people guard their right for this, entitlement for that...There is not much community feeling, mostly people are anal about rules, etc. We are so lucky with really chill neighbors, eventhough the heels we hear upstairs on a wodden floor are annoying at times, but that's life.    
I wouldn't go extremely out of my way, would formally try to be on good terms with the sabotageurs, but wouldn't sweat it. I bet things are going to calm down. I think they are pished since they know they cannot really do anything about their petty and neurotic complaints. Maybe they are jealous you are happy and positive folks.

			Well if you're studying Psych it seems to me that you must have some understanding of ""why"" you are feeling that way.

			Last year I filed a tax return since my annualised salary was higher than CHF 120k, however my actual salary was lower given that I had worked than 12 months.  
Now I received a letter from the Tax authorities stating since my income is less than CHF 120k, hence they will not assess my Tax return.   
Isn't this funny? Moreover, in case they do not assess my tax return, how will I get my refunds on the witholding Tax which was considerably higher than what my assessed tax liability is.   
My tax colleagues at office said that my return should be assessed since as per Zurich tax rules it is higher than 120k when annualised.   
I have already written back to the tax authorities but still am perplexed by their response.   
Can someone please shed some light?

the eye test cost me 15 SFR and the lady at the license place was very friendly and helpfull and marked down that i needed my south african liscence back for when i visit home. this was on monday so i am going to see what happens next though she did not see any problems. compared to south african liscencing department i think whatever they charge is worth it here for the effenciency.

			My permit finally arrived, after 6 months. I have the right to work to to be paid.    
The best part is that due to the insane delay (having arrived last Autumn), I am not required to purchase retroactive healthcare for 2009 or even for January 2010. So all the waiting and frustration actually worked to my advantage, in that I saved about chf 1,500.

			I upon some correspondence, got the following information in regard to the video-camera surveillance at Zürich HB (Zürich central rail station) from Securitrans :    
..................................................  ................................. 
- 
Der HB Zürich ist videoüberwacht. Die Live-Bilder laufen in unserer  Überwachungszentrale zusammen. Bei Ereignissen können wir vorsorglich  Bilder speichern, und halten diese bis zu einer allfälligen Verfügung  durch ein Gericht bereit. Im vorliegenden Fall wurde keine Recherche  aufgenommen, da die Kantonspolizei ebenfalls Zugriff auf bestimmte  Kameras hat. Ob diese für die Nachforschung des Ereignis eingesetzt  wurden oder nicht, entzieht sich unserer Kenntnis. Sie haben dies  richtig festgeschrieben, von Polizei oder Untersuchungbehörden gehen  keine Bilddaten gegen Aussen, der zulässige Weg verläuft in die andere  Richtung, d.h. von uns zu den Behörden. Aber auch hier kennen wir klare  Limiten, nicht irgendein Uniformierter oder sogar Drittpersonen kann  Bilddaten beziehen, wir bestehen auf das Vorliegen rechtlich gültiger  Unterlagen für eine Übergabe.   
Freundliche Grüsse   
Martin  Graf

..................................................  ...........................................

Zürich HB in fact IS under video-surveillance. The pictures get together in our surveillance station. In case of events we can, as a precaution, secure pictures to have them ready in case a court demands them. In the case you mentioned nothing was secured as the Cantonal Police also has access to some cameras. Whether their records were used in the case mentioned or not is beyond our knowledge. You wrote it correctly, pictures do not go from police or investigating-authorities to outsiders, but the other way round, from police and surveilling organisations to the authorities. But also this is clearly limited by rules and regulations. Just a ""uniformed"" cannot get pictures from us, but we insist upon legal documentation/authorisation for any handover.  
Best regards  
Martin Graf

which shows how much is imported. Beans for example usually come from Egypt nowadays. And you have to realize that the situation is more or less like that throughout the year. Much of those imports were not yet availabe as late as the 50ies and the early 60ies, or blocked by customs barriers, and so simply not around. So much improved than in the 60ies and early 70ies, and I do not believe there are too many people who wished to go back. And I also remember the ""refrigerator"" we had, sized 50x50x40cms, the fresh milk was brought round in the very early morning (the order written the evening before into your ""milk-booklet"") by the milkman and had to be consumed the same day as it otherwise became undrinkable, and of course the home of grandma WITHOUT fridge with ""cool"" things kept down in the cellar. Also this not things I would wish to go back to.  Most foodstuff btw. comes in either by truck (Italy, France, Spain, Greece) or by airfreight. There is a big import hall at ZRH airport specially for that business, and a big parking lot right in front of it, always full of trucks from Monday to Saturday. Fruit for example is picked in the very early morning in the Southern Mediterranean, flown over here during the day, and in the shops the following day !     
Sure, there are bad things. Traffic problems can mean tons of fruit and vegetables lost. For instance heavy snowfall in the Ticino can mean that up to 100 trucks are blocked for more than a day, which can result in some 500 to 1000 metric tons of cargo either to be sold at 50% discount in a hurry or even totally lost. This aspect is one of the reason why Zurich Airport is kept open even in times of heavy snowfall.

Everybody has to work unsociable hours from time to time. And as in every job , there are pleasant and unpleasant people that have to be dealt with.    
However some people, once they are in uniform seem to think that they can treat the rest of us mere mortals as they like, as though the uniform, SBB ID and ticket book confers them special powers. Like thugs they revel in their new found status. I am all for fining fare dodgers, but in the cases cited above, the inspectors should exercise a little discretion and in the case of  tourists they should show leniency. In the case of my parents, they are approaching 70 years of age and are as honest as the day is long; the little sh1t of a conductor revelled in belittling them and was seen to chuckle at my parents expense. I did have the good fortune to meet him  and accidentally walked into him with a hard shoulder.    
I use the trains on a daily basis and normally have my ticket inspected on each journey. On the whole, the inspectors are reasonably polite but there is one fellow who is a miserable bar steward and seems to spend an inordinate amount of time checking individual tickets. I am always polite to him which seems to rankle him even the more.

			Snow on the ground brings out the litter bug in a lot of people, not just a few irresponsible dog owners. I've seen all kinds of litter on piles of snow by the sidewalks -- cigarette packaging, ciggie butts, used tissue (this is extra disgusting when I've to wrestle it out of my pup's mouth  ), candy wrappers, bakery paperbags. What is it about snow that makes people think it's OK to throw it on the sidewalk?!    I'd think snow equals white and pristine surroundings, no?         
A few dog hairs in your soup won't hurt you. I've lived with dogs all my life and I'm sure I've ingested the equivalent of a few largish hair balls.    
No, dogs are not allowed in supermarkets, only service guide dogs with disabled persons excepted.

			Hey everybody.   
I'm trying to get me an apartment. I have a good job, some local references and B permit. Still, it's been 5 months now and counting. Every time I'm sending all the docs to the agency, I'm getting ""yes, we've got it all. we'll let you know"" and after some week or two it's always ""we've found someone better"". No explanation beyond this point what ""better"" is. I'm kinda tired living in temporary apartments.   
It's not that I'm too picky, the only requirement is the top floor.   
So, are there any websites where apartment owners advertise their property directly?

I'm not sure how you gain from doing this. I don't know what the laws are but a detective will only search someone if he is sure the person stole something.

			I had the first two open days on Friday and Saturday. Between the two days, there were 37 to 40 people/couples/families here. At one point, I had a line down the hallway of people waiting to get in. It was nuts.    
I'm having my husband call them to see if we can get that third day out of the ad. I'll still be here to show it if anyone comes on the third day, but I would imagine they've got a bunch of applications already. I ran out of the applications they sent in the first hour, so I called them and they sent another batch, which I quickly ran out of as well.

			Sorry, that should read, you don't need proof of residency (i.e. Auswiess) in the UK (anyway) - the Dutch may be different - when buying VAT free. As I don't ever travel with my C permit and have claimed tax back, it must have been OK.   
The reason the Dutch may be different is that you are required to register you place of residence in your passport, as with many other countries. Certainly when I lived there, I had a big shiny sticker in my passport saying I lived in Holland. So while the UK authorities don't care a fig where you live, some countries do - Switzerland of course included  .   
This came to light when leaving Germany, were I had ""discussions"" with the bloke on the counter when trying to get tax back, as my British passport didn't state that I lived in CH: ""So vy should ve belief you?""...   
I would try the UK anyway before heading off, especially if you are just transiting through Schiphol airport.

			Hi   
it is incredible that companies such as Apple and Disney do not support the official languages of Switzerland. Where are the options for Italian and Reto Romanisch ?   
I live in Switzerland with 4 official languages.     
Curious îf I try to  book Alton towers my only option is to do it in English, the same if I want to buy a rail ticket in the UK.    
Why should things be in english here...   
Looking at this      
The non-official language with the largest group of native speakers is   with 103,000 speakers in  , followed by   (95,000),   (89,500),   (77,500),   (73,000), and   (44,500). Speakers of all other non-official languages totaled 173,000. Altogether, roughly 10 percent of the population has a native language other than the four official languages.     It would make more sense to do it Serbo-Croat.

I didn't allow the SMS to automatically save the download, I looked at the attachment and it was named 'commw'. Something smells fishy...   
Google has it that the Commwarrior worm is doing the rounds. Watch out...   
"" Spreading though MMS:   
Commwarrior spreads through the MMS by sending MMS messages that contains the infected SIS file to other users whose mobile numbers were in the address book of the infected mobile. The MMS messages contain variable text messages and Commwarrior SIS file with filename commw.sis. Unlike in bluetooth spreading, the SIS file name is constant, otherwise the SIS file is identical to the one sent in bluetooth spreading.     Disinfection: 
             The easiest way for disinfection is the use of the anti virus software for the mobile phone and it will remove almost all the viruses in your mobile phones. Several companies like F-Secure are providing softwares for the removal of the mobile phone viruses. For downloading the software, open the browser in your mobile and navigate to :  . Click on the link ""Download F-Secure Mobile Anti-Virus"" and then select your phone model. Then download the file and then install it. After installing go to the menu and open the antivirus and scan the mobile phone for virus. The software will detect the viruses and removes it. But to kill the running Commwarrior process, the mobile phone must be restarted. You will get a detailed description about the manual removal from:      ""

			Well, in our organization we celebrate everyone's birthday with sweets and coffee. Usually first come, first served rule applies here as it is not possible to invite and provide for everyone (there's around 250 employees) but I agree, I hate these moochers.   
One funny incident I can recall in July, when I invited everyone to celebrate my B-day with cake and two bottles of dry red Pinotage from South Africa. It was a bit  and embarrassing as I realized later, because of alcohol consumption in middle of the day and not everyone wanted to taste it. On the other hand they serve cool bevarages, beer and wine in cantina during the lunch time and some employees sip it in midday already. After a party I left the bottles in a coffee room and no one picked them up. I completely forgot about them and two weeks later there was a tag attached   ""Please remove your bottles"". I did it asap and my colleagues at work were chuckling and congratulating me ""well done"".

			These Laundry Cards and Card Machines are hideous in my opinion and I am a Landlord.   
One of our tenents vandalised the 50 cent coin machine in our laundry room and stole the monies from it. 
This was becuase we had won the court case to evict him and time to leave was coming up.   
We only have five apatrtments in the building; three of which are members of my family renting.   
I suggested that we just charge 60 francs more per annum in the maintenance charge to cover everyone. 
My mother behind my back went and had one of these card machines installed which cost 1700 CHF. 
She doesn't know how to top up the cards so ends up taking 50 CHF from tenents when they want their cards topped up and gives them 150 CHF top up in error.

			It must be incredibly frustrating for you. I agree with Puddy, I have looked up appropriate vocabulary, when I need to  do some specific task. I find people usually more helpful if I apologise for my limited German at the start of a conversation, but at least attempt to get my message across in German.  A friend had an incident to report (assault, although not serious) and was unhappy with her treatment by the police because they did not speak english.   
On the plus side the incident inspired her to take a course in German after she had already lived here for a couple of years and had not had any lessons.

She gave me her name but deliberately miss-spellled, haha, I was able to figure it out, google and trace her down to the actual bank place she works, wtf? Made me only wonder why the bank thinks it is good not to introduce themselves but demand all sorts of sensitive info, by phone ?! What does the concept of bank secrecy have to do with giving sensitive info by phone..  Next time she called I called her by her real name, she was pretty wigged out..

			Hi  
Am sadly astounded by the bluntness of some of the replies you have had to your thread.  As someone who is just thinking of moving to Zug my main concern is always peoples understanding when it comes to children - if we didn't have them there wouldn't be much point to anything and unfortunately, children come with a lot of baggage. Anyone else reading this, trust me the baggage drives parents round the bend nevermind anyone else!  I can understand your frustration as all you want to do is get told upfront that places don't do children/prams/toddler toilets etc, then it is fine.  Good luck with the next place you eat!

			Just so you know, Freebooter, not that I need to inform you, I closed the insults thread (not Uncle Max) because it was serving no purpose other than to breed more insults. And that is not what EF is about.   
Most of our members don't enjoy reading offensive language and most don't like the feeling of being threatened. Your posts come across as very in-your-face, very threatening. Please don't persist with this line. This is the wrong forum for that sort of post.   
The founder of EF used to delete posts that weren't written in reasonable English. I agree with that approach, although I won't do it in this instance. Instead, I'm simply closing this thread as well.

			I would like to point out something about this forum from the perspective of a newbie if I may - brace yourself for a rant...   
Sorry, HELLO, my name is Catie, I'm Aquarius and about to move to Switzerland with my husband and my son. (I hope this is adequate).   
Anyway, this forum is a really really intimidating place. It's soooo full of information and ""veterans"" and it's pretty hard to know where to start or who to avoid offending. Some of the posts are pages and pages and pages long and years old and next thing you get some veteran cyber-shouting at you to ""read all the old posts, your answer is in there, so stop asking the same as everyone else"". Well I'm sorry, but I have a lot on my plate and forgive me if I haven't got time to read 18 pages of conflicting advice and snidey comments (and trust me there are a lot of those).   
Recently I met someone else who had been recommended this site and I warned her she'd better have thick skin.    
Having said that, to the very nice people who helped me with my last question, very many thanks (I already did this directly) and I apologise if I didn't introduce myself properly.   
Brace yourself, I probably won't be back for a while. I didn't realise it was the start of a serious commitment, I just wanted a little bit of help. Will stick to phoning the authorities in future, at least they don't shout at you (much).

			YOu should probably not say anything on a forum that you wouldn't say face to face or in a group of people. Think of the forums as a pub or wine bar. In life, there are consequences, sometimes physical, for verbal abuse and/or taking liberties, and so there should be.   
Unfortunately, having a load of moderators running after trolls tut-tutting, deleting posts like footmen chasing farts, is rarely the solution. Ignoring them surely is the best thing to do.    
I was just reading a thread about a woman having serious marital problems. She sounded distressed, isolated & frightened. One bloke kept making 'agent provocateur' type comments, you know, jab-jab-jab then hands up saying 'what? what? it''s tough world!' and citing the plight of eg, abandoned lower-caste Hindu women. I have my doubts over whether this bloke has seen much of the world, but that's not the point. People kept reacting to him, stoking his fires & giving him the attention he craves, rewarding his twattishness   
Well, any parent knows that you reward   behaviour and ignore bad.

			Dear NoToM,    
It must not be very pleasant for you to read all the complaining about Switzerland. Sorry about that. Must sound like the foreigners are one whiny bunch who don't like anything here - you must be wondering why we are even here if everything is so bad, right? But I would say that most EF members, a few exceptions there of course, actually really like Switzerland and the way things are here. Just that people don't start topics when everything is fine and they are generally happy - although you can find a few ""what we love about Switzerland"" threads as well.    
Also, often when somebody complains about something, like local habits and understandings, it's not because we think it's wrong or somehow worse than in our original countries. It's just that we want to of course behave nicely and it is frustrating when we make mistakes because we simply did not know it is polite to ask if the seat is free, for example. It is very stressful to move to a new country where you don't know how things work; where to go to do something; what and how you should do etc. We're learning.

			My POV:   
While it's specified in my contract that I should refrain from ""excessive"" showering, full baths and ""excessive"" toilet flushing between 22pm and 6am, a lot depends on your neighbours.   
Excessive showeringusually means ""more than 10-15 minutes"" with full falsetto ""The Lion sleeps Tonight"" singing, no full baths is mainly for the draining noise but I don't have a clue as to what excessive toilet flushing would mean... a nice case of gippy tummy/the runs being verboten? I'd have a ball in court!      
I got lucky in that my neighbours are all young families with kids ranging from kindergarten to junior high. They know they're noisy, so they can't come and complain when I get a call of nature at 3am or shower at 5.45am when I get up    And I let it slide when I wake up from my Sunday lunch nap because squeaking/giggling kiddoes. Live and let live, after all, I could have a grumpy old coot downstairs that insists I tiptoe around on felt slippers etc.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	after 22h one cannot take a shower in [Switzerland]?

			Hubby and I were walking down Barfuzerplatz and we saw a family with 2 kids a girl aged 10 and a boy aged about 11 or 12. It seems the little girl had been pestering the little boy to which the boy reacted with fury, and I mean fury I could really see rage in his eyes while he started hitting and kicking the girl...it was really scary! The father stopped the boy but really was not bothered by his attitude. A couple of weeks later, I saw a little boy aged around 10 completely bullying his little brother aged around 4 or 5. He was kickig him and pushing him...I felt so powerless so decided to look at the older boy in the eye so he noticed I was looking and he stopped his awful attitude. 
Some kids might have some anger issues that really need to be dealt with before they blow out of proportion when these kids turn into teenagers.

			All this thinking about neighbors cooking... so many memories for me. (No wonder I'm heavy, lots of good memories center around food   ... well, that and I hate to get sweaty  )     
I remember, as a kid, living in Okinawa and our across-the-street neighbors were a family from the Philippines. It was a young(ish) husband and wife, their baby son, her mother and a teen-aged nephew they'd adopted in order to get him access to better health care as he was sickly.   
Anyhow... oh my. ""Grandmama"" (as we were asked to call her) soooo could cook. They had a baptismal party for the baby which, of course, required days of preparation for the massive amounts of food. They dug a fire pit in the lawn (something you'd rarely see in many areas of the US!) in order to roast a whole pig. I don't remember everything they had (I was only 8 after all  ) but I remember it smelling strong and good. I also remember all of the women coming in and out for days before, bringing dishes of food and staying to gossip. The menfolk starting with the firepit the night before to make sure it would be just right, all the joking around (and alcohol consumed I'm sure).     
Too bad the OP's neighbors won't be able to share fantastic memories like that with their kids.    "	considered unworthy	Join Date: Aug 2008	Groaned at 39 Times in 16 Posts	Can I make a complaint over this? [Leasing apartment discrimination]	Posts: 207

Then about 9 months later they dug up part of it while also digging up the street I was living on..O.K. they paved the street then about 6 months later they announce they are digging up the street and traffic has to be rerouted...They dig it up then pave it....After about 8 more months they announce another project. They dig up the whole street then pave it and start on the street around the corner. Then they close the street again to put the painting on the street which in turn only lasted about a year...When I left they were still working on the street around the corner which should be finished by the end of the year...All the while they complain they don't have enough money for the schools so they are putting 1,2,and 3rd class in one room. They couldn't put their usual flowers out for spring and summer and a private citizen paid for them...They seem to continuously dig up roads and the like everywhere.

			It definitely makes a difference when the server's standard of living is heavily dependent on tips.    
And fake or not (lets just admit we don't go to a restaurant looking to marry the serving staff) I would far rather hear ""Hi my name's Brittney I'll be your server today"" than ""Und?""   
I've quoted before Scottish comedian Billy Connolly on these matters. When quizzed by folk back in Scotland as to how he can standard the ""fakery"" around the Californian ""have a nice day"" he says he'd far rather hear someone say that and not mean it than someone say ""%^&^ off"" and mean it. I agree.   
Also smiles are infectious and can actually make you feel better. I once asked a Russian why they look so serious and was told it was because in Soviet times to smile was the preserve of the mentally ill (which I can imagine). Still doesn't explain all the overtly serious suits on the Bahnhofstrasse though or the train station ticket seller who pulls a face like they are in the middle of conducting brain surgery or the waiter who is so above it all. I've never seen so many people who look like their loved one just passed away as I have in Switzerland.

			There are other places to live in Switzerland besides Geneva and Zurich. If big city life is the goal maybe it's not the best place.    
I like a compromise- here it's a 13 minute train ride to Geneva 4 times per hour, and I can escape when the exhaust fumes there get to me; it's also a 10 minute walk to the local farm where I can get fresh milk out of a machine and cut my own flowers. I think that's quite a high quality of life!

To your point, another example when you take out a morgage in Switzerland, you do so for 100 years- obviously beyond your lifetime. You benefit greatly from this becuase it reduces your amorization to a very low level. On the other hand when you die your next of kin will be held responsible.

			You can report things in Switzerland that happened elsewhere.  Three weeks ago we were in Lille, France for the Braderie and our Garmin was stolen out of our rented truck.     
The thieves broke the side passenger window and took the Garmin from inside.  We also were on a tight schedule and did not have the time to go to the French police station.     
We reported it to Sixt (the truck rental company) when we got back to Switzerland the next day.  Sixt took care of reporting and repairing.  Our insurance is paying.  Never even had to go to the police station.

At this point, swine flu has a relatively low mortality, being most of cases related to pre existing conditions. I totally disagree with the widespread use and distribution of tamiflu (just think about antibiotica and how many resistant bacteria you have created with its misuse. add this to the fact the virus mutate very frequently). Also, it is not effective in all cases and has to be given quite early (i believe day 2 of symptoms).   
I am not saying the doctor is having a good praxis - she should at least be tested  whether she has virus or bacteria, or a combination of both. I was under the impression you had this test by default whenever you had an infection. Even a common flu might cause serious secondary infections (it is in fact more likely to do it, as i know only too well).

I think they are venting their frustration here rather than contesting the decision.  If the Authorities looked at the driver as a whole - one with no convictions for 20 years caught a few kph over the limit - they might cancel the penalty.  Because a camera or automated device is purely logical it makes no such distinction.   
The law is the law but why in that case do all burglars not receive a fixed time in prison based on a chart of the amount they have stolen - because when they appear in court the judge looks at them as a whole, not just as an automated process.

			I think Tyler Brule has spent a fair amount of time in Switzerland - apparently he has a house in St Moritz. As the OP says, and he himself says in the article, he's usually a fan of Swiss service. He wasn't commenting on lifestyle but the service he and others received - that's normally the pattern his FT articles follow.

			I use the ignore function in all ways possible. There's too much content on this forum, a lot of which is not so useful, so I use the ignore function to help improve the signal to noise ratio by a small degree. I ignore people who make a lot of posts but never contribute anything intelligent or are always just complaining, I ignore threads that I am tired of seeing on the list of new posts which I never plan to read, and I ignore whole subsections of the forum that I'm not interested in - General Off-Topic, Inernational Politics, Jobs Wanted, and Pet Corner. I'm never going to be interested in those things, so it is better if a computer filters them out for me rather than me having to read all of the thread titles in the list of ""New Posts.""   
Finding the controls to ignore specific users and threads is easy, but if you want to ignore a forum subsection then you must go to My Settings, Edit Options, Miscellaneous Options, and select them from the list. Strangely, the list of subforums is out of date and doesn't entirely match the current structure of the forum. However, it does appear to work for the subforums that do still exist (I pointed this out a couple of months ago, but nothing appears to have been done about it yet).

I was the woman with the baby in her arms who also was trying to get off at Max Bill Platz.  Thanks for pushing me, causing me to stumble and knock into some other poor soul who was smooshed up next to me like a sardine.  Your ""ENTSCHULDIGEN!!!"" wasn't being yelled into my ear loudly enough.  Also, I was just being lazy, since I figured I could just wait until the doors opened before getting out of your way.  Next time, I'll climb onto the 12 year old in front of me.  Thank you for switching to English and answering my ""I'm getting out at this stop too"" with a polite ""Take your time.  Be welcome.""  I'm sorry I didn't catch the sarcasm along with your black-gloved hands waving in my face.  I thought you were being sincere.   
Thanks for knocking into me once more while I was trying to get out of the bus.   
Sorry I yelled at you.  I was just having a bad day.  But, I'm glad you made your stop, since you were clearly in a rush to push past everyone else going into the Coop!

			Does anyone have an Ikea fridge freezer that has problems with icing up on the back and creating 'floods' at the bottom? Also too much condensation on glass shelves and then water drips all over food (causing it to rot much more quickly) We're on to the second one (they replaced the first) and we were told that it could be due to open watermelon  in the fridge (never mind that we lived in Madrid at 40°c in the summer, fridge stuffed full of watermelons, etc. and it's still going strong after 14 years (and it was even cheaper than the IKEA one, if that's possible). 
Thanks for any feedback.

			Two points here: 
Our lives were transformed when we bought ourselves a Kenwood mini-washing machine. Not cheap, and you need to get a little adaptor to get the inlet pipe to attach to the cold water, and apparently these machines are illegal in Zurich city, but don't let that deter you. Just buy a thick rubber mat for it to sit on to damp vibrations and avoid damp. Also never use the hot tap as the feed, you can cause the hot water pressure for your whole building to cut out. 
In my old place, a large family of E-europeans were causing great upset by monopolising at least one of the two machines in the block from 7 am to 10 pm. Wednesdays, Saturdays and Friday evenings, the 'free' times, it was the same thing, load after load was going in. It stopped rather suddenly when the Hausabwart caught the wife of the family handing over a big pile of cleaned clothes to a workman for cash!   
Cheers   
Jim

			One thing that Swiss web sites in general   got right is the multilingual aspect. I'm thinking of ergonomics here where the languages available are displayed horizontally at the top.

So no matter whether they are operating on the street or in a Monaco Casino, they are betting that people don't know statistics.

			The Swiss are taught to hold their cars on the clutch at hill-starts? That I did not know, but it explains why I had two people kiss the front bumper when I first arrived. I now know that I need to stay well back. Has anyone told them how bad that is for their cars? 
Having seen them trying to parallel park, my first thought is always ""Do you really need to put the rev-counter in the red, and have the engine screaming away?"" The classic (which I've seen a couple of times), is to ride a rear wheel up the curb, and then not put the hand brake on, so the unbalanced car promptly rolls either forward or backwards into the adjacent car.   
Cheers

			Well they finally arrived.  10 days late and on the last day, according to their T & C they had to deliver before they had broken the contract.  Nothing broken, nothing lost.   
To add insult to injury, despite being told about access problems, they turned up in their huge truck and couldn't get any closer than 500m so I had to ferry all of our stuff from there to the house in the back of my car.  It took six hours.   
All credit to the guys on the truck, they were spot on and did things well and as quickly as they could.

first of all, so very sorry for that loss !

But, as the chance is 98 to 2 that it simply WAS stolen, yes, a police report is necessary and try to place it with the household insurance if you have some. But for later, try to get a cheap but good one over

I for many years, up from my 15th birthday, had a bike I really loved. It however was stolen when I was some 35 years old. I about two years ago purchased, for less than 80 francs, quite a similar one, which now is in daily use again. And I have another one, stationed downtown which is of the make, the most disgusting bicycle mechanic in quarter had as his trademark, but I really love that thing as well, in spite of its purchase-value having been clearly below 100 CHF  
- 
I even had a similar bike been stolen, so that now, I have three bikes, with a purchase value of below 100 CHF each, but the locks having been worth more than 50 CHF each. Strange, true. At the other hand, really new and fashionable bikes have a high risk to get stolen, unless being stored in the gold cellars of the UBS ..

It reminds me of an experience in military service. A colleague had to do the cleaning, and then the ""Feldweibel 2"" (we had two of them) asked me to re-check. It was a bit strange as the colleague was far more on the ""clean side"" than me, but I did my very best. I felt a bit disturbed when the Feldweibel told me ""you see, you never know with ...., but you of course understand ...."". I really did understand him, but found it rather disturbing. --- Yes, it for sure is a Swiss thing ........

How arrogant can you get. Why is   way always correct?

Plus with 99% of shops where you purchase large or semi-large goods it is possible to arrange delivery of the goods whereas with second-hand, this is hardly ever possible.   
The point is, if the price is virtually the same as a new price for an item that is being sold second-hand, then why even buy it second-hand.   
Plus with new, you at least know that it is new and unused, and IF there are parts missing you at least have warranty or can go back to the shop.

			Never really had a problem with outgoing post. What really pulls my chain is the tendency for the customs barstewards to hang on to things sent to me from abroad for about as long as they feel like. I just love getting all those patched up / sellotaped together envelopes. Maybe there used to be a drug-dealer / terrorist with my name, but I seem to get an awful lot of this.

			I've given to Doctors without borders since I was 17- I got married to my husband and was surprised when he said he would not give money to charities (any charity).    
A little bit of digging later, and I found out that growing up in India, he's seen corruption involving charity money first hand. So his experience tells him you can never be sure money goes to where you want it to go.   
Our compromise is that I continue making a personal donation to Doctors without Borders on a monthly basis without his input, and he sends his parents in India money once a year, that is used to sponsor a monthly feed at the local orphanage. They supervise the whole thing, from the buying of the ingredients to serving the kids. He thinks this is a more 'certain' way of helping. Its not what I would choose, but over 1000 kids get a square meal that day that they'd probably not otherwise receive.   
People have their own particular way of dealing with these matters. When we're passionate about a cause, its somewhat natural to want to proselytize. But its not necessarily the nicest thing.   
Talking about not the nicest thing- neither was my initial response. My apologies for being unnecessarily snippy.

			I have never submitted a complaint on the forum, but this time I just had to let some steam out.   
Has anyone else who lives in Kreis 8 ever had the unpleasant experience of interacting with one of the lady employees (dark hair, rather heavy set, deep raspy voice) at the main administrative office at the Kreisburo on Feldeggstrasse in Zuerich?  There are usually only about 3 people working there at a time, and every time it comes to my turn, I have the good fortune of being called to her desk.   
Never in my life have I encountered anyone so miserable, unhelpful and just plain rude.  I have really tried to bite my tongue the last few times I have gone there, but last time I just let her have it.     
Curious to know if any others have had similar experiences with this sourpuss?

			We had dinner at King's Curry (near Wiedikon Bahnhof) last night and were extremely disappointed with the food..   
I have read good reviews about them, so was a little shocked with the food served.   
We ordered the aloo chaat for our starter, Chettinad fish curry with rice and palak paneer with rotis for our main entrees    
The aloo chaat lacked any flavour..it tasted like sugar+potatoes..there was no tangy ""chaat-like"" taste at all..   
The Chetinaad fish curry lacked the most basic ingredient - ""salt"" ..actually had no salt at all..the curry was extremely watered down as well..maybe they didn't have enough of the curry left...and just poured some water to build up quantity.   
The palak paneer was excessively creamy..lacked flavour too..   
rotis were good...perhaps the only thing I can't complain about.   
We didn't order any desert as we didn't have the courage to try anything else..   
Anyways, hope this review saves some of you from the experience..I also hope that this is just a one-off experience and that other dishes they serve are better..

			I'm afraid i'll have to disagree with most people.   
While it is understandable that larger cities have to avoid getting flooded by cars, the P+R solution is nice but only if you have a monthly pay. Even so, there are *no* alternatives like parking outside the city and taking a bus / train. We have a car and we need to park it, be it overnight or for one or two days if we take a train somewhere.   
I still prefer to use my own car to drive when visiting some new place and pay for the parking as it is still cheaper than paying for the train and the eventual bus tickets.   
That said, I still fail to understand how this (lack of parking for longer stays for non residents) is perceived as a major advantage. Maybe if some of the replies brought more logical explanation instead of cynicism then i'd be able to understand this point of view.   
In fact, i'd go as far as to say it is a bit hypocritical to say people should use public transportations if we don't offer them a place to leave their cars which is convenient for the car owner and also the community in general.   
Obviously I didn't mean turning swiss landscape into a parking lot, there are several clever and practical solutions which include underground parking, a few places for non residents with a longer than 12h limit even if they aren't in the center...

My Brush with the Olympians is actually kind of a silly story. I used to ride with a guy named John who was a scrub on the US Olympic speed skating team. He was good friends with another more famous speed Skater named Eric H. who you might remember from the 1980 Winter Olympics. Eric was friends with some guys on the Bike team. Who they were, I have no idea. What brought us all together was a mutual enjoyment for something that recently put Michael Phelps, a more recent Olympian, back in the headlines. At that time in my life, I was sufficiently connected to supply interested parties with this substance, which was my only in.    
This all culminated for me at a party in Wisconsin where I was cavorting with some of the Elite of the Olympian world. After a fairly interesting night, it was mutually agreed to go for a bike ride the next day which involved myself, My friend John, Eric H., and two members of the US bike team.  
We rode about 50 miles  that Sunday on some rural roads in Wisconsin. They on some serious custom Italian work, me on a $200 Fuji. This being the 80's, they had actual bike shorts, shoes, and shirts. I was in my traditional battle dress of cut off jeans, no shirt, and a bandana around my head finished off with mirrored aviator sunglasses. Don't forget the mullet.   
We rode fast that day. Not many hills, but just enough to make the heart pound. Being young men, they wanted to impress, and I wasn't going to admit it was a challenge. One of the 2 guys was serious fast, and no way was I ever going to pass him, but I stayed with him. The other one could barely outpace the speed skaters.    
At the end, there were suggestions that I find some sponsorship and work my way into their world. Being from the wrong side of the tracks, this sounded as silly to me as learning to speak French and moving to Switzerland. Sure, these guys were half baked from the night before, but so was I, and I did OK.    
My only other brush with greatness involved being pushed out of the way by Vern Troyer (mini me from the Austin Powers movies) at a strip club in Las Vegas in 1999.

			This is good advice anywhere. I now skim my receipts from big shopping expeditions every time.  
At the Carrefour in Hinwil (when it was still the Carrefour), I once found two imaginary boxes of beer had been added to my shopping, for the princely sum of CHF 50. I went ballistic, causing much embarassed amusement to the general public, and after initially denying all wrongdoing, the cashier, and the manager (who was the only one capable of making a decision), admitted that indeed there was no beer to be seen in my trolley.   
Cheers

			I wanted to do a few guitar lessons so we checked first with the landlords company. They said no because of the noise (we have a 4&5 floor maisonette with no neighbours below us or behind us). I challenged them because we have a (swiss) music school next door (same landlord) who has neighbours above, below and directly behind on the same floor and has never had a complaint. 
The landlord then said people coming into the building would be a nuisance. My (swiss) girlfriend then rang the landlord and gently explained that we share an entrance in the building with a bank, a hairdresser, a key cutter, a clothes shop and a physiotherapy practice which require the door to be kept open from 06:45 to 19:30 6 days a week, so how could this possibly be a problem? 
Magically the problem dissapeared...

			I don't think the Brits have much of a problem with 16+ materials being sold over E-bay. But the Swiss site (I believe it is administrated from Germany??) may have. We also share some, luckily not all, of the German rules of classification of games and dvd's. Therefore any bloodthirsty games or films (those that make people commit all these awful crimes  ) may not be sold freely. E-bay in Germany have a reputation of taking all those sales down pretty quick.   
Maybe try somewhere where they can verify the age of the customers... On the other hand there are so many smaller sites like piazza, ronorp, kleinanzeigen etc where there are no strict controls, so you might get away with it.

			[quote=dawiz;434203]? No idea what you're talking about. Yes, you'll be sued if you cause a traffic accident and leave someone dead or disabled. But apart from that - I've never heard of anyone being sued for anything in Switzerland.   
Anyway, in response to the OP:   
- Health care isn't taken out of your salary, you have to get that yourself, separately. What's taken out of your salary is probably a ""Krankentaggeldversicherung"" which essentially is an insurance for your employer, not yourself. If you get sick and can't work for a longer period of time, that insurance will reimburse your employer for parts of the damage caused by your absence. This will NOT pay your doctor's bill - so if you haven't gotten that yet (which is hardly possible because the community won't allow you to register without it) you should make sure you get a health care policy from one of the private providers   
i do not know if this is my work visa status but i pay 296 chf and my employers also pay this for my health insurance....they are also doing the accident insurance as well...   
now i know too from the 'moving out' forum, that i should have two kinds of insurance for my flat...one for my things and another type for the kind of wear and tear that may occur while i live there!   
thanks peeps!

			Those that produce the cheapest prices in Toppreise.ch are not  
always on the up-and-up.  I have dealt with Toppreise.ch for many  
years now, as a webshop.  There are other shops that offer prices  
below the Swiss distributor and wholesaler prices.  Obviously these  
are imported as gray market items or smuggled over the border.   
Some even take your order from France and they drive over the  
border and send it from the Swiss Post Office.     
Of course you can not see this or act accordingly as a consumer.   
Thus, the shop rating is important.  You have the chance to offer your  
opinion in the form of a rating on Toppreise.ch.  Don't be shy, be  
honest.  When looking to make a purchase, read carefully and  
compare the ratings.  My rating when I was activly selling was 5.6 of  
6.0.   
What to do now?  Contact the company in which you purchased the  
item.  You do have a right to return it for a full refund.  Talk with  
them, tell them why you are not satisfied and suggest returning the  
item.  You could use the fact that, (if true) that it is not the item you  
ordered... you ordered it because you had intended to use it in  
Switzerland, where the item was purchased... not in North or South  
America!   
Keep us informed how it works out and good luck!

			Unfortunately, there is nothing to stop these traders from setting up a new business under a new name even after they have been caught. i remember years ago, my folks had their own business; they were soon left with unpaid invoices by companies who went into liquidation, and opened up the next day,  on the same premises with a slightly different name. it's disgraceful really.    
i have read that the government is trying to deal with it at not only a national level, but at a local level, allowing local government authorities to have some control, but alas, each local authority has a different approach.    
Best thing to do is contact the office of fair trading/trading standards if you have been affected, and be vigilant when looking for tradesmen/services. although the government is there we need to be more proactive in stopping these fraudsters when we get the chance.

It's not often that I'd leap to the defence of a certain Cannuck but since when has ""having a grudge"" been suitable grounds for ""hassling"" someone? One of the aspects of Switzerland that makes living here sometimes a little difficult is the prevalence of the police and their willingness to interfere in things based upon flimsy suspicion - c/w the thread a while back about people being frisked because they appeared (in the eyes of the coppers) to be Serbian which per se = suspicious? What next, gypsies and homosexuals?

			Not a medical experience, but rather a lost girl and boy... 
I had a odd experience last weekend in Laax, at the Ski lifts... 
A 5yr old boy, and his even younger sister (must have been 3) was standing alone, in the middle of nowwhere at the lifts...the little girl was screaming 'Pappie, Pappie' on the top of her voice and was in tears as well, the brother's eyes was big and confused. I had my same age daugher (5) with me and she walked over to them, and came to tell me that the girl says they are lost. So, I went there. Talked to them, sat with the girl and ask her if they are indeed lost etc. yes, they both said. The girl asked me to stay with her, and find her Pappie..so, I said that I will sit with them right there, in the sight of everyone that Pappie can see them clearly if he comes to the lifts again. She was crying, my heart was really sore ...and after about 25 minutes the father showed up (coming from a totally different direction than the Piste or slopes/ticket offices).  
Man...was he upset with me. Instead of a thank you, I got NOTHING, and he grabbed his kids (I was not even touching them, just sat there calming her down with my promise that I will not leave them), gave me a LOOK and left! 
My daughter was stunned and said:Mommy, he did not even say Thank you. Well, well... I was a bit upset in my heart, ...at the father for leaving his kids alone .. 
maybe i was wrong in feeling sorry for the little ones crying and thinking they were lost, that Pappie has left them there..

			Just an update for those interested in the little saga: today, we got a letter from Pfister telling that they had terminated the relationship with the supplier due to problems with delivery, yada yada... At the end, the letter mentions that we are entitled to a 10% discount in our new selection (I bet that comes along with the corresponding three extra months for delivery). If we decide to go for it, I guess I will be leaning towards buying a bed for a teenager instead of one for a 6 year-old boy, in case the come again with further delays  !

I was not very comfortable with this at the beginning but after a couple of months, I realized that is a very good practice. For me was really a better thing.

			You should try the St Galler Brot from Coop in the blue bags. I have found this to stay fresh the longest and if bought after work one day you will easily get to fresh lunches out of it.   
I understand what everyone else is saying about additives/preservatives in the tradition Irish/English sandwich breads but I miss them so much    
Living on your own and buying fresh bread in Switzerland is a serious waste of food as you rarely get a chance to finish what you've bought before it turns into concrete!!

			I am a UK citizen and my wife is Indian. We arrived in Switzerland in Canton Vaud in late August. Since we didn't use a relocation agent ( didn't see any point as this is the 4th country we have lived in, and we know what sort of documents are required by and large for visas etc. etc. ), I went to the local Kommune office and did all the paperwork myself. There was no request for a Criminal Records check for my wife, and within a month we had all ( including the kiddies ) got our Permit B's valid for 5 years.   
Of course things can be different from one Kommune to another, but the one thing I have found in getting visas in the UK, Norway and the UAE is that if you want something done quickly, do it yourself. I understand this might not be an option open to some, but if it is, and things are taking a while give it a shot.

			I would follow up on the earlier discussion and recommend you always use your mobile to call Cablecom.  This gives you the choice of language.  (For better or for worse, I've always had to call from my mobile since my Cablecom phone connection goes out along with my Internet so I don't have a choice...)  I've never had a problem getting someone to speak English to me (calling from Zurich).  If the first one doesn't speak English, they transfer me to someone who does.  Good luck next time...   
(Side note:  I didn't realize it, but the internet and phone connection is closely connected to the cable box connection - if you have one - so if your internet and phone go out, reboot your cable box.  This will possibly re-initialize your connection and save you time and frustration.)

			Please keep one thing in mind.  When the Swiss Post ""promises"" to deliver  
by a number of days... then the promise means delivery to the foreign  
Customs Officials.  That does not mean to the destination address.   
Basically, I have had good luck with postage to the states and otherwise  
international destinations.     
One international delivery was too good and ended up cost me over CHF  
4000.-, that was an eBay fraud, payment via Paypal.  Thus, the conclusion  
that they are both fraudulent companies.  Read more  .   
Back to the point:  Plan early, send accordingly (registered) and ask your  
destination to inform you of delivery.  That way you have some sort of  
confirmation when the letter or box arrives.

The real joke was when the bill appeared with two whole bottles of wine on it, (it was lunchtime, we had enjoyed a glass each of a light red).  
I pointed to my heavily pregnant wife, and asked just how much wine the waitress thought she had drunk. Without even blinking, the waitress scratched off the wine and presented me with a correct bill.

I had to have a stern word with some skinny old trout in the shower room of the swimming pool up at Forch yesterday morning who, in her effort to barge past everyone in her way, managed to shove me and my little boy against one of the shower cubicles.  Unfortunately my little boy was in my arms and his chubby little thigh was just at the height of one of the locks on the door frame and, boy, how he howled as it dug in.   
Fortunately a couple of other ladies (and, even better, a couple of mums) saw this blatant lack of manners and joined in with me.   
What was unfathomable was the fact she retaliated by having a go at us for being in her way.  No remorse, no ""sorry, I wasn't thinking"", nothing.  Amazing.   
I felt terrible because I had put my little fella in that position but I really had no where to turn in the time the old bat barrelled down the narrow corridor.

			So sorry to hear that. It is common in that industry to lay people off and not related to foreign status.   
Good news is that it seems people here have a lack of imagination on garden design so perhaps there is a untapped market for good advice.   
Think about the big spring shows like BEA in Bern where lots of people start playing in the garden again and maybe would like some advice. Basel and Zurich also have big spring shows.   
Also, since lots of the apartments are owned or managed by property companies try approaching them. Similarly, many new apartment block developments are so so bland that maybe the building companies like Marazzi (etc) would appreciate some advice. And, don't get me started on the new office blocks of concrete lacking any greenery ...

			Swiss-French is another story, i've had another bus driver come into our bus and tell us that there was more space in his bus and that he was going on the same route.    
I've had a bus stop for us about 50 meters after it departed because the driver saw us running.   
Two weekends ago in Geneva, we asked a bus driver for directions to another bus stop. We followed the directions and when we got there we realised that he had given us the wrong directions. A few minutes later he arrived; after realising that he had given us the wrong directions, he got out of his bus and came to find us.   
A train driver saw us running for the platform and waited for us. As he greeted us while leaning out of the window we told him that we didn't have tickets. He asked where we were going and it was only one stop (not a tram stop, a reasonable distance) he said not to worry, get on and have a nice day.   
Only once in Zurich have I seen a tram open the doors again.   
Whenever I cross the Rostigraben I get a mild attack of culture shock and it mostly manifests itself through the public transport, odd I know but I can't explain it.

			May be not so bad an experience, but something annoying.   
I bought a dish antenna from 1000ordi shop, then next day wanted to change it (note: change it and buy a bigger one).    
They refused. After insisting that within 7 days I have right to return the item (Btw I am not so sure about it). They told me that since dish was opened by a ""non professional"" so they will not return it. I wonder how a professional would have opened the bloody dish box and planted 6 screws  .     
After needless wobbling they agreed to give me 50 SFR for a dish worth 68 SFR. They did not return the money, did not even give me a voucher; but said that I can buy stuff from their shop.   
Initially I was thinking to buy more things from them, but now I will not do so (I know they will not go out of business due to that).   
Anyways, just as information on the shop.   
p.s. I compared that their prices are slightly higher then the satshop.ch, but since I was in Geneva so it made sense to go to the shop and pick things

			On a tenuously related note, we live in a typical Kleinbasel apartment block with a mix of Swiss and foreigners.   
People are generally considerate - now and again there is a party in some apartment but I think it is a question of give-and-take in that I won't make a fuss as I play Fasnacht piccolo and I get no complaints about me practising. In fact, I mentioned to our Swiss neighbour that if the piccolo disturbs him he should let me know right away. His attitude was one of ""you wouldn't live in Claraplatz if you didn't like Fasnacht"".   
We live on the top floor and a couple of years ago, the flat next to ours stood empty for a few months. The owner of the block put an ad on the main door of the building and one day there as I was walking out there was an older Swiss couple looking at the ad and they asked me what the apartment was like. Not fancying nitpicking Swiss moving in next door, I informed them that it is okay but during Fasnacht it can get unbearable if you are not a fan and that the trams make quite a racket. Needless to say I never saw them again.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Hi Gav,   
Interesting point about the pillars - I'd never thought of that before, but you do have a point - it is a pain, and you just have to look at the amount of paint left behind on these pillars to wonder about the cost to the ecomony of so many pointless car repairs needing to be done..   
Just a small point about paying for parking. Yes I agree - I think it's outrageous that I go and spend money in a store, and then have to pay a couple of francs for parking (especially if I don't have coins which is often the case!!)   
In defense of the shops I'm lead to believe that this is not something they want to do, but they are forced to do this. It sounds plausible. My solution - any shop where there is a meter and you have to feed it yourself I simply never do. Why would the shop have people going out and checking these meters, and what power would they have to fine someone? Why would they even bother? At places like Ikea and Media Markt you have a barrier so you have to pay, but there's nothing that you can do about this. So don't be angry at the retailers, be angry and people like VKS (Verkehrs Klub Schweiz) that keep up the pressure to implement these things, and for the voters that go along with it!!   
Mark

			Well we knew this letter would come. It's their run-of-the-mill letter to those who dispute the ""contract"" and states that you are bound by contract. They also say that they've linked a code to your name in their database so they have already had 399.- worth of expenses  . Thank you for scanning it.   
The time comes to decide if you pay or not. I think I've made clear what I would do. It will not be free but possibly cheaper than 400 CHF. These three organisations all offer legal advice to members:   
The Swiss consumerism organisation, politically active:       
The consumerism press:        and

			Well, TonyBhoy, though I am neither British not Swiss (at least not originally), I must admit to preferring the Swiss way.  
First of all, I only do rounds with people whom I know. Otherwise, I remember how I hated rounds when I was a student and forced to pay expensive coctails of other people when doing rounds, sticking myself to something I could afford. Today, I often buy expensive stuff myself and I really don't want anyone to have to pay that.. (suppose you don't have this problem if everyone is drinking beer, but not everybody likes beer - I don't for instance)... 
Secondly, I remember being on holidays with some friends who brought 2 British guys along. All they did in the evenings, was watching football, drinking beer and smoking - for a week straight.... You might like it, but not everyone finds it so cool... So, I might know how your girlfriend feels. 
In general, every country has its ways. In Switzerland, they might be drinking not the way you used to in Britain, but they surely do have their reasons. They won't pay for your drink if they just meet you 5 minutes ago, but it is quite normal to pay for each other once you know each other a bit better (at least, in my experience)..

			Sorry to hear about your experience. I once heard an SBB railway worker referring to the end of summer as ""Springer Zeet"", (approx. ""Jumper season""). 
In my experience if the Swiss as a nation have a blind spot, it concerns a total lack of consideration for others, and a rather selfish attitude. (Which has been discussed ad. infinitum on these boards.)  
When, in a very english way, I have recounted similar stories to my Swiss colleagues / friends and tried to make excuses for the behaviour I encountered (he probably didn't see me, she must have been tired etc...), my swiss friends have looked upon me kindly and pityingly, and explained to me as if I must be rather slow that expecting any other type of behaviour is deeply naiive and unrealistic of me, and ""of course he saw you"", ""she was just being a b*itch and looking out for number one"".   
Cheers

			Some posters detect an inconsistency in German (example 47 is said as seven&forty). The inconsistency is actually in English. From 13 to 19 we are happy saying, e.g. 16 as six&ten. Then from 20 onwards we change the order in English. German is more consistent!   
The most inconsistent is French-French. You need a computer to calculate 4x20+10+7=97. The Swiss French, however have a word for 90.

			When haggling I've found it useful to consider the sellers options. 2 for 1 doesn't work, but 3 for 2 does, even with Würst.   
Give the other fella room to manoeuvre. It's not about losing face: everybody should gain.   
I bought an expensive watch for a beautiful lady, but lamented to the saleswoman I could also just forget about the lovely lady and buy myself some bling.   
Or I could get the watch for the Honey, but what do I get from the deal?   
She smiled, and gave me enough of a reduction to buy a ...Swatch ha! ha! ha!   
Still, even on the Bahnhofstrasse in ZH you can get reductions, despite  - in my opinion - the quango they operate.      
Don't rush. A tactic I learnt when working in the Near East is to look at something less costly, then let your eyes be 'drawn' to the costlier item. Works a treat!

			We don't get late night roadworks, but our strasse is being dug up for the   time in one year. Again, more pipes are being laid. I don't understand why they can't all be done at the same time. I seem to recall the gas, electricity, water and cable companies being 'forced' to coordinate their activity in London to reduce the aggravation to residents.

			The wife and I once went to look at a house for sale in Monchaltorf. It was amazing, everything we wanted at a price we could afford. Just as we were about to ask for the form to take to the Notariat, the church next door fired up, shaking the walls / windows, knocking dust out of cracks in the ceiling, and drowning all conversation for the next five minutes. 
""You get used to it..."" insisted the seller; we were already out the door and backing down the drive! 
Aparently the great majority of these bells are driven at the push of a button by an electric motor. Perhaps it should be made law that only bells pulled by campanologists are permitted. This would either result in a lot of enourmously muscled priests or a lot more quiet.

			I hope you are not getting too much advice...  Here's my bit.     
There cannot be too many native english speakers in your area, and with a degree in English literature TEFL may be a good initial career for you while you learn the language.    
Schools will , in the most part, insist upon a CELTA qualification (ask me later when you are at that bridge), but in the meantime why not try teaching conversation classes to intermediate level Swiss. I am sure there cannot be a lot of competition where you live. You could put signs up in supermarkets etc. A qualified teacher can charge about 80chf an hour in the cities, so I imagine 40 might be considered a bargain.   
Any teaching experience you acquire prior to a course will be invaluable. Although the CELTA is a very worthwhile course, you really only learn by doing. So why not give it a try?   
Good luck!

Also remember the OP is stating they are *thinking* about it. With my previous neighbours and lack of decent sleep for 4 months I was thinking of doing horrendous things to them. My wife and I even discussed hiring local thugs to seriuosly beat them up! It never happened but it was good to exteriorize the feelings. My experience and experience of friends has been that revenge or retaliation normally works. sad but true

			The Baden Area doesnt have decent Brocki-hauses anyway. Ive been to most of them from Zug to Baden, and the worst is by far Hausen. I recently had to decorate some office space in Windisch. I was better off looking in Zug and Zuri, both next to their respective Bahnhoffs.   
Hausen Brocki Prices:    
1990 Tv set was CHF 280.    
MC Hammer Pants CHF 25   
1974 Lexicon Set (With only 12 of the 16 books) CHF 130   
1999ish Ugly pfister lamp (about 12"" tall) CHF50   
Stained (formerly white) Ikea chair CHF 200.... We bought a new one for 230CHF!    
I simply dont know how these people stay in Business. Its almost like an insurance scam where they inflate the prices so they can set the place on fire, and collect on ""investory value""...... Not one person bought anything while we were there.    
There is a Brocki in Grenchen and they were willing to do business. The place was packed with Pakistanis and Indians and its 100% barter and mostly antique wooden stuff. But everything was negotiable. Got a full set of 1895 Lexicons in mint condition for CHF75. Baden/Hausen is a joke.

			Thanks for all the responses to my rant. I realise that it's important to keep an eye on the bigger picture. Swiss trains are cheap and efficent, which is more than can be said for trains in England. I don't actually think they should ban food, maybe just a polite notice to remind passengers that some foods are more acceptable than others. Music should be personal as far as I'm concerned. 
I can understand bags on seats when there's not enough space on the racks, but if it's just some attempt to protect personal space (common amongst Swiss people) then I don't have much patience.

Who did you buy it from? (answer:Orange), ven if it's for free as you've probably signed another contract with them which implies you've paid them something. They may send it to repair with Samsung, but that's their problem.   
Also, Ask them where it say that the screen isn't covered by a warranty?   
Do you have a legal insurance? (PrivatRechtsschutzversicherung). If you don't, I'd get one (costs 100-130.- Sfr per year) is they will normally verbally advise you about issues that are not covered by the policy (they don't cover buying houses, marital problems, anythong to do with vehicles/boats(another insurance needed, and advisable) and it's handy being a foreigner to have someone to ask such questions about.

			Your attempt at sarcasm is misplaced. Unfortunately, you no longer control the discussion, and having hinted at the reasons behind your split, you have left yourself wide-open for others to speculate on what happened and fuel the gossip. The more tactless will even question your handling of the relationship, etc etc etc etc. Read some of the ""nobody loves me but my mother, and she could be jibing too"" kind of threads and you will get a taste for it.   
This happens time and time again, but still people think that the answer to their personal problems lies with asking the world to provide comment. Then they complain when they answers they get are not necessarily supportive of their behaviour or point of view...

			Damn some people take stuff literally         Good for you but given the choice my wife prefers if I pick her up from areas that might be quiet at night or infested with super drunk people.  My wife is not replaceable for me so I take her safety and requests seriously.  Btw traveling between Oerlikon and HB is hardly what I would class as typical sexual assault territory.    
Luckily the Euro championship have been relatively peaceful but when **** hits the fan things can get out of hand very fast in terms of violence or police charge. My wife hates going to city on weekends due to the crowds let alone on Euro day. What I meant by   was that if my wife had to go to city out of  (as for pleasure she herself would not go near Euro cup area) then I would try my best to accompany her. It's called love and caring for your partner. Most importantly we appreciate each others company so any extra time together is time well spent. End of discussion mum        When did I blame the city?

the point is i dont need  as you say, to do this as a hobby!      you dont see why? like i said in my earlier posts i want to increase awareness of this kind of frauds on the internet and if someone like   (or her partner who got cheated) had made a thread somewhere about her partner's experience which is EXACTLY like mine, and seems like the same group of scammers cheated us both, then a lot of people would have read it and probably I would have read it too.

This is completely non transparent as a lot of people are not even aware they're paying this with rent. Well I think Cablecom says digital TV is included       
""   
but you're only allowed to watch it if you rent gear from them at additional cost   
So digital TV starts at 31 Fr. per month but it's not even digital TV as the box has only analog outputs   
Digital TV with recording capability is 25+20=45Fr per month and it's not even digital TV as the box has only analog outputs and even if it had digital outputs you couldn't archive your recordings in a lossless manner which to me would be the whole point of digital TV.   
Also Cablecom recompresses all signals to save bandwith except maybe HD Suisse but somehow I doubt they can really transmit anything without sending it to a big box where everything is reencoded to a given quality target.   
So all in all this is inferior quality at inflated prices and some smaller independent cable companies ( ) with much more difficult economies of scale offer unrestricted analog and digital TV for a lot less than Cablecom basic TV.

			I think you've already been given the best possible advice... however, I would like to reiterate that you need to keep your stepson out of it as much as possible..   
Do as your neighbour suggested, get it documented...    
On a personal note, I am so sickened at this kind of behaviour. I think its admirable that you actually had the guts to say something against the vandals behaviour. In reality if more of us actually stood up to these rowdy youths perhaps we would not have to be so ""afraid""...

			Watch out if you happen to be at a course when theres a team practicing for a mini-golf tournament. Yes thats right, there are such things as mini-golf tournaments. (but why not I suppose). They like to polish the area around the putting hole, and the starting point before and after they take their go and sometimes expect other players to do the same. Quite often I've seen them retake a shot until they get it just right, and nothing is ever said to them about it.

			When we were looking for a house over here we were told countless times that ""we don't let to aliens"".  We eventually found a lovely house with a very nice landlord, but..... the previous Tenants were German and goodness me, I have never come across such a dirty house. So we are definatley a better Tenant. (And I mean dirty unhygenic.)   So maybe the Swiss are a bit racist but only a few.  In 6 months I have met 3, the family opposite won't even acknowledge us since my partner who has a large tattoo on one arm and a few others sat in the garden without his shirt, the lady in my local Post Office hates me and the old Gent next door (but his wife is lovely.)

			Truth to be told.   
A big percentage of genuine pure Swiss are not interested in us nor willing to integrate with us or help us to do so.   
I can say truly that I am integrated with Switzerland and the Swiss way of life.    
I move inside an intersection zone formed by people from my culture and people ( swiss and from other origins ) interested in my culture.    
And also in another greater expat community that share common interests and activities.   
It is kind of a big zone and I feel comfortable within it, I have a good time and can't complain.   
I guess It will be much harder if not impossible to integrate with the standard swiss people in their standard environment. But I am thankful I don't need it nor I had in my 12 years in Switzerland, thanks to be living on the 2 most international cities in the country.

On contrary,it happened more than once that because of my errors my posts gave a wrong meaning and I was glad ,whenever one of the 'natives' did correct these mistakes or clarified what i meant,after all i initially don't want to give wrong information.

			Yes, car sharing is a totally different deal than car rental.  The idea is to provide for somebody who needs a car a couple of times a week but doesn't want to put up with all the hassle of owning one.   
The main thing is that it includes insurance.  So when you see that 10€ price on a normal rental car, it only works if you carry your own car insurance.  Those of us who are lucky enough to not own a car don't carry car insurance.   
If I rent a car I have to pay the day rate for the rental agency's insurance which is usually at least 50 Chf.  Therefore the Mobility rental which includes insurance is much much cheaper.

Perhaps another way to consider that point. Imagine that you are an ""economic"" migrant with skills useful to another country. One might assume that another country will provide the option for you to migrate there, or make it easy for you. Sadly, very few countries have skilled migration programs. Let's take Germany for example, it was possible to come there as a guest worker and clean toilets many years ago, but not as a skilled person. Result - massive skills gap, severly hurting the economy. Many european countries now need high levels of immigration to survive the next 50 years, but the populations prefers to bury their heads in the sand and pretend they don't need the foreigners. Meanwhile those countries with active skilled migration programmes are reaping the benefits of having other countries educate their immigrants and their economies are forging ahead.    
One positive aspect of Switzerland is that it at least makes it possible for skilled migration (though without the promise of citizenship, and when it happens it takes far too long and is too expensive, but that is another story). That said - this type of migration is only possible with a sponsoring company, and is different to skilled migration in other countries where you can enter the country on a migration visa without having a job. It should also be pointed out that since Switzerland has agreements with the EU most ""skilled migration"" is now coming from within the EU, effectively shutting out the opportunity for those outside the EU.   
Anyway, I think we are getting off the topic a little, I think we were discussing whether we encounter racist attitudes in our everyday dealings with Swiss people, and whether these attitudes are entrenched in society, or just manifest themselves in a few extremists.... To discuss the pros and cons of asylum seekers we should probably create a new thread :-)

			This is a big problem over here. (staff costs) The trouble is that the only place you can cut corners is on the food and this is what the customers notice. 
Bit of a catch 22 situation. 
In a family run establishment you probably have the best chance of Kosher food, as the waiters are working for the mother/father and have outside jobs. I used to go to the Handi restaurant in Oerlikon, because the lady there was more interested in keeping the customer satisfied, rather than the cost of the raw ingredients. Not sure if it is still open

			The salesperson was right. Rescission is only possible if the contract price is at least 100 Francs and it was a door-to-door or telemarketing sale, or if the salesperson explicitely talks about a right of withdrawal when explaining the contract.

			New transfat rules?? Would you have a link, as I would love to know the details of the new rules, and whether they are compulsory or just guidelines.   
By the way, if they are rules, it will mean that almost all fries, potato wedges, roestis, and 95% of cookies will have to have their content changed, both at Migros and Coop. Both even have many bio products with transfat in it. I really hope this change will be compulsory, it will improve the health of the nation (and its fertility! ).

			With reference to dry air, you should use   during the winter months. These are available during the winter months from Coop, Migros and many other retailers in a number of forms.   
The simplest are white plastic containers with a sheet of replaceable blotting paper in them. These are hung on radiators and filled with water from the filling hole on the front.   
More sophisticated types are floor-standing electric models, some of which send out a reassuring plume of condensed water.   
We always run our humidifiers from November to March.    
For those used to to the mild humid maritime air of the UK, Switzerland can be very dry in the winter - the colder it is, the dryer the air, as the humidity is removed from it in the form of frost and ice.   
All this has little or nothing to do with mould on mushrooms, but will stop the dreaded bleeding nose problem...

			Oh joy of joys. 
The secretary at work phoned them for me.  They claim they sent me a letter (which never arrived), but wouldn't say why.  But apparently, they've 'registered' her, but haven't issued a certificate to us yet.  They said they would do so soon, although gave no reason why they hadn't already or how quickly it would arrive.   
Then the subject of the marriage certificate came up.  Even though the woman agreed to exchanging the original for a certified copy, they're now refusing, even though the original is not valid for the purposes they say they need it for because it's more than six months old. 
So, even if we get the birth certificate within the two weeks we've been given in order to get the B-permit sorted, we're still stuck. Before we can get the B-permit, we have to have her registered at the embassy and then get her a UK passport before she can get her permit.   
Amusingly, she didn't need a passport to arrive here, but she needs one to get papers... 
I'm not really complaining about the B-permit hing as the time they gave us should have been ample for sorting these things out if the Zivilstandesamt hadn't been involved.

			Your daughter's explanation makes the whole situation that much worse.  If it were my daughter, I would have the teacher's head on a platter; my husband likely would try to pull her out of the school (after I pulled him off the teacher!)  I think going over the teacher's head and talking directly to the administration is not only appropriate, but also necessary.  Her neglect could have led to devastating consequences, and must not be repeated, for your daughter and the other students' sake.

			Thanks for the replies.   
I am just ticked off because it was not a cheap printer, it prints photos, really well and is a scanner and fax as well. It has built in card readers and is also only just over a year old.   
BTW I always ignore the printer ink messages until it stops printing colour, but we are to the point now where it will not print anything, the black must be just about out.    
My husband will be going back to Australia for business soon, so I will get him to pick up as  many cartridges as he can.   
It is not like I was doing anything dodgey, I was happy enough to shell out for the genuine brand inks.   
Hopefully I will be kitted out again and ready to print in a few weeks.

			You are being a bit narrow minded here. While I don't disagree that many countries/cultures work this way, there are many that don't. I have meetings and personal affairs in Asia/Europe/North America, and there are lots of different styles and values WRT to time. Shall I shun people from Italy or Spain who don't show up two minutes before our meeting is scheduled. Or deem those in parts of Asia or North America as disrespectful because they do not have the same values as I do?    
And yes, if I had a date with Scarlett Johansson, and received a phone call from a client, I would probably be late and hope she would understand. If she didn't, I would have to question whether I want to continue the relationship.        "	slipped a little	Join Date: Feb 2008	Groaned at 3 Times in 1 Post	I'm not a fan of Swiss Punctuality!

			People are rude to each other everywhere. Look at any democratic institution and you will see it. It is part-and-parcel of free speech. I dont condone direct name-calling, but at the same time some friction is necessary to enable the clash system of debate to operate and keep the discussion moving. In addition it allows exploration of issues and cases for views to be made where they would otherwise remain unexplored.   
I can think of many ways the forum could be improved, and starting a PC ""be-polite"" campaign is not at the top of my list.    Imagine the extreme scenario where the forum was composed of 5000 people asking one question each. I suspect there resource would be fragile, and the answers would have little credibility, as no one has had time to develop a base of knowledge.     
What are you trying to say here ? Some people looked, some people didnt join. Thousands did.    dave

1. Maybe there is a concept to it, like, have another coffee/sandwich while I'm waiting as it takes so long & I start to get hungry  ...or maybe they are thinking you could always stay for lunch/dinner as well as I really think I could stay there for as long as I liked. No, even better, go home, get a hammock & TV & move in !   
2. Keep the engine running & say the car will not start again if I turn off the engine!    
3. As long as my wife is driving, carry some booze, offer it around (drink it yourself when they refuse) & start getting really drunk, hopefully they tell her to 'just take him home' after an hour or two.     
4. Take one of my daughters pooed-in nappies (left in the sun for a day) in my bag & put it near the counter, they think then I have rear-end problems & will allow me on my way with what i came for.   
Thanx for making me laugh & realising there are always other ways rather than 'accepting' what I think are just the Swiss thinking everybody else has to do things their way.

			I sympathise with the original poster, and yes sometimes people go a little overboard to prove the point that something is their property. I must admit that in a similar situation I would have done the same thing and pulled off the street to get a little one into the car.   
I can however see the other side   you were to park there any longer. Last week I went out to the shops just to pick up some milk, when I got back someone was parked in my space and was nowhere to be seen. To be honest it p!$$ed me off no end... ...I would not have a problem with this if I wasn't using the space but when I come back and can't park in a space I paid for it is a little bit of  pain in the a$$.    
I think the person was definitely trigger happy for not ignoring it for 2 minutes.    
I have had a similar experience once for parking in the visitor parking in our own living area. I had given a friend my parking space and parked my car in the visitor space... When I got back I had a warning on the windscreen that I would be fined if I didn't move the car.

This is the effect of travelling and living overseas - it makes you appreciate the finer things in life, and realise what makes you happy. Things will hopefully improve once your girlfriend arrives, and you can reassess your situation then. Perhaps it is your girlfriend who you are missing and not Switzerland itself?    
Besides, you can always move back to Switzerland ... They say that ""home is where the heart is"", and perhaps you now realise where your ""home"" is meant to be?    
But take advice from the above posts, and try to enjoy your time back in Brissy. You might soon remember the things that annoyed you about Switzerland and soon you'll appreciate being back home.    
P.S. having said the above, I think I would also desperately miss Switzerland if I had to suddenly leave ...

			First of all, I always call the tollfree number, ask if they have problems on their network, and when the untrained person suggests I call the tech support, I ask to be connected directly. There go the 0.11chf/min. 
Then, on weekends getting any sort of help other than in german is generally quite complicated, although I must say that at least the cellphone support helped me a lot a couple of weekends ago.   
It might also be sunrise-independent, as it's swisscom managing the physical connection. If they're working on the infrastructure, you're left in the cold.

			I have just come across a similar problem with my apartment (I think it's similar) about the pipes.   
We are a ground floor apartment and every evening at the moment at just past 9pm we suddenly here this knocking noise, which sounds either like a tree hitting a window/wall or a pipe noise.  This runs right through until about 2am/3am.  At first I thought it was the former, because it's totally irregular - it may happen 3 times at 2 seconds apart and then not at all for 15 seconds.  Consequently it is really annoying, as because it is irregular you can't ""get used to it"" and get back to sleep.   
I definitely now think it is the pipes though, as there is a faint hissing after the first knock which then stops with the second.  Anyone experienced something similar?  Who's responsibility is it to sort it out?  I've considered talking to other residents but my German is abysmal - so no idea how I would explain myself.   
Should I contact my landlord and ask for it to be sorted out?  Is he going to be bothered?

			@Titlis   
I sympathize with you. Having worked here for over a year, I have noticed the following things:   
1. When I enter my apartment building and I see someone, I say hello and they say hello, but then they attempt to run into their rooms as quickly as possible to avoid conversation.  
2. There is hesitation to sit next to someone on a bus or train; people would rather stand just to avoid this. 
3. A friendly smile from a stranger seems to be an unheard of concept on the streets. Shop keepers are generally pleasant though.   
I don't think any of this is due to my olive-skinned complexion,  but sometimes I wonder.   
Regarding having kids just to socialize -- what a joke. They're probably jealous of you because you have a free life and they have to deal with all their kids' problems.

I should also point out that nobody is complaining about having 24 hour shopping prior to Christmas, and that the staff in the shops are paid extra for working in shifts, so they don't seem to have a problem with it either. It's just one of those things - I had to do it many years ago when I worked in retail as well, and I didn't think anything of it then either.   
Merry Christmas everyone!

			hi Hanad, does your family have health insurance? Is there a way to pay off your outstanding medical bill bit by bit each month?   
You've not given much detail, but if you are low-income then there are organizations which might be able to help you. Two are the Red Cross is Aargau (Rotes Kreuz Aargau) and the Catholic church, which is quite active in helping low-income families where you live (römisch-katholische Landeskirche in whichever Aargauer Gemeinde you live). I'm not sure if you've already approached your Gemeinde/Sozialhilfe for help?   
Of course I can't promise any of these will supplement your monthly income, but if you explain that you have an outstanding medical bill which prevents you from getting treated now, they may be able to help you find a solution quickly.

			Believe me, it goes both ways. Some Germans in Germany have problems with the Swissies, too. Ask anyone who has driven on A81 between Stuttgart and Singen only to be endangered by Swiss drivers that think it's an F1 race track.    
I initially thought it would be a good idea to pick up a few bites of Swiss-German when I initially moved here, but decided to give up on it beyond the occassional Grüezi or Hoi ... no need to cloak my heritage.

			My very firm answer is YES; YES; YES. The Swiss are Bureaucratic Freaks. They must have some built in genes that separate us them from us, the rest of the aliens on this planet.   
I am a from Singapore, which many people consider 3rd world (for those who still think we are somewhere near China, I get those sometimes, still  ). Singaporeans are world known to be real big pains. We want the best, we get upset when things are not free, when the food is not hot enough, when its not clean enough...everything. But hey, we don't make life hell for foregners who come to live with us or try to make a living. And at least the foreigners can set up their lives within 2 weeks of arriving with just some phone calls and not having to fill trails of documents and 'formulars', in languages we are expected to know (of course, in Singapore , we will excuse you if you dont write or speak our 4 main languages).     
While I consider Switzerland to be more sane place to live than the other EU countries, the bureaucracy drove me to tears countless times over the years. The years here does not make it better. As each day and year pass, you just get more convinced of their pure stupidity, stubborness, rigid and senseless common sense.     
Destiny brought me here. I was sent here for work, no choice really as you have to earn a living, then pure madness drove me to marry here, which does not help me now. I cannot leave unless my Czech husband decides to relocate as well. I still have my job, thankfully, my employers are extremely international. BUT IF WE HAD A CHOICE!! we will move.! He too is sick of this Swissness. After going through the hell hole of getting his wife through the Swiss red tapes more than several times!   
And so my friend, if you had a choice, find your paradise elsewhere - where the neighbours don't say Grütsi to you one morning and pretend not to know you the next when he sees you on the tram. Believe me, he does not wnat to get know you.  He is simply pissed if you drive a better car, wonder where you get the money from, wonder why you seem happier than he is or if your wife looks much better than his.    
But then he knows all about you, when you come home and when you don't put a sticker on your garbage bag (he will surely ring the doorbell to tell you to do the right thing, not knowing the bag is not yet ready to be thrown). Then they ring the doorbell again to ask if you work at all, since you are barely in the door at 8 pm and they say they smell something awful that you might be cooking! If you are a lady, the women hates you and give you dirty looks (well, the rumour is the foreign women, and men, all marry for the passport and money...)    
And the permits offices - they are all nightmares . They managed to loose my permits 2 times and want to make me pay for new ones when they lost them in the first place. If my Swiss-Germanspeaking-Swiss Passport -holder-husband did not intervene, I am sure I would still waiting for the permits to arrive. And they fined ME! for a mistake my employer made because I should know! My employer verified they were the ones who were at fault. But I still must pay!!! The ridiculous irrational , unbelievable and hedious care-less attitude of these administrators who love the fact that they could do whatever they want with us and we will just have to take it. It is simply to hard to describe the feeling when all these happen to you.   
I could go on and on telling you the horrors of my life in Switzerland (as a single arriver and later as a married woman) due to the bureaucracies.   
All the years I spent a a tax paying individual are not counted for. Now I hold a position as a wife of a Swiss! This really sucks. Now this is another entirely different animal altogether...enjoy the experience!!! If you still want to come....

			You know when you've been Tango'd.   
Actually, I was out and about fairly early (for me anyway, about 8:30am) on Saturday morning around central Zurich and there seemed to be a lot of crazy people around. You get the babblers that stare at the pavement, the ragers that stamp there feet and shout at passers by and the wanderers that are pushing some kind of trolley at a high pace screaming blue murder at no one in particular. The Vigilante is a new one on me, though.   
A couple of weeks ago a tramp on a bike was going at a fair rate along a very busy footpath. People were diving out of the way but my pregnant wife was not quick enough. This fella then had the audacity to try and push my missus out of the way after ramming her with his bike, shouting at her. I'm all for live and let live, but this kind of behaviour is not on - folk just seem to ignore it and put up with it.

			I have never seen more radiator based systems in the US as I have seen in Switzerland. Even my 1950s apartment complex in the US had a proper thermostat control and heater. 
Another nice fact: they turn off the heat for several hours in the day here  
I pity the stay at home folks.   
FYI a floor heating system is not a Swiss invention either.

			i think diem is pretty right. 
when you meet somewhere with loads of people in a pub or at a party, it's okay when you're late, cause the other ones got someone else to talk to / to do. 
or when you say you're there at 8ish (in german ""so um acht"") then it's clear that you can't tell if you're there exactly at eight. 
but when you say you meet at eight maybe at the barfüsserplatz ore wherever just with one or two guys and they have to freeze till you show up half an hour later, it's not very nice. Then it seems like you don't care if someone have to stand somewhere in the rain and wait for you...      
the other thing is that i think since everyone got a cellphone, the people are more and more too late. the people care less if they're on time or not. it's like ""oh, i can send him a message that im late"". but getting the message doesn't makes the waiting better...   
probably it's right that beeing on time is a swiss spleen. but i'm shure it shows in every culture kind of a respect for a person when you're there on the time you've said you would be there.

			calling the police should be the last resort (except if the noises sound like fighting).    
the first step would be to either talk to the family directly or ask other tenants how they feel about it. If nothing comes from it, write a letter of complaint to the landlord.

i wouldn't drink tap water in really big cities that have a ""pipes system"" that is 100 years old...like Bucharest Milano or Paris for example...but Zurich is Swiss, is in the mountains, the ""strength"" of the water is quite low (which is good for the human body) ...i don't think they have too old pipes cause there is no rust anywhere...and so on...   
and about the toilet...i saw at Myth Busters on Discovery Chanel a show about how many germs can get on your tooth brush if you leave it in the glass on the sink in the bathroom...hmmm...well quite a lot...the same as if you leave it 30 cm above the toilet and you flush...but we use our tooth brushes everyday and we are still alive aren't we?

			Hi miniMia,  
Yes, youve got the idea. 
I think bringing a MieterVerband rep might be a bit provocative, I think I will start by discussing the wc issue, and move on from there, because he had already agreed to resolve this situation, and has done nothing. 
But I must bring up his rudeness, its not fair to my clients otherwise. 
Thanks for your advice and support, and it seems I am already making a few friends here, via my Inbox. 
Once again, thanks everyone! 
Cheers, Morph

  You could be charged with Driving Without Due Care and Attention, Dangerous Driving or Causing Death My Dangerous Driving. All the prosecution has to show is that you lost control of your car and an accident resulted and once they have done that there is a   case against you and from that point on you are effectively guilty unless you can prove your innocence.      A defence that you were driving a high powered sports car that had bad road holding in the wet wouldnt stand a chance and I cant see any lawyer even trying that one         All that would do is tell the court he didnt know how to control the car.

			It's not just a Swiss thing.  My mum back in Australia used to get dirty looks for parking in handicapped spaces despite having a badge.  Like your husband she is able to work.  But she has almost as much metal in her spine as bone, not to mention the missing ribs.  So she needs the space to get out of the car and she can't look over her shoulder, but can only use the mirrors for reversing.  But nobody can see this once she is out of the car.   
She doesn't complain about it, and doesn't regard herself as handicapped.  But she does appreciate having the extra space and doesn't enjoy the dirty looks.   
She now lives in a small town where everybody knows her, so doesn't get the dirty looks anymore.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Apr 2007	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	People should just mind their own business...	Posts: 25

If you don't know they rules, and a company turns you away without fighting back, they win everytime. No service = lower costs by cutting customer service. Our company could do the same, but customer service is more important than turn-over. Some businesses can gamble with this idea, but we can't.

So I am now happily Grüezi-ing and Grüezi miteinand-ing everyone...but have just learnt that's not the done thing in Zürich. Funnily enough, we're only 30 klms out of the city, but life is very different in 'the big smoke' compared to here in semi-rural land....Anyway, I agree with the advise, keep smiling, it's so much nicer to see a smile than a frown.

			Yes, I have to vote for ""Intermission sucks"".    
Where I'm from there were great theaters, a wide choice of not only Hollywood but foreign films as well, and there was no intermission and no assigned seats. You could buy your ticket earlier in the day, but then you had to stand in line and wait for the doors to open. It was first come, first serve -- and beware the stampede. It was best to have your running shoes on to reach your preferred seat first.    
It was a great social event to stand in line for hours for a blockbuster and chat with everyone around you. There were others who took the opportunity to panhandle from the 'captive audience', some not simply asking for money but entertaining you with music or song first!

			This rule applies to all EU nations.    
First look for potential employee in domestic market, then EU, and then to non-EU boundaries.    
Germany has Employment Office (Arbeitsamt), where the advertised position from any major German or MNC is posted for local people to look at for a period of three weeks, before granting a work permit for non-EU.   
The same procedure is applied in Switzerland. No change, when compared to Germany or Holland or Belgium !!   
Although you see in Switzerland there are over few hundred thousands of non-EU employees, it doesn't mean that there are no EU employees available to fill-up the vacancies. It's all in the game.

			i think that the post was missunderstood.    
first, the policemen was NOT in uniform, so, his was the appearence of a perfect stranger making justice in his own hands.    
second, i do not support a child's wrong behaviour, (i would have said something to her if i've had saw her in action) and if you see the seeds this girl was chuckling (smaller than a pea) would be clear for you that the one who overreacted was the police officer, specially when i see daily drug-dealing on the streets and no police officer is at sight, or if one happen to be at the spot, he looks away, i understand, enforcing the law with little kids is a bit easier. i found it laughable.    
and last, as i originally posted, none of us saw the action, we just saw a very big guy catching a small kid. it could be easily a kidnapping case.    
what i openly criticise is that the police officer found our INVOLVEMENT wrong. what suggest that if you witness anything like a man hitting a kid you better walk away... would you do that? judging your words, i'm afraid yes...

There's a issue they feature some articles about Hong Kong (a year ago or so), but without reading the content, I already can tell that 90% of the photo they published are NOT in/from Hong Kong, I can tell by the way people dress, and the letter/language appear in the photos is totally miss-leading, I feel insulted immediately to know that my ""place of origin"" are being presented in a wrong, and negative way, but I didn't do anything... Good that I can finally at least say it here...    
this phenomenon has actually been in Switzerland for quite a while, you see people are putting up wrong Chinese word (some of them is upside down, some of them is flipped) on T-Shirt, Furniture....everywhere that make them look ""hip"", there's one time I even saw UBS use cheap Chinese writing on their poster...haha!

I had sort of a problem last year when I checked both the ""spouse of a Swiss citizen"" AND ""student"". They then returned the form to me, asking for the (stamped) confirmation from the university. Confused as I was, I went to the Einwohnerkontrolle of the Gemeinde (community office) to explain that the previous year when we were still living in Kanton Bern (we moved in Kanton Aargau), I didn't have to ask for this ""stamp"" from my school although I also declared the same (2) purposes of stay. A lengthy discussion followed, in which I reiterated that although I am also a student here, the main purpose of my stay is being the wife of a Swiss citizen!! (Believe me, it was as if, that is so hard for them to understand!!!!)    
I ended up leaving (about 15 - 20minutes later) the ""unstamped"" permit renewal form with them! Got my renewed permit after 3 weeks (I paid the rush processing option of CHF 30 extra).

			Ohhh, that is very nice of you to ask sorry also for colleagues...clearly I am very tolerant otherwise 6 yrs that I live here I would have gone to the other end (extreme though) and called the police...but as I said I can tolerate the noise even though I have to admit I am disturbed by it but I just then think if I have children in a few yrs and want them to play outside they will make a more significant noise and I will hate it if someone complaints about that! My concern is higher on the safety issue and as you said it will remain as so and noone is hit..

This depends on the type of insurance you get.  Some policies allow you to go to any doctor and for others you nominate a doctor from a supplied list - the latter option is a little bit cheaper.   
Dentists are pretty much like the UK private system.  If you have dental insurance (seems expensive) you can go to whichever one you like, if not it's the same but of course you pay.    
The other thing not yet mentioned in the ""excess"" - whatever policy you have there will be a minimum that you will pay before the insurance kicks in.  1500 CHF is not unusual.   
You don't have to wait until you arrive - contact Swica or another insurance company and they will provide all the relevant information.

Someone witnessed my car being driven into and getting badly damaged, left a contact note saying they witnessed it and the police said ""not interested"" because for some weird reason car parks are considered private property and not subject to the same regulations / laws as the street. I had to follow a private prosecution. Turned out it was a vehicle owned by the car park. The car park owners couldn't be bothered to hand over CCTV footage. Incredibly frustrating...

			Hi Nick,   
sadly your experience does not surprise me. A while back I was looking for a windows mobile phone and went in the shop you mentioned and asked about which models they had in stock. The assistant tried to tell me that a number of different phones which all did not run the windows mobile operating system did run it. Realising that the assistant did not have a clue I left the shop. Sadly this chain of shops seems to be staffed by people who have not got a clue about what they are talking about. Generally I have found Orange and also Swisscom shops staffed by people who at least have some technical clue about what they are selling.   
This is not a swiss problem....just go and try to have an intelligent discussion with an assistant in Dixons....now called Currys in the Uk.   
I suppose if you have a clue about the technology you tend to not work in a shop.   
Have fun   
Martin

Simon, it is pretty shoddy what they are doing, but they do it here in Switzerland as well. 
The Frauenklinik in Bern gets free baby formula from Nestlé, so all new borns that are non-breast fed automatically get started off on this. 
This happened with our son, even though the milk powder was hypo allergenic, he had some none too pleasant reactions to it, including periodic scouring .... doctors advice is that babies are kept on the same formula for a minimum of six months .... cynical marketing of a high margin ""shite"" (literally) product. Am sure this is not the only maternity hospital that has this arrangement. 
The little 'un is doing really well now thankfully, but still has really bizarre reactions to anything from Nestlé in the baby food department, different doctor has advised stay well away as the stuff is stock full of glucose ....

Famine isn`t unique to humans. All species are subject to it everywhere in the world. If there are forty thousand people in an area that can only support thirty thousand, it`s no kindness to bring in food from outside to maintain them at forty thousand. That just guarantees that the famine will continue.Every increase in food production to feed an increased population is answered by another increase in population.Mankind must face the fact that increasing food production dosen`t feed our hungry it only fuels population explosion, we must stop increasing food production..How? The same way we stop destroying the ozone layer,stop cutting down the rain forests, if we have the will a way will be found.

The thinner variety I think you are looking for are also sometimes referred to as spring onions or green onions. In reality, they are scallions.  True scallions are generally long and straight, and they are readily available in most Asian stores...Mostly, scallions, young leeks, spring onions, etc are interchangeable in recipes.  March and April are the best time in Switzerland to use them...after that they become a bit harsh.  You can always simply use chives,  , young leeks, shallots, etc...

2991	null	null	null	null	"    Pity a university professor can't see the bleedin' obvious. I cannot image how that report was concocted, but lets see what happens to paths in real life and not in the ivory towers of academia:   
On steep earth and lose gravel paths, bikes make continuous ruts while both riding and breaking. When it rains these channels allow erosion - much more than unconnected boot footprints.   
I have not walked in the Züri-Oberland for over 5 years now thanks to mountain bikers. The final straw was having to wait while a group of 30 bikers passed us on a walking path, only to have them stop ahead and run up to a summit as we walked past them. 10 minutes later, we had to stand to one side as the 30 mountain bikers pass again. This happened a dozen times. Apparently the group were going up 20 peaks over 1000 metres.    
More generally, mountain bikes and walkers simply do not mix. As the two groups travel a vastly different speed. I'm sure bikers would soon get fed up if walkers travelled at 5 times their speed and mountain bikers had to stop and get off every time a walker rang their 'bell' when they passed, or came towards them.   
Do mountain bikers get off as walkers approach on narrow paths? Or are walkers expected to stop instead and let the bikers pass? This is the problem.

			@rwb: That's a funny one. The lady probably thought ""what a nice young man.... fool."" I think you learnt your lesson there - sometimes it's every man for themselves (especially on the ski lift!)   
@gav: Thankfully I've always had good experiences with Zurich airport, though I was lucky enough not to land in a situation like yours. Features like checking in the evening before are awesome. It's one of my favourite airports. But since this is the complaints corner and people might accuse me of being too nice I guess I should also mention the things I don't like. Firstly that new set of gates - the ones that take 20 extra minutes to get to - what is up with that? Seems like a complete joke. Last time I used it the trains broke and there was chaos. Seems like they are trying to take a perfectly good airport and introduce features that nobody wants (like 20 minutes extra transit and having to run for your plane!) And the other thing is I often travel with my dive gear, so squeezing past the luggage limit is often something I have to do. Nowhere in the world have I found the check-in staff so diligent in enforcing the limits as in Zurich. Flying with the same airlines in other countries is no problem. Oh and to top it off, have you ever been quoted the price per kilo for excess baggage when it is checked? It was something like CHF150/kilo....   
I once had a nice experience at Heathrow. I turned up 29 minutes before a flight. The cut off was 30 minutes. No discussion, I was turned away and had to buy another ticket. BA.....

			Hi,   
I was wondering if this is the way it goes in CH or is this unfair?   
Case is I had booked a service appartment for a month from  25th onwards,  but now my coming to CH has been delayed by a week. Instead of giving me a penalty for 1 week, I am being asked to pay form 25th onwards only.   
Any advice?   
Thanks

I think what spmull wrote is true. The disclosure of all the personal data in your CV allows swiss employers to select personnel by nationality and race which can give reason to assume racial segregation.    
I'm for equality and against discrimination. However I can imagine that it takes a lot of time to work that over in Switzerland. The EU has adopted a new anti-discrimination law which protects workers of non-european descent. That would be a good start but it allows foreigners to take advantage of the new law and force employement, and that, in contradiction, can create new tensions between locals and foreigners.

			Hi Dragon 
Start writing a new chapter... a happy ending. So visit Switzerland on a new light, it has so much too offer especially if you like outdoor activities and fantastic chocolates. Every place in the world has its dark sides, but don't let negative experiences get to you. 
I had a very bad experience during my first year in Switzerland as I had to work as an intern in order to complete my studies in a small family hotel. At first this Swiss family seemed very friendly and open minded. But they were completely Jekyll and Hyde. They also had a fat witch working as a manager of the place which completed the horror show.  
As my German at the time was broken and still is, they showed no little sympathy towards me. I did my best to improve my German knowledge but they insisted in speaking Swiss German and used to shout to make my time a miserable one at that hotel. Interns are cheap labor... so let them think like that. I left the place with a horrible feeling and lost my motivation to learn the language... Threw away the books. 
Now I thank them for being rude because I made my way to other countries, worked at great properties, had fantastic experiences and I know that I will not repeat that type hospitality to any colleague / guest of mine. And I am learning German again! 
Let's wait for your new thread!

My comment was referring to the practice that some Swiss have of speaking in dialect to a foreigner, in some cases knowing that they won't understand. I think anyone who struggled to learn German would appreciate it if a German-speaking Swiss at least makes an effort to speak High German rather than dialect. By the way - take some time to settle in and you might see that I posted a rather long post about High German vs Swiss German in another thread. I'm a big advocate of learning the local language, and spoke German before I arrived in Switzerland.

3020	null	null	null	null	"    Interestingly enough I have heard plenty of anti-foreign comments as well as comments against people from other areas of the same country in many of the countries I have lived or visited, including the ones you have mentioned. That many Swiss are not as friendly on the onset as some other cultures might be is true but that does not mean that if one as a foreigner makes an effort to communicate with them in their language that they won't react in a friendly manner. Someone gave the example of him or her and a friend walking their dog and coming upon a ""water"" spot where a Swiss lady was trying to enjoy the water. As she had heard them speaking English she reacted at first a bit rude but as he/she spoke to her in Swiss German she changed her tune and nicely explained her case. Sometimes all they want to see is that the foreigners are making at least an attempt to integrate or learn the language and culture instead of just assuming that it is the Swiss that should adapt to our needs and desires.

			Just wanted to post a small update on this thread.   
The original complaint raised here was that cablecom is pulling yet another English-speaking channel and moving it to their digital service which we have to pay for. This leaves us with precisely one English channel (CNN) on the cable.   
So what do to? A letter writing campaign? Probably wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference to a monopoly. Many people will fork over the extra money for digital, and cablecom will laugh all the way to the bank by continuing to charge for the cable and then collecting again on the digital subscriptions.   
Well in my own way I've decided to do something about it. I've never felt the need to hand over large sums of money for a sky subscription - I just don't watch that much TV. I occassionaly watch BBC prime and get everything else I need from the Internet. But now that they are pulling BBC prime I'm pretty mad.   
I've therefore decided to go for a satellite installation to get the English-speaking free channels from the UK. To be honest I'm baffled by the various messages on this forum with all sorts of satellite technical talk - I've no clue. But with the help of Lob Rockster I've just ordered the basic components that I need. I plan to mount the dish myself and have a go at plugging it all together. A friend his giving me his own sky box to use as a decoder and the entire bill for all the other components I'll need just cost me 280 francs.   
Within a few days I'll have access to boatloads of English-speaking channels, without paying a single cent in subscriptions - all very easy and totally legal.   
Some of you may have been wondering what to do about the situation and whether you should be forking out money for Cablecom digital. Maybe you are a bit intimidated about all this satellite talk, just as I was.    
Therefore I'm going to post a little story in a few days called something like ""A complete idiots guide to getting hundreds of English-speaking channels for free"". I'll show you just how easy it was to set up, how I did it and a list of the parts I bought (I bought them all online). Maybe others will be inspired to do the same thing and we can all give a collective two fingers to Cablecom. What do you think?

Low and behold, due to Iceland's attack on the airline industry, the trains were packed. Oh, and we forgot to put up those little signs for the reserved seats, says the conductor, and no, I am not gonna ask those nice people that are in your seats to leave, and you're screwed. Sitting on the floor in front of the bathroom is not quite as nice ... so yeah, in the future it's air travel for me (die, trees, die).

			re: using several UN and PW. I have about 6 standards. I change the PW every few months, since several of them have CC attached. I often clean out my cookies, since I websurf so much I attract oodels of spyware, and viruses, even though I use Adaware and Norton. Also, the damn Windows XP has some sort of glitch where it won't let me view source if I have too many cookies in the cache (don't ask - it's not worth it).    
AND - just as users can be pretty clueless, a lot of sites are pretty bad. The Forgot UN or PW links don't always work. Or they ask me my birthdate to verify myself, something I always lie about. Damn, that one has bit me in the ass.    
Actually, most users will simply re-register at a site rather than click ""forgot"" blah blah. They think it's easier to stay there and re-register than figure out any account management or emailing back and forth.

			Heh, 
I am cool.   
With one-liners, included by some users, I am unsure if they are sarcastic, me-knows-all, or just simply baiting for a fight.   
I apologise for posting 3 threads on similar discussion.  I did not wish to justify anything, however viewing other threads by the same user, led me to think one-liners with some serious name-calling, is the norm for some users.  I think they are uncalled for.   
I regret that this thread turned into a firing-squad flaming contest. Sorry, I take blame for that.   
I may be a newbie in this forum, but I take issue with ""senior"" forumers who bully others when they do not actually see the whole picture.  Although they are entitled to their views, I hope they will also try to understand that this Complaint Corner is a great place to write something to take it off our minds.     
I appreciate that, any sarcastic comment is not useful to pacifying an ""angry"" person who write to this column anyway.   
I am sure those who are at loggerheads, are GREAT guys/gals in their own right. However lets just stick to the written topic and stop classifying others, giving labels or implying things about their characters.     
Come on, I posted less than 50 messages and I am totally understood and even ""classified""?   
One thing is for sure, I am not the quiet guy.       
The landlord's untruthful father, the crazy lonely woman and the (now quiet) nightshift taximan downstairs, do not warrant us to uproot ourselves again in just 2 years.  We will look for another house with a garden for our children, but the pull factor and not the push factor will help our decision.  
Again, thanks for all the replies and support given here.

In the US you can order it, sold in large ""sheets"" (eg. 6 ft x 6ft), from catalogs that cater to music enthusiasts. If one were intent on soundproofing a room, that would be an option, provided a retailer could be found in the area of the person interested. Just a thought . . .

			After having a threat of being made redundant I allowed myself to learn the law... When with a later employer I was made redundant I knew what I was entitled to and what not. It does make a difference and it is worth investing the CHF 20 or so in the relevant books. Of course if you cannot read German they do not help much.    
Another thing I never mentioned is actually taking out insurance, Rechtsschutzversicherung (yes Mark another one!!!) to protect you against legal costs. This is remarkably ""gunstig"" as you find out when you make your first appointment with a lawyer and find out what the fees are like.

Now since Zurich City has a population of 300,000 could we guess that there would be 150,000 residences?    
So something like 0.2% - but if it's the best in 5 years then I'm sure everyone is happy   I still have no desire to ever move (within canton Zurich) again!

3043	24.06.2006, 11:49	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: switzerland	"    Yes - there isn't anything wrong with the doctors in the NHS - it's more the way that the system is managed which makes it a case study on doing something badly (much like the UK's privatisation of the railways). In Switzerland's case high health costs are also caused by poor (read: inefficient) management. Doctors (especially junior doctors) are not really paid that much at all, especially when compared to other professions, or even unskilled jobs. So your high health insurance premiums aren't really going into the pockets of the doctors themselves!   
I guess the big difference between the NHS and the Swiss system is that because the government runs it they control the funding. In the Swiss system (which isn't really privatised) they just keep raising their prices and you have to pay more health insurance.   
Hospital management will become a big issue in the future, especially as our population ages! I still believe that private enterprise can run things more efficiently than governments - but the trick is that it is the government which has to set up the correct framework for privatisation to avoid mistakes made like that of the UK's railway network.

			Most of the time the barging on trams, trains etc does not bother me; I see it as part of living here. But having said that there are times it has made me mad; I spent quite a long time on crutches after surgery and still people would barge me out the way and not give up their seat. The other time it has annoyed me is when pregnant or carrying my son in a baby carrier, still no bloody consideration from most people.  I have noticed this behaviour elsewhere too; when in Paris, my friend who is permanantly on crutches as she only has one leg was pushed out of the way by some guy deperate to get the disabled seat that she was aiming for on a bus.

3050	13.12.2005, 20:34	The Architect	Thanked 418 Times in 115 Posts	Location: Zollikon, Switzerland	"    The difference is that in other countries you might have a document, but it's not the same thing, it doesn't have to be carried in the car, and you don't have to trot back to some government office for them to make official ammendments which you get charged for. I've owned cars in 4 countries and only 2 of those countries (Switzerland, Germany) had this kind of circus. In Australia and South Africa there was no such document, and 3rd party property insurance is also not mandatory. In the case of the US, it is also not mandatory in every state.   
My main beef here is that you are required to carry the damn thing at all times, and pay for modifications to it (and of course get fined if you don't). I just don't think it is necessary or serves a useful purpose. There's absolutely no reason that the relevant details can't be online to the police (as is the case in Australia and i'm sure the UK). In South Africa the police are probably grateful to get ammunition, let alone computers or radios in their cars :-)   
Let's consider this. If insurance is compulsory (which it is in Switzerland) then why not simply make me carry a letter (or card) from my insurance company which states that person x, with vehicle y is insured. You have the same idea for your health insurance card (which is also mandatory), why do we have to create so much work for ourselves in this case?   
Sure, some other countries may do this, but it doesn't make that right either! But I don't accept that this level of idiocy exists in every other country, because I can say from experience that it doesn't!   
But at least we don't have those stupid tax disc things here - so I am grateful for that.   
Anyway, the central point to this thread was about the fact that changing insurance to a more competitive policy wasn't easy. Finding and accepting the offer was easy, but I think that the process of changing was made more difficult (and expensive) than it needed to be. This will discourage people from changing, and ultimately lead to a very uncompetitive insurance market (Gav, if this is what you meant by a shake up required - I fully agree!!)

			@LordMonkey:   
Welcome to the forum - and sorry about you losing your posts. That was probably me restarting the server - I had some problems and needed to do some restarts (quite a lot of them actually) but didn't realise someone was actually posting - but you are right - better safe than sorry.   
I've only been to Singapore once, and must say I was impressed. Parts of it reminded me a lot of Sydney, and the food was edible, taxes were low and everything seemed to work. Overall, apart from the rain I had almost nothing to complain about. I hear it's not a good place to smuggle drugs to, and what's this business with a law forbidding more than 5 people showing up in the same place at the same time? Taxi drivers complained that the rules were too strict and told me it was worse than Switzerland - but then again taxi drivers always complain don't they?   
I tend to agree with your comments about the fact that they have to do 3 years' worth of training to deliver poor service is a joke. My girlfriend recently tried for 6 months to get a job - she'd partially completed university studies and nobody, and i mean nobody would hire her for a job because she hadn't completed a ""lehr"" - the funny thing is they don't even care if your training is relevant to the job, just as long as you have one. She worked for a while in a pub and at least did the things that make customers happy - smiled, acknowledged customers while they were waiting, and wait for it - wiped beer glasses if she'd spilled any froth down the side while pulling the beer. Isn't that just a basic courtesy? Seen it in a pub lately? Anyway, despite actually being good at what she did, nobody would hire her. Which is a good thing, because now she was forced to start her own business and is doing really well with it (though starting a business here is not easy!!)   
So it is a shame that we seem to have all this training for staff, yet we constantly here complaints from people about unfriendly service. On balance though that I have to say that it isn't all bad, it just usually is. I have had some shopping experiences where I have been so impressed that I've bought extra stuff. I have had some really great experiences in Ochsner Sport and Sportplausch Wider where the staff knew what they were talking about and they spent a long time helping me. I've also noticed that I don't have to ""hunt"" the staff down, like I had to do in Germany, so I guess I should be grateful for that.   
They say that sales staff are the worst paid staff from all industries, and I guess it is true. Swiss have often offerred this to me as a excuse for their behaviour (defending sales staff) as if it somehow makes it right. I retort that whatever you do you should do it with pride, whether you are paid for it or not. I used to earn almost nothing working in a department store. I was paid much less than the Swiss were and worked longer hours. It paid the rent (just) but I did the job to the best of my ability and took pride in my work, no matter how menial it seemed. I never complained about it.   
Oh - sorry to disappoint you - but if you think that the staff in the original store felt any regret about you buying the bike somewhere else think again. If they even remembered you they would have come up with any number of explanations as to why you didn't buy from them, but all of those would not have involved laying any blame on themselves. Revenge in these situations is not sweet - it's only for your own amusement and that's as far as it goes!   
@Gav - I know what you mean. We've both been here over 5 years, and even though I've pretty much figured it all out I still feel like they are trying to always grind me down. My girlfriend always says that she likes me much better whenever I am away from Switzerland - she says I'm a different person. I think she's right, I do notice that I'm much happier and jovial when I'm ""outside"".   
Just a note about the poor service. I think part of the problem is that service staff don't know what service is because they've never experienced it for themselves. How can they deliver something they've never seen? They should be sent away to the states or Japan to learn a thing or two as part of their 3 year training!   
I'd like to share a positive shopping experience (just in case people think all I ever have to say is negative). I bought some stuff from the online shopping site  . Now they were advertising a housing for a camera with an availability of 3-4 days - but I happened to know that the Swiss distributor had a lead time of 3-4 weeks+. So I ordered and made my order conditional on the information on the website not being a lie. The guy contacted me, and explained that there was a longer leadtime, and he was dependant on the supplier. Now I was really angry, because I was sick of being duped by Swiss online shopping sites - because they don't take credit card you have to pay in advance for products you find out aren't in stock, and then you are screwed.   
Anyway, to cut a long story short the guy wrote back to me in perfect English (his name was Scott) which lead me to believe that he was a foreigner himself. But it was also his attitude that was suspicious. He made it clear that he was willing to fight to keep me as a happy customer and to have me back. I was so impressed by this that I bought a whole lot of other stuff from him, and have always been back to his website as my first choice when I want to buy something camera related, even if he isn't the cheapest, or he doesn't have the item in stock. Mind you, when you are used to being jerked around, finding someone good makes them stand out like a shining star!

			Hi Mark,   
I think the comment like this is suffice to say Fascistic...as a person of Croatian background who came here not to live of Simons taxed money, but my rich husbands, I think the comments like this are more then too much. 
Slavics? Yes, but to read the history one would learn more... 
I have never in my 2 years time here experinced anything like this...never...maybe coz my husband is Swiss, maybe not. But, I see that I was not even spared here, and more for no reason at all. My point of writing about my husband Christian getting a fine, was for reason that people who do drive know this. It can happen to you as well. 
Not for anyone to abuse it. Not even Nathalie, who is unlucky to deal with it more often then some of us. 
I am just confused and sadden. Hey, and he is not even a Swiss. Wow... 
But, all I can do is turn away and let Simon live as he does. Hopefully, one day he will become a better person for this world.
