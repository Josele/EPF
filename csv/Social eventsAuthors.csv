2	Social events	Duplicate Calendar Entries - a known bug	Nanda	10,392	0	Location: Zurich	05.06.2007, 18:15	" 
			
			Occasionally you might spot duplicated calendar entries, for example the drinks nights starts Wednesday evening and continue through until Thursday night. Wow, well, maybe not many of us are capable of going for that long, but in fact it's an error in the forum, to do with the way it handles Daylight Savings Time.    
Simply put, if you create an event that ends at 23.00 or later, then the calendar view might think that it continues into the following day. To avoid this, please click on the option ""Maintain same time by ignoring DST"" when creating the event.    
You can also go and edit events to correct this, but this action will erase any RSVP entries.    
This issue has been logged and will be fixed soonish.   
Note: This only occurs occasionally.

3	Social events	Organising an event? _READ THIS FIRST_	Nanda	14,160	0	Location: Zurich	03.06.2007, 15:14	" 
			
			Here are the guidelines for posting events.        
The first thing to do is to decide whether it's a social or commercial event. In short, if you're organising a get together and not charging for it, then it's probably a social event. If you're advertising your business, charging a fee or hoping to sell something, then it's a  .    
Social events are group activities for all forum members. For example, drinks evenings, coffee mornings, skating, hiking, attending concerts, ski-ing, etc. There is no commercial interest for the organiser.  This does not include club events that cost a fee or have the aim of member recruitment.   
Commercial events are almost everything else. Comedy nights, wine tasting, salsa class, concerts (commercial promotion). These events have a commercial interest, whether there's an entry fee (concert), price (english breakfast) or sales angle (wine tasting). They should also preferably have some angle of interest for the expat/englishforum community.   
If your event doesn't fit the above, then it's probably a commercial event. If you aren't sure, then you can always send a PM to a moderator to check.    
Example: If I invite people to meet in a pub to watch Chris Black sing, then it's a social event. If Chris himself makes the invitation, then it's commercial.    
Please don't create invitations for events that you won't be going to (“Just wanted to tell everyone to go and see this great band...”). If an event is unclear, then you'll hear from one of the moderators anyway.       
There are now three calendars: social (default calendar), commercial and Concerts. This helps to separate the different types of event. To see the commercial or Concerts calendar, look at the bottom right of the calendar and use the “Calendar Jump” field, or see the 'Events' drop down menu on the options at the top of the screen.       
In order to post an event, you have to have a little forum history. Most people qualify pretty quickly. The reason for this is that we want to encourage people to be an active part of the community and not to use it just for free advertising. The qualifications are as follows:   
If you create an event and wish to edit it, you can go back to the event and click on the ""Event Options"" button. Then you'll see another button that allows you to edit your event.    
Please note that editing an event will erase all of the RSVP information. This is unfortunately something that isn't easy to fix at this time.       
Anyone is welcome to organise a social event. Although there are a small number people who organise most of them, this is an open community and everyone is welcome to create events.   
Post your event ahead of time - don't be disappointed if you advertise something last minute and nobody comes.   
If you plan on attending – use the RSVP function and say so on the thread. When other people see that others are planning to attend they may also be encouraged to attend - don't keep your desire to attend a secret!   
If you have attended then use the thread to post some feedback. This will help create a better event next time.   
In case you have further questions, feel free to post your question here.

It really was a bad connection.

I believe it starts around 20.00     
Apart from Sean and one other person I dont anybody, so dont be shy and come and say hello, Its only a little place so should be easy to pick us out!
