1	http://www.englishforum.ch/social-events/25899-poker-thread.html	Poker Thread	49864	206	"        Right, there are various threads about sorting out poker nights etc.... but all of them seem to run into a dead end.     Clearly there is a demand, so I thought I would start a fresh thread with plenty of details and actually get the ball rolling.     To quote my father - They dont make statues out of people that say they are going to do something, they make them out of people who have ****ing done it       What I propose:     Game: standard Texas Holdem     Venue: a back room in a bar/hotel/pub/restaurant which has bar service at the table.     By-In: CHF 50 per person, winner takes all.     Chips: If several of us bring our chips we can pool them together. Then just divide them up separately and ignore colour i.e. all chips are the same value.     Blinds: Start at 1 and 2 chips, then double each time a person is knocked out.         Issues:      1. Swiss gambling laws. Maybe the CHF50 can just go towards the hire of the said venue and drinks and the winner get out of paying at the end???     2. A full list of rules and also a clearly printed out chart of hands will be there which can be referred to at any time.              If you are interested in the above (or some variation of it) then post below, and if your location is not in your profile please include it in your post.     Once we have a list of interested people, I will collate the info and put them in lists according to location. This list will also be useful for anyone in the future who wants to play poker to see who is near them as well as newbies to the forum.     You do not have to be Gus Xenson to join in, and total beginners to the game are more than welcome, perhaps if it is your first time or you are just learning poker im sure we could have the first night for no money so you can get to know the game, and we could even play with open hands.     
I had one of these in the UK.       
..but alas, I donated it to a friend with 4 large silver cases of chips, would have been perfect for this night. Oh well.       
So just to sum up, please post the following info if you are interested:             
Also please add anything I might have left out or offer up alternative suggestions.   
Many thanks 
SC

			I think several public establishments will have a problem with you playing for money as that is illegal. You will need a friendly face.
		     
Please refer to issue 1       and we all laughed at that bloke with the 8 seater cinema and huge house when you need him? 
i think the way around it is to charge an ""entrance fee"" to everyone who comes through the door and then the winner happens to get said ""entrance fee"" at the end of the evening?
		 
			
			""You do not have to be Gus Xenson to join in ""   
or Gus Hansen even!!!   
Thats said i am interested in Poker but based in Geneva....
		 
			
			PLEASE CAN EVERYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN PLAYING POKER   ADD YOUR DETAILS. YOU NEVER KNOW, THERE MIGHT BE LOADS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR AREA UP FOR POKER!!!   
ONCE I HAVE A LIST, I WILL COLLATE THEM BY AREA AND THEN ACCORDINGLY ORGANIZE GAMES BY REGION.     
(Maybe i should i written the thread later and not when i was half asleep)
		 
			
			pat - Basel - Playing socially for a year or so, but nothing serious or for money (yet :-) ).
		 
			
			monkeynut - geneva - play quite a bit...would much prefer to play for money to keep in interesting - but in the suggested tournament format.
		 
			
			Actually, the Swiss gaming law as regards to Poker has become rather grey.    
The ESBK (Gaming Commission) has decided that tournament play with sufficient entrants is in essence legal, as the outcome is determined by skill more than luck (which is why we see the same ugly melons in poker finals).    
However, hand-to-hand (cash games) is illegal, because winning an individual hand is based more on luck than on skill.    
The Casinos are actually currently taking this to court, as they currently enjoy a monopoly on poker play in Switzerland.    
Poker games would best be kept in a private atmosphere. Having said that, I am interested.        
Then post your details so i can add them to the list!!!    
			
			Thin end of the wedge, etc.   
Next it'll be drinks and dancing.   
Tsk.
		 
			
			Sutter- St.Gallen not really played, but my husband played alot in the military, and is hooked, so i bought him a poker set, so i will be learning (i am a fast learner) over the next 6 weeks  count us in please   
			
			I am very much intereseted.   
duenni - Berne - played in some turnaments. Money keeps the players honest!
		 
			
			I just did a search under 'poker' and pmed loads of people.   
If you know of any other members who like to play poker please could you send them in the direction of this thread!!   
Thanks 
SC       
			
			Nathalie - Zürich - playing for about 2 years live tournaments only - moderate player    
			
			Hey    
i am here in Lugano and interested in playing, only plaid with friends and for small amounts.
		 
			
			Lee, Zurich, been playing just 2 years but frequently online and with friends normally around 50-100 and regulary take Brett's money! (Does that mean im good or he is bad?)
		 
			
			Come on, there must be more than 9 people on this forum who play poker!!!
		 
			
			I also know a lot of people/players and host around once a month but only ever invitational small games 6 people.    
Most wouldnt add themselves on the list but would come adhoc
		    My location is in my profile ... but I'll save you the click and tell you I'm in Zürich.
		 
			
			I am always keen for poker        All In!
		 
			
			I want to play with her        But not for chips.
		 
			
			Okay, a little bit more on the legal side.    
As I said, tournaments outside Casinos are legal, subject to ESBK approval. Under 50 players, such an application would be uneconomical (the application costs 300chf).    
Check out the    
So for the legal reasons, lets only quote Monopoly Dollars (MOD) as the unit of currency in this thread.    
			
			Per instruction:   
Phos  Zürich/Bern to Basel/Luzern  Been playing for as long as I can remember, but not consistently.  Guts player.
		    How about if we play at someones house, i would be game to open my door for people to play poker, provide nibbles, and beer       
I was half expecting someone to write that they want to        
Are you sure that your GI-JOE wont mind me coming round for  ??        
You've not added me to the list. Also I have something similar to the table you showed above, just for 6 people max really.
		     
Sorry missed that!!       me too.........her poker face is appalling , the smile reveals to me AK suited or at least JJ?
		     
Yeah, I reckon she must have a decent pair.......
		 
			
			Kevin - Duebendorf/Zuerich area. I have been playing since highschool with a half dozen buddies back home. Not a high roller though don't worry, just enjoy the game      
I would be uber-pumped to play some games in a good atmosphere without in-your-face people who take it too far! I'm not too worried though       LOL  erm............ nibbles cough splutter, crisps, party snacks   
			
			If the game(s) aren't on a weekend (since I work late Saturdays, Sundays and sometimes Fridays)...than I am certain!
		 
			
			I am interested. Zürich/Dübendorf from 6/14. I am a big fish I have been loosing money for almost 3 years now .   
But I would assume to play differently. Sngs are ok but with different structure.  Blind increase should be based on time, and ITM places should follow the usual structure on the net.(up to 6 players 1-70%, 2-30%, up to 9-10 players 1-50%, 2-30%, 3-20%). Or certainly we could play ring as well.
		 
			
			I will play, but I don`t think the structure works in the format you suggest. 
Firstly the bUy-In needs to be specified. Standard would be 100 Big Blinds. Doubling everytime someone busts out means the levels go something like.. 
1/2 
2/4 
4/8 
8/16 
16/32 
32/64 
64/128   
Assuming 10 players which means after 5 levels an average chip stack is 200 and so the BB is >25% of a stack. Conclusion? Donkfest. It is much better to have the blinds on a clock for a tourney.    
Most people who set up a ""home game"" start with a tournement and then migrate to a (monopoly) cash game, for the simple reason it offers the most flexibilty. When did you last get 10 people to turn up on time for anything? A cash game is flexible. You can arrive when you want, leave when you want, get up, sit out, take a smokie. I like tournements but think it makes more sense to play them online or in a casino where, when you bust out, you can jump straight into another game and are not left sitting around twiddling your thumbs for 2hours. Worst case scenario for a tourney is you plan your evening around it, bust out in the first hand and have no chance of getting a game for the next 90 minutes..
		    She has a pair of aces     
So I whip out have a royal flush.
		 
			
			How about a full house      I can go for two pairs, or three of a kind.  Afterall, I'm straight.
		    So you are coming to my home for a flush, full house, or some pairs       
You won that one.         
Yippee so am i good at poker , can i join in   
			
			Add me to the list.     
14. Shove - Zürich - Have some game. Profitable in Casinos.
		 
			
			On a nice day, with some furniture help, I could arrange something on my roof terrace for a tournement style game/BBQ.    
I normally play cash (monopoly) games and perhaps both can be arranged on the same day for those who would go out early can then play on the side.
		     
Sounds like a good plan!! (Looking at the list so far most people are in Zurich.)   
Just tell me when and i will bring brandy, meat, music & cigars!!!          What about little old me , i can also bbq, and sit in the garden   
			
			Karen - Basel. I have been playing for one year but so far never for money....I will start saving my Rappens.....
		    This one is easily solved. Bob Ciaffone's ""Robert's Rules of Poker"" is the nuts when a ruling is needed for a home game.        
			
			Dan in Zurich - been playing online for about 12 months.  Usually sit and go STT.  Would be well up for a regular home game
		 
			
			Interested currently play a little online and with friends who are soon leaving    
			
			Dan - Zurich - Limited ""real"" poker experience; some online.   
Willing to provide hotel room for a game as early as Mon (Jun 16) evening; in SihlCity Zurich. Assuming attendance would be less than 6 persons.
		 
			
			Ozsh from Zug is all in, please add me to the list
		 
			
			Hi - I would be interested in a game, living in Zurich, play online a bit and been down the Gutshop in London a couple of times
		 
			
			or even the Gutshot!
		 
			
			Mikey Broomers - Zug - been losing money at poker since my parents went on holiday and left me to my own devices about 14 years ago. Silly them. Not played that much, due to my tendency to lose...
		 
			
			Ratbert - Zurich - King of  
Okay lads, enough talk, let's organize a game shall we? Should be easy enough to find a decent hotel room in Zürich with space enough for a table of 6 to play for an evening. We can provide our own drinks and nibbles, and another 30 or so per head will pay for the room.    
Tuesday,  , which seems as good a reason as any to have a little  .
		 
			
			When do you guys want to play?  I am in!
		 
			
			In Switzerland so far 90+ licenses have been issued to play tournaments for money outside of casinos. for a list of all events in all cantons, check out       
In Geneva the best is      who have weekly events with different buy-ins. a good crowd, and very sociable. no need to pre register, you can just turn up, and maybe just watch for the first time.   
			
			Nice       - Zurich     
			
			What about Sunday? Or is everyone also playing footie with U. Max? 
Usually a good time to get a hotel. Mövenpick Regensdorf?
		 
			
			I would play Sunday if it is an late afternoon/evening game. Please keep me in touch.
		 
			
			Downerbuzz- Basel, been playing 7 card for years, Hold Em for a few months. I'm pretty good at just about anything though...
		 
			
			Any games this week?
		 
			
			Also interested in playing.   
eds27 - Lausanne - Played for about 2 years, mostly online and a few times with friends. Moderate player.
		      I could organise something for tomorrow night if there is enough interest. I want at least 5 seats filled so if anyone wants to play Wednesday from 7pm please send me a message.
		 
			
			Right, so far we have 24 people interested. (see page one of the thread)   
I think its about high time that i start organizing a poker evening.   
In the next couple of days i shall put an event up for a trip to a Casino for a poker tournement. I am currently collating the information required and shall inform everyone on the said list by pm as i doubt everyone is checking this thread.   
Also later i shall edit the list of people and have a link to the each persons profile page, so that it makes it easier to pm everyone if anyone decides to hold a game at their house etc...
		 
			
			Right, im going tonight to the Grand Casino Baden for the poker tournement.   
This is just to check things out before i post    
From what i can tell from their website it looks pretty good:         
If anyone wants to join me let me know!   
Dont for get to bring your poker face!           Sorry will not be able to make tonight,  but have fun anyway, and let us know how it was please   
Thanks
		 
			
			Thanks for the notice.  Unfortunately, I will be preparing to leave tomorrow for a vacation.
		 
			
			Looks like im going alone then      
I will give you all a full report in the morning!!
		 
			
			Last chance hotel, im leaving at 6pm.
		 
			
			I can't make it, sorry!   
But tournament in the casino baden are usually very good. I like it.   
Have fun!   
			
			Good luck Swiss Cheddar!   
Bit late noitice for me I'm affraid, let us know how you get on.
		 
			
			Didn't see it until now. Went there a few months ago (even had a date with one of the staff   ) More notice next time? 
Cheers 
Mick
		 
			
			Great night out. I will post an event soon 'The First Official EF Poker Night Out' or words to that effect.   
I will go into a bit more detail about last night later (am tired now) but will mention briefly that i was not that impressed with how lax they are with dress code other than that no complains at all. Nice Venue and well organised event.    
I lasted just over 2.5 hours, my mistake was that i folded a hand that i shouldnt have, then the blinds went up and i just bled till the end.   
I think also i left my poker face at home, it was my first tournement so at first was a tad dawnting.   
I cant wait till next time.   
Count so far: down CHF150
		 
			
			Stupid question:   
Anyone playing poker on facebook?    
PM me if you do    
			
			I've been playing since one year now, not really seriously though. I'd like to join anyway in case you guys meet around Basel.   
Best

			Hello all....keen poker player been playing most my life....still suck though......hehehehe.....

			I have been hooked for a couple of years now.....count me in for any up coming events too!
		 
			
			One more player for the list!       
Thanks!
		       
Im off to LA & Vegas on Monday and was planning on doing the Poker Night before then but due to the disease i have (lazyness) i did not get round to it.   
I will defo sort one when i am back.   
Thanks 
SC
		 
			
			And another one:    
Cheers
		 
			
			Matthew - based in Zurich. Played in poker clubs and casinos in the UK for a few years. Please add me to the list.
		 
			
			Kristen (plus hubby, Mark) - Zurich - played here and there over the years mostly with friends and family for under 100
		 
			
			Alright Lads hows it going.....i think we've built a big enough list i dont have an apartment as yet....but lets shuffle up and deal........
		 
			
			So despite all the apparent interest on the list it was once again impossible to get 6 people together at the weekend to sit down and play (See my event). So I checked out the pokertour.ch event in Kaufleuten today. I am a more successful cash game player than tournament or SnG player, but took the lazy option of the 10minute tram ride, rather than make a trip to Grand Baden last night.  
Anyway, the quality is absolutely God awful. I love Switzerland already! People happy to pay CHF200 plus fee to sit down and then play in a way where they can only ever possibly lose. I played a CHF200+30 tourney and then a 100+20 SNG. The structure was ok (have played worse and a lot better blind schedules, and the standard of play is bad enough to make up for 20% Vim so I will more than likely go again sometime, but would still like to find some like minded players for a weekly cash game.
		 
			
			If the list is still open;   
mirfield - Basel.  Been playing a few years but only played against real people a couple of times (plus a bit of Facebook poker).
		 
			
			Gwendy - Lachen/Pfäffikon SZ - just learned last month, still need practice on a poker face, total beginner but can learn fast...
		 
			
			Hi guys,   
Im looking to buy some nice poker chips, perhaps ceramic and cant seem to find a decent shop where I can go and not order online as the postage really increases the price.   
Anybody have some ideas or even a set they want to sell?
		 
			
			trollte - Basel - I've played online poker, and have been successful sometimes, and it's a great way to learn. Also had a couple of poker nights back home with friends
		 
			
			Zug - I've played quite a bit online and the odd live tournament. Up for some private games in people's flats etc. and happy to take my rotation in the hosting.
		 
			
			Check   link for the first EF Poker Tourny!!
		     
I have an 8 seater table in the UK which even has drinks holders. Its black felt and folds up nicely. Bought it from John Lewis with 3 slick silver cases full of chips. Not quite sure how to get it over here without paying some crazy postage.......but if you are ever in west london let me know.
		     
Awaits a plethora of green blobs & thanks......   
			
			hey, I live in Basel. I'm relatively young but I've played a bit and would love to get in some action...   So if you guys are having a game and wouldn't mind including me send me a PM. It's all in good fun after all... right? lol
		    You could go ""All in"", or she could perform a ""straddle""... yeah I know - hilarious!   
			
			Ben - Played poker for about 6 months.. Would love to join!!
		 
			
			I love playing poker and so does my boyfriend, its how we met. There are several bars in Zurich that hold poker games, so im sure wouldnt be too much trouble finding somewhere to play. I would love to come to something like that and also to meet people too. Im british, boyfriend is native swiss. You might not want him to play though he came 151st in the main event at the wsop this year, but does mean he has the buy-in for both of us lol.   
Hope it happens and i get to meet some of you.
		 
			
			Chad - Basel whens the next tourny
		 
			
			I've been playing poker for a year or two now and would be interested - based in Zurich.
		 
			
			Anil/May living in Zurich .. Played with friends a few times..
		 
			
			JordanElizabeth- Zurich- played every thursday back at home for about a year. also happen to be broke so 20 would be a bit better for me.    
			
			Geneva game can easily be arranged. We have a game going already, it's 180chf plus rebuys plus 20chf for the host/registration. Next game should be early in Jan. Anyone interested pm me.
		 
			
			I have been playing regularly for over 2 years. I frequent casinos, free rolls and tournaments. I live in Basel. Id be interested in a game if possible.
		 
			
			Hi There, I'm in Basel, and would be interested in a ""friendly"" game here and there.  I've played socially for the last few years, and a few times in the casino...
		 
			
			I'm  wondering if there isn't some way to organize this by location and buy-in?  I've waded through a couple of pages of this, and come to a number of conclusions.   
1. One member seems to be trying to do a lot of the work of getting people together.   
2.  I still can't tell if anyone has successfully gotten together for poker.   
3.  Playing in public is definitely NOT for me.  Too risky for so many reasons.  Has anyone actually done this?   
4.  Different people are definitely going to be comfortable with different stakes.  50 Francs is okay for me, 100 is pushing it.  However on any given evening I may be looking to play for more than usual.  Perhaps anyone wishing to host could post place/time/stakes/format and number wished/needed?  First come first serve as far as sign-up?   
For example:  [Poker][Zurich][date and time] 4 looking for up to 5 more for Texas Hold-em tourney, 50CHF buy-in.  Any other data such as 1st: 70%, 2nd: 25% 3rd: 5%. Data on whether bringing poker chips, snacks, booze is expected to be shared responsibility etc.   
Perhaps there should be some general rules for all games initiated through the site as well such as table stakes and the cards speak for themselves?   I suggest this only because while it seems most here seem to be of average competitiveness, you never know when someone will come along who takes things too far.   
Just some suggestions.  If things are working as is I'd be interested to know and would appreciate someone giving me the heads up on how I can join a game sometime.
		 
			
			I also am still looking for a regular game in Zürich. I now live in Pfäffikon (SZ) and would be happy to put something on, let's say on a Friday night, but people would have to travel 30mins from Zurich. 
Apart from that I suggest looking at pokerfreunde.ch for the tournement schedule. They have a homegame finder too, but it has not worked for me so far..
		 
			
			There are a few issues with what you have mentioned Stauff.   
We cannot make a game with cash involved as it is illegal in Switzerland. This means that any game has to be arranged a little bit differently and quitely.   
We did in the end get a game together but was only 6 people if I remember rightly.   
There are plenty of games around if you look in the right places and speak with the right people.   
Also a couple of good sites are:           
Because it is so popular, you will find it hard to get into home games here as most are always full. Perhaps hosting one yourself might introduce you to some players...
		 
			
			I've played here too.        
I don't really like it that much (organisation not great so can wait a long time for a game) and it is purely small / midsize tourney and SNGs, but it is easy enough to get to. I here also they are opening something up in the Old Town too.   
I can't believe my bad luck, that I end up living 5 mins from a casino myself, only for it not to offer Poker... Sheesh.

			jfd134 - Zurich , haven't played in a while but am ok. Used to play online ~3 years ago before it became illegal in the states. Would be interested in ~50 buy-in.    
Bit off topic - can anyone recommend a good online poker site here?
		   Hi All,   I went to a nice poker tournament on Friday hosted by      It was a nicely run game, fairly friendly and in a good location, I would recommend it to other people. There was 70 people there, I came 11th but went out with the better hand so not too upset.     This one was CHF100 buy in but there are smaller games as well.   I found it on www.buy-in.ch which shows all the local games.     I just wanted to share the information in case anyone out there would like to find a nice place to play at a good level. Im sure ill go again.     Trying again for another tourney     EF Poker Tournament   
			
			Hi Mate,

Cheers

			Jason - Zurich - I am terrible at this game, please take advantage of me and my money
		 
			
			simon_ch: love to play, based in Zürich, very big mouth, average skills.    
			
			I'll be heading to Grand Baden tonight for a couple of hours play. Thinking of the 5/5 cash game, and *maybe* the Omaha CHF100 rebuy tourney.   
Anyone fancy a spontaneous trip send me a pm.           
Hi All    
if all else fails and you cant get a game, then facebook has the best poker site on the web playing numerous tournament and hundred of tables every moment of the day   
No actual winnings but at least you get to play when you like...

			Just learnt to play Poker and am absolutely hooked! Would gladly host a poker evening at my home, tho' just for the fun of playing and learning more, not to play for money........
		 
			
			Avid player for over two years now; I'm up for some nice games if there are any...
		 
			
			John -  in Baden, looking for an excuse to banter and have a few beers, oh yeah and win all the money    
			
			Franky, Zug,   
playing for a while with friends. hold em tourney, no rebuys. 3-5-7 as well.   
would love to play.   
Cheers.
		 
			
			Jack - Zug/Lucerne - i play for fun     
my favorite rules were: 
The winner gets to keep the money in order to host the next party and is exempt from clean up duties of the next party. 
First one out gets to clean up at the end of the night! 
Everyone gets to eat and drink    
			
			I'd like to register my interest in a poker night.
		 
			
			If anyone is organizing a poker night in the Baden-Zurich area, please PM, hopefully I'll be available that night!   
Thanks! 
Patrick
		 
			
			Please add me to the Luzern list as of March 1st.
		 
			
			I'd be interested in playing some hands of poker in Zurich as long as it's nothing too serious/heavy.
		 
			
			Tore - have you thought of entering the lower end Baden casino tournaments? They have a CHF100 buy in Holdem tournie on Friday evenings and a CHF70 buy in on Sunday's.
		 
			
			Also worth checking    Lots of small buy in (up to CHF100) tournies in and around Zurich.
		 
			
			Henric - Lausanne - playing for.. 4 years on and off, mostly with friends, but ready for a challenge.
		 
			
			Kay - Zurich - playing for 8 years in tournaments, home games, etc.
		 
			
			Can anybody give me some information on the cash games in Grand Casino Baden?    
I couldn't find anything on the website about the tax/rake and what are the best days of the week to play (no limit) cash games?
		 
			
			Sindhoor - Olten - Playing since 2 years ..
		 
			
			Organising a poker evening has proven to be inordinately difficult. For those people who are interested but not on the forum every day, please subscribe to this thread so you know when it's been updated with new information/interested people. For the record, I am up for a poker evening (for real money).
		 
			
			Hey,  
I'm a novice player, new to Zurich. Glad to see there are sum other Englisch speakers here who like to play.  I'm tired of playing by myself on my iphone on the train. haha    
Been playing for a few years, mostly with friends.  I'm a friendly outgoing guy who likes to have sum drinks and play sum cards.  Please put me on the list.  Thanks!   
			
			i just play on partypoker. it's quick, easy and when you take everybody's money, there's no awkwardness    
			
			RonnyP - Zurich City, playing since about 4 years with friends and casino.
		 
			
			Hey guys,   
I organise a low stakes game every couple of weeks in Zug. We usually start with a 20NL tourney then move on to a 20PL cash game. All Hold'em, though there have been a few calls to slip some Omaha in there as well!   
PM me if you're interested in coming along one week, and I can add you to the mailing list.   
I'd also be keen to play in some games in Zurich, so if you're organising any please let me know!    
Cheers, 
Alex.
		 
			
			Hey all poker faces out there! 
I was a professional poker dealer for 5 years and still have very good skills... So if your poker table (in Zurich) needs a dealer, let me know with a PM   
			
			What's the catch?            Well, ofcourse it's not for free   But for sure it wouldn't be as expensive as in casinos - I know, I worked there and saw how much rake they take. So it would be a service on a professional level, but very cheap. I wouldn't do it for living, but because I miss it sometimes and I have a lot of free time.
		 
			
			Has anyone actually played with other EF members?  I have 
wanted to play a while.
		 
			
			If you want to avoid the potential legal issues but still get together as a group for an organized poker night, why don't you all just pick one (or several) of the already organized and licensed poker tournaments going on daily around Switzerland, register and attend.        
With a little ""Swiss diplomacy"", you could probably get one of the organizers to hold a private night for EF.
		 
			
			For anyone in the geneva area, there is a tournie at La praille shopping which i have just registered for. Can be donr online and is free so if anyone wants to join me - feel free.
		 
			
			If anyone's interested in playing poker in the Zug area then PM me. I organise the occasional friendly game in Zug, usually not too far from Mr Pickwicks!
		 
			
			John in Zurich.  Played home tourneys back in Chicago.  Would be interested in games up to 50 buy-in.
		 
			
			If anyone lives anywhere near Zurich and is interested in playing some poker, please join this group          
Only for people actually interested in meeting up to play poker soon.
		 
			
			Joined, but I am not holding my breath to getting a decent game running in this town..
		    No me neither. But this is as good a chance as any.
		 
			
			sounds good would deffinatly be up for poker. im in basel not sure were a good place would be to play thow. if you find one let me know cheers
		 
			
			another alternative is to play together on party poker. ok, we don't sit physically together (well, i guess we could with laptops) and we have to pay a rake, but then we don't need to deal and mess with chips either...
		     
Urrgh, sick. That is *not* an alternative.  
Shoving a stack is far more entertaining when you have a real stack to shove. Dealing and ""messing"" with chips is fun. The only advantage I see in internet poker over live poker is the hand rate and multi-tabling for people who play for a living, but it has far less social value as far as I am concerned.
		 
			
			I might have a seat or two this Friday for a home game.   
Would anyone like to join? please PM
		 
			
			Not available due to distance and weekend commuting.   
Anyhow, I will be in the poker event next week at the Basel Casino (Amneville EPT satellite). 
Any EF registered for that event?             
			
			One or two seats going tonight in Uster if anyone is interested?
		 
			
			is there ever anything on in Geneva area? really fancy a game...
		     
Well maybe someone very serious about it will get back... but I doubt anyone will unless it's a high stakes game (CHF100.- sit n go and upwards), which unfortunately you won't find on here.   
If you want to play and deal, then it's a different story of course, you get a chance to win + socialise + practice your dealing        
Our naturist poker sessions on a Wednesday have a spare seat... Always in need of a good dealer       lOl   
(message above is too short)
		 
			
			Next time you play sign me up.   Daniel
		    You are right... 
Well anyway, my boyfriend keeps telling me I should leave those days behind. So it's better this way          
hehehe        
			
			Hello all,   
I would love to join a game if anyone has a spare seat that needs a lively soul. Mainly looking for a social time with some good poker to be played. Looking forward to hearing from you.
		 
			
			Hi, I'll be moving to Zurich in January and would love to hear more or be pm-ed by anyone who's organizing or otherwise knows of poker games - I'm pretty much a beginner but eager to learn!
		 
			
			New to the Zug area, but would love to join a group who play semi regularly i.e. Once a month or so.  Got some experience though haven't played in awhile.
		 
			
			I fancy some poker to.  Shall we create a new thread as this is old and just kind of going no where?
		 
			
			There's a Wednesday night game running, you just have to find the right person to ask ;-)   
Was thinking of hosting too, I live in Seebach Zurich.
		   I don't think there is a need to create a new thread. The problem has always been that many people say they are interested, however the levels of skill, levels of money people want to play with and the commitment never really match up.     Whenever I have asked if anyone wants to play and actually offer a day at my place, excuses and reasons normally come out why people cant come.     I have a semi regular game at my place, normally falls on a Friday and sometimes Saturday. We have our regular players and generally its very hard for me to offer spaces as so many people are also on the waiting list.     I suggest if you want to get a game going, someone offer their place and set a date/event or doodle for people to reply yes or no and get it going.      Well i'll be in if it falls on a Friday or Saturday... :-)
		     
I don't think Wednesdays will ever fall on a Friday or Saturday    
			
			Country_Mouse I leave around Seeback as well. If you decide to organize something, let me know! I'll be happy to join   It's poker time!!!

			Hi. A couple of new players in Basel. My partner and I moved to Basel recently and am are keen to get back to playing some semi-/regular poker.   
It seems like most of the poker-ing is being done in ZH - anyone know of anything going on in BS (other than the GrandCasino)? We have both been playing for 4-5yrs at a moderate level. Happy to play socially as well as at a slightly more serious level.   
Please include us on the list and hopefully we can get something going in Basel. Thanks!
		 
			
			Without trawling through all the threads here I was trying to find out if there are ever some games in the Bern area? Small money ones preferred
		 
			
			Thanks for the game and poker banter :-)   
No idea how I pulled out a 50/50..  I'm in next week if that's still cool..
		 
			
			P.S. I enjoyed taking your money haha :-)   
I'll be donating more days than most I'm sure
		 
			
			TannyPhillips in Basel - I'd love to get together with people to play some Hold-em. I'm used to playing with college students in social tournaments. Never played in a casino setting.
		 
			
			Bump      .         
			
			Bumpity bump.   
Still places available.       
			
			I'm guessing the poker games died out since April?! 
I would be interested in joining a game, living in Zug.
		    Still going strong in Zurich. Game on tonight. PM if interested. Otherwise the Zug guys may know of a game more local.
		 
			
			I'm up for some Texas Hold'Em, just don't know where, nor what the laws are in Switzerland?
		     
Hi Upthe hatters! 
Where do you normally hold the games, how many players, and how late do you finish?! (oh and are girls allowed?!)
		     
We should try and get some other Zug'ers to play!
		    Full details posted earlier in the thread, see the bump.

		    Hi TannyPhillips, I've recently arrived in Basel too and would be interested in organising and running poker nights at my place in Central Basel. Send me a message if you interested in joining.
		 
			
			Don't see many (any) posts here for Basel poker games. I am interested in getting one set-up, ideally we would run it once a week. Please get back to me if interested.
		 
			
			My wife and I are in Bern, and are interested in playing.   
She's a complete rookie, and would be playing to learn (and for the social aspect, of course). I've played a few times before, but it's been a while and I'm a bit rusty.
		 
			
			Hi,   
I am interested in, Zurich
		 
			
			I potentially would have a seat or two tonight in Uster, would anyone like to play. Please PM me.
		 
			
			Hey guys,   
I just moved to Zurich. Looking to play some poker. I'm happy to play friendly games but also interested in mid-stakes games like 5/5 or 5/10 deep NLHE.   
Hoping to meet others in Zurich who love the game.

			Im trying to organize a friendly game (low stakes) of poker in Zurich. I live near Schmiede Weidikon and was hoping to host a game at a local restaurant once or twice a month. Please contact me if interested.
		 
			
			Hi Royce,   
I think you will have issues playing in a restaurant as its illegal to play in CH.
		 
			
			Hey guys,   
TRIP REPORT:    
Went to Baden Casino for a poker game Dec 27th. Games start at around 8pm and go until 4am. The stakes offered are 5/5 and 5/10. There was also a brief 10/20. (Note for beginners: these are not small stakes... hundreds and often thousands of francs are won and lost)   
There was maybe 8 tables total in the room. Several were being used for a small tournament, the rest were cash. I played at a random 5/10 table. Game was very well run and the dealers even helped me in english at first. I got used to counting in german fairly quickly. Great game overall, great tables/cards/service, very professional feel.   
Only downside, getting there from Zurich with public transport is rather annoying.    
-A
		 
			
			Has anyone mentioned Poker Palace in Dietlikon yet? It's above Toys R Us (lift to the 2nd floor). Might look a bit seedy initially but it's professionally run and all dealer dealt. Tournaments are listed on   and are all ""Freerolls"". Are they really freerolls? All I can say is it's very popular Wed-Sun and I can't believe that many people are just playing for the fun of it. I do know they run a lot of sponsored tournies for seats in places like Schaffhausen and even Berlin. That's all I know. Really.
		    Sorry, I'm not much for tourneys. I am pretty much only interested in mid-stakes cash (5/5, 5/10, 10/20).   
Is this Poker Palace just Freeroll Tournaments??? lol
		 
			
			wdavid - Bern - Playing socially, always with friends and with low buy in's (5 euros).
		 
			
			Oh well, I saw now that this thread is old... anyone still play poker?
		    That's what I want to know, any poker nights in Basel? I used to play in the UK and wouldn't mind getting back into it.
		 
			
			ElChe, Zurich, play with friends and occasionally at casinos when I travel.
		    Game on tonight in Kreis 3, regular, small stakes , informal.   
PM if interested.

2	http://www.englishforum.ch/social-events/8213-duplicate-calendar-entries-known-bug.html	Duplicate Calendar Entries - a known bug	10392	0	" 
			
			Occasionally you might spot duplicated calendar entries, for example the drinks nights starts Wednesday evening and continue through until Thursday night. Wow, well, maybe not many of us are capable of going for that long, but in fact it's an error in the forum, to do with the way it handles Daylight Savings Time.    
Simply put, if you create an event that ends at 23.00 or later, then the calendar view might think that it continues into the following day. To avoid this, please click on the option ""Maintain same time by ignoring DST"" when creating the event.    
You can also go and edit events to correct this, but this action will erase any RSVP entries.    
This issue has been logged and will be fixed soonish.   
Note: This only occurs occasionally.

3	http://www.englishforum.ch/social-events/8099-organising-event-_read-first_.html	Organising an event? _READ THIS FIRST_	14160	0	" 
			
			Here are the guidelines for posting events.        
The first thing to do is to decide whether it's a social or commercial event. In short, if you're organising a get together and not charging for it, then it's probably a social event. If you're advertising your business, charging a fee or hoping to sell something, then it's a  .    
Social events are group activities for all forum members. For example, drinks evenings, coffee mornings, skating, hiking, attending concerts, ski-ing, etc. There is no commercial interest for the organiser.  This does not include club events that cost a fee or have the aim of member recruitment.   
Commercial events are almost everything else. Comedy nights, wine tasting, salsa class, concerts (commercial promotion). These events have a commercial interest, whether there's an entry fee (concert), price (english breakfast) or sales angle (wine tasting). They should also preferably have some angle of interest for the expat/englishforum community.   
If your event doesn't fit the above, then it's probably a commercial event. If you aren't sure, then you can always send a PM to a moderator to check.    
Example: If I invite people to meet in a pub to watch Chris Black sing, then it's a social event. If Chris himself makes the invitation, then it's commercial.    
Please don't create invitations for events that you won't be going to (“Just wanted to tell everyone to go and see this great band...”). If an event is unclear, then you'll hear from one of the moderators anyway.       
There are now three calendars: social (default calendar), commercial and Concerts. This helps to separate the different types of event. To see the commercial or Concerts calendar, look at the bottom right of the calendar and use the “Calendar Jump” field, or see the 'Events' drop down menu on the options at the top of the screen.       
In order to post an event, you have to have a little forum history. Most people qualify pretty quickly. The reason for this is that we want to encourage people to be an active part of the community and not to use it just for free advertising. The qualifications are as follows:   
If you create an event and wish to edit it, you can go back to the event and click on the ""Event Options"" button. Then you'll see another button that allows you to edit your event.    
Please note that editing an event will erase all of the RSVP information. This is unfortunately something that isn't easy to fix at this time.       
Anyone is welcome to organise a social event. Although there are a small number people who organise most of them, this is an open community and everyone is welcome to create events.   
Post your event ahead of time - don't be disappointed if you advertise something last minute and nobody comes.   
If you plan on attending – use the RSVP function and say so on the thread. When other people see that others are planning to attend they may also be encouraged to attend - don't keep your desire to attend a secret!   
If you have attended then use the thread to post some feedback. This will help create a better event next time.   
In case you have further questions, feel free to post your question here.

			I see Zurich and Basel but no Lausanne or Geneva. Am I missing it or do we just have less people into photography down here?
		 
			
			Not sure if it is less people, but more people who speak French. There is a group that meets monthly:       
Quite an international group. However, there is a lot more French spoken at meetings than for the Zurich and Basel clubs.

			Despite the fact that INTJ-types are often perceived as asocial...there is still a need for these people to be social from time to time (myself included). However, to the INTJ the very idea of socializing can often be deemed as a trite and banal experience for myriad reasons.        
So...in the spirit of experimentation...I wonder what would happen if a bunch of INTJs gathered in one spot? Would nothing happen? Or would the reality that everyone else at the gathering is likely awkward provide a point of relief?    
I for one would likely sit quietly for 30-minutes and begin calculating statistics on every random observation possible. Others might just fidget about hoping there is no need to actually start a conversation...and if one does start it better be meaningful!   
As a pre-scheduling bit of due diligence...would such a meeting even work, in theory? Too esoteric perhaps? Who knows: either nothing will happen...or not.
		 
			
			My two cents: I can't think of anything less appealing than a party where I knew in advance everyone there would have a personality similar to my own. For me the whole point of socializing is that people are so gloriously different from each other.   
But I have no idea whether I'm an INTJ or not. Perhaps I'm not and if I were I'd feel differently.
		    As a kinda-INTJ-probably, I don't think the idea of an event for people 'like us' is a bad idea but I'd rather have a board or card game evening where people can be social if they want. Carcassonne or bridge or something. That may be orthogonal to the INTJ definition of likely attendees, however.
		    I guess if you have to ask yourself the question then you're probably not.   
I had to google it so I guess I'm not either.   
			
			It would be one quiet party    
Maybe have it in a giant kitchen    
you can take the test online
		 
			
			Just need to find a venue with lots of corners.   
Anyway. What about the rest of us ""I""s?  Don't we get a party?     
Assemble your invite list here          Sounds great, actually. Would make me feel nice and really not uncomfortable about dreaded scripted scenarios I am supposed to fit in. I imagine it quite exciting, all the unpredictable turns and interesting bits of info. Knowing myself, I would show up with a back up briefcase full off stuffs to entertain me with, hahah.    
INTJs gel together. They just get uncomfortable, sometimes, about societal routines, stereotypes and rituals that don't make much sense or aren't necessarily needed yet still expected. So while they might not have the patience to chill with others, go through dates or pointless work meetings, they actually look for other INTJs, in my experience. We are all INTJs in a family, our reunions are pretty hilarious and intense.   
When's the party?
		 
			
			My wild speculation:  The INTJs party would fragment into higher resolutions of the INTJ type.   
In other words, if the sample population is strictly INTJ, what fractions can we detect within that population?  Can we segment a group of INTJs into ENTPs, INTJs, ENTJs, INTPs, etc, etc.   
I would anticipate that we can.  So, as an INTJ, you might find yourself the rockstar, or you might find yourself the nerd of nerds, amongst the herd of INTJs   
Has anyone taken the test with a span of years in between?  We took it as incoming freshman, and again our senior year in university.  I went from INTJ to  , approaching ENTP, .., but then I was an idiot Freshman year.   
I was a seasoned, comparatively experienced idiot by graduation    
BTW, the   are rather interesting.  Check out the wheel chart on cognitive function.  Neat stuff.
		 
			
			The strang..ahem, most special attempt at socialising I have seen so far....   
			
			I'm an Infp, very strongly n and p ( for example, I score no j points at all). Have been for about 15 years, though I once tested Entp.  I have become more I over time. It doesn't mean I'm antisocial but I prefer small groups to large and find large social events exhausting.
		    It would have to be tidy kitchen, otherwise the element governing compliance would initiate order and tidying up would ensue.   
It's a great question from the OP. I'm also an INTJ and have often been called a bore at work, as I'm the quiet one, doesn't get sh1tfaced at the works parties and sits smugly the day after without the hang-over etc. At some points it has really got my back up, but now I just don't care. It is however a pretty good tool to use at work when you know what someone else's overview is, as you can alter how you deal with certain people with certain profiles.   
In a room full of other INTJ's? It'd be a quiet, contemplative first 15/20mins I think. People respecting other peoples space. Sounds perfectly idyllic.
		    This is the first image that came to my mind after reading OP and thinking of a party like this. And I'm ""Intj"" too, apparently..       
Anyways. I hope it could actually work, so have fun everyone.
		 
			
			Weird pic, but pretty cool. What/where is it from?
		 
			
			ISFJ here - I actually don't think the idea is a bad one, but I'm also somebody who enjoys learning and talking about the Myers Briggs. Perhaps you might get a bigger haul of people if you opened it up to, say, introverts? Or even people who shared two of your letters?
		 
			
			i've never met another intj.. maybe out of curiosity to see another 'unicorn' but wouldn't it be better to invite people who you might get along with?       
'This more or less limits their pool of friends to fellow Analysts (NT) and Diplomat (NF) types'   
i've found i get along better with the cheerful, pass the champagne types though, and amazed in a 'how did they do that' way by the more diplomatic types, rather than analytical.
		    This is quite an interesting topic. Im an ESFJ and am curious how an ISFJ would be. Could make for an interesting gathering.
		 
			
			Very interesting topic! How about this for description:    OR        
			
			Never heard this acronym before so had to look it up.   
Now I am worried I am one     
But definitely will not join the party     
			
			I wouldn't get too concerned about the Myers-Briggs stuff, although it's still popular it's not really supported by recent evidence on personality research.  Models such as OCEAN are what tend to be used now when it needs to be valid e.g. research, recruitment, assessment etc.    
In any case we tend to over-focus on the individual's personality and forget that the situation has a greater affect - consider an INTJ's behaviour in church on a Sunday morning and then supporting their soccer team on Sunday afternoon - it's not like people go from situation to situation behaving the same way.   
Myers-Briggs a bit of fun IMO, like horoscopes!
		 
			
			I started answering the questions but got bored after the first six and gave up.   
What letters do I get?
		 
			
			I never progressed beyond Jung's four colours.  I am Blue; on the red side        TDL!     ...:d
		    I would say:   
ADHD        In the old ""teach a man to fish tradition"":   
1. Open up a separate browser to images.google.com. 
2. Click down on the image and drag it into the edit box in browser.   
(TL;DR: it's from the movie Village of the Damned).   
EDIT: Even easier, if you're using Chrome, right-click on the image (probably a long press in Android) and select 'Search google for this image'.
		    Indeed. Performers can be quite introverted, focused on being immersed. I never liked being in the spotlight, guys had to push me.       It only gets worse    
Anyways, the test feels incredibly gimmicky and tabloid, the sentences can often be quite ambiguous, too. It's funny to read the descriptions, though, pretty accurate.    
An INTJ event sounds good fun.. Let's figure out a more poetic name. And, I do not think it's particularly a geek/nerd thing, either.
		    That's one of the problems with the Myers-Briggs stuff - there'a a high chance if you do the test again, even after a short period of time, you come back with a different rating.  That's not a good sign that it tells you something fundamental about yourself.
		    I imagine the OCEAN method tries for higher resolution[?], but can any of these tests control for someone trying to game their results into what they think is a ""favorable"" personality type?     
RISK is another test type I've heard of, but never interacted with.   
Anyone remember Enneagrams?  Tried reading into it, but was repelled at the time.  Now that the brain is good and broken   in, I suppose boredom could propel me through another pass.      Of course not.  Nerds, Geeks, these were mere descriptors of the larval stage of many of the people I know today.        Not quite.  OCEAN is a five-factor model of personality.  Myers-Briggs actually identifies more elements that this model, and it is suggested that therefore it is inventing personality aspects that are not real, because further analysis shows the number of elements can be reduced.  Moreover, the MBTI model misses some elements of the five-factor model, so it is neither comprehensive in describing personality, nor especially valid as it has unsubstantiated elements.  If that makes sense?
		 
			
			Favorable personality type...hmmm. Mine would be one that tolerates umbrellas. Today especially.    
I wonder if there's a hierarchy with EQ, SQ and IQ; SQ has quite often seemed overrated to me, but that's a deficit of sorts.    
Myers feels like a peptalk. ""Feel good"" kind of assessment. (Ignoring the ""why we suck at dating"" bit).
		    We suck(ed) at dating likely because its pure anticipation. When one has a tendency to calculate/assess every possible in and out of a date...this often causes one to shy away from the reality and actual purpose of why the date was supposed happen in the first place. I finally got around this by drinking multiple pints quickly to remove myself from...myself.   
Oddly, I don't favor inebriation overall. I drink to a logical point and then maintain that balance. Some people/nerds don't drink be cause they view it as a completely irrational act. I used to feel this way too...but then I realized that what is ""normal"" is to unwind/socialize via some type of vise.   
Anyway...the thread gained some interest. It had been up for weeks without a look until yesterday it seems. It sounds like there is some interest in trying this out though. Should we not form a committee and examine the possibility further? I don't think expanding the list to those who self identify as ""nerds"" would work. There are many types of nerds...and many are not INTJ-style awkward. Getting those people together was the original thought. Imagine Willy Wonka and Thomas Jefferson in the same room? What could happen? Thrilling the thought is it not?
		    ISTJ....solidly....every single time over a span of 20 years ...never even a hint of any other profile    
			
			Edited for clarity     
The real Myers Briggs is fairly long - 100 or so items with good reliability. What many people are used to is the Kiersey temperament sorter - you can pick it off the Internet, 20 or so questions. I'm incredibly consistent on both of these.    
I think it's a useful tool in organizations to help understand interactions and communication preferences.
		    sounds good in theory, but first its just one game, then its best of three, then best of six and then they don't want to sleep with you anymore
		 
			
			Maybe a classic movie night and people can discuss about how smart/stupid the movie is or anything else afterwards with drinks and light music?    
I might be one of INTJs and I love board game!
		    So, I did another online test and found which letters I get.   
Apparently I'm an ADD.
		    Or may be here:    
Regards
		    May be the fact that you get different result in such a short time does tell you something fundamental about yourself.   
Regards

			In an ever evolving chain of discovery...it turns out for most of my 42 years of life, and for a great majority of them, I have been under the influence of an undiagnosed anxiety disorder.    
How was I supposed to know what felt normal? Up until last year, I had felt the same way since I was 8. My point...who we are and how we identify with ourselves is a rather daunting task. To truly know yourself takes courage beyond measure.    
I really think I have many of the attributes of an INTJ person.  But oddly enough,  the same percentage of INTJ folk seems to equal the percentage of those who have a genuine anxiety issue. Do they correlate en mass? I can't say...but for me is true.

			Myers Briggs are tendencies and preferences. You can learn how to be other than your type. I'm naturally introvert, but people are often very surprised to hear it, because I've learned how to be social and appear extrovert.
		 
			
			a little something introverts will find funny..          haha, love it!
		 
			
			Actually, a couple of years ago, I stumbled upon a small group of wine geeks during a holiday in San Francisco. Although I'm no wine expert, the connection was immediate and powerful. At some point, the conversation stirred towards Meyer Briggs and it was amusing to discover that every single one of us was an INT(P/J).    
Most fun I've had in ages. I would attend to such party anytime.

			I've been meaning to attend this for quite a while now, but it's the first time I'm going to be able to make it. Looking forward to it    
			
			Regarding the meeting on February 2nd we will try to read an interview and have a discussion about it. 
Here's the article:       
It is an interview with the founder of ""The Body Shop"", Anita Roddick. 
I will have copies of the article to give out.
		 
			
			Hello to all members of the Conversation Group. 
I need your help.   
Last time we had at least some structure with the text. 
My question:  
Shall we go on like this?  
Some feedback would help, what could be done better? 
Does anybody wish to have a topic discussed? Let me know.   
I for sure know that I have to be better prepared when bringing a text to the group (at least translate the keywords in english).   
Thanks for your help
		 
			
			For tomorrow, Feb9th,I selected following article:      Renate Mann, 24, studiert Landschaftsplanung an der  Technischen Universität München-Weihenstephan.  Sie verbrachte ein halbes Jahr in Rom . 
""Ich hatte das Gefühl, meine Wurzeln kappen zu müssen, weg von zu Hause. Nach Rom. Dort habe ich etwas ganz anderes studiert: Geisteswissenschaften. Ein schönes Gefühl, ich unter hunderten von Geisteswissenschaftlern, an der Sapienza. Die Uni ist so riesig, dass an den Wegweisern dort eigentlich Kilometerangaben stehen müssten. Und die Großstadt - der totale Schock. Wegen einer Mensakarte musste ich bis ins Finanzministerium. Kelheim, wo ich herkomme, kommt mir im Vergleich vor wie ein Spielzeugland. In der ersten Vorlesung ,Wittgenstein und Ästhetik' habe ich einen Spanier kennen gelernt. Eigentlich wollte ich ja in die italienische Kultur eintauchen - habe dann aber kapiert, dass das nur bis zu einem bestimmten Punkt geht. Gewohnt habe ich zuerst bei einem Ehepaar, in einem Sechs-Quadratmeter-Zimmer. Die Frau hat sich schon aufgeregt, wenn Fingerabdrücke auf dem Kühlschrank waren. Na ja, ich habe mich mit ihr gezofft - und hinterher ging's mir besser. Ich habe das gebraucht, allein zurechtzukommen. Und ich habe mich verliebt. In Juan, den Spanier aus der ersten Vorlesung.""    
			
			The topic for the next meeting, February 16th, is:   
Food from your homeland !!!   
So prepare yourself (or not). The topic will be discussed the first hour, afterwards we return to freestyle.
		 
			
			Going for the first time.  Looking forward to meeting some of you and sharpening up my German!
		 
			
			I am coming for the first time too, it looks very interesting this meeting :-D 
a good way to know people and improve my bad german       No need too improve bad german. We try to improve the good german...   
			
			Hello, I would love to come although it might be slightly late(7-ish) since I have to wait for my wife to come back from work first. Is there in the area carpark?
		    Hi, the location is right above the Parkhaus Gessnerallee:       
Take the Exit ""Theater"" and you will be right in front of Stall 6.   
Please RSVP so I have an idea about the number of people attending.
		     
Yes, there's one close to the Stall 6, on the left side of the road after 200mt. It's an underground parking space which is quite expensive. Honestly I had no chance to check for other parking space at the moment, but I'm confident there will be some near there. 
I usually prefer that one because I left late from work or home, so no chance to go round and round to look for something else.
		    what is rspv, and how do i do it? 
Anyway it is going to be just me        
You can do that in the grey section of this thread. Just click yes and submit. Your name will appear in the list above. But as long as I know that you are coming that's ok. Guess you have all information you need to get there.
		 
			
			Thanks everybody for another nice meeting yesterday evening.   
The Topic for the next meeting (February 23) is: Hobbies. Tell us what you do with your spare time.   
And please try to RSVP till Tuesday around midday. We had around 16 people yesterday and I would like to reserve the tables beforehand to make sure we have enough space for everybody.
		     
Is this meeting only on Wednesday?
		    Hi vvv,   
yes, only wednesdays. 
But you are free to organize a Conversation Group on EF, maybe there is some demand for it.    
Cheers
		 
			
			Hi,   
I'd like to drop-by and see if I am holding back the group. My first lesson starts on the 8th March, probably 1-2 weeks after that? The location is somewhat near my workplace, so it is convenient.   
Thanks for organizing this event.
		    Hi Yves,  
we really don't care about the level of German you speak. It's always better if you have at least some conversation skills. Just pass by, the group is very welcoming and normally we stay a bit longer or go to a nearby bar.    
We will have a topic for the first hour, so people can prepare a bit.    
See you soon 
Cheers
		     
If you organize meetings during the weekend I could be interested ...       I am thinking about on Tuesday or Wednesday, would you be interested?
		 
			
			Does anyone know what time it starts? thanks a lot
		 
			
			oooohhhh...coocoo,...6.30pm, got it ) sooorrryyyy
		 
			
			The topic for the next meeting on March 2nd:   
your first impression of Switzerland, what to rant about and what you love about the land    
Don't be shy. Prepare yourself (or not).
		 
			
			Reminder:  
Please try to RSVP til Tuesday, 4pm, as I have to make reservations. 
This does also apply to the ""Oldies"".
		 
			
			Hi, I arrived in Switzerland about 2 weeks ago and have started taking German lessons. Im not very good, but I would love to attend, and meet people! Would you send me more information please. Like time, dates etc.  
Thanks      Hi Binx,   
you will find the needed Information in the header part of this thread. If you subscribe I will send out contact information. The meeting is every wednesdays at Stall 6 (Central location) and starts at 6.30pm.
		 
			
			Topic for the next meeting, March 9th:  
How I survived my school years. Tell us a bit how school is in your homeland, if you liked it or not   etc. 
So, prepare yourself (or not).
		 
			
			Dear All,    
I hope it is not too late that I sent a yes RSVP.  
Hopefully I`ll find also the place and the group itself.  
Will try to prepare about the topic too.    
Till than... cheers,  
Gabi
		 
			
			The group should be easy to find - just look for the large group of people speaking in short sentences, looking somewhat bemused, with a fair amount of if-I-nod-and-smile-it-may-seem-like-I-understand-what's-going-on faces.* Normally we're in the corner at the back, on the right.    
*Disclaimer: I can only speak for myself, but I find this technique works well.
		 
			
			Hahah Monomix, thanks! Good advise!    
Hope that sometimes the smile is honest...    
I guess I`ll be a bit late... TTYL    
			
			As the group is too big to handle we will try a different approach for the next meeting, March 16th. Someone suggested to discuss in groups of two or three people and switch partners after 5/10min. Just for the first hour, then back to freestyle again.    
Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!   
And thanks all for showing up. Please try to RSVP til tuesday midday before the meeting as I have to make reservations at Stall 6.
		 
			
			Great idea. I guesss 5 people/group would be good enough, each with a native german supervisor.
		 
			
			great meeting although I was a little bit late.. just a little!   
Hopefully next time I will be on time.. or you guys can arrange meetings in the weekends!   
either way nice to meet you all    
(the switching every 10 minutes sounds like a good idea)
		 
			
			Hi!   
I want to join to you.   Can I go? I'm from Hungary. I learnt at a German High School 4 years ago in Budapest, so my german is not so bad, but i want to improve it.    
			
			Hi Agtalan,    
I sent u a priv msg, I`m hungarian also    
C u next week!
		    Yeah, funny, where can we get the native german supervisors from? Most will be without supervision, I will be there to help out if there are questions.    
But I see you are forming an Hungarian Gang within the group.
		    The bar staff? They can comment as they collect glasses. We'll have to increase our beverage intake so that they have to continously clear the tables, though.
		 
			
			No   I`m not forming anything.  
And than without german speaking supervisor    
			
			On March 16th we will be at the tables, left side after entrance. They have an exhibition and no place left in the rear part of the bar.
		 
			
			On March 23th we will be at the tables, left side after entrance. They have an exhibition and no place left in the rear part of the bar.
		    Hi 
I've just joined EF a couple of days ago and as I am very much into languages (I am not a teacher), I was wondering whether it would be of any good if I came to the meeting on April 6. My mother tongue is Swiss German. However, as I have no idea how this conversation group works I think it's also possible that you are all set and have no need for a ""helping hand"". That's also fine with me.
		    Hi moira,   
as the group is pretty large in the moment (around 20-25 people) we would be grateful to have another helping hand. The concept is easy: We meet and stick to german for 2 hours, drinking beer or heissi Schoggi. I try to correct and help with questions. People will also help out each other. Relaxed and fun...   
Hope to see you next week.
		    Hi Prof. Taratonga   
Thanks for your quick reply giving me some idea of how the group works. I'll be there a little earlier. I will read the text beforehand. See you on Wednesday and have a good weekend. moira
		    We will not have any texts anymore. That was an experiment a few weeks ago...no preparation needed.
		 
			
			Quick reminder for tomorrows meeting. Please try to subscribe til Tuesday afternoon. Thanks
		 
			
			I might come this week. I already came once and enjoyed it.   
As I am not the greatest at small talk I would prefer to have a subject to discuss...It seems like I missed the times where you did have a subject. How comes that has stopped? Wasn't it a success?
		 
			
			Having a set text to read was good, but as the group is pretty large these days it was a little tedious going round one by one and having everyone read a section; people spent most of the time sitting and listening. Potentially instructive, but not really the point of a conversation group. Having smaller groups isn't really a viable option either because there's normally a grand total of one or two native speakers to answer any questions.    
With a set theme too, things invariably drifted quickly towards normal chat anyway, so I'd suggest that you simply come armed with something you'd like to talk about and slip it seamlessly into the conversation at an opportune moment.    
			
			Reminder: Please try to RSVP til 5pm as we have to make reservations. 
Last time 12 subscribed, 23 showed up....   
Thanks
		 
			
			Watch out...we will maybe sit outside today, April 20th.
		 
			
			I arrive in Zurich on Monday from Texas. I would love to join in this conversation group. See you this afternoon. Thanks! Elizabeth
		 
			
			Monomix!! What in Switzerland are you talking about??  If any of that is true , you MUST come and have a couple of beers with us    
			
			Yonathan,    
next event will be next Wednesday ( same time, and possibly same place) hope you can make it! It's fun, and even possible to learn some german!!    
			
			HelenT and Aussiebear,    
we'll miss you 2 too   Have fun in UK Helen!!!  
Careful with those first class drinks Aussiebear      
See you girls soon    
			
			Please subscribe till Tuesday afternoon as we have to reserve places.
		 
			
			Hi, I have a couple of questions. Does the group meet every Wednesday? Is it necessary to reserve a place beforehand? Thanks. -S
		 
			
			Hi sueznot,   
yes, we meet every wednesda. Please RSVP yes or maybe in the first part of the thread so we know how many people will attend. I will send you some contact information.
		 
			
			Am feeling de-motivated with my progress and the language. Apologies but I need to attend..       Don`t worrie my German is really bad, and I confuse the group every week. so you will sound very good....see you there x
		    Your English isn't that good either.   
			
			Reminder for tomorrows meeting. Please try to RSVP by today.
		    Far too true, but between the two I make a little bit of sence xx      I really don't think you do.   
			
			Reminder for tomorrows meeting. Please try to RSVP by today.
		 
			
			OK, todays meeting is canceled. Seems that nobody is around. See you next wednesday.
		 
			
			Hey, I will join you on the 8th. I am working in Zurich for the month of June. Currently a B1 level german. Till the 8th..
		 
			
			Todays meeting will be inside.  
We have a reservation at the tables on the left side when you enter.
		 
			
			Today, June 15, we will most probably sit outside. Enough space available if you still want to subscribe.
		    I hate to say it but, i think you may be on to something....i have enough trouble spelling and talking in english......I got NO chance in German (but i am very trying)      I am an awful speller, so please take it as the afflicted mocking the afflicted.
		    Always room for one more! The signups are just to get a rough idea of how much space to reserve, so as long as you don't bring 10 friends/pets along it's fine. (If you do, bring vicious friends/pets so we can use them to scare away other people and make space.)
		    I'll bring my pet shark, Cuddles.          I`d bring my wolf but someone has to look after the kids        
			
			Was a rather good evening yesterday. Also impressive that that the only pet present (maybe the least vicious in the history of pets) still managed to alienate some people, and another dog, with his.. erm.. predatory instincts. Thanks to everyone that came along!
		 
			
			Really nice that Aussie Bear is back, we missed you here. This is gonna be awesome...
		    Yay, its going to be great, and the sun is also supposed to be shining    
			
			Still nice weather. We'll be sitting outside at the long table beside the bar. Look out for the ""German Conversation Group"" signs on the tables.
		 
			
			Anyone have a grill they'd be willing to bring along next week? If the weather's good we might mosey on down to the lake and cook large quantities of meat.   
No ferret meat allowed, though.
		 
			
			I've been meaning to tag along to this for ages, Im pnly studying A1 and not getting anywhere fast - I have a memeory like a seive and lessons once a week just dont seem to be working. As im forgetting things from one week to the next.   
Hopefully even im just sitting listening i might pick up something !  
I can't make it on this week but will try it out on the 20th.
		    I thought that was a fox ?   
ok so I don't know how to quote pics...
		    No, it's ""Camille, the stoned ferret"". This is the official Mascot of the Zürich German Conversation Group.
		 
			
			Your club has ferrets? I'm in for the next meeting..... someone should have mentioned the ferret earlier.        You mean your snake is hungry again?   
""German Conversation Group Zürich"" (may contain ferrets and/or nuts)
		 
			
			He'll just cuddle her........        I thought that it might be something else but I never would have said ferret   
			
			hoi zäme,   
ich bin in Züri seit 3 Jahren, bin ich auf jedem Fall kein native aber würde auch gerne mitmachen. wir haben etwas ähnliches gemacht für französisch und lustigeweise auch im Stall 6 uns getroffen   
wann hat's die Treffe?   
grüsse   
röbi
		 
			
			und wäre es nicht  besser auf Deutsch zu schreiben? hop hop!
		    No, because it's a conversation group and not a writers guild   
This is just the technical site for the Group not the group itself and serves, among other things, mainly to subscribe, get the directions and obtain general Informations. These Informations are best given in a language that most people on an Englishforum are comfortable in and this is, you may have alredy guessed it, English.
		 
			
			Hoi zäme,   
As I've just started a Swiss German course this is relevant to my interests, what level is the average and is it mostly Hoch or Swiss German spoken?
		    It's all different levels. Only high german. At least one native german speaker helping.
		    Every Wednesday from 6.30pm. please rsvp.
		 
			
			On July 13 we will meet in Stall 6 as usual. Maybe next week at the lake if it is dry and sunny.
		 
			
			Sounds good!
		    Some knowledge of German is an advantage. But it is open to anyone as you will meet people who are in the same situation as you. You just can pass by and see if the group suits you.
		 
			
			My time settings are all messed up and I can't figure out how to change them.  The meetup says, it starts at 11:30, but I'm pretty sure that's wrong-- do you meet at 19:30?   
thanks! 
hj
		    It starts at 6:30pm    
			
			Today, July 20, we meet as usual at  Stall 6 from 6.30pm. Too cold and wet for a BBQ at the lake.
		    Lets keep our fingers crossed the weather will be better next week    
			
			I reckon we could have a discreet barbecue in the corner of Stall 6 without anyone noticing, as long as we cook only odourless food.
		 
			
			As the Event does not appear in the upcoming events I have to bump it.  
Subscription for this evening still open.
		 
			
			Bump it, professor, bump it       And grind it Professor, grind it.   
This weeks discussion will be on how to write an advertisement to sell a trailer, so please bring your drafts for us to discuss.                       
(Yes I have to write an advertisement for my trailer).
		    Can you summarise exactly how it was used? This is crucial.
		    It was used to carry my Winkelschleifer.
		    ?   
Winkelschleifer:       
That's either one hell of a Winkelschleifer or a seriously small trailer...
		 
			
			Hi guys,   
I just need some help of some people who already attended the Conversation Group. I will set up a new group within my company and need some feedback to put in a newsletter. You can PM me. Maybe I will take some photos next wednesday.    
Thanks for your support.
		 
			
			Hey guys. Is there a German conversation group in Basel? I can't find it. Link? Thanks, Joan
		    You want a model, because I'm sick of being asked to take my clothes off.             
Seriously, happy to help.
		    Thought I had it but think the thread's gone.     
			
			@ivich   
dude, this thing always happens.    
			
			The group in basel closed in July.  
Maybe you can start one there.
		 
			
			I see, the whole techno armada is subscribing. Did somebody do some advertising at the Streetparade?
		    It'll be easy to spot the group, at least. Look for the glo-sticks and nipple tassles.
		     Something deep inside me just died        
hmmm.. Monomix, and I thought I saw you dancing like crazy when we went to Exil later on    
			
			@ jordanbaker   
sorry i forgot to show you the book today. was in bern. promise for next week.    
			
			Y'all, what a fun night that was even though I arrived when you'd all finished conversing in German for the night to watch the...erm...football on the big screen together.  Who won in the end?!    
Had a blast with everyone but special mentions for: -   
@AussieBear: You and Mr AussieBear totally ROCK!  We gotta hang out together some more - real soon!    
@Mr ""Compton Cookie"" from LA: Dude, sorry but I can't even begin to remember your Forum handle.  Too complicated to say, let alone spell!  Anyways, you are awesome and at least have some appreciation of street ""performance"" art ideas. Also, have you cooled down now after that pho? Hehehe!    
Take it easy y'all and till soon.    
			
			Me and my wife will be attending to the meeting this week, we are very beginners, but trying very hard to improve. Would be nice to meet you all.   
  Regards.
		 
			
			Hi all - just quick question. My girlfriend and I are in Zurich for the next 2 years. I did German for 5 years in school, but we're talking almost 15 years ago. My GF has almost none.    
Just wondering - would it make sense for her to do some classes first (something like the Migros courses?) before coming to this group? Like would she get more from it that way?   
Sorry if stupid question, just our first time ever really trying to pick up a language for real!   
Thanks 
Graham
		    Hi Graham,   
it makes sense to start a course and then join the group. Because we will not do grammar, just conversation, answer questions and correct a bit.    
It's ok to pass by and find out if the group suits your expectations. People are welcoming and from my point of view it is a good way to socialise.
		 
			
			Do you guys still operate!!?
		    Yes, we do....
		 
			
			Thank you very much for your patience today, this is a very good initiative and I will do my best to improve fast so I can interact more the next time.   
Regards.
		 
			
			Are there still places available for session of 7/09? I am new to Zurich (Arrived today) and I want to learn German. My level is close to zero. I can understand and read a bit because my mother language is similar to German, but not able to speak.  
Hope this doesn't matter?   
greetings,   
Stef
		 
			
			wow, this is gonna be a crowded week. hope i won't forget the book that i need to show jordan baker again.       
thanks for bringing it along    
I will definitely read it as soon as I'm done with the slightly less exciting statistic books    
			
			Would like to join as well. First time, Mein Deutsch musst schnell besser wirden    
			
			Prof.,   
Do you still pick a weekly topic or is it ""free flow"" conversation?    
Looking forward to seeing all      No, there is no topic, all freestyle. But we can choose one for you, for example what to say on a romantic weekend with a german to make him really really hot      Wir gehen in die Sauna.
		    Naughty man   
(not him, YOU!!!)
		 
			
			whoopsie. fell asleep and just woke up. next time...    
			
			The same happened to me, and it would have been my first appearance as well- oooops! (although as my bf is German I always have access to German conversation  ).       
			
			Prof.,    
I will be a bit late this time because I am visiting an apartment at the Tiergarten at 18:30. I will make it there as soon as I can.    
Thanks!   
			
			I'm new to German language, i hope this community would help me to understand german language and able to speak as well. looking forward to see you there guys..
		 
			
			YIPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! i've been looking for this for ages!! hmmm need to find the rsvp thing   
			
			Some highly unexpected stuff (e.g. work I should do) have happened in the office so I can't go this time. Hopefully see you next week.
		    Hi,    
thanks for the update.    
Of the 14 people that subscribed around 11 turned up but we were like 22 people in the end.    
See you next time.
		 
			
			Moving to Zurich from UK mid November. No job, no money, little German. Only for love. What can I say, I'm an old romantic. (am bricking it a bit though) 
Anyway, this group seems great. I'll be there on the 16th Nov (Wednesday's right?) Hope the drinks are cheap.
		 
			
			I would like to join. I'll be there tomorrow, Oct. 5th. Looking forward.
		    You can subscribe in the upper part of the thread. See you.
		 
			
			Sorry guys, some unexpected stuff came up and i couldn make it   
see you maybe next week    
			
			I will be in Zurich for a couple of days and happy to see you guys again.  
Conversation group rocks!
		 
			
			Yay..... cant wait for wednesday, its been like forever      
			
			Hi, 
Is this group still meeting? 
Regards, 
Rich
		 
			
			Hey,   
I've not been to the conversation group yet, as it clashes with my formal class.  But its the Autumn holidays so I thought about giving this ago... is it still on for Wed 19th?   
Also, my brother is coming from the UK on that day so instead of missing it altogether I was thinking of bringing him along.....would that be a problem.  I think he has little to no German experience.
		 
			
			Yes, the Conversation Group never sleeps. We will be there. 
No problem bringing your brother along. Just sign up, pass by, have a 
few beers. I will give you personally a lecture about the legal implication of weed in Switzerland. Cheers       
			
			I've not been to any of the conversation group evenings but the people I meet when the group migrates to another watering hole are always a jolly bunch.    
I may even come along one night and converse in foreign. You seem a nice crowd           Thanks Prof...will be there.  Although, the weed question was pure curiousity nothing else    
			
			Yippee, this sounds great! I was going to pay huge amounts for Bellingua's conversation lessons, but maybe I'll try this with you first   I've been studying german 8 years at school, but haven't used the language that much in the past few years.. Maybe my boyfriend will attend too   We're both from Finland and been living in Zürich only a month. Can't wait!
		 
			
			Will have to leave you earlier today to meet up with THE LOLCAL owner at Corazon.
		 
			
			Dammit, I'll have to skip it after all! Too much work to do, just today.. But see you on next wednesday then, right?
		    Yes, no problem.
		 
			
			Hello, I was just wondering, is there an enterance fee.. Or how does this work?! Regards, Valerie
		    There's no entrance fee - just show up, crowbar yourself into one of the ""spaces"" on the couch and get chatting. You can also buy a coffee or a beer from the bar at your own leisure. CAVEAT: first-timers must bring a goat to sacrifice.
		 
			
			Ha, I will be first-comer today but Im not sure will I bring the goat. I am going to the Alps today, I hope I'll find one in the wild, haha
		 
			
			hello I will come tommorrow. It will be my first time. Should I something prepared before, except pen and paper ?
		 
			
			Pen and paper will be enough as we usually just stay there, talk and have a few drinks ..    
the pen and paper are useful for the new words or if you want to ask how do you say something
		 
			
			Woohoo its almost Wednesday, and therefore the best weekly event on the EF calendar    
			
			Should be there around 7:15-7:30. No Russians this week, but people from Congo   
			
			Just out of curiosity can I ask, what is the usual ratio of German speakers/learners? 
Do you agree a subject in advance or chat about current topics?
		 
			
			I had a good time once again! Thanks for organizing this.    
Dan
		    Hi, the usual ratio is normally 1:15, the last time it was 3:23. As the group is pretty large there is no specific subject, people are free to talk about what they like. Believe me, we tried it the other way...
		 
			
			Next time I come, I will try to convince my brother-in-law to join, to add to the Swiss/German speakers...
		 
			
			Hello everyone,   
I am kind of new here and would be happy to join for the next conversation group meeting, if this is fine with you. I have taken quite a few German courses, and always got overloaded with grammar, with no focus at all on speaking. Finally I got tired of grammar teachers and would like to learn to communicate in German;D Looks like this is the right place. I could bring 1-2 friends with me.    
See you soon hopefully, 
Adrian
		 
			
			Hi Adrian,   
you are free to join the group and bring people along. I guess the purpose of the Conversation Group is exactly what you are asking for. Please subscribe and you will get detailed information tomorrow.           
			
			Perfect  I may bring one person with me, however this is not yet sure. Next time I shall come with more buddies.   
Bis morgen then       
			
			Hi, guys! At what time do you meet? I didn'find this info in the message. I work in Zug, so, I need some time to get to Zurich...
		     
Its from 6:30-8:30pm at Stall 6    
			
			Is it okay if i come a bit late, as I also live in Zug.          No problem. Most people arrive between 7 and 7.30 pm.
		 
			
			I'm definitely a beginner in German, but looking to improve.  I will hopefully be there by 730.
		    It's a great group, with all kinds of levels. I am very happy to say that my German has greatly improved since I have joined the group.     That, and perhaps having a German...ehm...""private tutor""   
Looking forward to chatting!
		 
			
			Stall 6 has concerts tomorrow from 7.30pm. Maybe we have to find another place (which is difficult for such a large group). I will post here if there is a change for tomorrow and pm to all subscribers.
		 
			
			nice! I'll join as soon as I can!    
			
			UPDATE  FOR   TODAYS   MEETING (Nov 30, 2011):   
We'll stay at the tables left side next to the entrance. 
As the concerts start at 8pm we will have to shorten the meeting.   
Tickets for the gigs are available for CHF 15 before 8pm. There will be 3 swiss bands (on from the Romandie, one from Ticino and one from Deutschschweiz).     
TWEEK from Vaud play a mix of HipHop, Rock, Funk and Electro 
TAWARA SHEN KOOL from Graubünden play a mix of Reggae and Rock 
and IN THE DEAD CAR from Ticino play some Folk-Country-Blues
		 
			
			Thanks for the update. I am afraid I won't be able to make it on time, due to something running until past 7pm. See you next time!
		 
			
			Sorry, won't be able to make it this week after all.  Will try to come next week though.
		 
			
			As the event is not showing in ""upcoming events"" once again I have to bump....
		 
			
			Sorry for not being there yesterday. Hope everything went well and you treated the newbies nicely.
		 
			
			Hello Prof. Taratonga, 
      Hi, Please i like to ask you about this group and how it works. I am planning on setting one up around where i live as it is outside zurich. Please can you tell me anything that can help, like what you discuss about, and is it run. Do you give them topics to prepare for every meeting. Looking forward to your reply. 
S
		 
			
			hi, 
I just moved in Kloten. I would like to start learning German. Can I attend this meeting. Not sure of the dates from the thread...
		 
			
			I hope to make it tonight, but might be a bit later. Looking forward to it...   
Dan
		    The group operates weekly even if the posts on the thread are from past days (weeks), only make sure to sign up for the event and you will get more info for the reunion. All levels are welcome but if you already speak a little bit of german makes the experience a little better.   
Hope to see you one time on this thing 
Cheers
		 
			
			I would like to sing up, 
Boris
		    Boris,   
To sign up, you can just subscribe by clicking ""yes"" above, each week that you are interested in coming.    
Hope to see you there!
		 
			
			hey, this is also my first time. hope to see you everyone.
		 
			
			Hey Guys   
This will be my last time with the conversation group so i hope to see you all there, new people and old (regular) people xD   
I think we can after head for some drinks or something... will see once we are there.   
Thanks for everthing over the last 6 months and all the improvement with the german.    
			
			Okay everyone, some of you know i'm into my photography   anyway I entered one of my photos taken into switzerland into a little competition, so if you like it, then feel free to VOTE for it!!!    
Merci!!!   
Helen    
			
			27 people? We're going to have to  .
		 
			
			Hi everyone! 
I have some months in Swizertland, and i think this a great idea! I will like to go for the first time, practice my german and meet new people! When is the next reunion?   
Greetings!    
			
			Hello all   
I have been meaning to come along for quite a while now, but tonight I will finally make it. I am a German native speaker and look forward to seeing you.
		 
			
			Hello heaventhree, welcome to the conversation group.  I guess everyone will be excited to meet you there.           Really appreciated you coming around. 20 subscribers and more then 30 attended. Next time we will have the comfortable lounge again.
		 
			
			Is there a reading for this week?
		    No, it's freestyle. We will be around 30 people from all around the world. There is no way you can control this crowd. Maybe we will have a few more native speakers around who can help.    
Still waiting for someone who can challenge me on the tablesoccer.
		 
			
			Hmm, can't say I'm very good at table soccer. Will have to hope for a spell of beginner's luck...
		    Regarding the native speakers, I asked my OH to come around if he is free, and he'll confirm later either way. He is a native speaker and I think it would be fun.    
Regarding the table soccer...
		 
			
			Two years ago MariaMARIA started the German Conversation Group.     
The first meeting was at the Imagine at Hauptbahnhof. Three people showed up: MariaMARIA, HelenT and me. After 2 years the number of people attending the group slightly increased. Nowadays there are usually around 30 people squeezing into the lounge at Stall 6, including sometimes babys and dogs.    
Thanks MariaMARIA for the great idea, HelenT for her steady presence (hope you learned something) and taking over whenever I couldn't make it  and all the others for creating a good, laid back atmosphere at the meetings.   
This last two years I met more people then the ten years before and made many good friends of which some already went back to their home country.   
I really enjoy leading this group as it's like a little holiday every wednesday evening.
		 
			
			Certainly two fabulous years full of wonderful people and great ""after partys""   that led to awesome friends.
		 
			
			Hi ... I am new to the forum, my level is Intermediate ..... Do I register interest to come along or do I just turn up ?
		    If you just can register that would be good. So I can at least see about how many people will attend. You will also get some contact information on Tuesday or Wednesday before the meeting.
		    Thank  , prof.T, and all others who make the conversation group special and a very, very welcome weekly appointment. I really look forward to Wednesdays, and as you know, only ""the Russians"" can prevent me from coming - everyone else (boss, friends, OH) knows that Wednesday at 7-ish is German conversation group time for me!!!   
Thanks to you, I have already improved a lot (although my German is still awful, but that's entirely my own fault ) and most of all I have met you all great people, who have made my experience in Switzerland a much better one.          
Which reminds me...we need to go out soon. It's been way too cold and unpleasant lately.
		 
			
			We are now also on FB!
		 
			
			Federica, we must meet up this weekend, am going to Paris for two months on Sunday, so ring me up if feel like a night out    
			
			Sorry I didn't make it tonight   Got snowed under with work (not with snow...). Boo hiss. Won't be around for a few weeks now as I'm in Germany next week, then on holidays and then away in Holland       Show off!       Oh no, snowed under with work   
We will miss you LouisaB !!!!!! (Are you the smiley on the right or left? lol)
		 
			
			Hi there   
I just saw this. Are you going to meet again for German conversation? I'd really like to come along   
Thanks!
		    Hi, yes we will meet tonight at stall6 from 6.30pm.
		 
			
			Today (Feb 22nd) we will have to end the session at 8pm!
		 
			
			I apologize..I am only reading this today Wednesday. I am too late to participate this evening but future gatherings are of interest to me. I am looking to learn Swiss German and German as well .
		 
			
			Never thought I'd be so busy on Wednesdays, but I'm going to miss this again    
Should be back soon.
		 
			
			argh. missed my train. may get there only at 8pm. is there a follow-up location?
		 
			
			I'll be there on Wednesday - the bullet is well and truly bitten! Looking forward to meeting you all    
			
			Thread rated five stars, for justice.
		 
			
			Hello everybody, 
today I couldn't come because I have my last lesson 
at Migros KlubSchule (level A1!), but I'd like to join 
starting next time. 
I'm interested in High German for now only (just 
that it's already complicated!). 
I can have only simple conversations in German, 
is that ok? 
Tiz
		    Titius, I first joined while in the A1 class. I am now completing the A2 level, I understand a fair bit, but can, like you, only have basic conversations in German and mostly about daily life. I have found that it is no problem, as there are many levels in the group, but I will admit that at the beginning I was mostly listening (which is ok also), now I try to talk more.    
I must say, a huge part of the improvements in my spoken German happened because of this group   
			
			on my way with the cantonese conversation group.   
btw, anyone want food later? i'm starving.
		 
			
			It is just me or beer helps understanding and being more fluent in German?! 
Maybe it's because they sell German beer at the counter.
		 
			
			I'll leave the following here, might be a good conversation subject for Wednessay...

A lesson in German capitalisation   
Die Spinnen!

			Hi I just arrived here in Switzerland, can I come to this convo group?I would love to learn and improve my german language skills!   Thanks
		 
			
			I want to join this group. But I  dont know Germany. and also my English  (speaking skills) not good. I want to improwe my English and want to learn Germany. Is it possible? 
Best Regards
		    Until approximately 8:30pm, conversation is carried out in German, and all levels are welcome.   
After 8:30pm, we start speaking all kinds of languages, depending on who is speaking to whom, and, among those, there is also English.    
So you see, if you come, you'll kill two birds with one stone (or, as we say in my country, you'll ""catch two pigeons with one fava bean""  ).
		 
			
			Thank you very much I will be there next week.  ))))
		 
			
			I would like to join...Look forward to meeting everyone!
		 
			
			Welcome! And yes you can join any time        
			
			How often do you have this meetings? Do you think it is possible a no German speaker join it?
		 
			
			Can some of you suggested me a good German intensive course (at night) in Zug or Zurich? Tks!       Hi cbaldi   
Why don't you try the language corner? You may find a suited teacher there?   
In Zug there are quite a few language schools and they offer courses late in the evening too, e.g. Castles, LiZ, Dialogica, etc.   
Good luck
		 
			
			I have never been to one of these conversation groups, but since I JUST moved to Zürich I'll finally be able to make it out to a meeting.  See you guys on Wednesday!
		 
			
			Not tonight, but hope to see some of you at the 'dukt tomorrow   
			
			I am currently out of Switzerland, but I will join you soon!
		 
			
			Hello Guys and Gals learning Tüütsch  ,   
how far are you with German? I am an intermediate level, I can probably explain what I want to say, though not in a very sophisticated way.   
Would it be OK to join (also more like to meet new people :-))?
		    Seems like the group is tailored only for you. There are all levels, from beginner to natives. You sure will meet new people as there are usually from 30 to 40 people attending.
		    brilliant! dann... bis bald!       Hey user137, did you make it at the end? Looking forward to tomorrow's meeting   
			
			Had an excellent first experience with this group last week, but have got stuck in work this evening.  Apologies that I couldn't make it.   
Away for a couple of weeks but will definitely return after that.   
Thanks.
		 
			
			As the German Converation Group is working very well and is running smooth I was thinking about having a small group within the group for SWISS GERMAN CONVERSATION.   
This means max. 4 to 5 people. Decide what school book to use. Working through the book on wednesdays with my help.   
If you are interested let me know.
		 
			
			sounds excellent!
		 
			
			As the event is again not showing in 'upcoming events' I have to bump it here.
		    I'd be really interested in this. What are the options, as far as books go?
		 
			
			Hopp hopp, for some reason the event is not showing on the calendar on the front page!!!        
So would I       +1   (depending on work, though)
		    The best would be this one:       
Costs CHF 75.-- including Schlüssel (Vocabulary, Solutions) and 2 Audio CDs
		 
			
			I'd pass for the time being, until my German reaches a better level. However, if I happen to bump into you while I am venturing outside for a Raucherpause, I'll try and see if I can understand something      The book looks good, and it has lots of pictures!!!! Me likes the look of this book!    
			
			Me likes the sound of this too.  Never got past lesson 5 of the Pimsleur SG course    
My German has improved (thankfully) in my time here, and I can perhaps pick out more SG, but my level is still pretty nonexistent.   
I'll subscribe to this thread to see if this starts up    
			
			This conversation group seems very good for me. I'm trying to learn German but conversation is missing. I'm going to attend as soon as I'll be in Switzerland    
			
			is it too late to sign up?
		    Not at all. Late signups, or indeed non-signups, are becoming more and more fashionable.   Of course it's best to sign up as early as you can so we can reserve a big enough table, but you're more than welcome to come along and shoehorn yourself in.
		 
			
			Today first beer/drink for any US Americans showing up is paid by the prof. Happy 4th of July!
		 
			
			I have a question about the German Conversation Meetings (not just this particular meeting)...    
I know that this isn't a huge issue however I was just wondering if there are often or any younger people attending this group? I just turned 20 and I think I would attend if I knew that there were people around my age because I would feel much more comfortable knowing that there are others similar to me who moved here quite young and have little working experience, and all the other inexperience that comes with being quite young and very new to Switzerland. I know this group is about German learning, but for me it would also be about meeting new people and working on a similar goal together (which is learning German).    
Thanks in advance
		    I'm 32 if that still fits the scale...   this week I'm moving, but I'll try to be there later (20-21-ish) - not sure how many will come.
		    Age is just a state of mind.   
That said, depending on the day you will find also quite some people who are a bit 'younger' from the counting rounds-around-the-sun perspective.   
I hazard to say that the age distribution though is anything from 20 - 45 on average with a heavy bump around the 30s.   
Just join, check if you like it, and if not, you hop on to another bar. Easy    
Note that quite a few folks join later thus depending on when you come it might be livelier or not.
		    Well, hello sir, welcome back!!!    
Rebecca, don't worry, whatever our age, some of us still act like they are 15 again (not me, of course)   Just stop by and see for yourself if you like it!
		    'back' is not entirely back, just spend a bit more than month in the US and now for the comings bits quite swamped with work and late-night conf calls, US folks wake up when we go out, thus I'll have to miss out on the fun    
			
			If you average most people's real age with their effective German-speaker age, it's probably in the late teens, so we're a generally young bunch. Not to mention the reinvigorating effects of learning German grammar.    
			
			@Paul_G - when are your working hours? (i.e., are you sure your browser is not still set for the US, as this is from 18:30-20:30?   )
		    Excellent -- I will be there. The subject displayed 12:30 - 14:30 on the computer I used yesterday. I will be there and I will change my status on the invite.   
Thanks!
		 
			
			No meeting up this wednesday as it is a holiday!
		 
			
			Ups!    Next time then      
There are other social events going on in the city... PM me those staying in town and with not plans to celebrate our host country's anniversary..
		 
			
			I didn't practice for long time now... But I'll be there to start over this week    
			
			I am following up this event for a long time, hopefully try to make it next week.   
Question? I have made A2.1 course in February and have lost touch with German since then. any recommendation before I come to the next meeting?   
thanks a lot!
		    No recommendation. Just join us and have a good time.
		 
			
			Hi 
Is it going to be this Wednesday(15.08)?   
Sincerely, 
Irinka
		 
			
			Hi 
I would like to join this conversation meeting on Wednesday.  
This is my first week in Zurich, trying to get used. Happy that i found you!   
Sincerely, 
Irinka
		    Hi Irinka, yes its every wednesday at Stall 6 from 6:30pm    
			
			Hallo!   
Is there any topic for the 1st hour this week ?
		    Hi vilnico,   
we don't have any topics as the group is too large (usually 25 to 40 people). Swing by and speak to people in German. I will send out detailled contact information either on Tuesday or Wednesday to the newbies. Looking forward to meet you and Irinka.   
Cheers
		 
			
			Sorry, guys, 
I am afraid that I can not attend to today's meeting. 
Since last night, I have high fever. Please Have a nice time.
		    I wish you ""gute Besserung"" and hope to see you at some other date.
		 
			
			Hi, this time i will make it! See you soon)   
Sincerely, 
Irinka
		        Hi Laura,   
really no problem. We will be there usually til 9.30pm or even later. All levels are welcome and there is no problem in supporting yourselves in English.   
See you later
		 
			
			Thanks for the opportunity, see you there!
		 
			
			Let me just reiterate how wonderful this group is! Yesterday I managed to come at 6:30 on the dot, and not only I put in some good 2 hours of German conversation, I saw my friends, I met a ton of new people, and...after ending time at 8:30pm, when it becomes ""freestyle"", I even got to refresh my Spanish! Awesome evening.    
I highly, highly encourage ANYONE who is new in Zurich, wants to practice German, and meet cool people to attend these meetings. Don't be afraid if your level is not too high - we have from absolute beginner to mother tongue, and everything in between.   
I started from absolute 0 with German, I couldn't even say HI properly. I started classes once a week, but it wasn't enough, especially since I had a lot of trouble at the beginning to reconcile the classwork (High German) with what I heard on the street (Swiss German). Then I went to this conversation group: first couple of months I attended, I sat down, said the (very) few sentences I knew - like ""How are you? My name is X"", etc., and mostly listened to others.    
I started speaking more and more as the time went on. It's amazing to me how I could go from 0 to making a small conversation, then on to a bigger conversation. While I am far from fluent, I am definitely more comfortable, plus I made great friends.    
See you there?      I totally agree, and I have made lots of really really good friends through german conversation. In summary ""German conversation group rocks""    
			
			Hey everyone, I only moved here 2 weeks ago and don't know anyone here yet. I am often feeling frustrated with my lack of German.    
I look forward to meeting you all tonight, it would be nice to meet some others in the same boat. If i'm not mistaken, its at 6:30pm due to DLS? Do you guys have dinner there? If so what sort of food and are the prices reasonable?
		 
			
			Hello there,   
I see that the last post here was at some point in 2011...is this group still meeting? I'm interested to join but don't want to RSVP if no one is meeting...any one knows?
		    Of course we're meeting - alive and kicking every Wednesday   
			
			Thank you for the quick reply! Is there some sort of reading or something I should have done? If so is there a way for me to have it...if not then I will see you all tomorrow a the the Stall 6 then!
		 
			
			How long do these meetings usually last? I'll probably come but can only arrive after 19.30.
		    Hi, there will be no topic as the group is too large to control. We just meet and speak german. The natives or the ones with higher level of german will help. There is no pressure. Just come and see if the group fits your needs.      The meetings ends officialy at 8.30pm but people tend to stay for longer. There are even people just coming for the afterparty.
		 
			
			OK, I'll be there then    
			
			Hello,   
when will the next conversation group be held?   
Is there a way to know and get updates of next event ?   
thanks,
		    We meet every wednesday at 6.30pm at Stall 6. You can subscribe here from Thursday on for the following week. The next one will be tonight if you can make it.
		 
			
			Hi everyone,  
May I join the conversation group, too? This will be the first time I attend this meeting, as I have moved to Switzerland only recently. Right now my working language is mostly English, but I would love to brush up on my German a bit.  
Thank you very much,  
_ca_
		    Yes, sure. You are welcome. Just subscribe and pass by.
		 
			
			URGENT MESSAGE:   
Stall 6 will be closed tomorrow for the public outside the JazzNoJazz Festival. I will have to cancel the meeting for October 31st. I will be at the venue to inform the members of both my learning and conversation group.
		 
			
			I assume the group is back on this week?  If so, I'll be there
		 
			
			Are Wednesday evenings the only times you meet? I would love to join but I work on wednesday evenings...
		 
			
			Hallo 
I woukd like to join this event tomorow 7.11.2012 at 18.00 
I am  one person 
How can i  subscribe? 
Thank you 
Menelaos
		    Back on full speed - I can't join tonight, but there is a big group of subscribers from the RSVP, so should be fun.      So far, Wednesday evening it is. I think if you search the forum, someone recently was trying to set up a German Conversation Group in Zurich during the day.
		 
			
			I really have to step up my German so I'm planning to come next week.  It's okay if I only really know the basics?  How will I find you guys?
		    Big group of friendly folks all the way at the back of Stall 6.    
The friendliness of the participants, as well as their level of spoken German, increases in a way that is directly proportional to the number of alcoholic drinks consumed during the evening   
			
			Hi prof. Taratonga,   
I and a friend of mine (Silvia) would like to participate to the Group Conversation in Zurich on 19th Dec. Could you please explain us how it works? How can we subscribe?

Giorgia & Silvia
		 
			
			Hello,

Ci vediamo al 19.

All I can say is: it's been awesome.

			Hi There,   
I have also been meaning to attend this group for a while. I may not be able to get there for bang on 6:30 as it will depend on when I finish work. Is it okay to be possibly a little late?   
Many Thanks   
Shack
		    Hi Shack,   
no problem if you come later. People tend to come between 6.30pm and 7.30pm and some stay til around 11pm.    
Cheers
		 
			
			I'm organizing a BBQ with my german class on Thursday, so we'll be speaking in german the whole time, so I thought, why not invite the whole german speaking population I know  here? So YOU are all invited!    
I am not sure if it should be posted as an official event here on the EF, since the event's  language won't be english, what do you think?    
Event's Info 
BBQ on Thursday at the Arboretum (see link below) 
Starting at 5pm (until dusk)  
Bring your own food, drinks and if possible, portable grills (I'll have one there)    
Any suggestions?    
PM me  for my phone number if afraid of not finding the group ( we'll mix very well with the locals with our awesome german skills, finally!   )        
See Thursday everyone!
		 
			
			Hi, I just moved to Zurich and this looks like a very fun opportunity to practise some German. Tomorrow I can only stay till 19:30, but I like to join for an hour if possible.    
Looking forward to it, bis später!
		 
			
			Can you attend even if your German is at a very basic level?  This group sounds fab. Thanks!
		 
			
			Yes, all levels are welcome    
			
			Hi, 
Is the get together on for next Wednesday ? I would like to put my hand up.
		 
			
			Hi, can I come from next Wednesday, 8th of May? It seems a good idea this conversation group.
		 
			
			I'm looking forward to joining the group next week.  I volunteer to bring some cake for HelenT's birthday.     
			
			Hi all, I will not be there on the 8th of may as I'm on holidays(Yeah). MariaMaria will host this meetup. I wish you all a good time.
		 
			
			Hi there, who will join on the 15th may? Im a first timer who would like to improve my german and get to know people in Zuri. Looking forward      Hi,  I will be there on Wednesday.  Last week was my first time attending the group.  I arrived a bit late, so most people had already moved on to speaking English by then.  I did meet some nice folks, and I'm looking forward to meeting up again.     
			
			Hi! I have been looking for a group like this in Zurich. Is it not too late to register for today's meeting?   
			
			Im unfortunately unable to make it today - Next week it is..
		 
			
			It's the same by me, I try to get there tomorrow, see you guys and thanks for the opportunity!
		 
			
			Hello everyone,    
will there be a German conversation session on Wed 24.7? I would like to drop by. Can someone please confirm?    
Many thanks.
		 
			
			Hi, not sure if this has been asked, but what time do you all usually stay until? I take my German course every Wednesday evening in Zurich from 6pm-730pm, so this would be perfect for me to practice a bit after my class.
		 
			
			Mailand: There are meetings every Wednesday, people just (spontaneously) arrive after work or whatever, so you'll always find a bunch of us practicing our German, socializing and drinking beer      
JonSnow: Officially we speak ""only"" German until 8.30pm, but that is up to everyone's preference. Personally I change to English or Spanish as soon as it turns 8:30pm ( 2 and a half hours of german are more than enough   )    
Some 10 people usually stays until 11pm or midnight, specially now that the day light last  longer.    
Feel free to join us whenever    
			
			Hey, new guy here. I've read through the thread a bit and didn't see an exact answer to my question but excuse me if it's being asked/answered...   
How formal is this group? I saw mention of bringing pen/paper and time limits for ""German only"" periods and having set topics of discussion? Is it like that still or... maybe more like a Stammtisch type of thing? I have a fair understanding of German but my conversational abilities are a bit slack.
		    I've only been once or twice, but it seemed more a stammtisch type of affair, very relaxed. There are some nice people who go.  And Prof T goes as well       As we normall have 15 to 40 people attending it's not possible to work on topics. It's laid back, chat in German and have a few beers....
		 
			
			Thanks. I think I will then join in soon.
		    Does that mean most people do not register as a `yes`? - I only ask because there are only 4 today . . .  .including you . Looking forward to it anyway      That's right, most people don't RSVP before showing up.  Subscribing to the event gives the organizer a better idea of how many people might show up.   
I will be standing in for the prof as host this evening.  I look forward to welcoming you to the group.        If I'm coming I tend to wait until I get the notification email, as by then I know I have the evening clear.   
Are you doing the Swiss German part, Amazonna, or the ""normal"" German?  Hope to find you all this time...
		    Well, the joke is that prof. taratonga chose the person with the best German abilities to be the Deputy host.  Unfortunately, the Swiss German Course is cancelled this evening.   
I hope you are able to find us this time.        I... forgot    
I'll try to make it this evening.   
@prof: Gute Besserung!
		    We'll be inside on the couches to the right, after the bar.
		 
			
			Thank you user and amazonna. It looks like i'm avoiding you user as everytime you come to the group i'm away
		    I think I can't really make it tonight, actually.  I've a very busy next four days/evenings coming up, so to add to it this evening is probably stretching myself too thin.
		    You didn't reply to my text either    
			
			I will not be able to be there tonight. See you next week and have fun.   
There will be a concert at Stall 6 tonight. Au Revoir Simone, a Girl Band from NYC     
			
			Pity! We are going today!       IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE OCTOBER 2nd MEETING:   - Stall6 will be closed on Wednesday October 2nd! I will be there from 6.30pm to 7pm to inform ppl who didn't subscribe and maybe having a drink afterwards.   
			
			If anyone else is in the Halloween spirit, don't be shy to wear a costume this Wednesday.  Dibs on cupcakes for those who are dressed up.     
			
			Hello !    
			
			Attention:   
On the 27th of November we will be in Stall 6 on the right side after entrance.   
See you
		 
			
			First timer looking forward to it    
			
			I am new to Zürich and really need to practice some German! My partner and I will both be coming this Wednesday if it's going ahead?    
Thanks
		 
			
			missed the last one! Hope to make the next need to work on my coversation skills , too comfortable with just understanding!
		 
			
			Hello. Anybody is selling a books for German Certificate / B2  ? Thanks
		 
			
			Hello, When is the next session?
		 
			
			I'm also interested to know if this group is meeting...       
			
			Hello, I will not be there tonight. Still on holidays. Place is reserved. Enjoy. See you all next wednesday.
		 
			
			I am Coming today
		 
			
			Is it on this week?
		 
			
			Yes, place is reserved. I will not be there today but there will be plenty of people attending.          Ok great, thanks for the info.
		 
			
			I live in Switzerland many years already, BUT... Since everybody speak to me English, my German does not improve... . so, I guest I just found the right event to get things going... See you next week!
		    And today, I have heard that I missed some great cakes in last night meeting   and been promised to get a taste of the rebacked... I will definitely come for that next week. ( and you will have the chance to meet the slowest German language learner ever...   
			
			Thank you for this event. I was attending last week, and it was.... COOL!       Are you DETERMINED to come next week... . Also found some ""Skullcandy"" earphones last wednesday.
		    Well... Determination I leave for profoundly important actions... . But, I surely will show up in some future meetings...  
In any case; thanks for organizing and taking care for this group and event. Very well done.
		 
			
			For todays meeting I have reserved the tables outside! 
See you all later
		     
Sounds great. I'd love to come again but the wife is working on Wednesday nights so I have to be home with the kids. She is teaching German, actually...   
Dan
		 
			
			I've been working on my beginning German for the last month, about time to try some out.  Will there be many people at the next meeting?
		    Last night we had around 30 to 35 people attending including 5 native german speakers.
		 
			
			Hello All,   
I will attend this event for the first time. When and where is it happening next? As I am joining fresh, do we have smaller groups too or is this the only event happening for German Conversation ? Looking forward to some interesting conversations.   
Cheers.
		 
			
			Hi, I will not be there tonight but made the reservation. Have to leave zh for a long weekend abroad. Have fun.
		 
			
			Does anyone on here have any recommendations for a good german tutor in zurich??   Thanks!
		 
			
			I found Jean to be very good. He is based in Winterthur.      ATTENTION:  No official meeting on 18th and 25th of June because of 
World Cup Brazil. Public Viewing at Stall 6.    You are welcome to join us to watch the games.      How does one recognize EF members in Stall 6 on Wednesdays? Do you have an EF sign or is the table reserved under a special name? Thanks for the info       On the regular meetings on wednesday we sit either inside on the right side after the bar. When it's good weather outside at the long tables. We do have ""German Conversation Group"" signs on the table, also the staff knows where to find us.   
For the 25th of June there is no reservation possible because of the Worldcup. I would be the one with the horns....   
Next regular meeting is on the 2nd of July.
		 
			
			here is Austin. I would love to come, please count me in.    
Bis Gleich!   
Austin
		 
			
			Is this event current now? I'm interested but I see only old messages. Is this always organized on Wednesday?       Hello Maja, yes every Wednesday unless it says so here.
		 
			
			Sorry, I will not be able to join today. I apologize for last minute notice       No worries. There will be enough ppl anyways. See you at some other wednesday.
		 
			
			Is this activity still ongoing? I am interesting in that.   
Thank you
		    Yes, we meet every wednesday. Usually we have 15 to 30 ppl coming.
		 
			
			Here is the   in food & drink.
		 
			
			hi there,   
i really would like to take part for tomorrow Geramn speaking gathering. I m new to this group and i hope it s not late for morrow registration.   
Could u plz tell me the subject to talk about, also ?
		 
			
			Hello guys, 
I am very interested to come,but my German doesn't exist. 
Is it still ok? 
Thank you!
		 
			
			Hi Julie and Ellie,   
you are welcome to join us and see if you like it. There will be no subject as the group is too large. Don't worry, no pressure.   
See you tonight.
		 
			
			Good ! Thanks anyway. Im very excited for this German chat   
			
			Hi,   
I am an Indian and am new in Zurich (1 month old here) and looking for German conversation group. I have basic knowledge of German, but unable to speak. Let me know if I can be a part of this group.    
Thank you,   
Anju
		 
			
			I would also be interested in group meeting on weekends. But there is definitely an advantage to a fluent high german speaker to be in attendance, so I'll see ya'll on Wednesday.
		 
			
			how much is to pay for 1 month for this group?
		    It's free. It's not a school. You only pay for your drinks.
		 
			
			What happens if someone forgets to sign up before weds evening, can they still come? 
Is it mandatory to drink something while there?   
thanks       Yes. Most people come without subscribing. 
As it is a bar you are supposed to drink. If you are short on money I will 
offer you a drink or two...
		    There's no such thing as a free drink...   
			
			I've been working mainly since I got here so need some R+R! I will try to join you.
		 
			
			I'm very interested to join this group!
		 
			
			Does anybody know if the Canton of Zurich sponsors some German classes for immigrants?  They used to have one in the French speaking part where we used to live.  There were as well some classes given by an NGO which I used to attend and I met a lot of great people there.
		    There are some courses that are sponsored or partly sponsored:        
			
			Thanks Prof. Taratonga!  But it seems like the Kulturlegi only sponsors people who are under Sozialhilfe?
		 
			
			Will this group still meet in February? We will arrive in Zurich on February 4th and I am interested to meet for conversational German practise (and a chance to meet people in town) as soon as possible. 
Please let me know. 
Thank you.
		 
			
			Is this group still meeting regularly? 
Will you be meeting in February 2015?  
We will be in Zurich as of February 4th and are interested to meet others to practise German. 
Looking forward to hearing from you.
		 
			
			Coming for the first time and I am new to Zurich. Where exactly you guys meet?
		 
			
			EVERY WEDNESDAY FROM 6.30PM. 
Location: 
Stall 6  
Gessnerallee 8 
8001 Zürich   
5 minutes walk from Zürich Central Station.
		 
			
			Hi.    
German is my mother tongue. I am willing to help some of you with their German studies and use this chance to get to know new people from and around Zurich.   
Cheers 
Janine
		 
			
			Is it too late to RSVP for tomorrow? My German is terrible but I need to force myself to practice! Been here a month already and it's not coming back as quickly as I hoped!
		     
You don't need to RSVP, just turn up.
		 
			
			Hopefully next week. Got home way later than expected today! Just settling kids now!
		 
			
			Hello,   
I would like to attend this from next wednesday onwards (15th). Are there places available?    
Please can you send details,   
Thanks   
Daniel
		 
			
			Hi Daniel, there is always enough room, its very open and informal. Starts at 18:30 we try to only talk German until 20:30 but it goes on as long as there are people willing to talk to each other. Address and details are at the top of this page. See you tonight. Toby         
			
			Last minute notice !!!!  
Stalle 6 is closed today for a private event If you know anyone planning on coming to German Conversation group please let them know that it is cancelled tonight. Sorry for the inconvenience.
		 
			
			Can we have some conversation group meetings on weekends too? I usually work in the evenings so cant make it on Wednesday evenings and I would really like to attend these.
		    Sorry this is specifically a Wednesday evening thing, you are always welcome. You could look on the Meet Up forums  , I know there are many groups meeting in Zürich, maybe another one would suit your times better.
		    May I ask what is the level of Deutsch conversations in general? Would love to join but a bit intimidated as I am not at all a fluent German speaker...   
			
			They have all levels - from ""Hallo, ich bin Elsa"", to discussing current political events.   
Just go!
		 
			
			Hello guys   
I'm a native (Swiss) German speaker and I would love to join your group for meeting new people. Do you have some places available? Can I join you spontaneous?
		    Sicher scho. As we have usually over 30 people attending any help from native speakers is highly appreciated.
		 
			
			Hallo! Is there plans to continue these meetings? I would really need some practice since I now only speak a bit at the classes, and English at home. Thanks!
		 
			
			Hi there, its on every week unless stated. But for more reliable updates join up on Meetup: Zurich German Conversation Group.
		 
			
			This wednesday we'll celebrate the 6th anniversary of the Conversation Group. Thanks to MariaMaria, the founder and Helen, the first subscriber in Feb. 2010. Duriing these years I met hundreds of interesting people and made some good friends. The group is still growing, last week we had around 60 participants. Guess we are an institution.
		    The group is awesome! Wish I was there to celebrate with you all - drink one for me bitte!        
the cakes around were superb
		    They were, thank you Prof. for organizing everything :-)
		 
			
			Hi, I'd like to participate from now on. Will you please post the link of that Meetup? Thank you in advance           
It is not exactly fair of you to indicate that the organizer and   are NOT reliable     
			
			Hi Riana,   
you also find us on meetup.com under Zurich German Conversation  
Group. We usually have 40 to 60 participants. See you wednesday.
		 
			
			Happy Birthday to our awesome group!! I concur with Prof. Taratonga, it has been a great source of invaluable friendships and fun entertaining midweek nights          
It's grown soo much in the last couple of years one feels a totall newbie sometimes,  but warms up immediately by the friendly laidback atmosphere of the meetings.      
xoxoxox         
			
			Can a b-level student join too? Since the group turns 6 yrs Im not sure now what level is necessary in order to join you? Cheers   
			
			a b-level might be a bit too high level for some        
Of course you can join! There are always a-levels to native speakers there.         
			
			Sorry I've come down with a bad cold but will join next week.
		 
			
			I'll most likely be there with my beginner-to-nonexistent German skills...   
Bis später.
		 
			
			We--aaall-- wlll will help you as your German most likely is better  then the Greek of most of us  --
		 
			
			When will be the next meetup ?  
Sounds very interesting and cool. I would love to join once.
		 
			
			Today is the next meeting day. It's always on Wednesdays.
		 
			
			Hi all, just to check - is this still going on?
		    just turn up, in case you don't see the group, ask at the bar or if it's nice weather everybody is outside, there are usually some bits of paper with German conversation group written on them! Hope that helps    
			
			Hello everyone ,    
I am excited to attend my first meeting next week  .    
I am wondering if there are any nurses that will be attending or does anyone know a nurse that I would be able to have a conversation with about working as a nurse here in Switzerland.   
If the nurse does not have the time next Wednesday evening, we can always get together another day for coffee at their convenience. I am staying in Chur but I am willing to travel to meet with someone.    
Ali    
P.s. Should I create a general new post for this or will  it suffice just posting  here .   
Thank you all in advance    
			
			Thanks for organizing this... it's very difficult to have a german conversation in ZH because everyone speaks english as well... Looking forward to meeting you
		 
			
			Hi, I just found your group.  Is it still running?  And could I join you this evening, just to say hello. 
Alison
		 
			
			Hello,   
Is this group still meeting?    
I hope to join you soon       
			
			Will you be doing this next year?  I am starting a new job in Jan 2017 and am hoping to be able to join then.
		 
			
			Hello, are you planning on doing this next year as well? I'll probably start taking German lessons in January and would love to join you!

			Looking forward to it ladies!
		 
			
			Looking forward to seeing you all in about an hour. I'll be the one wearing a blue spotty dress with a huge belly!       
Melanie
		 
			
			Think il be a few minutes late! 
See you soon :-)
		 
			
			Hi Melanie,     
I would like to join the meet up on the 25th May...      
Is there anything I could/ should bring to the meet-up?     
Looking foreward to Meeting with other moms     
Best      
Lilly
		 
			
			Hi Lilly   
Great that you'd like to come along on Sunday.  You don't need to bring anything - just yourself (and maybe your baby!)   
Looking forward to meeting you,   
Melanie
		 
			
			Hey Melanie,   
Another Melanie here.  Pregnant with my second child but looking to meet other mum's to be as I didn't have a chance with my first to integrate with other mummy's.   
Hope I can make it on Sunday but depends on how shattered I feel.....pregnancy number two seems much harder than the first.   
Thanks for organising    
			
			Hi Melanie   
Glad you'd like to come on Sunday and hope you feel up to it.  Doesn't matter if it's your second baby - I'm on my fourth!  Sometimes circumstances mean you haven't got a good network of friends with each child and that's why I'm organising these get-togethers.  None of my friends are having babies so I need to make some new friends!     
Hopefully see you on Sunday...
		 
			
			Hi.  Is anybody planning on coming to Tibits today?  Don't really fancy traipsing all the way there on a stinky tram in this heat at 35 weeks pregnant if I'm just going to be sat on my own!!      
			
			Are these regular meet-ups?  I'm also an expectant mum in Basel and would be interested to come in the future.
		 
			
			Hiya.  Yes - we're trying to meet up every couple of weeks but it's a bit hit and miss as to who actually turns up as weekends can get busy - especially at this time of year!  The next one is this Saturday (28th) in Tibits from 14:30-16:30.  Would be great if you could come along.     
			
			Hi, i will be able to join with my 9 week old. Looking forward to meeting you all  .    
Jayne
		 
			
			Great thanks,   
I'll try come along.  I am in the middle of moving at the moment so its a bit hectic but I'd love to get to know other new/expectant mums.   
see you   
Jenna
		 
			
			Excellent!  Will be nice to have a couple of new faces there.     
See you on Saturday,   
Melanie.
		 
			
			Is this still going on? I will be part of the ""demographics"" for the next 3 months or so :-)

			Guess who's bread-winning half has to go on a business trip this particular week, leaving her home with the kids..? That's right, I can't make it this time, despite being the one to choose the date. Sorry!   
But my absence mustn't deter you from showing up; the rest of you should meet there as planned. Be loud and obnoxious and report back later, and I'll make sure that I'm around next month.   
I'll even reserve you guys a table - last time the place was so packed that the reservation was definitely needed. You won't get to enjoy my Premium Handmade English Forum Sign, though.
		    Ohh, we'll mourn your absence. Some husbands have no sense of timing, let's admit it    
Will do our best without you, but it won't be the same.   
Have you booked the table yet? Thanks for that, it was really crowded last time.
		    Indeed. Well, he has been and will keep on getting nagged about this, despite being helpless in the face of higher authorities and their unforgiving work schedule.      I haven't yet, I'll wait until Tuesday for the headcount.
		 
			
			This sounds fun   Especially since I don't have to take the train to Zurich to meet fun English speaking people. Not sure yet if I can make it this Wednesday but I will definitely try! Till what time are you there normally?
		 
			
			Last time we left a bit early (I was starving, nothing to do with the company  ), I think about 9. I understand the others stayed much longer.
		 
			
			I'm still mourning the passing away of my Talacker night out last night. 
I might need a beer or two to make me feel better...   
Btw, in the absence of the EnglishForum sign, how will I recognise which table you've reserved ?
		    Hum... ask the bartender?    
			
			Don't fret, I've just booked a table, and they'll take care of the sign, since my artistic abilities cannot compete with an-gina's.   
See you all later       Ha, Miss Marple beat me to it! I just called the pub today (forgot to do it yesterday, and what the heck, today's just as fine) to book the table, and the gentleman pointed that another lady had just made a similar reservation a moment earlier...   
I feel my monopoly shaking!   
Have fun, little ones. I feel like you're all grown up, having beers all on your own. Makes me so proud!
		 
			
			I'm sooo sorry  . I thought you'd forgotten and didn't want to be a pain in the arse reminding you, when I could do it myself.   
Will think of you aaaaall the time       There's hardly reason to apologise for showing initiative... And I HAD forgotten about it for a while!      Wouldn't expect anything less.
		 
			
			We had a talk last night and it seems that 20.00 is better for everyone.    
So, new time next month?   
See you all then    
			
			I changed the time for 8 pm for next time. See you then!   
(I hope you at least have hangovers, or a teeny-weeny sleep debt, or beer stains on your trousers. Or something!)
		 
			
			Ohoy,   
It's that time of the month again, gentle people of Argovia and its surroundings. How many seats should I reserve this week? How many people will make the inarguably worthwhile trip to see the Official Handwritten English Forum Sign?   
And remember, it's a new time this month: we'll be starting at 8 pm.
		 
			
			I've reserved a table; a smaller one than before, since the headcount seems more modest this time. But big enough for the random unannounced visitor to drop by, so do feel welcome!   
See you tonight!
		 
			
			This month I have yet another case of poorly timed work trips by the OH, so I won't be able to show up. Which is a terrible shame, especially since there seem to be some new faces about. But fret not, newbies, someone else will surely make you feel comfortable enough!   
I'll reserve you guys a table under the name English Forum; ask for it at the bar if you can't otherwise locate it. And have fun!
		 
			
			Okay, that's a first: I called the pub to make the reservation, and they were able to get all of it, except for the name ""English Forum"". I mean, the fellow at the other end, obviously a native English speaker, was able to hear the ""eight o'clock, six people"" part, but when it came down to giving a name, the reception apparently broke. Every. Single. Time.   
The mobile network clearly has a severe EF allergy!    
So he said he'll put us under ""Zero""; I'm not sure what to make of that. But anyway, I doubt there are other reservations for six people at 8 pm tonight, so you'll surely find the right one.
		 
			
			Turns out they reserved the table as ""Sarah"". Got four so far. Come find us!!!
		 
			
			Sarah, eh? I guess that kind of makes more sense, although I must say I preferred Zero.   
It really was a bad connection.   
(wish I was there)
		 
			
			Oh, sorry... Completely forgotten about that  (   
The whole evening I've had a feeling that I am missing something... damn...
		 
			
			Hoi folks,   
unless you've forgotten, this week's Thursday is the Auffahrt / Ascension, so most of you will probably not have to wake up early. What a brilliant excuse to come and have a drink on Wednesday!
		 
			
			Ahoy,   
I haven't made a reservation for tonight, since it doesn't seem exactly crowded here... I also don't think I'll bother making the trip to the place if it seems that I'll be the only one attending tonight - until next month then!   
However, if somebody still feels like going, just PM me and I'll be happy to change my mind and join you for company tonight.
		 
			
			Have these events stopped...?   I was way too busy last month, didn't even bother to look at it.  
Anyway I'm currently having some health issues and next month I'll be on vacations, so no Pickwicks for me in the near future...
		 
			
			I don't think it's stopped; last month everybody seemed to be busy, but the month before was quite a good night, I believe, although I wasn't there - I know, hard to imagine!   
I'll be going tonight, if somebody else clicks yes... I'll even make a reservation in that case. And I think I'll be back from holidays by the last Wednesday in July, too, so I'm all game!   
So chop chop the rest of you, drag yourselves out tonight! And get well, Pegaso, we'll surely see you again one of these months...
		 
			
			I need a drink. On my way...
		 
			
			This is the first time I have seen this post. I'll write it down for next month, but not sure yet if I'm going to be here or away. I am definitely here in August though    
			
			Is anyone going tonight?
		 
			
			I'll come if someone else does! That is, if someone announces their coming at least a couple of hours in advance so that I can prepare to make the leeeengthy journey from Brugg to Baden... No really, it can be rather lengthy, at least on a bicycle, and in this weather. Wonder if it'll rain later?
		 
			
			Hi there! Have never been to this event before but some time has to be the first, right? Hope to see you guys end of August!
		 
			
			I have never been so will either send my husband or come along (someone needs to stay home with the kids   ).
		 
			
			Here's a heads-up: we're meeting again this week! And since it's been way, way too long, I promise I'll be there no matter what; come rain or shine, may the sky fall and everybody else cancel; I'll be sitting there at my reserved table downing my IPA.
		 
			
			Woohoo, I managed to reserve a table for tonight without any hearing problems! Apparently the English Forum allergy has been cured!   
Or maybe the fact that I've changed my mobile provider since the last time has something to do with that. Apparently UPC Mobile handles the phrase 'English Forum' much better than Orange did.
		 
			
			Well done an-gina!    
And you won't have to down you IPA all alone, I'll come join you :-)
		 
			
			I cannot make it tonight but will be rejoining in the future. My mum is in town and she is not an ipa type of lady. But I'll be back again. Have fun.
		 
			
			Hello, 
Are the drinks on this week?
		    Yes they are! I will be going, and I'll book us a table, too.
		 
			
			I'll be there too (for the first time)    
			
			And I'll be there! :-)
		 
			
			I case you lot can't wait until the last Wednesday of October, there's a couple of us beer-and-chatting-hungry souls going out the this / next (I never could figure out the difference between the two) Tuesday. Behold -  !   
The monthly event is naturally also happening; the Tuesday thing is just extra!
		 
			
			Hello,   
I've never been on any social event is Switzerland (just moved here), and would like to ask if i can join. (I'm not English).   
thanks a.
		    Why yes, of course you can join! It is a public event, anyone who understands the invitation is welcome!   
And frankly I don't think I've ever seen anyone English there, or maybe I've just forgotten. Americans, South Africans, Aussies and Kiwis, as far as Anglophones go, but no Brits. And then a load of us non-native speakers!   
I wonder where all the Brits are?
		 
			
			A gentle reminder to whoever is following this thread: the holidays are done and dealt with, and we'll meet again this week. Or, well, at least I'll be meeting myself at the pub on Wednesday; wouldn't mind the company, though!
		 
			
			I'll be there too   And bringing two new guests!
		 
			
			I would like to join sometime. :-)
		 
			
			I am also coming and I look forward to seeing both familiar and new faces! :-)
		    Is this a smoke-free pub? If I'm not extra-cautious, cigarette smell plus issues  with the public transport might result in me       Hi FunnyBone; yes, Pickwick's is smoke-free. Well, the way they often are: people smoke right outside the front door, so some fumes may drift in, but you won't be soaked in smoke.   
I hope to see you there; same goes for Stephanienie, and then of course all the oldies. And other newbies. Well, just about anybody who's housebroken, really.
		 
			
			A late-ish reminder: we'll meet again this week. I'll be there; I hope you'll be there too!
		 
			
			Hi! Are you guys still meeting? If so, when? I am new in Switzerland and I will be happy to join       Hello WildGorilla, yes, we are still meeting every last Wednesday of the month! The event updates itself every month, so you'll always find the next meeting time at the beginning of this thread. That means our next date is on Wed 27th of May, in a couple of weeks.   
I will be there, and I bet a bunch of others too. Hope to see you there too! You will find us at a table with a sign that says ""English Forum""  or you can just ask at the bar, they will surely be able to point to the right table (and they speak good English).
		 
			
			I would like to Join if possible.
		    Of course! Welcome!
		 
			
			Hi, I just moved from Zurich to Baden a couple of weeks ago. I would love to join as well : )
		 
			
			Is this happening in June? Should be this Wednesday?
		     
Hi vostok4,   
It is very much happening also in June, even though our usual (and may I say very appreciated) host an-gina is out of town. I just booked a table this Wednesday 21 June at 20.00 in the name of English Forum. Usually they put up a sign, otherwise just ask at the bar and they'll guide you right. You, and everone else who'd like to, are welcome to join!    
Emelie
		 
			
			Awesome! I will make the trip out and gladly enjoy a pint with some folks, haven't met many people so I'm really looking forward to it!
		 
			
			I just thought I'd officially declare and simultaneously remind everyone that the pub night is on again this week (that'd be tomorrow, counting from where I am now) and that I will be there. And yes, I will also reserve a table for us.   
Hope to see many folks there, it's been way too long since I last had the chance to drop by! All the newbies are, like, oldies now, and nobody remembers me anymore.    
			
			Yay! I'll be there too, looking forward to see you all (?)! And I haven't forgotten you, an-gina;-)
		 
			
			Here's just a reminder, and a reassurance: I will be at Pickwick again this tomorrow, hoping to see many of you there as well! Ask the staff for the English Forum table, if you can't find us (me?).
		 
			
			Hey, unfortunately I'm out of the country but I'll be there in January again! Cheers!
		 
			
			Hello Baden-inclined people; it's me again, reminding you to join us this week at the Pickwick Pub. There have been holidays and other busynesses preventing me from attending, but I promise to be there now in January, whether it's just me or perhaps a big bunch of loud English-speakers.   
I hope many of you can make it!
		 
			
			I can finally make it again this month!    
			
			Me too! Finally! :-)
		 
			
			Last time there was some talk about how easily this monthly night can slip out of our minds, if there isn't a reminder. Well, here you go: a reminder! We will be meeting again tomorrow, Wednesday 27th of April.   
For people who've never been to one of these evenings: fear not, we are nice! And even though this thread doesn't seem like the most active place in the forum, we are still meeting every month. Many of us just usually forget to RSVP here on the website... Although I try to remember to always do it; I've set an automated reminder of the event, which is something you lazy-regulars-who-keep-forgetting-things could take note of...    
Welcome all!
		 
			
			Hello sweeties in the vicinity of Baden or those willing to travel! This event has been pretty quiet during the summer months, but let's try to pick it up again, shall we. So this week I promise to be sitting in Pickwick's, rain or shine, alone or with company. Hopefully with company though!
		 
			
			hi! Is anyone going today? 26.10. ? I would like to have some company by a beer in baden.
		 
			
			Guessing nobody is coming today... I'm outside having a beer. In case somebody changes their mind  . Cheers!
		    Rats. If I'd seen this earlier in the day I would have made an effort to turn up.
		 
			
			Tonight nobody should have to drink alone: I will be there with a table reserved for the English Forum, just ask the staff if you're not sure which one of the happy, smart and good-looking small groups is the right one.
		    Does this mean that the christmas drinks event is only open to happy, smart and good-looking people? or would 2 out of 3 be ok?
		    Even if you'd be only 2 out of 3, the company will surely make sure you leave a full 3. Or at least I hope they will do that; I myself will be happying, smarting and looking good outside Switzerland that week, so I can't join the Christmas drinks. Hopefully others will make it, though.

11	http://www.englishforum.ch/social-events/152110-board-games-evening-zurich.html	Board Games Evening Zurich	6771	73	" 
			
			Anyone interested in a board games evening in Zurich? I would volunteer to organise it (or at least give it a try ...).    
Ideally in a bar (suggestions welcome) or possibly in my home (for a group of up to 5-6).   
Gina
		 
			
			You could probably hold it in Bubbles (near Stauffacher) on a Wednesday, when they have their backgammon evening.       
They also have the best cheesecake in Zurich, which I realise is irrelevant.
		     i didn't know about the backgammon. will definitely check that out! anyone else up for backgammon?
		 
			
			Hmmm maybe maybe! 
Like a spot of scrabble though.... That and rummikub are the only two board games my husband will play! Boo!
		 
			
			yay scrabble  
how about settlers? or some strategy games
		    Cheesecake is never irrelevant    
Scrabble sounds fun. Haven't played it in english for years (and would most likely spend ages pondering and get thrashed anyway)
		    Yes, glad to see the reference to backgammon night, I would be up for it
		 
			
			Sounds great!   
I was too slow to get on board (so to speak) for the last one, but all geared up now.   
Thanks to the great deals at Brockieland, I have recently acquired three board games ( ,   &  , all in German) to add to the many we already have (including a fun strategy wargame,  , in which you play various fantasy races in an effort to control the most territory on the board to earn money ...).   
We also have mahjong which, I realise, is not strictly a board game ... and we'd need to get an expert along for scoring, as I've never been able to remember the 'special' hands. Still, I can teach people the basic rules of the game, and simple scoring ...   
I also enjoy backgammon, although I haven't played for ages.
		    I'm in.     
Does anyone have interest in Chess?  Strategy games sounds great too.     
Any Axis and Allies players?
		    I can play chess, but not with any great skill.   
I've played Axis & Allies once (about ten years ago!) and enjoyed it ... would be willing to relearn the rules.
		 
			
			I'd be interested too.
		 
			
			OP - great idea. I would be keen to join as well. I recently played a bit of Bananagrams and Scrabble while back in the States and thoroughly enjoyed it.    
Unfortunately, I do not have any board games to bring with me (all packed away in my parent's house in the States), but I can bring some friendly competition!
		 
			
			Oooh, this thread comes at an interesting time for me as I'm currently reading  .   
Presumably there's hundreds of Scandinavians on the EF that already host regular board game evenings.  They're mad for it up there.   
Which reminds me, I have Partners if any Danes/Faroese fancy a game.
		 
			
			Just found this video advertising the book...     
			
			Hi,   
thanks for all the replies.    
We can try Cafe-Bubble, sounds good. Otherwise, there is a Bar/Restaurant at Helvetiaplatz, where I once saw people playing board games.   
Scrabble might be a bit too challenging for non-native English speakers (like me). I was thinking of playing something like ""Settlers of Catan"", Monopoly or similar type of board games, where 4-6 of us can play together. Chess and Backgammon would be just for 2 players.   
If everybody brings one or 2 games, we should have a good selection.   
I will set up (and post) a ""doodle"" with a number of options (Somewhere August/September) to see which date fits best for the majority.     
Gina
		    Sounds great, Gina - post the link to your doodle here when it's up, please!
		 
			
			Hi gamers !!   
Such a cool initiative, plus it's not far from where I lived.   
Small World is cool, Settlers of Catan as well. 
I might play Chess too (though it's been long and I am quite bad at it)   
If there is anyone interested in playing Go, let me know, I can bring a board there !!!
		 
			
			I'm interested as well    
			
			If people are interested, I can bring along the Europe map for Ticket to Ride!
		 
			
			I'm a little further away, but I would definitely try to make it if this happens!
		 
			
			Here the Doodle Link for the first games evening....         
I will choose and post the final date once we have collected enough entries in doodle.   
Please check this EF thread now and then or send me a PM, then I can mail you directly.   
Gina
		 
			
			It looks currently like the 26th August fits for most of us, but I will still wait before posting the definite date and time somewhere next week.   
Location:  
Have checked the opening hours of cafe bubbles and saw that they close at 21:00 or even earlier depending on the day ... this is a bit tricky if we start at 19:00. This means that we might need to look for an alternative location. Does anyone know the name of the Bar (it is a larger Bar/Restaurant) right at Helvetia Platz? Or any other suggestions?

			Hey there!    
I was wondering if any of you have ever played the Arkham horror board game?   
(We have the game + almost all expansions in english)
		 
			
			Haven't heard of it before but won't stop me from giving it a go.
		 
			
			It's a pretty 'geeky' game in Lovecraft theme and takes around 4 hours. Players play in a team so it's a cooperative game.        
If anyone is still interested we could host a separate evening for solely this game since it takes some time to explain the rules and so on.        That sounds interesting, I'd give it a go.
		 
			
			Update on the board-game evening ...   
It seems that the   (Sunday) does fit for the majority (Andrzej, Nicolas, Christopher, Circe) ... unfortunately not for me anymore as I am invited for a dinner that evening (had completely forgotten about it... ).    
But that doesn´t mean that the 4 of you cannot have the games evening.   
Location still to be decided (cafe bubbles is not open during evening times as per their website). Either you make it an afternoon games evening or a different location is needed).   
Gina
		 
			
			I'd be up for an afternoon event on the 26th    
			
			Just a quick note - Bubbles is open till 11pm on Wednesdays and is back open after their summer break. I just had a great pasta there while checking the opening times.
		 
			
			Yes, but the proposed date was Sunday ... and on Sundays they close at 18:00.   
We could play Sunday 26th from 14:00 (for example) or find a new location (I cannot join on Sunday evening unfortunately).   
Or we give it another try and I set up a new doodle - then considering the bubbles opening hours (which I was not aware of  )   
Gina
		    Do you know why type of bg they are playing? Is it friendly for fun, competitive with / without money involved?   
I would like to come and play but it is a long drive so I am interested in knowing the level or any info before I made the trip (live in Riehen)
		 
			
			I would prefer not to combine it with the Backgammon evening, I fear we do not have enough space then. And those who want to play backgammon can just go there on Wednesday ....   
Gina
		 
			
			Hello everyone,   
Sorry for making it very last minute, but I just discovered this thread and Im totally in. Anytime this weekend is fine for me. I can bring Dixit and Biblios (both card games), Jungle Speed and Arkham of Horror (though I see somebody mentioned it already). Im also into Backgammon or classic card games. So did we decide on the date/venue yet?   
Cheers   
Piotr
		 
			
			I have just amended the time for Sunday 26th to 14:00.    
Could those who have time on Sunday please update doodle or write me a PM? With all the to and fro I am not sure who is still on.   
Gina
		 
			
			Hello Gina,   
I’m still in. Sunday 2pm works perfectly fine for me. Confirmed on Doodle too.   
Awaiting your news.
		 
			
			Great Idea. I'd join. I am interested to play Scrabble, chess or Monopoly. Anything else I'd have to learn.  Let me know if I can bring anything, be of any help in organising : )
		 
			
			LaDeLu, good to know   Then I think you should confirm your presence here:    
			
			Hi,   
since we have only 2 confirmations (Piotr and me) for Sunday 14:00, I would suggest to give it another try in a few weeks. I will add new options in doodle ...   
I trust we will get it going then ... I do not give up easily!   
And I read that there is a co-host already (very welcome!!!).   
Enjoy the rest of the weekend! 
Gina
		 
			
			Sorry all for not checking this thread sooner, but I cannot make it in the afternoon, unfortunately. Hopefully next time!
		 
			
			Sorry just realized this got updated. As a rule I can do Sunday afternoons.   
Looking forward to meeting everyone. (And trying out this Arkham horror game!)
		 
			
			Hi all,   
Should we try on sat/sun 22-23 or 29-30?    
Monopoly could be nice as a first game    
			
			22/23 could work for me. Good idea!
		    At the moment, both options seem fine to me. I propose to setup another Doodle schedule which makes easier to track things    
			
			Did I read ""hundreds of Scandinavian""that arrange board game evenings? Where?? I would be very interested in such event.. It's such a nice way to spend time together, well.. It could be    
I'm a Scandinavian and love board games. Preferably strategic ones but who an I to be difficult        
			
			Allright, where should we play then?  I'm a bit afraid if there is no place in bars on sat/sun   Unless we go early?    
(I'm trying to figure out this doodle thing so be patient )
		 
			
			You mean this weekend? Bah, Im not around anymore. Next weekend works great for me though. Yup, Doodle to the rescue! Awaiting your news.   
P.       
			
			I love board games, monopoly, risk, and others. But, my favorite is Settlers. I miss having a group of friends to play settlers with. So, if anyone is looking, please let me know.
		 
			
			Are there Starbucks in Zürich? Perhaps that might be an option for a Sunday (provided they are open, of course)...
		    There are Starbucks in Zürich ... all over the place. 
Since I don't use them, I don't know their opening hours. If they're in a major station (eg HB, Stadelhofen) then they're likely to be open on Sundays until 8pm.   
This may help you:    
			
			Greetings!   
Here's the doodle link    
As you can see i'm no master with that, sorry!    
We can bring monopoly uk classic version for 2-6 players.    
Any ideas/wishes where we could play? I see Starbucks was mentioned        
No boing your husband! Scrabble and Rummikub are the best boardgames around!
		 
			
			We give it a 2nd try to find suitable dates for the Zurich Board Games Evening.   
I have updated Doodle with 2 new options. 2 times Sunday afternoons as this would work with the Cafe Bubbles opening hours.       
Please send me your e-mail via PM, I can then update all participants via e-mail and post it here in the EF too.   
Gina
		 
			
			Hi, does not really work out as it seems ... we would be 3 for the 28th Oct. I guess we should be min 4 people.   
Might give it a 3rd and last try somewhere in November.   
Gina   
P.S. someone with the name Christoper has signed up in Doodle. Cannot get in contact as I have neither e-mail nor EF name ...
		 
			
			I'd be interested in doing this... I have Settlers, Carcassonne, and Quirkle.  I was wondering if anyone has Dominion?
		 
			
			I was thinking of starting a board game (and/or cards) night at my house in Greifensee -- maybe one weekend night per month during this Winter. I only have Scrabble here, though (my favorite game).   
If anyone is interested, please let me know.    
Other games I love are Cranium and Pictionary, but unfortunately, I don't have those here with me in CH.   
Or if you all end up needing an extra player sometime, please PM me and let me know.    
			
			Hi I am very interested in Scrabble with native spealers. Also, cribbage.  Has this event taken plce yet? It is now October. Or is there another night? I can only do Tu or Fri,Sat or Sunday.   
Thanks. 
Rainy       
			
			IS there  a board game evening planned for OCt 2012 or November 2012.I can only do Tu,Fri Sat or Sunday. I am interested in Scrabble with native or near-native speakers.Also cribbage.

gina

Deniz

			I can’t believe I missed this meetup, read about it just now. What did you guys play?   
FYI, there is this group meeting every Wed to play some games   I might give it a go sometime later this month. It would also be a good occasion to meet up with you guys too.
		 
			
			Hi Gina

Thanks. 
Lorraine

Gina

Gina

I have a few games, if you'd be short on games.    
Sofia
		 
			
			I am back to life after some stressful job weeks ...did not have any energy left to organise something...   
Will try out the meet up board games on Sundays somewhere in January. Might be an idea to join the one I tried to organise here with that one to avoid too many simultaneous events.    
will then post an update ...   
happy new year to all! 
Gina
		 
			
			Bringing an old thread back to life.  My Swiss friends are crazy about DOG, the board game.  I'd love to play it more.  Does anyone on the forum also play DOG?
		 
			
			Sure, I love it! 
Happy to meet if you want to play
		    Fantastic!  We need just two more people and we've got enough players to start a game.

			interesting choice - looking forward to making the aquaintance of ""slipstream"" fiction (thanks wikipedia  )
		    Likewise! Not a clue about the book or the author, but I am really looking forward to being educated!   Will post feedback online as usual. Have a great week!
		 
			
			It turns out I did not have enough time to read the book. How was the meeting? I have my copy though, I might read it this weekend as I will be in San Diego, CA with my feet in the sand for a long-awaited break!    
			
			We had a very fruitful and focussed discussion - a remarkable book which I will cherish for a long a time to come. I have definitely added Canada (which I felt very ignorant about) to my personal geography.   
We decided, though, that until more people join again, we will ""go private"" since it seems too much of an effort to organise official meetings and it works quite well with small numbers, too. Please PM me or CDN_lake for details of book choice, venue etc. if interested.
		    Sorry to miss!  I will add it to the list of things to read... We're moving back to the US and life is a little crazy, but I always need books    Will miss our discussions!
		 
			
			Ahhh, so much loss! I actually read the book and was ready to join, but I missed the fact that the location changed and found it out only when I came back home after spending somewhat uncomfortable 20 min in Stall 6...
		 
			
			Thanks for your valuable and continued contribution to the Book Club Anowheels, and all the best for a smooth move back!        
			
			Sorry about that, bluecherry! It's always good to subscribe to the thread or to check for last minute changes. Have already PMed you for the future meetings           Where are you moving to? Anywhere near here? (PM is fine if you want to share). Best of luck with the transition!
		 
			
			As a great fan of Abraham Lincoln I love your new avatar, BokerTov  
I would be curious to know what book is on your bedside table right now??    
On mine ist Kafkas ""Trial"", which seemed the natural choice after Camus ""The Plague"". Not a disappointment!          I have three.   
First: ""Il Matematico Impertinente"" (The Impertinent Mathematician) by Odifreddi. I agree with some of his views, but I am distant thousands of miles from others, and yet, it is very refreshing to read rational, sound arguments even for ideas I disagree with.    
Second: ""Winter of the World"" by Ken Follett. Yes, I got suckered in by the first book of the trilogy over the Christmas holidays (thanks, mom!) got attached to the characters, and felt the compelling need to read book 2 above. Plus, it's a good read for when I fly (frequently). So yes, rather than my bedside book, it's my airplane book!    
Third: ""Living History"" by Hillary Rodham Clinton, not started yet. I am and have long been a huge fan of Mrs. C and I am lookig forward to starting this book.
		    Very well said!    
Let's say that Kafka is my ""bus book"" rather than my bedside table book, which is terribly frustrating because the trips are much shorter and hectic than by plane... but I find it a bit too ""dark"" to read at night. Also due to the onirical structure of ""The Trial"" I'm afraid if I read it at night I will be dreaming about poor K.s plight every night...   
I quite admire you for the non fiction. I find it difficult to get to the end of biographies, historical or political essays etc., even if I admire the author (which doesn't include Mrs Clinton, I'm afraid ). 
I've been wishing for ages to finish another ""bus book"": Richard Dawkins ""The God Delusion"". Some parts are really entertaining and brilliant, but still, I need to concentrate too much... probably I'm just lazy!
		 
			
			Wow, so cool there is a book club.   
I'd love to come along to the next meeting, is it open for anybody to join?    
Being a massive bookworm and at the same time looking to meet some new friends here in Switzerland, it sounds great    
			
			Fine, I'll put you on my PM list    
			
			Is someone still running a Zurich Book Club? 
Not for me (too busy with other projects) but a very interesting discussion partner is looking for a book club.  Any suggestions, please?
		    I'm only aware of Zurich Book Swap, they usually meet on Fridays. There is one book club listed on the meetup website I think, though I'm not a member of it. 
In the meantime, there's a virtual book club (a social experiment) going on, in case he/she is also interested in participating.
		 
			
			There's two that I know of: 
1. Meetup:   
2. Internations:   
I might organise one myself and will post here when I do.

			Okay it's a bit specific.   Sadly my expat friend with two kids the same age as my two girls, have moved away from Switzerland for ever and we are quite devastated. So now I'm looking for a new replacement mom-friend nearby, for casual meet ups and playdates. We live near Hinterdorf Seen. Anyone interested in meeting up?   
Yes we also have other friends, but they are not conveniently living in Seen.

			If you live in Bülach then you may want to come and participate in a beer or two at the Craft Bier Keller tonight in the main square.     
 Sean a rather talented muscian from Ireland will playing, mostly folk style I gather but he did a great version of ""This is the One"" by the Stone Roses at a wedding recently!! Hopefully he will play it again tonight?     
I believe it starts around 20.00     
Apart from Sean and one other person I dont anybody, so dont be shy and come and say hello, Its only a little place so should be easy to pick us out!
