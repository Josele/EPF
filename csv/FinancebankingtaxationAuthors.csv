11	Financebankingtaxation	Canton change - 3rd pillar tax refund for taxed at source	spieler	182	10	Location: Baden	Today, 13:04	" 
			
			If you're taxed at source only, you should file a form for tax at source correction. Not 100% sure which canton - I'd start by asking the last one for a given year. Beware that there are some very strict filing deadlines, depending on the canton, or you lose the tax advantage. In Zürich and Bern this should be filed shortly after the year's end - by 31 March. In AG the deadline seems to be 5 years.   
Here are some links where you can find the forms:

A Swiss in Switzerland is a Swiss, regardless of any other citizenship, and only has to follow Swiss law. Should they then go to the US, that's another situation.   
That a foreign entity can force their absurd laws in such a case is truly screwed up.   
And I don't see the US handing over details of Swiss bank accounts in the US, either.

			Ynab comes with a particular money philosophy where you pre-allocate ahead of time.    
To be honest, I don't use it that way, and I do tend to forecast ahead and it's absolutely possible to use it that way, it's just that the plan ahead philosophy will probably mean that you save substantially more in the long run.   
Ynab allows for two options with leftover money, you can roll it over as surplus funds to start the next month, or you allocate to (as you say) to a savings or investment category.    
They do have an excellent website and forum, and lots of videos etc so you can really get the concept and work out any problems you might have.

19	Financebankingtaxation	Low cost Investment Funds in Switzerland	Steve77	28614	154	Location: Geneva	09.09.2013, 19:36	" 
			
			I will move to switzerland soon and I Have exactly the same question and after a little bit of searching on the internet and reading the previous posts this is my conclusion:   
For investing money as savings my aproach will be to use ETF´s at Post Finance. Here is why. It is simple and free to open an account, the fees are not that expensive (compared to other swiss options which is the point of the thread)   
The cost of buying or selling and ETF is around 0.35% (or 35 CHF per 10000 transaction). There is NO custody fees. ETF are great because of the much lower fees than mutual funds and you can by an ETF that replicates your favourite index (SP 500 for example as suggersted above).   
Best of all, If I understood Jim correctly and other forum members there is no capital gains tax in switzerland. So if I buy an ETF for 10000 today and I sell it for 12000 in five years I do not have to pay any tax on these earned 2000. Am I correct?   
If somebody have some suggestions to us non financial experts please let us know. (and I am not rich to hire a financial adviser so I try to do everything myself)

You can store your bitcoins from within your exchange account (the riskier), offline(safest), up to store on hash code in a paper.

26	Financebankingtaxation	Betreibung  no longer resident in CH	msmaddymax	393	3	Location: other side of the pond	03.01.2017, 05:40	" 
			
			If don't feel like paying it, I wouldn't even acknowledge the receipt of any communication from them especially if it's not sent by registered post. When dealing with abusive firms, the less they know and hear from you, the better you sleep.   
After 5 years if they don't pursue the matter any further, the bill silently expires in Switzerland. During those 5 years they may only slap onto it 5% interest + costs of the Betreibung itself (30-40 Fr or so). But if it comes to a court and they have a case, you might end up owing them court costs too, which can be costly. But for a couple of hundred franks with debtor abroad, it's probably not really worth it for them to go this way.   
But consider also what implications foreign unpaid bills may have in your current country, whether it can affect your credit score or something. Some inkasso firms like Intrum Justitia, for example, operate internationally in many countries, and I presume would not hesitate to tell your future creditors about any dirt they have on you.

			1) I have found that the spread and fee savings at IB more than compensates the $10 fee per month. I have between $1000-2500 per month for savings/investments that i manage to save. Xe.com has been charging me about 1.5 % commision. This means they take about $15-$37 per month. Plus I would need to pay a commission to a broker when buying shares. (between $7-10 per trade)  IB gives an exchange rate thats extremely close to the interbank rate and charges $2. For me that means the other $8 that I need to spend at IB to reach the minimum is ""house money""   
How do you know that they use interbank rates, do you have some sort of proof from them and have you checked the out with an actual  FX deal you transacted with them?   
I ask this because I do FX deal with UBS every month (CHF/GBP) and I know their rates are not the best but at least it's more secure than a broker (correct me if I'm wrong) and easy to control the flows of cash as I have CHF and GBP account and send the cash to UK from the GBP account.

Is it the reality you got from the press as in the case of Robert Gaines-Cooper, or the reality when US citizens get taxed despite their residence and you think all treaties fail? I think it's sad when ignorant people judge something without understanding it.  Sure there are many cases tax treaties can't resolve but they do resolve a lot of cases, if not the majority of double taxation cases.    
Sorry I didn't think you could read since I have mentioned that point in previous posts but you kept bringing that up...   
Anyway there's no point in explaining one thing over and over. If you still don't understand it now I doubt you will ever understand it.

37	Financebankingtaxation	Capital gains 0%, dividends high%: Isn't it bizarre?	Capo	1249	11	Location: The World	15.07.2016, 11:42	"    Not all capital gains are tax free in CH. Only ""private capitals gains"" are tax free. Business/professional capital gains are treated as investment income and  taxable for income tax purposes. The distinction is sometimes not so easy but there are a number of indications used to classify capital gains as private capital gains (tax free status) or investment income (taxable). For example capital gains arising from trading in large amounts, use of borrowed funds in trading, etc. would lead to a taxable investment income treatment.   
Dividend withholding tax is 35% in CH. This withholding tax has two functions: 
- Is final taxation of non-resident recipients (not unusual, almost all countries impose WHT on non-resident recipients, for example, dividend WHT in US and Australia is both 30%) 
- Prevent tax evasion by Swiss taxpayer. This means Swiss taxpayers if duly declare it for their own income tax purposes can get a full refund or receive full tax credit for this WHT.   
So business capital gains and dividends are actually taxed the same...

The tax saving is earned(spread if you will)  over the timespan the money is blocked. That's simply how annualized return is computed.   
Otherwise you would have to assume it's (partially) earned either at the moment of pay-in or pay-out, in both cases the rate of return would be infinite as the timespan is infinitely short.

They must have an algo to decide which of the currencies they use to fund the purchases in non EUR, USD or GBP transactions.   
In any case it shouldn't matter that much as they use the interbank rate as the basis for conversions, so converting from EUR to CHF or GBP to CHF should yield the same result but of course it should be easily identifiable to the customer what the Algo is.      Interesting... So what you effectively have is an online wallet (with a 0% funding fee!) with a pre-paid credit card attached to it!

I am looking for such a person who can advise a US expat in Zurich area. That is: hourly fee, quite knowledgeable in US-Swiss taxes and retirement planning.

			Investments are all about risk - owning something in a foreign country carries a FX risk, having debt against it incurs an IR risk. Then look at economic risk - inflation/deflation.   
If you earn, own and borrow in a single country you lower your exposure to risk.    
The best situation is to have bought with CHF 10 years ago - pay the GBP mortgage with earned CHF - and then retired to GBP-Land with a CHF pension.

			It is the withholding tax on interest paid. 
1) It gets even applied when you are Swiss. 
2) It is only applied if the interest is CHF 200 or more. 
3) The interest in your account is 0%. 
4) Do the math how much you need on your account that it makes so much interest that you have to pay witholding tax on the interest. 
5) Laugh or cry.

			Thanks.   
Savingsaccounts have a max withdraw of 50K per year, so that is not very helpfull.   
BCGE accepts a custody account for your deposit.  You can invest the money in securities, or transfer those free of charge (for the accepting bank BCGE, origin bank might charge you for that). Costs for the custody account is 0.2% p/y.   
Price for banking with BCGE is 6 account fee + 5 non-domiciled fee CHF per month, so not very expensive.   
As for interest. You have to consider the FX element, my guess is that the EUR will depreciate vs the Frank (due to the ECB printing euro's as madman). This will mostlikely offset any interest losses.   
Keep in mind we live in a very unstable time frame, keeping money 'steady' instead of lossing it is already a wise investment strategy. (imho)

66	Financebankingtaxation	Please help : My father's funds are blocked, how to solve it?	blueblay	8329	56	Location: Taiwan	30.07.2014, 05:09	" 
			
			(1)    How does UBS know the correct transfer history of my fathers  
funds? Why UBS can be so rude to treat my fathers account like that?      - No they do not that is why your dad's funds are blocked. UBS are not rude but following procedure. They also have tousands of customers a day that transfer millions and as your dad is not a customer of UBS and has no history with them they probably feel they do not have to bend down in front of you for 2m dollars/frs   
(2)    Is it legal for any Swiss bank to easily block clients funds without negotiation and notification? Especially for a foreign client?     Yes     
(3)    My fathers fund has been blocked for almost 7 months. Its really ridiculous. How long does it usually take to resolve such situation?      depends how quickly the owner of the funds can prove they are clean and how fast you can get all the document requirements in order.     
(4)    Is it anyway to return our funds back? What is the worst case that we cant get our funds back?     the funds are frozen, worst case they are confiscated if proven to be in relation to criminal activities   
(5)    My father never received any official mail or letter from any institution during this period, we got all information from the asset management company. We tried to communicate directly to the private bank or UBS for checking further status, but no one answer. Is it right?      what is the name of this private bank/institution - are you sure they are even based in switzerland? sounds odd   
(6)    Did we meet with a fraud(I mean the asset management company)? How will I know this is not a fraud and how to detect my fathers funds are still existing?     No idea - to be honest it is possible as your story is dodgy     
(7)    Is it possible to ask Taiwan Ambassador or other sources for help? How can we speedup this process?     By getting the documents and proving the funds are ledgit is the only way in my opinion. If you call in your cavalry such as a taiwanese embassador you will first of all only be harming yourself by proving you want to use big people in big places to pressure a bank - that looks dodgy no offence.     
(8)    If my father finally is approved that he is clean, may we ask compensation? If yes, who should take responsibility for this?      You need to get a serious lawyer (swiss financial lawyer). If your dad is legit and so are the funds, you will spare a few hundred tousand to pay a good lawyer to get you out of the sh*t  "	Posts: 7	Join Date: Jul 2014	Newbie	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	become a little unpopular

I use our PostFinance account and put a set amount each month into it - slightly more than what my payment slips say I need to pay - and then make the payments from that account.  I get 9 commune/cantonal invoices a year (May to January) and I also get 6 blank Federal ones along with a note of the estimate and what the monthly figure is and I pay those any 6 months I like.  The bit extra going into the account each month also acts as an emergency fund if needed for things like downpayment on a new car, vet bills, paying any extra tax if we've underpaid, etc.  With a standing order at our bank it's easy to change the amount transferred to PostFinance, temporarily stop the payments if I think the account doesn't need topping up, etc.   
And yes jamon8, ask your cantonal tax office for a payment slip.

			Either delay getting the account until you dump the card or open it by providing the info needed, then inform the bank once you've dumped the card in the near future.  Make sure you do it properly with an I-407 form and keep a copy of it, it's the only proof you'll have for the bank that you've given it up as the US won't send you anything to confirm it.  Giving up US citizenship gets you a CLN to show, a Green Card holder gets nothing similar.  Only the form is proof that you've done it.   
No bank here will allow you to open an account as a Green Card holder without the required info.

Still it's not clear to me and I will need to dig deeper into the regulations and talk to specialists.   
I am aware that the some institutional investors such as pension funds obviously do not have to list all their "" beneficial owners"" so I was wondering how to structure something similar that would comply with FINMA.   
Anyway, thank you guys for the feedback.

In Zurich you get 0.3% deduction from income to look after your investments which exceeds wealth tax liability for the first 6 million or so, therefore it pays to declare assets.

			The question of ""why"" is reasonable. There is nothing ""fishy"" about it.  The reason is same as why some perfectly healthy people buy insurance, it's just in case. The other reason is I hate the idea of ""big brother"" knowing everything and having the potential absolute total control of my financial interests. Having alittle money somewhere secure away from the big bad government is a good thing. There are no laws against this. You are supposed to report assets over 10K USD held outside. Calamity does occur and having some protection is argueable.

Mostly the concern for money laundering is with the receiving bank.

Most cantonal taxes are progressive, the more you earn, the more, more taxed you pay. Flat tax is also possible. Degressive tax is not allowed based Swiss constitution and Federal Court Ruling 2P.43/2006.   
Lausanne, unmarried, no kids, no church:  
taxable income == tax 
310k == 118'456.80 
300k == 113'517.55 
delta == 4939.25   
120k == 31'423.65 
110k == 27'597.70 
delta == 3825.95   
20k  == 2'455.55 
10k  == 865.15 
delta == 2369.40   
And even for low income it equates to thousands of francs in tax savings in canton Vaud. It looks like canton Vaud has quite a steep marginal tax rates for low incomes.

My first port of call would be the Zürich office of PwC, KPMG, EY or Deloitte or alternatively your aunt's tax advisor for either advice or a referral to a specialist.

106	Financebankingtaxation	2nd pillar investment funds	rmaunder	796	0	Location: Geneva	17.11.2016, 13:18	" 
			
			Hello,   
I see a lot of post here regarding people leaving CH and transferring 2nd pillar contributions out of country. However very little on keeping funds in CH during period without a Swiss employer / fund.   
I worked for a Swiss employer for about 5 years and built a reasonable 2nd pillar pot. When I left this job 14 months ago I moved the funds into a Post Finance ""Compte Libre"" (Freizügigkeitskonto) account.     
This was meant to be a temporary place to park money, until taking another job when the funds would move to new employer. It originally paid 0.5% (hardly great) but has reduced to 0.2% today. The only upside is no fees or really risk to capital.   
However my situation today is that I now work for a UK employer, spend 3 days week in London, 2 days working from home. I pay tax in UK, with CH declaration at end of year. My family continue to live in CH, my wife works these and we still own home.    
Long term plan is still to find suitable employment in CH again but that might be at least another 12 - 24 months.   
In meantime I'm trying to figure out a better thing to do with the 2nd pillar contributions I have in CH. Obviously there is all the risk / return questions - as getting anything better implies accepting some risk on the capital. Additionally it might be only in the fund for a relatively short period before moved out again to future employer (unless I decide to keep separate and start another one).   
I'm trying to find a good site / broker which can give me some guidance. So far a few I turned up were:         
Wondered if anyone else out there has faced similar issues (possibly due to being self employed) and has some suggestions?   
Many thanks   
Richard

			The Geneva authorities fixed this problem a few years ago after a few court cases and the federal authorities put pressure on them.  Since several years, for Geneva you are definitely not taxed on spousal income, only your own.  You put zero for spouse even if married.  Prior to this fix, they did indeed tax unfairly the income of the UN spouse.  Vaud does not have this jurisprudence, but last I knew they did not add it in, and the same priciple applies.  But I guess you are in France, so not sure how the French authorities treat it, but probably not in your favour.

114	Financebankingtaxation	Split salary between two countries?	3Wishes	636	9	Location: Bern area	13.11.2016, 13:28	"    The nick is ""Urs Max""  
Urs is fine though    Without knowing the costs it's impossible to determine if this is a good offer or not. At the very least have them provide an example calculation with 1000CHF that shows how much is actually sent to your US account after all fees and deductions, and that also shows the market rate it's based upon; typically the markup on the market rate is where the bank makes its money.    
As things stand you buy a pig in a poke and don't even know who (which bank) you're dealing with. What are you gonna do if the money doesn't arrive in your US account?    I thought Revolut had announced they would implement deposits in CHF during 2015, but apparently they didn't or I mis-remember. Since without that feature you need banks anyway it's probably not worth it.   
So currencyfair or transferwise may well be worth a closer look.

Keen to get educated about various deductions which are feasible in Zurich canton with respect to personal taxation (dual income household with 2 kids), and also for a GmbH.   
I have googled for this a few times, but each year end up realizing & learning about new exemptions.  And, whenever I ask my Accountant - he has a sweet response - oh - I didn't know you were spending money towards this as well    
Also, would be great to get educated about - which all exemptions need a formal proof, i.e. receipt to be submitted (so that I can retain them moving forward atleast).   
Thanks in advance.

			Hi, can someone please help me.          
1) My son has the theme ""berufs woche"" at school.  
2) So he has to start preparing for berufs woche. 
3) We live in Menzingen in Canton Zug. 
4) He is trying to find out how one can do online fx trading as an occupation and 
5) If there are any companies in Canton Zug or Zurich which offer online fx trading as a profession. If not, 
6) Are there perhaps any other professions which might offer this type of profession?  
8) I have contacted UBS and Zuger Kantonalbank and they said no.   
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.   
Yours sincerely,

			As a non-EU national studying here you cannot be self employed nor can you work for the first 6 months of your course.  You need an employment contract with a Swiss employer and you cannot work more than 15 hours a week during term time.   
I don't know where you're studying, but this is from the ETHZ website:           
During the semester, you may accept a paid part-time job of no more than 15 hours a week. Full-time employment is permitted during the regular semester vacations. However, in both cases your employer will have to apply for your work permit at the cantonal Office for Economy and Labour (""Amt für Wirtschaft und Arbeit""  AWA) if you come from a non-EU country or from Romania or Bulgaria. This is only possible once you have received your residence permit!       
Bachelor students from non-EU countries must have lived in Switzerland for at least 6 months to obtain a work permit.   
During their first 6 months in Switzerland, Master students from non-EU countries can only obtain a work permit for a job at their ETH department.

This is just my two cents, but I think the USD will drop no matter who is elected.

			I had a similar issue when i moved from Zürich to Schwyz. I spoke to my Gemeinde and they recommended speaking to the withholding tax official at Kantonal tax office. He agreed that there was money owed from Zürich and said they were really slow at transferring. He put a block on my bill from the Kanton and sent an email to the Gemeinde asking them to do the same.    
Can't say for sure if he speaks English or not, so if you don't speak German, it may be worth getting someone to call on your behalf.

I never tried this but I heard of it. Do they give you the live rate or a marked up rate but marked up a little better than their online rate?   
I was under the impression that if you ring their trade desk they still mark up the interbank rate but not as much as their online platform does and obviously speaking to them on the phone attracts a minimum fee that you mentioned or thereabouts.

Probably worth splitting over a few years if it's a big fund. Hargreaves Landsdown have a reasonably economic drawdown scheme.   
I suspect you need to fill in a UK tax return to get the personal allowance, I am very interested in how this works as I will be doing this in 1 years time.    I don't know any country other than Switzerland with compulsory insurance. I know people moving to France, Germany, Italy, UK & Malta who have taken cash before the earliest normal retirement of 60.

153	Financebankingtaxation	Pillar 3a stock funds	landoa	4161	24	Location: Geneva	19.12.2014, 00:51	"    I agree, sensei but the path to financial freedom is long and hard for those bombarded with   and the promise of tax breaks. They (or should I say, we) cannot see the forest for the trees...    
I think it should be sticky up there in the section that rule of thumb goes:  
- if you have an investment horizon of 20 or more years, stay out of 3a and invest in low-cost funds, diversify and buy-and-hold no matter what. 
- if you are on the market for a primary residence in 5-10 years, stick to 3a, as the tax breaks make sense. Else, go option 1 
For those rich enough and smart enough, the truth perhaps lies in the mix of both - put money on the 3a to buy property while on the side you invest properly and with low TER?    
In my research of 3a funds (as we are on the market for a house soon-ish), I found UBS to be daylight robbery with TER of 1.4% and higher, CS to be second with classic robbery and so far lowest fees Raiffeisen (your random mugging kinda thing). What sets the Raiffeisen offer apart is also the higher equity component at 2/3 of the mix, whereas both UBS and CS cap at 45%.    
What say you, sensei - does above make better sense?   "	Posts: 6	Join Date: Dec 2014	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

He has been described for years as the man without a face (there were zero pictures known of him). A few years ago a French-speaking Belgian journalist managed to pin a face on the man and wrote an article about him (including the picture). Insiders told that the man was enraged (as he is scared to death to be kidnapped). I understand his concerns. It's probably more than just about taxes. It's about living a discreet life, having fiscal rules that are more predictable (in sharp contrast to the Belgian government who has been changing rules related to taxes all the time). Maybe the terrorist threat plays a role as well. Geneva is considered way safer than Brussels.

			Well I would consider I'd pay less tax after moving abroad. Difference coming from treating the property as a side income at the top of your tax progression, reasoning is that you have your main income from the job either way, and it was your conscious choice to keep the money invested in the property rather than in e.g. capital-gains-tax-free stocks. A rough calculation to demonstrate:   
Assumptions: taxable in city of Zürich, single, 1M wealth, 200K taxable income from main occupation, 20K taxable income from property (from rent or Eigenmietwert minus deductions).   
Case 1. You live in Zurich. Taxes for 220K income: 61408 Fr, or 27.9%. But if you didn't have the property, you'd pay only 53512 Fr for 200K. Hence you're paying 7896 Fr taxes for your property, which gives 7896/20K = 39.5% rate.   
Case 2. You moved abroad, kept property. Taxable income base in Switzerland is still 220K, and the rate is still 27.9%. BUT: the actual income on which tax is due in ZH is only 20K, you'll pay only 5580 Fr in taxes on it - 27.9% rate.   
Actually, as your main income abroad probably would not remain constant, but drop, you'll pay even less... But then there's the question of how your new coutnry is going to treat your swiss income.

			Thank you all for your valuable inputs. Appreciate your kindness.   
I will have to rely on the debit card (HSBC visa debit contact-less) as I don't have a credit card. Looks like I have to check with the bank on the best type of account(Basic,advance etc) to use in CH. I will soon visit local branch.   
I was under the impression that house contract is only needed for applying for job seeker or work permit (L or B depending on the duration) which is either after living 3 months in CH without job (job Seeker Permit )or after getting a job (Work Permit). My plan is to register with in 14 days of arrival as I intent to stay permanently in CH. I believe just an address will be sufficient for registration and gemeinde can't insist on a house contract.    
IMHO ,Registration and permit are different things. Registration has only come to effect after 2007 as part of the EU freedom of movement and thus most seasoned EFers might not have to go through it. Above is my understanding after reading both Swiss & EU documents .Can somebody confirm ? Anybody has gone through this recently ?

164	Financebankingtaxation	Freizuegigkeitskonto [vested benefit account]	ommthree	38099	149	Location: Zürich	13.08.2007, 13:43	"    I am not quite sure what you are getting at here, other than a way to convert bonds into cash legitimately. You also need to be careful what you are saying about the restrictions on BVG accounts.    
In practice a Freizugigkeitskonto is simply an investment account in which you can place cash from the funds of your pension scheme when you are either not working, have changed jobs or are leaving the country. Many banks and insurance companies offer this type of account and additionally pay a fixed interest of 1.5% either now or at the next quarter end. This might not seem an attractive growth rate so it is possible again with practically every company offering these accounts to switch to a Freizugigkeits depot account. With this type of account it is possible to invest in a range of BVG type funds which offer a (usually) better rate of return. As an example long term bonds over 25 years offering 4% are not unusual and this provides a ""win"" of 2.5% over the standard offerings.   
Note here that for the OP it is necessary to ascertain what the motivations are and what can be done with the money in the BVG account. Is this all mandatory BVG or is there additional monies in there? All money that is not mandatory can be cashed in on leaving Switzerland, and this is actually more tax efficient than leaving it in for the reason that monies paid out of the BVG in the form of pension are subject to tax at the normal rate whereas capital payments are taxed at 40% of the normal rate...

			Just thought I'd add to this thread, since there is confusing information on wechselstube.ch on here.    
I recently opened an account with wechselstube.ch as a private customer since I was looking to convert large amounts and wanted to obtain a good exchange rate. You can have an account as a private customer as long as you are transferring money only to your own bank account in another currency. In my case from my CHF bank account to my British Pound bank account which are both in my names.   
I signed up online and sent them a copy of my permit (stamped at the postoffice) and copy of passport, within 2 days, they called me up and gave me my account details.

I will NEVER live in the U.S. again and I'm very disappointed in the country, so it's not just the tax situation for me. I'm more of a ""conscientious objector"" in a way. However, I'm going to have to make up my mind. I guess if I had three citizenship's, I would drop the U.S. citizenship like a hot potato! Anyways, I will have to decide soon and I'm about 75% there!

			As with parking/speeding tickets the correct procedure with bills from collecting agencies is:   
1. Pay the bill (even if you dont agree to it). 
2. Start a complaint procedure to try and get your money back, if you feel you have a case.   
Think of Intrum like Hells Angels. They purchase a debt and use force to collect it, together with their fees. And they   collect it. You need to pay Hells Angels to get rid of them. Hells Angels dont care about you not having received an invoice a year ago or whatever, neither does the client who sold the debt to Hells Angels. They just want their money, with interest, right now.    
The matter is between you and Hells...sorry, Intrum Justicia now.

171	Financebankingtaxation	CASATAX + Penalty	magic	313	0	Location: Geneva	14.10.2016, 17:28	" 
			
			So a couple of years ago I asked the financial people at AXA to reduce my Pillar 3A in order that I could afford to rent a small apartment as my wife and myself decided to split-up. They agreed and all seemed well until about a year later when we were sent a demand by the lenders of our mortgage that by doing so we owed another 10K for the last year. The policy was tied to the mortgage and should not have been allowed to be reduced.   
My mistake for not knowing and or understanding this at the time. (However I never expected our marriage to end but there you go)   
So AXA work out a way around with a new policy but at a higher premium for the next 6 years, problem goes away, we thought.   
Now I get a bill of 9K + 2K fine for fraud from the recovery department in Geneva for CASATAX, my ex contacts them and they inform her this is because we effectively broke the terms of the agreement on our apartment. Contact AXA they say yes didnt you expect this?   
I have been able to negotiate paying the bill + fine over the next 12 months; so accepted and move on.   
Just wanted to share the story for two reasons:   
1.	If you are unfortunate for your marriage to break-up and money is tight which it is, be careful what you do. 
2.	Anyone give some feedback if AXA have some responsibility.   
I dont hold much hope because I have been conditioned living here that when you make mistakes it usually is expensive.

			As a resident of Switzerland, Switzerland SCO will coordinate your social security application with the US. You should expect that the US social security amount will be reduced by the so-called ""windfall"" provision and that you will physically receive two payments. See this link for ""Information about the social security agreement Switzerland and the United States of America"" and read, in particular, sections 8 and 9:       
Also this link contains useful information:       
If you are a US Person, you are normally subject to US income tax on your worldwide income. The US income tax that you pay on the US social security benefit will be determined by amount of your total earnings and other factors. If you are not a US Person, you should expect a 15% US withholding tax:         
For further information, you might wish to contact a US CPA in the Geneva area and could possibly find one in your area on this list:      "	Posts: 173	Join Date: Dec 2007	Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 99 Times in 56 Posts	considered knowledgeable

You need to be aware of the currency risk in doing that, similar to taking out a CHF loan for a property in a non CHF country.   
I did have a good amount of savings and the interest etc to pay on the loan is not high so the bank thought the risk to be acceptable.   
So it not only depends on your permit but also on your risk appetite and your personal income and savings.

			Sounds to me like you would be better off with a Tagesmutter/nourrice/gardienne/maman du jour/whatever it is in French. Maybe you could even find another parent who requires such services, reducing the cost further? Not sure what the law states but I think if the kids are over three years old, having one carer for four kids in a reasonably sized apartment should be ok, no?  
If I remember correctly, there was a vote not that long ago about a higher amount of childcare costs being deductible and it was rejected because it was considered unfair towards families where mum stays home to look after the kids (at least that's what the SVP posters said, it would of course also mean a loss of tax revenue, the more reasonable argument against it - probably the real reason it was turned down)? Something like that. We vote on so much stuff, you forget what you voted about. I may even be remembering this wrong, feel free to correct me.

			Price is OBVIOUSLY the most important thing here. Why? Let's say you get into a trade, and things change, and you want to get out. Why should you pay $9.95 a trade or even more when you can pay $1 at Interactive Brokers?   
You don't need to call in and get someone to hold your hand and teach you how to trade. The internet can do that easily for you.   
IB will explain their platform easily. Even if it's in US dollars, European stocks on the NYSE trading as ETF's will already have the exchange rate factored into the prices anyways.    
You can also pay a small subscription fee for eSignal, and that will hook into Interactive Brokers, and then you get awesome real time charting.   
Oh ya, when some brokers say that they get better ""fills"" that's a load of hoopla. Just place a limit order. Something that's web based, and doesn't have an installable platform to trade with is an inexcusable joke, and goes to show why many brokers in Europe are 10 years behind. Don't pay more than $1 per trade or you're getting ripped off.

			If you pay a EUR purchase with your UBS credit card, you get charged a 1.75% commission over their sell rate (typically the interbank exchange rate +1.4-1.5%). So, in total, you pay 3.2-3.3% extra per transaction.   
From SEPA transfers, there is a charge of 0.30.- with the same sell rate mentioned before.   
If you buy Euros on the counter or withdraw them from an UBS ATM, the banknote sell rate is used (around 2.5% on top of the interbank exchange rate for EUR if I am not mistaken, but I cannot check this out at the moment).

You're still better off than with direct amortization using your after-tax cash. 
3B is useless as the contribution is not tax-deductible and that's where the (only) 3A advantage over direct amortization comes from.

205	Financebankingtaxation	Freelancing in Switzerland	Gorlami	1025	6	Location: Luzern	10.09.2016, 19:55	" 
			
			Hey guys. 
I searched the forum(and the internet), but couldn't find the answer that could make me happy    
So, this is the situation: 
My wife has a full time job(100%), as well as myself(100%). We both would like to add some more work on our free time, as a freelancers.    
Which is the best way to do this?   
We are not planing on working more than couple hours per day, so there is not going to be that much money involved.   
I know, someone will say that the best solution is to find clients, do the work, and get money on hands, but I wouldn't like to have some problems with the tax authority later.   
Is there a way to just report the money that we earn(which came on our accounts) as additional earnings later on when we fill our tax report? 
Or do we need to found a sole ownership for that?

			Welcome to EF, Kumar. 
An intro would be nice.. but coming to your question.   
Presuming you have declared in your SWISS tax return when you transferred the  money to India, and have been paying tax in India on the interest earned thereon, there is no question of the same money being taxed twice (i.e. when you bring it back)   
Regarding the transfer - you have practically nothing to worry regarding source of funds / drugs / terror etc etc. You need to transfer funds via the "" "". You have been out of India for less that EIGHT years, so you probably have an NRO account. LRS can be used for resident as well as NRO accounts.   
In case the USD 125,000.00 falls short, and you already have funds in INR in your account, you can 'gift' to your immediate family members and they can then 'gift' to you into your Swiss bank account via LRS on their own.   
You will need a bit of documentation to establish that the funds are tax paid in India - which should not be too difficult as you can bank / CA will provide relevant docs.

Short term, yes, for tax avoidance, if you plan on getting the money out in a few years anyway (for property or moving abroad). But I'd utilize pillar 3a to the max here first, its withdrawal conditions are more liberal.      A car is an expense, not investement. You're guaranteed to lose money on its deprectiation.

S&P 500 Total Return on 2011-10-01:   - it never went lower since     
I can imagine waiting 20 months for your value to recover can be nerve-wrecking, but at the same time, this scary world crisis wouldn't hurt you if you just didn't sell.      Of course, war is a big risk. But why do you think bonds or gold provide you safety? If you don't have physical gold hidden somewhere, you will never know if the gold that you think you own even exists. The only reason I would consider to buy gold, is that other people believe it has any value in times of crisis.        That's as long as the majority agrees to believe it. USA has the biggest net external debt in the World. What if something undermines the trust in USD, interest rates go up and USA can no longer finance their huge debt?        You didn't. I just meant that these were the dates that I had available and if you went back a bit more, you could arrive at a more attractive rate of return.        That's actually better than I expected  . And the Annualized S&P 500 Return (Dividends Reinvested) between Jan 1984 and Jan 2013 was 10.46%.        Nothing, but it only makes sense to compare returns of two portfolios if they are in the same currency. A USD porftolio might show a rate of return of 10%, but e.g. 3% of it is Inflation.

""related to a property abroad, you have to declare the property value + possible rental income  Satzbestimmend (wage) on your annual tax statements. 
However a Schenkungssteuer is excluded, and you do do not have to pay any Schenkungssteuer on it. Because the property is abroad and not in Switzerland, and your parents are not domiziled in Switzerland.""

			Ivank, 
My comment was because you came in off topic, the discussion was not about rates but about the time it takes to complete a transfer.    
My experience with the company I mentioned is that in every case the money was delivered not later than the next business day. My experience with the high street banks, in both countries, is that I never received the money in less than two business days, often more.   
I agree that they don't always have the best rates but this is due to their business model. But they often do have very good rates and one would be a fool to not look around for the best service and rates for your needs.

			Swiss banks are reluctant to open ordinary bank accounts for Americans living in Switzerland because the financial risk is too great. In 2015 the US government extracted a $2 million fine out of PostFinance for having a grand total of   poorly documented documents belonging to Americans, out of a total of three million accounts at PostFinance.   
Recently Wells Fargo, a large US bank, was fined $185 million for having opened   unauthorized accounts and credit cards, or $92.50 per unauthorized account. If the US government had fined Wells Fargo at the same $1 million per account that it did PostFinance, Wells Fargo's would have been  , and it would be bankrupt!       
In the past several years the US government extracted as much money as possible out of the banks in Switzerland and, as a result, Americans residing here have been denied ordinary banking services. Not surprisingly, the number of Americans resident in Switzerland has declined in the past four years from 18,118 (June 2012) to 16,975 (July 2016), or -6.3%.

232	Financebankingtaxation	why my card balance in e-banking and ATM doesn't match?	shadip	457	6	Location: Geneva	14.09.2016, 01:11	" 
			
			It could be due to the difference between booking date and valuta date. Generally speaking Valuta defines availability of the money and when interest starts to accrue whereas booking date defines when the money shows in the account balance. Differences between the two are probably the reason for what roegner describes above.   
Valuta cutoff happens between 15:00 and 17:00 these days. Ignoring the intricacies of payments between 3pm and 5pm to keep it simple, any payments that are entered before 3pm get valuta ""today"" whereas those after 5pm get valuta ""tomorrow"" (which can be multiple calendar days away, for instance payments entered before holidays or on Friday evening). So if the new credit was sent after 5pm yesterday, it may not be available before tomorrow (or after 5pm today, i.e. after the valuta cutoff).   
The difference between online and ATM may be because ATM uses cash which must be booked immediately whereas online access can be restricted to ""not earlier than valuta"", assuming the full balance is available online to begin with.   
Since banks define themselves how they react in these cases and/or what kind of transactions they allow, it may well be that person A (who uses bank xx) never has a problem such as OP whereas person B (who uses bank yy) always has it with respect to, say, salary payments.

243	Financebankingtaxation	best (cheapest) way to change money (CHF->EUR)	guest	13179	15	null	null	" 
			
			i know this question was asked many times, but i couldn't find good answer.   
what would be the cheapest way to exchange francs to euros? I have account at postfinance, according to their site, this is current exchange rate:    so they sell euros to me for 1.45 chf, according to this   average right now is 1.43 for every euro, so i think it is pretty normal exchange rate.   
do you think i will be able to get better rate at sbb or the zurich airport? or anywhere else? if so, where and any idea how to check current exchange rate at the airport for example? google doesn't help, and getting there just to check exchange rate doesn't seem to be good idea

If prices fall they will ask for an increased deposit or can recall the loan in full.   
You need to ask how many years salary they will lend maximum, then you will have the no's for yourself.

			First of all congratulations on getting married.    
You will have to update your marital status with both your employer and cantonal/commune office. Reason for updating with HR/employer is that they are the ones who pay you and are responsible for deducting the tax at source (Assuming you are on B permit). change in your marital status will be effective from that month and not for complete year. You will pay less taxes compared to what you paid as a bachelor.    
Go with your marriage certificate to your commune office and ask them to update your details in their records. I am not sure though if this service is for free/fee    
Regarding the tax rate, use this link     
Hope, this info helps..   
cheers..

256	Financebankingtaxation	Time period for amendment of assessed tax return in Switzerland	Salad Days	559	4	Location: Geneva	25.08.2016, 15:55	"    My French is bad and in my visits I've never found one who spoke English, but I've always taken somebody to interpret. They are polite and certainly not unhelpful. But the philosophy of the system is clearly different compared with Australia where the principle seems to be about fairness, with time having nothing to do with it. Maybe there's a sense in Australia that the ATO is after the big fish not the small one.   
In particular it is curious to observe, given the slowness of everything in Switzerland, that the periods of amending or objecting are so short. Ten days to object! Amazing. What if you are away when you receive your notice? Too bad, you lose?   
And yet on the other hand, it can take years to get your results back from tax in Switzerland.    
I would love to write a definitive guide to how it all works here!

			I miss the days of Quellensteuer and also paying tax separately. 
Had to pay tax ourselves for the first time for the year 2015 and getting these massive bills is not pleasant.   
I am looking into it and it appears at first that we have paid more tax as a married couple, taxed together, than if we had remained single and on Quellensteuer.   
Total taxable income, after AHV deductions etc: 202,902.95 
Staats and Gemeindesteuer: 23,191.50 
Bundessteuer: 11,718.00 
Total tax: 34,909.50   
I think there must be a mistake in there. 
I am checking it out with our tax lady as this seems excessive to me.   
In 2014, my personal taxable income was 83,292, Quellensteuer on that was 7,920.00. Much more manageable.   
Wish you could opt out of this system and be taxed as an individual. 
As a couple we keep our finances totally separate and to go through this tax palaver is rather frustrating for us when we don't share our finances in other ways.   
I find it a rather outdated system from when men worked and women stayed in the home.

A Brit who's father was born in Britain will almost never become a UK non dom, as UK domicile use extremely difficult to loose. It's nothing to do with where you live, more where you came from.

			I'm Australian (with Italian passport as well) with a C permit. I have been double-taxed by the Swiss and have received a refund of tax paid for the relevant years by the ATO. Now I've sorted out that part, I need to pay Swiss tax.   
My working income (as opposed to dividends/interest etc) is derived from working for business(s) in Australia and I am paid in AUD.   
Although in Australia I was a sole trader, self-employed, the Swiss don't want to define me as that and it probably isn't worth the trouble and expense to set myself up to fit their definitions.   
However, I'm used to being able to claim Home Office, computer, etc etc. Now, defined as 'salary' earner, they seem to have given me an automatic deduction of 1100CHF for expenses and nothing more on their assessment. In practice my expenses are more like 10K.    
I'm checking to see if there is anything I can claim as a salary defined individual that I don't know about. At the Geneva tax office today, I was told Health Insurance is one. Is that really it? Is there anywhere I can find this online?

			Thanks for the reply.   
The non-EU L permit holders wouldn't be self-employed in CH. They'd keep their normal Swiss jobs. The business and potential clients have nothing to do with their current work and I'm checking, but pretty sure that the employment contracts themselves are compatible with this. The income would be similar to dividends from a foreign company. Doesn't seem to break any rules that I can find.   
The corporate tax in Estonia is 0% for reinvested profits and 20% for distributed profits. (Not ideal but that is why Estonia proposes the program.) The owners of the future company would be responsible for declaring the foreign income in their Swiss personal tax declaration, I presume.   
There are relatively straightforward ways to set up a bank account in Estonia once the company has been created.   
I'm also considering Hong Kong: better tax conditions (0% for income generated outside of HK) and it's also possible to set everything up there (including banking) through vetted and reasonably priced agents.

My UK pension is worth 11 times the contributions (I have been investing the funds more recently) so tax payable on exit will exceed any, investing the money in a PEP / ISA would have been far better. There of course is no CGT in CH, so personal investments would be a better way to go IMO.

Whereas you used to be taxed on the amount by which you exceeded the exemption, you now 'go to the head of the class' on the tax table, which puts you in a much higher tax bracket. I have paid several thousand dollars in US tax over the last few years, but previously went many years without having to pay anything extra.    
The next hook is the foreign accounts. They are being unbelievably draconian with these accounts. You really need to be 100% truthful about every little account you own or they can actually confiscate the whole thing.

286	Financebankingtaxation	France or Vaud, again... One simple question...	thecrispgirls	697	14	Location: Montreux	10.08.2016, 11:19	" 
			
			If your husband only needs access to Geneva airport twice a week (assuming that's once going, once coming back) then being across the border in France might make sense, especially if you feel your daughter would be happy in the French education system (in which case she presumably speaks french).  
If she   and you need to find her an english- language secondary school then I think there's been mention of that in previous threads, try looking in the search function. Possibly there's one on that side but I'm not positive, my own children went through the local swiss system. 
The Ferney-Voltaire side is probably your best bet, road access is reasonably if you can avoid rush-hour, and there's a regular bus service from most villages into Geneva, and the airport has a separate entrance on the french side so your husband wouldn't need to enter Switzerland at all when catching his 'plane.. 
South of Geneva the landscape is arguably prettier but is definitely less well supplied with things like doctors, schools and shops.... unless you are happy living as far out as FZ that is.   
From an income point of view, with three children it's my understanding that you'd be better off in France, the dependents allowances are quite generous.

287	Financebankingtaxation	Can I move my Pillar 3a account from UBS to another bank?	ghasemi	497	1	Location: Lausanne	09.08.2016, 18:01	" 
			
			Read you UBS pillar 3 contract to determine the transfer fees. You can move the funds to a pillar 3 account at any other institution. Cantonal banks normally charge CHF 100, with some there is no charge at all for the transfer but UBS may be different. 
As it's actually beneficial to have multiple P3 accounts (because they're insured per institution) you may as well leave what you have at UBS and open another one elsewhere.

			Some card providers have recently started charging the conversion fees on cross-border transastions even if the currency selected is CHF so it's safer to just pay in GBP and your bank will then charge you CHF plus 1.5%-2.5% fee, depending on the card type (Swisscard charges it on store-branded VISA but not on frequent flyer Amex and Mastercard, go figure) 
If you select Amazon's payment in CHF there's still some 1.5% conversion fee built into the exchange rate they offer so you may end-up paying the fee twice.

This is correct. If you are planning to return to the US, there is not Need to disclose your 401k Holdings to the Swiss as non-righteous to the holy Folks as may be Sound. Yes, you should. But - real world no. Nor do I disclose any of my US Holdings.  I left my 401K as is under ML with an active Management scheme with risk tolerances consistent for my Age, and feed in accordingly.      
You are American so you know that it is going in as are the gains until you start pulling from it which is taxed then.  With the Roth IRA, this is a different Story, I believe you are taxed going in, but not as you pull from it in retirement.  If you going to do fund your 401K, I recommend you do not add more into Pillar 2 beyond what you can get from the employer and max the 401k (up to 18K I beleive), or your IRA. As for Pilllar 3, dont' open on up as that is taxed under US, so no benefit to you.  So throw that cash into IRA (or 401k, if you havent maxed there), i think Roth is haning around 5K for maxing.   of course i'm not a tax advisor and alot of it can depend on your salary Level and the way you manage your tax with the US, but as mentioned if you're headed back to the US, don't miss out on making those contributions contrast the Swiss-ones.  Ist your decision so good luck and speak to a tax advisor.

295	Financebankingtaxation	Contactless credit card payment	simple_person	3463	26	Location: Zurich	25.03.2014, 15:53	"    Am surprised none of you have mentioned it here. It can be used , contactless, for a max amount of 40CHF,  for a max number of 5 times in a day , after which it asks for the pin to be entered.   
Also  , good to know, if the mount is anything above 40chf , you can still use it contactless , but it will still ask for your pin. In other words, you never need to actually insert the card into the slot.   
I rarely carry/use cash. I use only credit card, and only contactless. If I use it more than 5 times a day (below 40chf), it will ask me for my pin. If the amount is above 40chf , it will ask for my pin. It is really convenient and quick. Contactless is available in many ticketing machines too.    
     If I do lose it (which is rare in my case) , I understand that the finder can use it 40chf X 5 times per day , until I report that I have lost my card. 
 I would know within 2-4 hours if I did lose my card. So its really comfy for me to use.

			The gold price jumped as a result of the uncertainty around the liquidity and credit crisis after the fall of Bear Stearns and Lehmann Brothers in 2008. I believe the banking system has not yet been repaired and asset valuation is so much politically driven that gold will keep his status of preferred and overvalued asset for a generation to come.

304	Financebankingtaxation	German Brokers for ETFs/Funds	Ciuccio	482	0	Location: Zurich	29.07.2016, 00:13	" 
			
			I am a Swiss resident (no US person) who is interested in buying some ETFs or funds, mainly tracking S&P 500, and keeping them on a long-term horizon. I read some discussions in the forum and many people suggest to use US brokers instead of Swiss ones, given their lower fees.   
However, I wonder why e.g. German brokers are not usually taken into account. They seem to have even lower fees than US brokers and, as suggested  , there are no problems with opening an account with them while being Swiss resident. Moreover, their range of available commission-free ETFs seems quite varied.   
Is it because German brokers are euro based? Or am I missing some other drawback?

So a $1000 invested in 1986 would be worth now $16000. That's a 10% annualized return. And if you adjust for inflation, you would have $6730, 7% return.   
Interestingly enough, this 3% difference looks similar to the devaluation of the dollar in relation to the swiss franc. is the conclusion that the swiss franc maintained it's value?

			Hi everyone, I've been trying to do some research regarding opening a bank account in Switzerland prior to me moving there in October. It seems to me that this is possible from the information I have gathered.   
However I would like to ask if there are any specific banks that would be better options than others and more importnantly what type of account do I need to consider.

OP, you are probably going to need to try the big banks like UBS or Credit Suisse. These banks might be more expensive than average, but they tend to be a bit more experienced with the ""foreign factor"". Being American, I have no experience whatsoever with the cantonal banks, but my overall impression based on hearsay is that they are good for people who have standard banking needs, but the customer service personnel are generally out of their depth with more specific, less standard needs.    
Of course your mileage may vary depending on the rank/experience of the agent with whom you speak.

Again, note the deadline for submitting this form for 2015 source taxes was 31 March 2016 and the deadline cannot be extended.

			My advice would be to quickly get in touch with a lawyer. There may be some objections that can be raised retroactively (e.g. not validly served, etc.) but only in rather short deadlines. Otherwise you might find that the debt enforcement demands may already be directly enforceable. However, if you are lucky they may have already lapsed.    
I'll pm you the contact details of Geneva lawyers.

			do some more homework and go to the commune and ask for information on plans in that neighbourhood. Try and talk to people living in the building or next to it.    
On your conclusion that it is cheap. On what criteria do you think it is cheaper than other apartments that are similar? For example, did you look if a parking place/some outside space/m2/.. is included which may explain a big difference in price.

For example, suppose the equity on your foreign property is 20% of your total asset value. Then they calculate the wealth tax on 100% but only charge you 80% of that.

For USD.CHF I am seeing a price of: 0.98075@0.98085, that's 1 hundreth of a cent wide! (with size of over 4million both sides), Their commission for $500'000 is $10 ( ) and there is no mark up. However there is a monthly activity fee of $10.   
I don't know what post finance show you, I really doubt they would show you the rate you trade at. Feel free to post a screenshot as I don't have a PF account. If they do show you the rate you can trade at, I would expect them to have a time limit on it like Swissquote does (i.e. they show a rate and it will be gone in 15 seconds) or maybe allow you to change the order type (Market or Limit). It's not easy to implement and it's doesn't really bring them that much money.

			What will happen is as u do not have any address  in Switzerland they will just publish the acte of pursuit. The date of publishing starts the 10 day period when you can make the opposition. Then, it is to the other party to react, i.e. go to court. And depending on documents, the opposition will be or not excluded. Unfortunately, it is quite a technical thing, it is not a proper trial, more like court hearing after which the judge decides based on the documents what is the probability that you owe something. And then, if the result is not satysfying, under some conditions you can go to the court for a normal trial. U do not have any estate properties in Switzerland? Because if yes, they will seize it at the first place. If you want really the act to be adressed to you you can choose a representative, not necesserily a lawyer, and inform the office about it. It's easy in geneve as there's one office for the whole canton. If anything PM me.

Please can someone assist with my query below  
I am a German national, got a new job (125K = 13th sal+bonus) in Zurich. I would like to live in Zurich for work. Am Married, one child and they will be living in Germany until 2018 due to my wife (now home maker, may be student from March 2017) higher studies.   
1. When it comes to Nett pay, Would i be counted as Single OR married with one child, non-earning spouse category under Zurich canton? 
2. As I will register my residence in Zurich, I will also be maintaining my bank accounts and my residence in Germany atleast until 2018. Can I maintain my German residence as primary or Secondary residence and at the same time allowed to apply for Permit B?   
Any guidance with this information will be greatly appreciated!   
Thanks!

In my opinion it is a little tricky to set up, but once set up it is efficient with good market rate (i.e. mid price minus some commissions).. it takes around 3 days to transfer from one account to another.

			I am trying to submit my 2015-2016 tax return (self assessment) in the UK, but cannot get past the Gov.UK Verify stuff they introduced this year.    
They are completely blocking online access if you are a non-UK citizen living abroad.   
I tried calling them, and they recommended using Digidentity to be verified, but that didn't let me verify the credit card part of it. And none of the other providers will allow me to get verified without a UK passport. I even managed to find a help page on the HMRCs website which specifically said that they don't support digital verification for people living abroad.   
A friend used one of the third party tax providers to submit, but now cannot log in to the HMRC website to see how it went, so I'd rather not go that route.   However, I was wondering if anyone in the same situation (non-UK citizen, living abroad) tried and succeeded to submit an online self assessment this year.

It's a bit complicated to work out and I don't know if the actual rent would take the place of the theoretical rent.  Best to talk to either your new HR department re the tax or Zurich taxation office for advice.

			Trying to beat the market by timing almost never works. People loose far more money by holding cash then being invested. Small investors do exactly that & highly underperform the poor performance of the funds they previously held.   
The markets really don't think profits will be very different either way, remember the stock market is geared about 15 times so a fall of 15% equals a 1% fall in profits. Holding good companies is key.

I asked if you tried already UBS because I have cashed a check with them before. However, since it was a two or three years ago their policies may  have changed .So had you already talked to them it would have saved me from having to type out a longer answer on my phone while I'm at work.    
And yes. You need to open an account with them. But guess what, you can then, OMG, close the account after your check clears. (yes, that was smartassery).    
Seems like a small price to pay to collect money from the sale of a house... unless it was a double wide in Detroit. (that too was smartassery).

375	Financebankingtaxation	Moneyhouse and personal data privacy	Samurai	12910	29	Location: Geneva	30.11.2009, 10:49	"    Theoretically only the reprensentatives mentioned in the commercial register extract with ""a power to sign"" (alone or along with s.o.) are authorized to engage the company into an agreement. Theoretically the engagement signed by a non authorized person is not valid. Though it is the duty of your counterpart to verify whether you are authorized to sign. In practice, this is rarely done, except for the official acts (notary...) or with some important customers. The kind of decision making depends whether you act as a member of the board, as a member of the Direction or with a delegated authority. The shareholders' meeting is the highest organ in a SA, therefore shareholders' resolutions basically apply to anyone in the company, authorized to sign or not. Nevertheless, you wouldn't expect the shareholders to decide on the day to day business, which is usually delegated to the Directors.    
There is therefore no happy way to remain fully ""discreet"" and to be the only one to take decisions for the company. The only way to do it is to appoint a representative as a board member (having him sign an agreement which sets forth the way he should act (if needed), which is - basically - only on your instructions). Apart from that, if the board member has single signature and you are not authorized, he could quite manage the company on his own, though he still has to act with diligence (= in line with the interests of the company).

			Just for the record: you are comparing Bonviva PLATINUM with some banks that are more on the budget end of retail banking.     
Of course does a platinum credit card package cost money... if you don't need it... ever considered downgrading to gold or even standard?     
I just booked a vacation for four today. The travel insurance for the trip would have cost some 250-400 EUR... but I am pretty sure that the coverage of my platinum Amex is even better than that... at 2.5 times the price of one single transaction for the entire year.     
So if you use it, the package makes sense... if you don't... you throw 1k out of the window.

380	Financebankingtaxation	VAT question about delivery	Penelopy	821	8	Location: Oberwallis	14.06.2016, 19:16	" 
			
			It's possible to get the VAT back, but the shop has to offer this service.   
What you need is a bill that contains your Swiss address. The vendor needs to provide this.   
On exiting the EU, get customs to stamp the bill.   
Send the bill back to vendor, he can now claim VAT from the UK (i.e. he doesn't have to pay it), and refund it to you.   
Thing is: I´m 100% certain this is possible, but the vendor has to know,  agree and do it, simply because VAT-refunds are a voluntary service.   
So if the vendor sais ""yes"" that's good, otherwise look for a different vendor.      is my standard case where I know for sure that they do refunds,   I'm not sure; any other vendor even less.   
Good luck.

The question is mainly to forum members who have an e-trading account with Post Finance.   
After the recent e-trading switch from BCV to Swissquote, e-trading home page states that all the previous documents would be available under E-Finance->Download->E-trading Archive in few weeks , doesn't state how many   
I checked and it only shows documents from May 2016 onwards. 
Appreciate if you can share your experience i.e. how far back do you see your e-trading documents in Archive section ?

In theory one should declare everything.  There is a rule that caps the tax to be paid on wealth based upon the income from the wealth.  
One thing to note is Zurich has particularly generous wealth tax thresholds.  Amounts which are ""so small as to not be any problem"" in one canton (like Zurich) can be significant amounts in other cantons.

As the OP has phoned up the Revenue & they said  he would be treated as being UK resident, I suspect what I am saying is correct. The 91 day rule had never been tested in court before, since then the goalposts moved!

It doesn't matter if they never spent any time there, it doesn't matter if they don't bother to apply for a passport. A citizen can choose to give up their citizenship, but it is an action which they must actively take, and somewhat of a PIA to have this recognized.   
Not saying it isn't insane, but it does nobody any favors to call somebody a non-citizen when the US nationality law says that they are.

			Since it's been solved this is no longer relevant to OP, but others may soon-ish be in a similar position: 
When the government is unduly slow, which certainly is the case with OP,  you can raise a Verwaltungsbeschwerde. As a consequence the case will  be inspected by a third party (not necessarily by a court I think,  depends on how far up on the ladder the complaint has gone yet) and  issue a binding verdict (which can be challenged), hopefully ordering  the problematic goverment branch to speed things up.   
Procedures  are likely to to differ from Kanton to Kanton (and of course  contacts)  so personally I'd simply contact the Verwaltungsgericht  (Zürich in this  case, every Kanton has one) and ask for directions,  legal  information and to-be-expected costs. 		      I would think they have to in every case, registered letter or not. The difference is  that with a registered letter you can prove that you're owed an answer,  same as if you had handed the letter over in person and got receipt  confirmed on a copy.

			You can see how they calculate the tax rate here ( ). Turns out that the difference is because I am married, my wife will initially not be working, and I have  child. Thus, my effective tax rate will be 7.6% for my salary of 81.400. If I were making the same salary as a single person, the tax rate would be 14.18.    
So it's almost half, which I guess makes sense if you think about distributing the salary over two people instead of one.    
There are other differences too - will have to pay much more in health insurance (since I am also paying for my wife and kid), but I also get a monthly child benefit.

408	Financebankingtaxation	which is the best bank for GmbH	Joan T	1347	2	Location: Reinach	04.09.2013, 22:39	"    The best way to find out is to take a few appointments with the Banks and compare the the offers. We choose Credit Suisse at that time because it seemed sound to us. End of the day, they are all the same.. so, maybe you want to think about using UBS since they have the greatest notoriety. It is all about your personal consultant, and if you feel comfortable with him or her. Be prepared to get ignored or snobbed (we were rather shocked of the services given from such esteem establishment). Remember, most of the GmbHs go bust within 2 years, so don't expect a red carpet treatment in the beginning.   
Basically they are all the same. 
I hope this help, and good luck!

Nestle is a Swiss company but makes 98% of profits out of CH. If the currency is strong the profits will be less as will the share price quoted in CHF. To a foreign holder of Nestle, the strength of the indian rupee has a greater effect on the share price that the CHF.

PM me if you are interested as I believe a recommendation from me earns both of us some sort of gift voucher but I'll have to double check. Either way, there are far worse brokers than IB.

			not done that in Switzerland but in other countries yes, toptip is to always have a third party value it (can be 1 or 2 agents) when transferring private <> company.  talk to the agents before they value it to be sure they say the correct amount...    
question is why you would want to do that. Normally you would keep property private and take a loan from the company to finance it. The capital gain is that way private. Unless of course you think the value will go down

			Griet, Belgianmum   
thanks a lot for the info.   
I suspected the reply from the insurance company, since it was unclear. 
Now I understand it is not an overall Swiss law that prohibit this, rather than a Swiss law that let the insurance company decide if they allow the transfer or not. 
The funny (or not) thing, is that I keep get negative answers from Swisslife which is my insurance company in Switzerland.   
Belgianmum, do you have any reference in Swisslife that handles such cases?   
Thanks again!

			Hello,    
How is the situation for a graduate (Masters in Accounting and Taxation) in India and also a Professional (Company Secretary from Institute of Company Secretaries India) here in Switzerland. Until now I have realized that Switzerland is a very small job market and most of the jobs are specialized ones in the respective Finance and Banking domain. Language criteria is another aspect. But, then how many students who are coming here from abroad and doing higher education getting Jobs without any job experience knowing the fact that Banks are not doing good at the moment because of lack of innovation and on the same side, Switzerland has unemployment rate of approx 3.5 %.

			Thanks to everyone. Your responses were very helpful. I wrote an email to my Vaud tax office. As you had advised, if I had over paid then after 30 days of final treatment there is nothing to be done. A bit of background explanation for future readers.   
I am an American expat who had transferred from the American subsidiary to the Swiss headquarters. My salaries were all paid in the US in $ and all retirement accounts are American in $. I have both ""defined benefits"" accounts, which I had declared correctly as Pillar 2, and ""defined contributions"" accounts, which were mistakenly declared as Pillar 3. I did not claim the 20% deduction. In addition, I did not claim the double taxation benefits.   
C'est la vie! So, I'd overpaid my Swiss taxes. But, it was for the common good and I am fine with it.   
Thanks to everyone, 
Dave

424	Financebankingtaxation	Switzerland-Sweden VAT Contractor Question	guest	869	3	null	null	" 
			
			Hi there, I would like to check my reasoning, in case I have missed something or am making any incorrect assumptions based on this and a similar posts.   
I have a business here with a VAT number. I invoice clients in CH, and UK and European countries.    
If I provide the services from here (remotely), to a client in another country I understand that I do not charge Swiss VAT. That is because the service is provided ""here"" not ""there"".    
That lines up with   about providing services to Australia.    
I just wanted to clarify if it is cut a dry and applies the same way to all countries outside CH. Well, western European countries in any case (to narrow it down)    
Also, what happens if I do provide the service in the other country (for example, if I provide training and consultancy services at their site in the UK or a European country). Do I need to charge Swiss VAT?

			The Vaudtax does not show the possibility in the calculations to enter what you already paid in withholding tax (import a la source). You can tough put in your acomptes (what you have already paid). There is a field where you can enter the amount where you state your income (revenu). It is field 12 of the certificate de salaire.   
Please let us know if the authorities did calculate it correctly or did you have to go after it.

429	Financebankingtaxation	Tax payable upfront on moving canton?	swissdip	670	3	Location: Thurgau	22.05.2016, 03:00	"    First, as pointed out, if you're on the monthly Quellensteure there will be no change.   
Secondly, I think someone's got a bit mixed up about this. Different cantons hae different rules, so in some cases it might seem as you describe it, but it's not about moving per se, just dependant on the local rules.   
For example, when we moved from BS to OW (in December) we ended up paying three years' worth in three months. The BS tax for the previous year was late, and should have been paid earlier, so that wasn't unexpected, but then we found that the OW tax, which we were then paying for the whole year, is due and final in November, rather than April (IIRC) for BS, and in addition you're required to pay in advance, around April, for the coming year, based on previous year's earnings as an estimate.

			Employers don't get involved in obtaining permits for EU nationals.  As AMDG says, it's simply a matter of your wife taking her employment contract to the migration office/kreisboro and applying for your permits.  Yours will be dependent on her getting hers, but that shouldn't be a problem providing she earns enough to financially support you.  You'll be able to work without problems, though you might need to show your business plan/financial status to be self-employed here.  Or you can apply separately from her via the self-employment route.

439	Financebankingtaxation	Now retired: To file or not on AVS & 2nd Pillar income?	MichaelG	839	4	Location: Granges, VS	17.05.2016, 10:44	" 
			
			This is a very interesting topic and Im pretty surprised that not many more have join in on this thread. Just for my own understanding, is AHV = AVS = 1st pillar? 
  Anyway, my enrolled agent has been including my 1st pillar contributions, my 2nd pillar contributions, my employers 2nd pillar contributions, my 3rd pillar contributions and the interest gained in the 3rd pillar account as income on my 1040. Now if you take a look at the PDF file that Mullhollander linked to they suggest that the same except for the interests gained in the 3rd pillar account. 
  What confuses me is what the US will finally count as income when I retire. To be precise Im a dual citizen and have no current plans in renouncing my US citizenship. Mullhollander's PDF suggests that the 1st pillar distribution is not taxed. Why is that? What about the contribution my employer made to the 1st pillar (1st pillar contributions are split 50/50 between employee and employer). The 2nd pillar I can pretty much comprehend, take a look at IRS worksheet A in IRS Publication 575. The 3rd pillar I will not include when it is paid out because Ive been including the contributions and interests gained and therefore it is just a normal account as long as the IRS is concerned. 
  Lets get back to the 1st pillar. Why are the distributions not taxed when I retire? Where can I find information from the IRS where this fact is clearly stated? 
Ive downloaded the US/CH tax treaty   
and If I my understanding of the English language does not fail me my impression is that being a US citizen the US will tax my 1st pillar distribution due to the fact that Im a US citizen! The savings clause in Article 1 of the treaty states this in more or less understandable legal English. Not many provisions in the treaty are allowed if you are a US citizen.  
  To sum up the whole situation it is my understanding that according Articles 1 and 23 in the US/CH tax treaty and being a US citizen the US will fully tax my 1st pillar distribution, but the Swiss will only tax 66% of (the 1st pillar distribution minus the tax paid to the US on this distribution). Now if this is true, why should I be including my 1st pillar contributions as taxable income on my 1040?   Hasnt anybody already done some investigation into this matter and is able to support their finding with IRA literature?

I'm thinking the same, but my tax preparer has only been including my and my employer's contribution as income for the past few years as far as I can tell. Considering the fact that, acc. to today's Swiss laws, I will be able to retire in 15 years I think it would be a good idea to include the interest as income for the next 15 years and then not declare any of the benefits as income when the time comes.

			Thanks for the info provided. I'm now clear on how the piller2 and piller3 can be used against a home purchase.   
Its essentially a property purchase with requirement to build on it by the seller's company within a certain period of time. So I need to meet the goals only for 1/3 the whole cost today and work with bank and the additional savings needed for the final build price.   
Meeting some banks and finance people next week, when i'll know more.

I found that the credit cards do take longer than the regular bank card. Around four weeks or may be a bit longer.

on 1.5.16 17680gbp * 1.4009 = 26'767   
if you'd compounded at 1% for 5 years, the 21'039 would be 22'112.

I now the rules for Canton of Zurich.  
They can be found in the Canton Zurich Tax law  
It is defined in § 108 (place of residence at begin of tax period or begin of taxation (when moved from aboard)) and § 49 (tax period is from January 1st to December 31st), and aditionaly reconfirmed in § 190. 
Means for Canton of Zurich your place of residence at January 1st is relevant for taxation.   
For moves between Cantons the rules can be found in the Bundesgesetz über die Harmonisierung der direkten Steuern der Kantone und Gemeinden   
It is defined in Art. 4b, the residence at the end of the taxation period is relevant. (One time pension, disability, or life insurance payouts are taxed at place of residence at time of payout) Art. 15 defines the taxation period as from January 1st till December 31st.  
Means for moves form one canton to another your residence at the end of the year (December 31st) is relevant. (This year, NOT the previous year).   
@Eepus 
Others have been in the same shoes as you. See:   
and also this  
Hope all can be resolved ASAP.

			Binary options are a zero sum game:  
What one side wins the other side of the trade loses.    
Thus you need to be better than the other side in order to have a chance to make money: You first need to make up for bid/ask spread, trading costs and such silly stuff as the broker taking a bite out of your winning trades. If the broker takes 16% of your winnings (not your payouts, but of your gross profit on the trade) and you usually buy at 50 cents on the potential dollar payout, you need to win about 60% of your bets just to break even (ignoring bid/ask spread and additional costs).   
With any such offer, especially if you get cold-called, you need to assume that your final account balance will equal zero. And that this result will be reached quite quickly.

468	Financebankingtaxation	überweisung per post	fisi	783	6	Location: Zürich	25.04.2016, 12:03	" 
			
			i) ""überweisung"" is a cashless money transfer. Bank to bank, postfinance to bank, doesn't matter I think. Payer pays the cost.   
ii)  ""Einzahlung"" is a cash transaction, for instance your buyer pays  the  purchase price into your account. I'm not aware of any costs this  comes with.   
iii)  ""Einzahlung am Postschalter using a red or orange payment slip"" is  also  a cash payment into your account, but payment happens at a Post  counter  whereby the money is credited to your bank account.  .   The accout holder (OP in this case) provides orange slips;   alternatively one can use red blank slips that need to be filled   manually.   
Since the buyer asks if that's Ok, he most probably asks if it's ok to  use iii), OP ask if it comes with any costs for you and specifically if  he intends to use a red payment slip (probably the only option as  presumably you have no orange slips).   
As for risks: None with any of the above.

The loan is to be converted to a mortgage at the end of the build time with the loan repaid as a lump sum from the mortgage sum. The loan could also take the form of a builder willing to take the cost of the build during the build with full payment and interest delivered at the end.

""The sale of US mutual funds to US Citizens not resident in the US has  operated in a legal grey area for a long time; a kind of don't ask,  don't tell. US Financial Institutions would allow overseas clients to  have a US mailing address and a foreign ""legal"" address, and this gave  the US institutions, or specifically their compliance departments,  enough reassurance that foreign jurisdictions would not bother them,  even if they were in a legal grey area with respect to the distribution  of US mutual funds (many funds and advisors of which are not registered  in foreign jurisdictions). ""

Since I'd still need to rent an apartment in CH and I'd commute very often, tax deductions for those costs would really help...

There is probably a daily withdrawal limit for cash from ATM's but I don't usually take out more than 500chf in a day.   
We pay all our bills with electronic banking and don't have any problems with that.   
Oh, and I have a 1000chf overdraft with minimal fees linked to the postfinance account, and I was able to get that with my permanent job and B permit, whereas ZKB would not give one to my husband with the same B permit and a much higher salary...

			Just something to keep in mind   
1. Custodial assets (stocks, bonds, funds etc) are segregated and generally protected in bankruptcy, UNLESS you have signed the securities lending agreement which authorises the bank to borrow your securities from your account for a small fee. In which case, your securities are lost if the bank goes in default. Worthwhile to check and revoke this agreement if you are worried about the institution.   
2. Mortgage offset versus cash account balance, this is generally not standard case. There are clauses in your mortgage agreement that prevent this offset. You need to have asked the bank to take this clause out when you signed. Worthwhile to check.

2. Residence permit required.   
3.  Maybe Zurich and Basel cantonal banks still take American clients, but they'd be the only ones.  Otherwise UBS, Credit Suisse and maybe PostFinance are your only options.   
4.  Tip - You can't keep an account after you leave Switzerland.  The banks will require you to close it due to FATCA.   
To sum it up, there's no privacy for American citizens in Switzerland - or anywhere outside of the US frankly.  FATCA is worldwide so forget about any foreign accounts being hidden from the IRS's eyes.   
You would also need to report any foreign account/s on an FBAR form if the aggregate amount of said account/s if the total is over $10,000 at any time of the year.  You also have US tax fiing obligations to fulfill as well.      "	Posts: 1	Join Date: Apr 2016	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			How does it work for the tax declaration? I am aware you need to declare any stock you own, but in case you perform some day trading, you may not own them any longer at the time of the tax declaration, and have already cashed in the profits, which are declared together with your total wealth.   
However, that sounds too little to me...   
How does it work then for profits taken and stocks negotiated through platforms like IG, Swissquote, Plus500 ? The 3.5 per thousand tax is already deducted by the broker at the time of stock purchase?

Well, working in the wine business for 20 years with a number of wine education diplomas, including one that is considered almost impossible to get (and took 9 years to finish, mind you), will hopefully indicate that I am actually serious.       The paperwork/invoice said it but the bottles didn't. But the tax people did not probably see the bottles because the package had not been opened and examined. I am just guessing that they looked at the paperwork and maybe missed something.

497	Financebankingtaxation	PostFinance to PayPal - does it work or not?	Schildkröte	1735	9	Location: Bern	10.04.2016, 16:00	"    to Link your bank details to paypal, you will need to give them the details of the account.  Not sure if the address you use for your bank account has to be the same as the address you use for paypal (I presume you can update your paypal address details). 
Paypal will then send money to your bank account, not sure if they do it once, twice or three times.  You need to then advise paypal of the amount received and probably the date received (it will be something between 0.01 and 0.99).  At some future point they will take back those cents from your account, but not for a while.   
Once the above procedure is complete, you can then send money from your bank to paypal.   
you can request paypal to get the money from your bank, but I find it faster to send it from the bank to paypal.  Seems when I requested paypal to get the money it took a few days and then I had to wait to buy.   
I believe if want to return money from paypal to your bank account in Switzerland they make a charge, as I read that previously on EF.   
In the UK I am not charged to either get paypal to send to my bank account or to pay from my account to paypal.   
Paypal do like to get you to link your credit card to the account after you have linked your bank account, but I prefer not to give them so many of my details.   
I believe some buyers only link their credit card to the paypal account and not their bank account, some use paypal and at point of paying, give their credit card details but do not link it to the paypal account.

498	Financebankingtaxation	US State Dept hiking renunciation fees to $2,350	MennoFloyd	18498	132	Location: Deutschschweiz	28.08.2014, 03:16	" 
			
			There's someone in Canada, apparently Toronto, who is trying to get rid of his US citizenship before the price goes up to $2,350 on September 12. The Toronto consulate is backed up until January 2015 and Montreal until  mid-October. Here's ""Krackjack's"" status report on Isaac Brock:   
""Update for all, 
 So I have learned a couple of things in this whole exercise. That I thought I would share with everyone.  
 First off, there is no continuity between consulates. I have  contacted about 10-15 different consulates. The one in the Bahamas has  been very helpful, the one is Bermuda has said that they do not allow  for out of there service area to apply for renunciation and it takes two  visits at least two weeks apart. The Mexico City had a tone that was  very official stating the importance of understanding what you are  doing. 
The Tijuana one was much more friendly in tone and had a simple process in order to accomplish the renunciation.  
 Second, it seems as though there has been a breakdown in  communication or at least not an acknowledgement of the new fees. A  couple of the consouls have said that they are still going to be  charging $450 for the renouncing fees. With no indication of the new  fees mentioned. They are either ignorant of the fact or being very  disingenuous by not telling people up front about the upcoming changes.  
 At this point I have an appointment booked in Nassau on September 11.  
 So just waiting to see if anyone else comes through with better  options. But it looks like I will be flying to Nassau for the priviledge  of losing my American Citizenship.  
 What a farce.""

			Hello, 
I'm residing in Switzerland (Vaud) legally and i pay my taxes here. I'm considering a 3 month contractor job in London (but keeping my legal residence in Switzerland) but i have some questions about taxes: 
- If i use an umbrella company, taxes will be deducted at source, right?  
- Is there a possibility to have my taxes refunded and include them in my swiss tax declaration, therefore paying taxes only in Switzerland?    
Also, I do have a company in Switzerland. is it a lot of trouble for the UK company if my Swiss company sends the invoice for the contracting hours?   
Any help from anyone would be much appreciated.  
Thanks

504	Financebankingtaxation	Libre Passage Question	atencorps	505	0	Location: Vevey	07.04.2016, 17:56	" 
			
			Hi All,     
I worked in Switzerland for a while and upon leaving the company & country (returning to the UK) was told I had two options regarding pension (1. Take the money in cash or pay it into a libre passage account).     
The last statement showed little interest movement on the money during the year. So my question is      
1. Can a libre passage account be closed and money taken out ? or do I have to wait until a certain age ie retirement etc 
2. if money can be taken out early, is it taxed or can the money be taken out tax free since I no longer live in swiss.     
Cheers

505	Financebankingtaxation	Tax question for Canadian	Muntjac	1676	7	Location: Zurich	22.01.2015, 20:02	" 
			
			Paper forms if your situation isn't ""mainstream"". E-file won't work or will be very frustrating to figure out if your situation is exceptional.   
If your (Canadian) income is simple, with taxes withheld at (Canadian) source, I think it's easier to fill out the paperwork, attaching supporting documents and maybe a short letter. A call to CRA might also come in handy to further clarify any misunderstandings or questions you might have.   
As far as I understand, the NR4 slip is proof of TAXED income for non-resident Canadians, and it needs to be filed as part of your documents. Should you be out of the country for longer than 5 years, you can elect to file form NR5 once every 5 years - you have to apply for it, or you can continue to file your regular yearly tax forms. Check it out and see if NR5 suits your needs.       "	Posts: 2	Join Date: Sep 2014	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

Anybody know or would like to speculate if this will have an impact on US & multinational companies that already have their HQs here in Switzerland?   
So far as I understand existing companies have 3 years before the new rules will impact them.

I also maintain a US Wells Fargo account, with a mastercard with no international purchase fees- for online purchases, travelling outside of CH, etc.  IIRC the account costs $5-a month or so, which is waived if the balance remains above $500.

			Tagging on to this relevant thread...   
Assume ANobAG, assume 2nd pillar voluntarily arranged (whether or not that's the optimal choice is another matter).    
The BVG provider will request an annual salary notification. What sum should be reported? The gross sum received (anticipated) for the year, before deducting anything (taxes, Pillar 1, business expenses, ...)?    
Sorry to ask, but this is absolutely neither clear nor easy to confirm. Discussions with tax, AGK, and Pillar 2 people seem to indicate the gross compensation, but the interactions leave me with a nagging feeling I'm overlooking something. Naturally I'm not going to take your word as law here, but your considered thoughts and terminology may help me settle the matter for myself.

While it may be indicated for health insurance, you can use the funds however you want.  It is not excluded under IRC 106.   
If you itemize your deductions, and your total Health insurance and medical expenses exceed 10% of AGI, you may be able to get some benefit by including on Schedule A.

			SRF Espresso ran a radio program on a Swiss who PostFinance suspected was an American or had American connections. It threatened to turn his name and account information over to the IRS and report him as being ""non-cooperative"" because he didn't return a document that it had incorrectly requested:

			Just send it via ebanking, from your UK account to your Swiss account. I do it in the opposite direction regularly, takes a few days and costs 20chf or so. By far the easiest option.

			Hi Scotty,   
Have a look at the last post in this thread:       
And this thread:     
In summary, looks like you'll be taxed in the country of your residence.  I know it's not exactly the same, but I work with a German chap who's family is in Germany, he's there in DE at weekends, but he's taxed in Switzerland.   
My neighbour just today recommended a tax advisor to me. Send me a PM and I'll give you the details.

When we moved here, my wife had been working here for a while while commuting from the US so she had a work permit already.  When we decided to move here and applied for my permit, the authorities were concerned that we would keep bringing family members over.  We had to write a letter that we had no children, sign it and have it notarized.  We did this in CH.  That was accepted by the authorities as ""proof"" that we had no children.  Maybe a notarized letter stating that you are not married will do the trick.

All other CH cities: $32,900       
The question then arises where do US diplomats and functionaries live in Switzerland (2014):   
Lausanne/Vaud: 432 Basel: 73 
Zurich: -0-       
So where do Americans, excluding US diplomats and functionaries, live in Switzerland: 
Zurich: 4,366 
Vaud: 3,172   Basel-Stadt: 1,348 
Ticino: 859 
Basel-Land: 829 
Zug: 678 
Aargau: 527 
Lucerne: 422 
Other CH cantons: 2,497   
It's probably just me but I'm seeing a positive correlation between where US diplomats and functionaries live and the amount of the IRS Housing Allowance. Also, if I were a US diplomat/ functionary living in Lausanne, I'd be feeling a little left out of the housing allowance giveaway!

			I had the same issue with a Barclays offshore account in the Isle of Man.  However the proposed charges were not nearly so high as you mention. Thankfully I had kept my onshore account open.   
I am sure that most of us opened an offshore account to avoid paying tax twice on the interest. However, now it is a realively simple process to reclaim tax paid on UK earned interest. You just need to complete a form once a year.   
The golden rule is do not close you UK onshore Bank account!

565	Financebankingtaxation	The concept of a VISA debit card	guest	19236	75	null	null	" 
			
			I think the lack of Visa debit cards needs to viewed together with the recent history of Swiss retail banking and consumer habits.   
Both the banks, by fixing a high commission they take from retailers/merchants, and the Swiss consumers' preference for cash, meant the use and spread of credit and thus debit cards was not as widespread as in many other modern societies.   
I remember within the last 20 years when the filling station at the Glarnerland services on the A3 autobahn (Zurich bound) did not accept credit cards!   
Eurocard, later replaced by Maestro, had chip and pin capability years before the UK.    
I daresay that the lack of a Visa debit card has much to do with the banks here not getting a big enough cut of the action.      is that cross-bank cash machines attract a fee. This was introduced some 15 years as I recall.  
I am a ZKB (Zurich Kantonalbank) customer and if I wander into nearby Schwiez or Zug, although their Kantonalbanks have nearly the same logos and give the impression of being the same company, the blighters charge me for removing my cash. So in fact I cannot get cash without charge from and ATM except at ZKB ones which are only in the canton of Zurich.   
On the plus side, I have the direct number of my personal adviser and I don't have to talk to a call centre in India as I do with LloydsTSB...

			I am starting to think that if you use that card only, and are ubs and migros customer, the ubs platinum card is a good deal.   
In fact if you have just a normal ubs individual package, you pay 180 chf a year, and get 1 keyclub point each chf. Assuming one spends 24.000 a year on a credit card (so makes all expenses on the credit card), that returns you 240 points you can convert to a migros gift card, and use it there for a value of 240 chf.   
If you get a platinum one, with the ubs individual package you pay 30 chf more per month but earn triple points. So assuming you do the credit card expense, you get 720 points back, but you spend on the card about 360 a year. Assuming you still convert the points into a migros gift card, you now get 360 chf back instead of 240.   
And 4 free access vouchers to airport lounges. And a travel insurance...   
Of course this is different for lower credit card expenses per year.

575	Financebankingtaxation	Bearer bonds laws	Phil_MCR	543	4	Location: Basel	07.03.2016, 17:28	" 
			
			Three sets of laws come to mind that may be relevant: 
- money laundering 
- Stempelabgabe (above a certain threshold, I think) 
- plus of course the Obligationenrecht   
Among private persons a bond must fulfill the minimal requirements to make it an Urkunde, plus a feature or two: 
The word ""Schuldschein"" or equivalent to make the papers purpose unmistakeably clear, currency and nominal value plus ""zahlbar an den Inhaber"" to make it a bearer paper, debtor and signature, date and location. Additionally it would be useful to mention interest rate, duration or due date or to be paid back on demand or payback arrears and their due dates, perhaps cancellation terms and conditions, plus covenants if applicable.   
There's no need to have the document validated (e.g. by a notary) or co-signed by witnesses but doing so may strengthen the creditor's position in case of problems.   
Things may get complicated if any kind of assets as collateral are involved.   
As a side note, it seems a few years ago a register for debentures was introduced, which apparently allows the creation of paperless debentures, which in turn eliminates the risk of loss and its problematic consequences.

578	Financebankingtaxation	Closing Bank Account from Remote	bumpyhead	481	0	Location: Lausanne	05.03.2016, 14:53	" 
			
			At the beginning of 2016 I had to leave Switzerland due to personal reasons. I made an appointment with my advisor at UBS regarding the closure of my banking relationship. The main problem at that time was that, I have a  , which need certain procedures to be unblocked. However this is not really a problem because I was leaving Switzerland and can rightfully claim it. Therefore I gave him my signatures, and made a written agreement with him, to close all my account, and transfer my money, right after the pillar-3 account is closed.   
However, it has been around 2 months. The pillar-3a account still appears to be blocked in my e-banking. I sent my advisor several emails, asking the current status of the paper works. However, he did not at all reply, while I am paying for the banking fees with zero interest.   
Now that I need this money to be transferred, I have to write a formal letter. However I intend to directly contact the authority at UBS that is blocking my pillar-3a account. Does anyone of you face similar situations? What is the proper address/person/authority that I have to write to, in order to get this settled in a timely manner?

			I was planning to do the same. Seemed like the easier steps would have been;   
- filling up the company info at startbiz.ch 
- getting accounting service (seems to be so cheap here that better to use professional service) 
- sending couple of bills to customers 
- taking copies of the bills and adding those to startbiz.ch company info to get the company officially formed   
Problem with this einzelfirma style of company is that if you get something done and want to grow your business to something bigger, it cannot be done. And second thing is that you can get easily into the court and lose your life (in case you make a mistake or end up doing something with wrong people). If it just a hobby helping out friends, then the einzelfirma is more than ok.

583	Financebankingtaxation	Debt issues (( confused ))	Mischka	2179	41	Location: Canada // Switzerland	01.03.2016, 10:41	" 
			
			@Mischka 
Here is a strategy I have seen work, several times, with people who – for whatever reason – got themselves into debt.  And by this method, they got themselves fully out of debt, too. Yay!   
1.	Do whatever it takes to stand up strong and admit, to yourself and to the creditor, that you do, in fact, owe the money, and that you are, really truly, going to do whatever you can to pay off the debt. 
This is partly a question of one’s inner attitude, and partly a paperwork step. 
Write to the creditor to say 
a)	Yes, I admit that I owe you the money 
b)	I cannot pay it all now 
c)	I would like to pay, immediately, the sum of Fr.   
OR better still: 
I have already transferred into your account, today, the sum of Fr., in partial payment of the debt 
d)	I am trying to re-plan my budget and will contact you again soon.  In the meantime, please do not proceed further with the process of debt collection (Betreibung) because I really am trying to pay the money I owe to you.   
Do not try to do this by phone, in a personal visit to the office, or by email. 
Send this letter signed, and in an envelope, with a stamp. 
Beforehand, photocopy or scan it.  
If you do, in fact, have an email address of the creditor, then you could, after posting the letter, send a mail, with the scan as an attachment.   
2.	Actually really, truly re-plan your budget.   
Spending: 
Think long and hard about every single cent that leaves your pocket, and which types of spending you could radically stop or dramatically reduce, permanently or only temporarily until you have managed to pay off your debt.   
Income: 
Think long and hard about whether there is any way you could legally increase your income.  This, too, perhaps even only for a while, to earn the money to pay off the debt.     
3.	Within a week or maximum 10 days of your first letter to the creditor (or IMMEDIATELY if the creditor happens to reply your first letter), write a second one. 
a)	On DATE-1 I wrote to you to explain that I am trying to find ways to pay my debt to you, and on DATE-1 I transferred Fr. AMOUNT as partial payment of the debt. 
b)	Today (DATE-2) I transferred a further Fr. AMOUNT to you. 
c)	I have now re-planned my budget and am in a position to offer to pay as follows: 
On DATE-1 	Fr. AMOUNT	(first payment made) 
On DATE-2		Fr. AMOUNT	(second payment made) 
On DATE	Fr. AMOUNT 
On DATE	Fr. AMOUNT 
On DATE	Fr. AMOUNT 
On Date	Fr. FINAL AMOUNT 
d)	Would you please confirm that, by making all these payments, I will have paid off the debt in full?   
Like the first, send this letter in an envelope, with a scan as an attachment to a mail.   
In general, in Switzerland, registered letters are very important.  Without the registration, there is no proof that the letter was, in fact, sent.  Unfortunately, they cost a Fr. 6 additional fee at the Post Office, which might be better used to pay off another Fr. 6 of the debt.  One way to get around this is to physically deliver the letter oneself.  Not necessarily to the official concerned, but to the reception desk.  Take along a copy of the letter, and ask that the receptionist stamp and sign it as “received on DATE”.   
Since your partner is working, and you are not, it would probably be a whole lot less trouble for you both if your partner simply paid your Fr. 500 debt immediately.    
Some couples run their purse as a joint pool of earnings and expenses.   
Others regard each person, at least financially, as separate from the other.  If you and your partner have the latter system, then you might consider setting up such a repayment schedule towards your partner.  Perhaps you could pay the amounts out of your pocket-money by going without some small treats, or perhaps you could work for your partner doing more of the errands or housework than are usually your “job” at home, or by helping someone your partner would like helped (clean the stairs for Granny, wash Dad’s car, help Bob's daughter with her English homework).     
If you choose this route, then I suggest you both put in writing exactly what your agreement is, and by when (in which increments) you will have done what you have to do so that the Fr. 500 has been “worked off” and you and your partner both feel the matter has been dealt with fairly, and then closed, so you don’t spend the rest of your lives with this episode hanging over you as a negative memory in your relationship, but rather as a time when you each proved yourselves to the other.  I've seen it done, and things were much, much better afterwards.  Take courage and good luck!

588	Financebankingtaxation	Debt collection against company in a non-Swiss country (EU)	MikeUSA	869	6	Location: Zurich	24.02.2016, 23:17	"    The Swiss company takes the Lux company to court in the Canton of Zurich. If it prevails and receives a judgment in its favor, then it takes that judgment to court in Lux asking that they recognize the Swiss judgment against the Lux company. If they do so, the Swiss co then seeks the judgment's enforcement in Lux, e.g., collection agency, lien equivalent, etc.   
Cross-border insolvency is a very tricky subject. The EU itself has sought to normalize the execution of various national laws in other EU country jurisdictions. Here's a link:       
The US has formalized the recognition of foreign bankruptcy proceedings (the term ""bankruptcy"" in the US includes debts owed and is not limited to complete bankruptcy like in the other Anglo countries) in the US Bankruptcy Code. This formalization is known as Chapter 15. Naturally, it's complicated.   
I haven't looked into the extent to which Switzerland may or may not be able to take advantage of the EU Insolvency Regulation. My discussion above merely concerns the general rules of cross-border insolvency and I mention them just for educational purposes. No legal opinions here, of course.

Our only complaint was when looking for a mortgage: it seemed that every time we had to go in to meet with our contact, we had a new one. They couldn't seem to retain their employees to save their life. That being said, everyone we spoke with were very friendly and willing to help.

Then there is the cost of real time market data:   
Depending on the market you are trading. In many cases it is waived if you generate enough commissions.   
Regarding tax - you get tax statement from them as with any broker. In Switzerland there is a distinction between a professional trader, and a non-professional trader.  The tax authorities decide on your status based on factors such as the frequency of your trading and turnover. If they deem you professional, you pay income tax on profits, but you can also deduct commissions and other expenses (hardware etc.). If they decide that you are non-professional, there is 0% tax, counts as capital gains. 
Once you start making significant sums, as with any other profession, best to get a good accountant/tax-advisor.

From my exp with the CHF 25 option, the diff between the day exchange rate and the rate ICICI gives you is lower than the CHF 5 option. I would say for smaller amounts aka less than 4000-5000 CHF CHF 5 is good but for higher amounts like CHF 10000 the CHF 25 option is better. Not sure how this pans our in Money2India.

anyways.   
Re the taxation of the ETF itself, I don't know the answer. According to NZZ, the ETFs domicile can have an effect. If you invest in an foreign SMI ETF, the ETF itself must pay 35% withholding tax on dividend earnings - whereas a CH domiciled ETF can claim for a refund of WHT. As other juristictions as well apply WHT or similar taxes, this has an effect on the CH domiciled investor's net return - as some ETF can't reclaim these taxes and therefore it results in a double taxation. For a CH investor who looks to invest into an ETF that covers the US market, Hinder Asset Management suggests to opt for Irish ETFs compared to Luxemburg ones (and worst ones are US ETFs).           I doubt.

Essentially, to work in Switzerland, one must have not just a permit to   here, but a particular category of permit which permits one to  .  Even then, some work permits are for a specific job only.  That's always the first thing to check.   : 
As a general rule, all adults must pay tax on all their earnings. Married couples pay tax together.   
All adults must also pay social security contributions (although there are some exceptions for very young people and for old-age pensioners).   
All employers must insure their employees for accidents that happen at work.  And for anyone employed for 8 or more hours per week, the employer must also buy insurance for accidents that happen outside of the workplace.   
This is a special status.  One cannot avoid the rules applying to the employer/employee contractual obligations merely by saying that the employee is ""self-employed"".  Anyone who wants to hold the status ""self-employed"" must apply to the AHV Office, and supply iformation about how the money is earned (how many clients, for example) and the AHV will then say ""yes"" or ""no"".     
Doing casual work and not registering anywhere and not getting the right insurance payments and not paying tax on the earnings.... is quite simply illegal.  And regarded as very serious. 
I suggest you and your friend make very sure that you fulfil the law. 
The steps to doing this are set out in the four threads listed in your other thread, here:   "	Posts: 62	Join Date: Nov 2013	Junior Member	Groaned at 6 Times in 3 Posts	Thanked 39 Times in 18 Posts	made some interesting contributions

it does not take long to do this and would not cost a lot to have someone do it for you. If your friend is not capable and you do not know exactly what he or you are doing I would recommend to ask help from a book keeper.    
you should opt for your option 3 being a employee in your situation. Also you need to be insured while working.

620	Financebankingtaxation	Pro rata tax return	Kamarate	711	7	Location: Neuchatel	14.02.2016, 11:08	"    They always agree to an extension and loads of people request it. If you ask for an extension until April 30th then it's free and they don't even send you confirmation. If you requested longer than that then they charge (20-30chf) and they send you a letter of confirmation. Even if you ask after the deadline (February 28th) they usually grant it. 
Hubby only for his annual salary slip on Friday so it doesn't leave much time to get it done before the deadline which is why most people get an extension. 
Unless you have massively high medical bills you just need to fill in the maximum 'forfait' for the medical expenses part. I only sent ours off a couple of weeks ago and got the reimbursement already but they're not high enough to be included on the tax return.

			I dont know how to tell you more softly, but in all honesty: A couple of hundreds a month is not even peanuts for a bank. The only ones who actually   you as a customer are the low end of the consumer banks. There is privacy not the big topic - keeping the fees low is. And frankly: The Swiss really suck at trying to be cheap... for most of them will you be more of a cost with no potential earning - why would they possibly want to deal with you?   
Even if there is a tiny bit of secrecy left in Switzerland - since you are in the EU will your government at some point be able to get all the data about you when they ask for it. Making a couple of hundreds a month as you describe do I not see why your government possibly would care...

But they saved up the money (and then some) first.    
Hey OP, remember that thing called the financial crisis? It didn't hit Switzerland as hard as many other Western countries because people aren't as credit focused. For the most part, we buy things with the cash we have. In this kind of culture, you will find it hard to get an unsecured loan for a temporarily-resident alien.   
As MiniMia pointed out, that L/B status does matter, though I think you'd find it tough to get the loan regardless of permit. That may also have something to do with why the service providers are demanding a large downpayment.   
Next time you get married, I suggest using that ""high education"" for a bit more upfront planning.   "	Posts: 5	Join Date: Jul 2012	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

Here's a description from the American Citizens Abroad website:    
""The Affordable Care Act will again impact US taxpayers in fiscal year  2015, for which US income tax returns are filed in 2016. Americans  living overseas should be aware of the important need to declare  themselves not subject to the Affordable Care Act ""shared  responsability"" provision by indicating that you benefit from ""deemed  covered"" status from a foreign health plan and do not need to  participate in a US plan or pay the penalty which can be $325 or more  for the 2015 tax year.""

I am not sure how they would view the fact you already received some refund, some might think it's an on-going dispute and that you have to wait until everything is settled from the Airlines perspective otherwise you would get the money back twice.

			As I understand it, your website gathers card information and this is passed to Stripe. There are free tools available for checking if a card is stolen - it does seem surprising that a card stolen months ago could still be used. I'd expect Stripe to check something as simple as that - and perhaps they do.  page says       
Which kind of indicates that they do have checking. So why wasn't this one declined automatically?   
By the way, Stripe also say:     
Which may be what's has happened to you - only the fraudster didn't get around to asking for a refund.    
It seems you are not alone:    
As first port of call, ask Stripe why, since the card was reported stolen months ago, their systems didn't decline it. If the liability is limited to your charity (Stripe can't come after you), then this fraud is Stripe's problem, since your charity hasn't the funds to pay.

642	Financebankingtaxation	The Motley Fool and Other Subscription Investment Sites	defcon3	794	7	Location: Geneva	02.02.2016, 00:11	"    With closed-end funds' return you want to differentiate between ""return on assets"" (financed by divis, interest earned, etc; in short where one would expect the money to come from) and ""return of assets""(payback of assets), which are summed up in ""return"".    
For instance PGP with seemingly 20% return on NAV (13% on market price) seems to finance its payouts mostly from assets, as implied by its -2.8% return on assets over the last 12 months. This staggeringly high return has investors pay a huge premium of 67%, which makes it a near certain loss generator:   
Buyers today pay $1.67 on the dollar but get back only $1, and even less after tax. Assuming 20% tax rate (on that $1 they get back) this amounts to more than 50% loss over time.   
Caveat: 
I didn't check any PGP filings so I may be missing a crucial detail.

Yes, I know the answer.            You can freely move your pillar 3a money from one institution to another (save some restrictions and fees in the accounts Terms and Conditions, so check them first. Best, before you open the account). If you are taxed at source then you get a huge tax benefit. If you are not taxed at source (Swiss, and C Permit) you can leave the money where it is, but move your residence to a low tax canton before payout. Or, you move aboard (means you will be taxed at source) and then move the money to a low tax canton before payout.

			I read the same law, but even if you interpret it as an exclusive ""or"" the condition is met.   
It is met, because 1 (""der Unternehmer den Gegenstand der Lieferung in das Drittlandsgebiet (...) befördert oder versendet hat"") does NOT happen, as the shop does NOT send it to the ""Drittlandsgebiet"".   
So no matter what, the interpretation does not hold.   
(I agree, I do not want it to hold, but I don't see how it could...) ?

If your wife is still paying Quellensteuer this year then, it is just deducted of the tax declaration.

664	Financebankingtaxation	Are salaries really high at all?	petermuller	3411	24	Location: Zug	08.01.2016, 20:57	"    Salaries are not that high, you are correct and it requires good planning to see the expenses and income and ultimately lifestyle and purchasing power.    
The CHF is also overvalued, officially around 15% according to SNB. Do not underestimate the living costs, and that it is superficially great right now to be earning CHF and spending it in EUR countries but that will not last.    
So, your nets salary of CHF2880 is around EUR2500 in normal Euroland. Check the salaries in Euroland and see where they are at to compare.   
For net CHF2880: CHF1500 for a basic apartment, CHF260 if you shop around for health insurance, CHF50 for mobile phone. That leaves around CHF1000 for a month including transport. Groceries for one person around CHF400 a month with planning.    
Have a look here   for a sample budget based on varying levels of income.

			Thank you all for the answers. I am building up an idea of where to go with this.   
Just to be clear, I am not worried about wealth tax. I am worried about how the perceived increase in my income takes me over a threshold. This means no more support for music lessons which means all the children having to give up music lessons.    
If only it was all about wealth tax.....   
I also see that whereas I put in my Schuldzinsen as 'X   
The tax man has used a new form and entered it as ""Schuldzinsen (2./3. der Aktiven)"" so he has now effectively lowered my mortgage on paper when that is not the reality.

671	Financebankingtaxation	Fixing my CHF-GBP exchange rate	Enohzee	1104	10	Location: Neuchatel	06.11.2015, 18:12	"    Not quite. Your example perfectly describes a speculative forex trade where you're hoping to gain from the buying or selling of one currency against another.   
What the poster was asking is how to fix a forward contract for a given amount of CHF and buying GBP.  The rate can be fixed for any day in the future and once fixed you will know exactly how many Francs you'll have to hand over to buy the given amount of Sterling.   
This deal is usually fixed with a 10% deposit though different providers and banks have differing policies.  Once fixed it doesn't matter what happens to the currency pair, the rate quoted is the one that will apply on the day.  There will be no carry interest to pay as that's all in the price.  Moneycorp does not charge a fee but a bank may, and the banks rate will be worse than someone like Moneycorp.     
There are other providers, I think Swissquote is one, so do shop around to find the best deal.

			No GCT if the follwing is true:     
- Held the stocks for at least 6 Months 
- Sum of a sales and buy value in a year is no more than 5 times of your total stocks value. 
- Gain from selling is less than 50% of your total earnings. 
- You do not use loans to finace your stocks. 
- You use derivates only to secure your existing portfolio.           
The 35% is withholding tax on dividens and interest.

			I think that in fact your husband will just pay less taxes. You will need to inform his employer that you do not work anymore and they will change his level of taxation (from 2 incomes to single income, sorry I don't remember exact names).   
I did check how will change my taxes at source if my wife will start working. It was exactly opposite. I have to inform my employer and they then change my level so I pay more taxes (single income->two incomes). However please check if it works in the opposite direction.

People on this forum tell me to pay taxes in my home country, but my home country is completely different from the embassy I work for, and as I understand it, only the diplomats pay in their home country instead of the country they were sent to.      
I guess I'll just fill out that tax-at-source return form and attach a letter telling them I'm not actually paying tax-at-source, then see what happens.

I'm trying to evaluate the costs and complications of changing cantons just for a few years. I have searched old threads about changing cantons but they tend to deal with one problem or another and not give a total analysis except that it is like changing countries and a big pain.

Can you add to my list of things to consider and correct it if there are errors please?   
1. Changing license plates for two cars   
2 Re  -Expertise for old cars? it was done last year but they need it every two years.   
3. More road tax? or does what was paid for this year in GE get carried over?   
4. Changing the C-permit? Does it have to get reissued? I'm now naturalized but my husband is not....Since it was done in GE - he'd have to pay the fees for a new card? His is a C permit - I don't see anything on the back about where he can live with it and presuming he can follow me. I did see that husband and wife have to live in the same canton for tax purposes.   
5. Changing AVS - right now I'm unemployed and he's retired so I have to pay into the AVS system based on savings....Is this complicated to change?   
6. Taxes - I've read here and there about paying your taxes before leaving. But I thought that taxes are paid based on where one lives the 31 December? So this is just for the previous year?     When changing cantons or leaving Switzerland the local OCP must be informed, and all taxes due should be paid to the Administration Fiscale Cantonale. 
Hotel des Finances   
7. OCP - changing registration...for GE -122 chf for Americans   
8. Changing drivers license - 100 chf (and get the credit card sized license) - we have a year to do this?   
9. Other fees and complications?   
Thank you !

			I use western union to transfer the money regularly from my credit card directly to my bank account. Somehow they do not have transfer fee nowadays, and the exchange rate is not bad at all. Mostly much better than WorldRemit.

694	Financebankingtaxation	Should I pay wealth tax on my company?	davidweber	2013	31	Location: Dubai	04.01.2016, 18:19	"    YES!   
Like others you are getting your knickers in a twist about nothing - like some  posters here - and a number of supposedly knowledgeable websites.   
As you can search a millionaire in Canton Zurich pays roughly CHF1100 wealth tax.   
What you own, is taxed. I expect your company owns your car (but you will be liable for some kind of tax on the benefit). As I posted above, if you own the company in the form of shares, these are added to your wealth. If your shareholding is CHF100million, then you can afford and need to seek professional advice

698	Financebankingtaxation	Lump sum withdrawal from vested benefit account in CH: taxable in Canada?	dbo73	1421	8	Location: Canada	31.03.2015, 20:46	" 
			
			Funny you couldn't get anyone from CRA on the phone. So far, fingers crossed, I've  always managed to talk with a human being after being asked to press this or that button. If you reach a dead end, you are choosing the wrong options. Nonetheless, CRA has brick and mortar offices, too, where you can go ask your questions, no appointment necessary (at least the first time around).        
First, Canada and Switzerland have a tax agreement to avoid being taxed twice. This agreement also makes it possible to get pensions from both countries, or to transfer your earnings to one of them (where you reside).   
Your 2nd pillar (or vested benefit account) is similar to the RRSPs in Canada, from what I understand. As such, in Canada, if you withdraw a sum of money out of your RRSP acct, you must pay it back within a certain amount of time. You could empty your accounts  if you left the country, but with a huge tax hit (25%?) IN Canada.       
But you did this in Switzerland with your Swiss pension money. Could you ask your Swiss bank or the gemeinde/tax office in Switzerland in which country the taxes get triggered? My bet is in Switzerland, because the money were earned here and tax-sheltered here. But rather than take my word for it, you should call your gemeinde. Here is an EF link talking about it (you said you searched )       
Just googling, I got this 2011 article. I doubt things changed much since then.       
Read and still do your own research regarding the advice and explanations provided within the article. Do  check CRA's website, make a list of questions, then talk with your Swiss and your Canadian banks. I found that my credit union served my needs better than one of the big 5 when it came to financial advice.    
Cheers and enjoy Canada!

			I'm a Swiss resident considering opening a brokerage account. I'm able to invest 1'000 CHF - 1'500 CHF a month. In the future (say 5 years) I'm probably going to live in a EUR country. I found lot's of useful advice in this thread and I'm leaning towards a US broker like IB or Schwab. I'm looking for more buy and hold type investing. Given that I'm probably not going to stay in Switzerland what would you recommend in my case?    
-Open the account in CHF, EUR or USD?  
-Go for a European broker? 
-How to best change CHF to EUR or should I at all?

			That reminds me of an acquaintance who studied at some pivate institution near Geneva, which went bankrupt and shut down a short while after he graduated:/ I believe he went on to do a Master's at one of those chain schools (if Im not mistaken it was Webster). Needless to say he failed to find a job in Switzerland after graduation, which in his case was no big deal since e came from a wealthy family. Private institutions pop up every year here and try to con people into attending by misrepresenting themselves as being part of the solid Swiss education system. Bottom line, I would advise against wasting time ans money on these institutions. In OP's case, it is hard to make a statement without seeing the contract or knowing the University and its practices. OP, see a lawyer who has experience with educational institutions (and is ideally based in the city of your institution). But typically you would seek legal recourse only after exhausting other available alleys such as calling or writing your institution. Several law firms will offer the first appointment at no cost. Rechtsauskunftsstellen ( ) or your Gemeinde may also have free legal advice available. Wishing you well.

Then you will have less than 300k invested so it's not applicable to most US citizens

			Normally: 
You should get a end of the year certificates where it is stated how much you invested in each 3a account.   
Submit a copy of every statement to the tax authority, to get the tax relief.   
Once they got aware you paid more than allowed they will then send you back the relevant statement to get your money back.   
In your case: 
There pop up some questions.    
- Did you get all of the end of year statements? 
- Does the summ of end of year statements show a too high ammount paid in the relevant year? 
- Did you send a copies of the end of year statements to the tax authority?   
If all above are true. Resubmit a copies of the end of the year statements to the tax authority to get the statement from the tax people that you indeed paid too much and are eligble for reimbursement from the bank.   
PS: I assume earnings, intrests and dividends to not count toward the max ammount to be paid into a 3a account. At least this is the case with interest and a normal 3a account.

b) Yes, it is. There are some (small) restrictions,....if you are settling down in a non EU-Country, then you can withdraw everything....

749	Financebankingtaxation	HECS debts [aussie]- how will they enforce the new rules?	19Monica	1250	7	Location: Basel	08.12.2015, 16:30	"    I disagree, it isn't that easy to find information on people especially if you require the cooperation of several government agencies. Sure, there is systems set up to deal with specific information sharing such as when a person is arrested in England but they're from another country a request can be sent and that persons crime record is checked in their home country.  That is quite a standard procedure nowadays but that involves criminals and does not apply in tax situations.    
I think it's easy to find information on people if you're a sleuth but not so easy if it starts to get offical - agencies refusing to share information will be the norm.    
For example to find me you'd need to know where my husband works to get my address or request it from my family. Why would my husbands work provide information on me to a government agency if requested? I guess if they knew what country I lived based on where I last flew to from Australia then they could write to every canton asking for my details? Just looking for someone like me would be very time consuming and expensive.   
But doable none the less.

752	Financebankingtaxation	How to declare UK apartments on Swiss tax return	Slayer	1012	2	Location: Zurich	05.12.2015, 07:34	" 
			
			I have a holiday house in Spain and co-own a house in Germany.   
I asked the Zürich tax office what to do, and they said, I should write a letter saying (and including the exact words) ""nach bestem wissen und gewissen"" in which I should state what I believe to be the fair value providing some backing up for my guesstimate.   
For the German property I used the purchase price, which I do to the best of my knowledge still believe to be the fair value. I specifically state this in my letter.   
For the Spanish property I also pay property tax to the commune in Spain and I show the bill for that to the Swiss tax authorities (albeit the previous year's one as they don't normally send out bills until the following October) and the Zürich tax office accepts the Spanish value estimate as fair.   
All I do every year is retrieve that letter on my computer, update the date, look up the exchange rate for 1st January and re-adjust any conversions, print it out, and stick those values onto my tax form and send in the letter (signed) with the tax form.   
So far they've never quibbled over my approach

753	Financebankingtaxation	How to declare UK ISAs on Swiss Tax Return	Slayer	1547	14	Location: Zurich	01.12.2015, 05:47	" 
			
			You should put UK savings interest as a gross amount in the DA-1 and claim to offset the UK tax paid against the Swiss tax which will be levied (on the gross amount.)   
My understanding is that ""tax credits"" in the UK are not recognised by the Swiss as tax paid by you therefore effectively there is no double-tax agreement.  In theory, for non-ISAs you should declare the dividend amount net of the tax credit and make no claim for tax paid in the UK.  You could try to reclaim the tax credits on the DA-1 if you think the Swiss tax people might buy it.   I'm not sure how it would work if you've paid higher rate supplemental tax on the dividends. Dividends in the UK to non-residents shouldn't attract this tax, unless you've asked to be taxed as a UK resident.  If for ISAs you actually receive the tax credit as part of the dividend, then you would need to declare the gross amount.  I.e. in both cases you declare how much was actually received.   
1. Dividenden aus im Vereinigten Königreich ansässigen Gesellschaften unterliegen gemäss innerstaatlichem 
Recht  
2. Vor der Revision im Jahr 2007 des Doppelbesteuerungsabkommens zwischen der Schweiz und dem 
Vereinigten Königreich (DBA-UK) hatten in der Schweiz ansässige Personen einen abkommensrechtlichen 
Anspruch auf Steuergutschriften (tax credits), wie sie im innerstaatlichen britischen Steuerrecht vorgesehen 
sind. Aufgrund der Herabsetzung der Steuergutschrift im Jahre 1999 auf 1/9 im Rahmen einer Änderung des 
internen Rechts des Vereinigten Königreichs, erhält ein Schweizer Investor seit dem Jahr 1999 jedoch keine 
Steuergutschriften mehr oder - wenn es sich beim Schweizer Investor um eine Gesellschaft mit einem 
Stimmrechtsanteil an der Dividenden zahlenden Gesellschaft von mindestens 10 Prozent handelt - nur noch 
einen sehr bescheidenen Betrag. Deshalb ist man anlässlich der Revision des DBA-UK im Jahr 2007 beiderseits 
übereingekommen, dass es sich nicht mehr rechtfertigt, eine Bestimmung deren Tragweite als Folge der 
Änderung des innerstaatlichen britischen Rechts unbedeutend geworden ist, aufrecht zu erhalten. So wurde die 
Abkommensbestimmung betreffend die Steuergutschrift aufgehoben. Das Recht auf die Steuergutschrift auf 
Grund von Dividenden, die von Gesellschaften mit Sitz im Vereinigten Königreich an in der Schweiz ansässige 
Personen bezahlt wurden, ist für Dividenden, die ab dem 6. April 2009 bezahlt werden, aufgehoben worden.

I had no idea until I received the letter... I certainly didn't see (or 'notice' may be more accurate) anything on-screen.      'Constantly' is a bit strong, but I do occasionally on some months if I go over budget, then I transfer some from my savings to my main account. And yes, for me it was the right place to store my money due to the convenience of having everything on the same hassle-free interface.      How did you create these extra accounts? And are they charge-free?

The fact that you pay off your debt to the CC-company in January shouldn't matter.   
I´d say it'll clearly be deductible in 2015, as it depends on when funds are received by the charity.

			Best thing to do with UK property is make sure it is your PPR before you leave, let it out while you are gone, and make sure it is your PPR when you return.    
That way you maximise your PPR relief which used to be up to 100% even with 7 years absence, now reduced to 5.5 years. On top of that you have the private lettings relief which can wipe out up to another £40k of gains.   
All in all, the tax rules for UK property are pretty generous and with the right planning you should be able to pay little or no tax.

			Some banks charge a fee for any transaction done at an ATM that is not their own.  Therefore, if you want to save that kind of fee, it is worth seeing which banks are physically near your home or workplace.  But that's hard to know while you're still trying to find a home, for example. 
Migros (the big supermarket chain) has its own bank.  And they Charge such an additional fee for using a non-Migros ATM.  However, you can also draw cash with no charge at every Migros shop, at the till or at the customer services desk!  And that means a huge network throughout Switzerland.

			For a while now, writing a will and drawing a life insurance has been on my to-do list, merely as things to do as a diligent parent.    
We have savings + 3rd pillar both regularly filled up and invested. The tax saving potential of the 3a is used and I am seeking answers to how best tackle the life insurance aspect.    
Majority of threads in the forum suggest that life insurance 3a has downsides - early withdrawal for purchase of property is penalised as this is, by design, a long-term product. Just as well, the potential gains are very low, as this has no investment element compared to the bank-account-3a which can be invested with limited success in dedicated instruments and still earn more.    
My questions to you fellow members:  
- life insurance vs the money freely invested in kids' names? 
- life insurance coverage: how much is ""enough"" 
- tips on drawing a life insurance?  
- good companies that come to mind? Is AXA one of them?    
As usual, far from believing my questions are exhaustive, so if something comes to mind that you think is worth considering - please share it.

I have an ""exit document"" from my comune, and have submitted all the proper paperwork to remove all my Pillars from Switzerland (it's currently at chaeis.net), and we want to remove it for a down payment to by a house in the US.  I am already aware of the tax ramifications in both Switzerland and the US.   
My wife would like to leave open the possibility of moving back to Switzerland, and is worried that if we remove the Pension, it will affect our ability to keep our C permit, or to have it re-instated on our possible return.   
Does anyone know if there is a connection between the Pensions and the ability to restart or maintain one's C Permit?   
Thanks!

In the end they were happy with a credit card statement and our landline phone bill to show our address. and a copy of our passports signed by a bank employee. They wouldn't accept a residency card signed by the post office (the standard for opening bank accounts in Switzerland). Thanks for your help

The accountant would send you the completed forms (physically or pdf), then you sign and send them back.

In France, there is a basic rate of 20% of tax on the net rental (and other) income of non-residents, although you may be able to benefit from a lower rate, depending on the level of your worldwide income.   
If you wish to make application for a rate of taxation lower than 20%, then you will need to declare all your worldwide income to the French tax authorities, together with supporting documentation (with French translation). This information will need to be included on the tax return F2042C.

Unfortunately going to my Paypal account online only shows the name of my bank and the last 4 digits of the account number and after so long I can't remember how I did it. I assume that the dots aren't used.

			Last time I renewed my mortgage with UBS, I went into the office to sign. Just before I signed, the UBS advisor went to check the latest rates, and they were slightly down, so she quickly drew up another contract to take advantage of that rate. She assured us that if it had gone up, the original rate we agreed on would have stood.

			Only the first 15% are redeemable (unlike the Swiss withholding tax, which is redeemable in full). I think the remaining 15% counts as a tax credit in Switz (but only if you actually have a positive charge on your tax bill).

			It really depends on the context whether or not a particular product is suitable for a person or not.  I suggest you look at your total situation first and then seek a product to bridge the gaps.   
A primary reason for picking an insurance type product for the third pillar is that if through illness or accident you become unable to pay it going forward it will still continue to accumulate until retirement, so your objective of having savings for retirement would be met.  If however your invalidity income would be sufficient for you to continue saving it might not be so attractive and so on.

So let's say I leave in September 2016 , complete tax form following year. 
Deloitte (company pays for service ) submit form in September 2017 , I get demand for payment 6 to 24 months later  
My company stops tax at source , but I always end up owing more. Not an issue , If demand gets to me and I have a mechanism to pay ie bank account in CH

803	Financebankingtaxation	Notifying Swiss Tax of Capital Gains when leaving Switzerland	calvin.diebel	962	6	Location: Zurich	04.11.2015, 13:05	" 
			
			Ok thanks very good to know. Fortunately my positions are not overly sizeable.      
I guess it would be in my best interest to hold all my profitable positions until I return to Canada (well at least over £11K). Canada deems you to have acquired your assets on the day you become a resident. Which makes sense as they deem you to have sold and realized all assets on the day you become a non resident.    
""When a taxpayer becomes a resident of Canada, he is deemed to have acquired all capital assets, unless specifically excluded, at the fair market value on the date he commences residency.  As such, any unrealized but accrued pre-immigration gains would not be subject to Canadian tax when the asset is sold.  Similarly, when a taxpayer ceases Canadian residence, he is deemed to have sold all of his capital assets, unless specifically excluded, at fair market value and the resulting taxable capital gain, if any, would be included in his last Canadian tax return.  If the individual has not been resident in Canada for more than 60 months, any assets he owned at the time he commenced Canadian residency would be excluded from the departure rules.""

			Just a thought -- since you seem to be very interested in a negotiated deal but are getting little information here despite repeating in every other post you make, maybe you should contact a qualified tax advisor?   
We have plenty of them here in Switzerland, and they're a much better source of reliable, up-to-date information than an internet forum (particularly one which is not full of millionaires looking for tax havens).   
If your affairs are large enough that you can benefit from a negotiated tax deal, a few hours with a tax advisor will be a drop in the bucket and represent money well spent.

809	Financebankingtaxation	Quellensteuer - Less than my annual tax burden?	Dest.Swiss	1167	12	Location: Zürich	31.10.2015, 11:27	"    When this happened to us in Canton Zurich, there was no 'liability' until they issue the first bill (invoice) which has a deadline. Then if you can't pay immediately you have to write a letter (we emailed and they said they would accept an email the first time but in future to always write a proper letter) - stating the payment plan that you would like. They then re-issue the new invoices with the amounts separated into monthly payments, and it's only once these come that you need to start paying.   
Because it's a Quellensteuer - tax return - adjustment - extra invoice situation, they don't expect any interim payments 'in advance' and any interest payable is a very small amount as it's not interest on the whole year's tax, just a tiny bit of interest from paying late on the adjustment amount..

			I use Transferwise and they are fast and efficient. If you pay within 24 hours the rate you get is the one you see. I have used Currencies Direct and TorX and they don't charge over 5K. However with both I noticed that some 11 chf less arrived than the amount in the contract. Both explained that banks often use a middle bank that takes a commission. Currencies Direct happily refunded me the loss from the past year but TorX did not make an offer to do this.   
With Transferwise it is simple, the service when I have emailed has been very friendly and you can send as much or as little as you want, with £4.50 charged per thousand pounds. The rate is usually .1 under the rate that yahoo finance shows.

2. If you had funds in your company's Pillar II when you left Switzerland, it is likely that they were transferred to the Auffangeinrichtung. Suggest you contact them:       
Edit: 
Rather than contact the Auffangeinrichtung directly, it is advisable to contact the ""2nd Pillar Central Office"":   
""The 2nd Pillar Central Office is the liaison office between the  occupational benefit schemes (also referred to as 2nd Pillar or BVG) and  insured persons. It is intended to enable interrupted contacts between  insured persons and the schemes to be restored.""

			Yes, you are married so you're taxed as married.  The fact that your property/finances may be seperate has nothing to do with it.  If you were divorced it would be different, but you're not.  That link only refers to how things will be if you divorce or one of you dies.

			I'm presuming they did not fill it in correctly but I really dont know! Its all so confusing!   
When I called the tax office in Zurich they said that HR could just tell them that I dont work and that would be enough. When my husband spoke to HR they said it was not up to them it was the tax office that needed to tell them that it was wrong    
My husband called the tax office again and they now say I need to prove that I dont work and they need a letter from HMRC that says this.   
HMRC say all they can do is send my self assessment calculations for the last 5 years which show i had no income. Hoping this will be enough?

To answer my own question:   
I went to the Steueramt and got info that there is no issue at all with providing a foreign bank account to pay out the tax return. 
The only thing is the exchange rate, which will be dependent on the day of payout.   
Cheers,

			You might in any case want to get tax advice on buying a property as some things in Switzerland don't work quite the same way as anywhere else in the world.   
I've used currencyfair for transfers and you could transfer it over in batches.  Also my bank (UBS) gives better rates if I call them up or go visit them.  Typically then it's only 1% loading instead of 2 but you're still at the mercy of the current exchange rate.

Nitpicking: If the trust puts the money in a bank safe, you would not be affected by the mothers bank bankruptcy.    
But, as the money incurs interest, there must be one or more third party involved. So there is a risk the money or some of it may vanish. For ever. No gain w/o a possible pain.

833	Financebankingtaxation	Investment portfolio management app / service	poot	452	0	Location: Zurich	11.10.2015, 12:43	" 
			
			Hi all, I'm using Interactive Brokers for my trading and investing, which is obviously a great platform with great execution prices, but isn't great for portfolio management.     
I'm now looking for recommendations for a good portfolio management service? I'm fine with maintaining my positions manually in it, as I also want it as much for research and quick & easy watchlist monitoring. Ideally also with a related iOS app.   
For portfolio management, I'm using google finance, which currently means I maintain a main portfolio, with details of my open positions on it.  Here I can quickly see my positions, charts etc.  I also maintain a number of 'watchlist' portfolios, to track other stocks and ETFs etc of which I'm interested in.  The negative here is there is no related iOS app.    
I've also played with yahoo finance, which in some ways (news, research) seems a bit better than google finance, but it in others it isn't as nice (not as intuitive as google, no portfolio charting etc). There is an iOS app, but not available in Switzerland    
Interested to hear what others do, thanks!

I came to notice that whatever I find in Amazon.de its already very cheap compared to buying it from a Store even in Germany.   
For example we checked with my wife today the set of cutlery from WMF, on the shop it was 399 Euros and in Amazon its 230 Euros...

 It's actually not entirely straightforward to just quit, since it's tied to my mortgage with the bank.  However at the same time as introducing a dealing charge for new transactions, they're also offering funds with a massively reduced TER, so over time it will actually make them cheaper to own.  However, it always seems expensive compared to the ETFs I have with a broker who with no custody fees and TERs of 0.09  0.3%.

2) correct. 
3) correct. 
4) I'm not sure I fully understand what you are getting at here. In principle, the law specifies minimum contributions (employee/employer). Important for you is what your pension scheme specifies, and this will be defined in the rules ""Ger: Reglement"" of which you should obtain a copy.

Cost: 0.45% spread (i.e EUR68) to trade and maybe small fee CHF2.- or so to transfer the money out.   
2. Use one of the many online FX platforms, involves the same kind of mechanism. Names I am aware of include: transferwise, currencyfair and fairfx.

All good from next month onwards.

863	Financebankingtaxation	Migros Mastercard limit reduced	MajorGrubert	752	2	Location: Geneva	16.09.2015, 20:43	"    Usually it is in the best interests of the Bank's clients, that the clients don't have access to credit that they cannot afford to repay. Naturally, the Bank will present all of its actions (closing branches, reducing opening times, increasing fees for services etc. etc.) as a direct benefit to the client. 
In this special case, the bank is now tightening  down its exposure to risk and the form you have to complete will be asking things like your level of income, debts etc. The threat to lower your credit limit is simply an incentive for you to keep the Bank updated with your current financial situation. At the end of it, you will probably see your credit limit increased.

Whether the cantonal banks in Mullhollander's list would offer Mastercard or Visa I don't know, but I doubt it.  Credit cards for those yes, debits no.  So you see they may not be that useable outside of Switzerland.   
It's only in the last 10 years or so that credit cards have become more widely used in Switzerland.  The Swiss, being thrifty people, prefer even now to use cash or debit cards rather than credit cards.  It's only recently that Mastercard and Visa have been accepted at stores here, before it was usually only a store's own credit card that you could use there.

			Hi all, a quick update. We filled out and sent off the required forms as requested, which the pension fund has received. However, we also needed a ""Cessation of Pledge"" letter from the creditor, i.e. our PostFinance mortgage broker, in order for the account to be released and the funds transferred. I'm a bit miffed our bank didn't take the initiative and inform me right from the beginning, but I've been in touch with them to do it ASAP.

			It's been said before but check how long you have to submit the claim with the seller or with global blue or similar if that's who you'll get the VAT back from. The places at the border where you see people queuing up with their green forms are the German customs stamping the export (not import) form. They might ask if you have it with you but I've never had anyone come to my car to look.  Many, many people then ""forget"" that they should declare goods over the limit to the Swiss customs 30 metres away.  You're unlikely to be stopped unless you see the Germans faxing your form to the Swiss or the bike's still in its cardboard box.  I've walked across the border with brand new skis before and no-one cared.  It's part of the thrill that is living in Switzerland.  The Swiss make up for this loss of taxes by taking money off you for just about everything else.

It will need to be put on your final tax return, it will be taxed at the rate of the canton you lived in rather the canton the pension was held in so the withholding tax may not cover the full liability.

Not sure if it always goes through though.   
Also, claim 700 for bike expenses (apparently up to 700 they don't ask for receipts, 700.01 and you have to provide receipts), and you can claim 300 as donations to street musicians without any receipts.

			As an unmarried couple you have to fill in separate tax forms... and obviously you can't both claim the tax allowances for your children, so you need to decide who's going to 'claim' for them.  
As the your tax rating depends on loads of things (salary, other claimable allowances) it's probably best that you see an accountant or tax advisor; at least for the first year or two.   
It's not a judgement of the fact you're unmarried, simply that you can't   claim for them.... divorced couple with children have a similar tax dilemma.

903	Financebankingtaxation	UK LTD company assets & dividend taxation in Switzerland	Landers	809	0	Location: Basel	28.08.2015, 12:10	" 
			
			Hi All   
I've done extensive searching but haven't been able to find any thread related to my situation but I'm not I'm not the only one.   
I've been a contractor through my UK company for many years and a few years ago took a job in Switzerland working for a big company through a Swiss payroll company (i.e. not through my UK company.)  Since being here I've paid a dividend from my UK company to myself in the UK, declared it in the UK in my non-UK-resident tax return, and also left some other money in the company.   
Now I have to do Swiss tax declaration.  For the dividend it would seem there's a double taxation agreement in place. In general I assume the 10% tax credit received in the UK also can count as a deduction of tax due on the dividend in Switzerland but I see also such a thing as lump-sum deductions (pauschale Steueranrechnung) and can't work out what this means exactly.  I've also seen things in ""Welcome to Switzerland"" type documents that says dividends from such a company would only be taxed at 60% of the (gross/net?) dividend.  I also see things such as directors fees and ""income derived from services"" and these are not be taxable in Switzerland.  I'm guessing a dividend can't in fact be classed under these?   There must be someone out there who's been through a similar thing?   
The second thing is the guy in the payroll company who will prepare my tax return says that I have to declare the value (the amount in the bank) and income (which is almost 0) of my UK limited company as it's counted as me owning shares and these are ""movable assets"". In theory yes I have 100% of the shares in my UK company but is this correct?  If it were a partnership or self-employed then I could understand it but usually in England LTD companies are separate entities.   
I'm very convinced that the tax guy in the payroll company has no idea about someone in my situation. He's just said I will have to declare and pay tax on everything and I can't claim any rebate for dividends or other tax paid  in the UK.   
The other thing is he says it's ok to submit for the UK financial year Apr-Apr instead of the Swiss one Jan-Dec as I have the tax certificates for this period.  Does anyone else do this?  What then about income in the first quarter of the first year I was here?     
Many thanks for reading!

904	Financebankingtaxation	Question about Swiss pensions	Durfain	713	0	Location: Bern	27.08.2015, 17:03	" 
			
			Hi all - I started working in Bern a couple of weeks ago and recently got a letter asking me some questions pertaining to my work based pension (something I honestly know very little about since this is my first job) from the Bernische Pensionskasse. One thing I was unsure about is the box that says ""Sparplanvariante"" with two options saying ""Variante plus 2%"" and ""Variante plus 4%"" together with a note in German saying if you don't tick a box you get the basic rate savings option. Am I correct in my understanding that this is like an additional voluntary based contribution into the pension of 2%/4%? Is this worthwhile considering? Thanks for your help!

910	Financebankingtaxation	Income in Different Cantons and Tax Return	Olcayto	556	0	Location: Zurich	23.08.2015, 16:47	" 
			
			Hello,   
I moved from Basel City to Zurich last summer. 
I paid Quellensteuer in Basel for 7 months and in Zurich for 5 months. 
I clarified with the Zurich Steueramt that I need to declare my return only to Zurich for 2014.   
My questions is about section 26.1 on the Steuererklarung which asks me ""Aus steuerbare Einkunfte in anderen Kantonen"".   
Am I supposed to fill this section(see attachment please) and separate my income as earned in Zurich and out of Zurich since I worked in Zurich only for 5 months in 2014? 
It would be great to hear from someone in a similar position who declared taxes before.    
Many thanks,

			If it's below £325,000 it's subject to the nil band rate of taxation so always free. Anything above £325k is a potentially exempt transfer.   
In any case no declaration of gifts is reported to the revenue   
The tax liability rests with the estate of the giver, so it's a moot point.

			The rates Moneypark negotiated on behalf of its customers, on moneypark.ch are, to my knowledge, about or very close to the lowest negotiable rates (e.g. 0.78% for Libor). Practically all banks/insurers publish ""Schaufensterzinsen"", ""shopwindow"" rates on various sites (Comparis, Vermoegenspartner Winterthur), i.e. Not yet ""best-and-final offers"", with the exception of, if I'm correct, Migros.

The alternative is open an account with Swissquote, here you get 1 account number that serves for everything, and nothing is ever transfered into any other currency, you have to do this. So if i have an incomming USD payment it stays in USD, i can then givew instructions later to change to different currency if i want.

One of the first reality checks in Switzerland was the credit card application. ""I'll take the top package with all the insurances and what not since I fly a lot"" ""I can apply for you, but I don't think you'll be approved.."" ""And why would that be the case?""

922	Financebankingtaxation	Transferring large sums from Canada?	swisscanmom	7556	52	Location: near Langenthal, BE	27.05.2013, 16:15	" 
			
			Wow, there is a lot of misinformation on this thread.   
First, a few hints.  You can use a cheque or bankers draft to bring the money over here, but this is a very expensive and time-consuming process.  Your Swiss bank will charge you handsomely for this service, and they won't credit your account until the funds have cleared.  This can take weeks or even months in some cases.  You won't have any visibility of the exchange rate that you'll get -- you'll get the rate on the day that the money clears.   
Summary: your money will get here, eventually, but at a high cost.  Not a great choice.   
A   better solution is to use XE.com to transfer the money.  You can do all the paperwork and set up the account now (this takes a few days, so better to get the process started well in advance).  You'll have instant visibility of the exchange rate that you'll get, no additional fees to pay at either end, and a simple domestic Canadian transaction from the point-of-view of your Canadian bank.  The whole process takes about 3 days from initiating the transfer until the money is in your Swiss bank account.   
The other advantage of this is that you can first transfer a *small* amount of money to make sure that everything works as intended.  It's a little nerve-wracking to have your entire life savings lost somewhere in the international banking system (I speak from first-hand experience).   
XE does nothing all day but move money back-and-forth internationally.  They're specialists at it, and they do it very well.     
A final solution would be to leave a signed wire order, without recipient account details, with your bank manager in Canada.  Tell him/her that you'll give them the account details later (they'll probably insist on a fax - it's a very old-world system).  This would also work if your bank manager is willing to take the draft, although this depends on how strong your relationship is with the bank.   
If your bank isn't a specialist expat bank (like HSBC), I actually don't like this option too much.  The banks don't have much experience moving money internationally, and there are too many things that can go wrong.   
As I said before, I'd use a specialist broker like XE.  It'll be the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to get your money over here.

			If you move between cantons, you are taxed in the canton where you have your official residency on 31/12. If you move within the canton, you are taxed where you have your official residency on 01/01 (at least in the canton of Zurich). So if you move from the canton of Zurich to the canton of Zug on 30/12 you will be taxed in the canton of Zug. If you move from Zurich City to Oerlikon on 02/01 you will be taxed in Zurich City. This assumes that you are either not taxed at source or are above the threshold and file a tax return.

When it comes to what counts as income there's a couple of things you need to be aware of, for example that your employer's pension contribution counts as earned income and the AHV, IV, EO, etc. contributions are not deductible.

			Yes you have to pay taxes for the money from the 2nd and 3rd pillar when you get it back. If you have 3rd pillar and are taxed at source, you have to complete a special formular each year to get back taxes on what you deposit for the 3rd pillar. 
Also because you have to pay taxes when you get your money back, many Swiss have not just one, but more 3rd pillar accounts. When you are at age to retire, or want to buy a house with 3rd pillar money, you may choose to get your money back from different accounts in different years, so that you pay less taxes.

941	Financebankingtaxation	My Experience with MidPoint (Int'l Money Transfer)	Curran919	956	0	Location: Effretikon, ZH	04.08.2015, 11:13	"     
Midpoint is a P2P money transfer service, very similar to CurrencyFair. I have seen the latter mentioned numerous times on the forum, but was surprised that MidPoint did not show up at all in a search. It is newer, sure, but not only gave me a better deal but also has different currencies available. I believe that when I checked in June 2015, that it was only these two services that would allow me to transfer CAD to CHF.     The Cost 
I needed to send about 10000CHF from Canada as seed money when we moved here. There is a minimum charge of 10GBP, but above about 4000CHF, the charge is 0.50% of the transfer value. The exchange rate used is the midpoint rate (compared to XE.com rates), hence the name. Using sample values, the CurrencyFair and MidPoint prices for the same trasnfer come to within $1. With my bank, the use of a 'buy' exchange rate would have led to about a 1.4% loss in the transfer compared to the midpoint rate. This saved about 90CHF. Note that the exchange rates for a credit card can yield a loss of up to 2.5%.     How It Works 
You put an order in for buying X currency A or selling X currency B. Within 24 hours, they will match you with someone (or multiple people) wanting to exchange the other way (this is all behind doors). When you submit your order, you fill in the account details for the recipient account. You get a message when you are matched with someone providing bank details where your sum must be deposited. Note that the sum is calculated from the exchange rate at matching not at ordering. You make a transfer to this bank account with the correct sum, and when your matched person also do this, your money will go to their receiving account and vice versa. You have 72 hours for the money to get to their account or there could be 'penalties' (you don't want to keep your match waiting...), although it seems they have no way of enforcing these if you never pay. This is because MidPoint themselves have very low liquidity and can normally not put up currency themselves, which is why they are a cheaper service.     Sending from North America 
MidPoint has bank accounts in all of the countries they operate in for you to deposit directly into... except for US/Canada. This is also the case for CurrencyFair and is a bit of a pain. You have to deposit the money into a UK bank which has its own associated costs. A wire transfer from your bank should costs $20-50 and should have no hidden 'exchange fees' since you are transfering CAD-CAD or US-US but also [usually] requires you to do this at your bank IN PERSON.     My Experience 
I (Canadian) was in Canada and my wife (EU) had just opened up an account with PostFinance. I wanted to try the service out with a small amount since there was so little information on it on the forums (yet a bit of journalism on the web). I arranged to send 1000CAD to her account. For this small amount, the fee was 10GBP which actually came out to 1.5%, more than my bank. When UK markets opened the following day (MidPoint based in UK), I was matched quickly and taken by surprise that the bank was in the UK. It IS in their FAQ, but they should really also have a warning when transfering from Canada/US. I thought, ""no problem, I can send an international remittance."" This would be through online banking for amounts less than $2500 and charging a $13.50 additional fee to my bank. Not so. International remittances can only be sent in GBP/USD, not CAD. I contact the MidPoint looking for some guidance. They reply within 10 minutes to say that people DO infact transfer money through my bank in Canada, but that if I was going to have trouble, given it was a small amount and my first time, they would cancel the order. I obliged since I was living on an island at the time with no branch for my bank. I phoned my bank the next day and they confirmed that indeed you do have to come into a branch to send money in that manner.   
The day before going to Vancouver, I order another transfer, this time for the full 10000CHF. I am quickly matched again and go to a branch the next day for the transfer. Everything runs smoothly and I pay $35 total to send the money with next day deposit, within the 72h. Three days later I am waiting for my wife to receive money when I get an email saying the money hasn't been deposited. With a few emails back and forth, I forward them my receipt of wire transfer. The bank teller had put the mandatory receiver's reference in the sender's reference section. They HAD received the money but didnt automatically know it was from me. After another day, all was fine.   
Two MORE days later, Another message comes in explaining that PostFinance had bounced the deposit back. More talking with MidPoint and we found another of my errors in the receiving bank info (confusing field named 'account name' should be 'name of account owner'). Another try and the money is finally available the next evening, about 9 days after first making the order, though this should generally be much less if everything is done correctly the first time.     Conclusion 
While the numbers will dictate where the best 'product' is, I had a great opportunity to really put the customer service of MidPoint through its paces and was very impressed. Over a dozen emails sent with two representatives, but whom actually spoke with eachother (and had names!) They were able to easily solve all of my problems and always answered my emails within 5-10 minutes and within 30 minutes of the market opening. With all of the delays, it wasn't worth saving the 90CHF in the end, but it will be next time when I do everything correctly.   
I hope someone else can chime in with their experience or comparison with other services if anyone has actually ever used MidPoint on here.

			There is this money transfer service by worldremit. They can transfer money directly to your bank account and the fee is quite cheap. You may use credit card for the transaction  .   
Perhaps you can ask your employer to transfer part of your salary into your bank account in USA using Worldremit. And part of your salary in cash to you for your daily use.   
If they dont want to do that, perhaps you can buy mastercard prepaid card, i.e from Kiosk (more Info (in DE)  ). Top it up in Kiosk. Open Worldremit account and transfer the money in your card to your bank account in USA  .

I'd like to order something from   shop. 
As they say   for customs taxes and import duties,  
would you ask them to specifically state this - along with the exact item price and shipping costs - on the package to make delivery easier?   
And does anyone have experience with colissimo expert service?

			You should be able to find a notary who speaks English and can go through the contract with you, paragraph by paragraph, on the day you meet to sign the contract.  We asked our estate agent to arrange an English speaking notary for us when we bought our house a few years ago and that's exactly what he did.  Went carefully through the contract so we understood each section.  We asked for a few amendments and with the agreement of the sellers he made the changes there and then so we were able to all sign to complete the purchase.

But seriously, thank you for the advise, and for the comment about professional advising. I will keep that in mind.   
At this point, the 401k to Roth IRA conversion seems interesting only if the special pension rates apply. Do you have any good resource to read on this point?   
The capital tax sounds like a lesser problem, given the amount involved.

			google the E411 form - it is available in English.     
My wife and family were living in Ireland (we were claiming there) and I also claimed here and the Swiss paid me their working out of the difference between the two payments.  ie 2 kids in Ireland : 270 euro.  2 kids here (under school leaving age) 450 CHF.  They paid me and extra 60 CHF a month! (450CHF - 270 euro doesn't come to 60 CHF in my calculations..). 
You also have to renew the claim forms every year as the children are not here (I didn't do it in time and they took all the payments back in one go - so it was as well that they paid me so little). 
Wife and kids are here now, and we have stopped claiming in Ireland and paid back the part we claimed when we were first here.  Just awaiting payments to start here now.

			You will have to pay taxes and social security on this amount. I´m sure there is an overview somewhere here on how much the IV, AHV and what ever is. Taxes will be dependent on where you live so no one will be able to tell you exactly what the amount will be. You could check with comparis and just take the gross amount and see what comes out.   
As to the discussion days/weeks, if you are without work, this is counted with days, maturity benefit is slightly different.

I am looking for a tax accountant who would be able to give me advice on how my taxes will work in this case (and how much I will have to pay).

			Statistics don't mean so much in politics.  Less than 0.001% of Muslims are involved in terrorism but that hasn't stopped governments using them as scapegoats.  When governments like Finland and Germany have to justify another Greek bailout to their local population, the facts won't matter, they will just go with a story about rich Greeks not paying taxes and hiding the money in Switzerland.

972	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss Credit Cards	Gottogo	40561	105	Location: Zurich	16.05.2007, 01:34	"    Many thanks for that advice!   
I went into Jelmoli about 7.50pm on 31st July (about 10 minutes before they were due to close for the Swiss national holiday), filled out the application form and gave them photocopies of my passport and work permit (""Bewilligung""). Two weeks later I started phoning Bonuscard (the card supplier behind Jelmoli - literally as well as figuratively!) to check the status of my application, and was told that they had no record of my application. Even though Bonuscard's offices are literally 100m from the Jelmoli store in the centre of Zürich, it appears that my application never made it across.   
I then filled out a new application form off the internet at   (site only in German or French - go into the store and get help filling out the form if you don't speak either), went to Bonuscard's offices at 18 St. Annagasse in the centre of Zürich, gave them   
* my signed and completed application form 
* a photocopy of my passport 
* a photocopy of my work permit (only an L, due to intial 6-month contract) 
* a photocopy of my contract with my agency 
* a photocopy of my most recent payslip 
* a photocopy of my contract on my flat 
* a photocopy of my broadband contract   
to demonstrate as much as possible that I not only had a good job, but had both an entitlement to be here and a commitment to staying here, and yesterday I got a shiny new gold Jelmoli Visa card with a 5000F credit limit, no annual fee as long as I spend more than 300F per year and no requirement to put up funds to the value of the credit limit of the card, which had been the stumbling block to applying for a credit card of the bank for which I work. 5000/10000F are 2 months / 4 months mortgage repayments on my UK mortgage, and that's much more important to me!   
So anyway, that's what worked for me, and now I am no longer paying foreign exchange charges and commission for every transaction that I make in CH on my UK credit card, only to get stung again when sending Francs back to the UK to pay off the card at the end of the month.   
If I had my startup time again I would apply for a Cornercard Reload card straight away to minimise the foreign exchange and commission charges, then for a Jelmoli Visa card once I had got my Bewilligung and then probably cancel the Cornercard Reload card at the end of the first year.   
Easy to be wise when you know; many thanks to AbFab and DavidInBern for the tips!

977	Financebankingtaxation	Buying a new property before selling existing	VDToGo	734	3	Location: Montreux	12.07.2015, 13:07	" 
			
			No our current place is not paid off. We have 40% in our current place and a 60% mortgage. 
The location is not Montreux (need to update my profile) its Zug.   
One scenario I heard was that a single mortgage is calculated for both, the 3xinterest rate at 5% (+1%) is calculated for affordability minus the rental income from one? of the properties. I haven't confirmed this though.     
I know its common to line up selling places with buying a new place. a Bankverprechung from the buyer is enough for the bank to consider an existing place as sold but not always possible to line things up.     
Thanks again

978	Financebankingtaxation	Taxes from Kanton Zürich	teco	1945	15	Location: Zurich	13.05.2015, 01:41	"    I moved mid-year from Ticino to Aargau, - only Aargau billed me for taxes as I was resident there on 31st December. After all not everyone can move on 31st December!   
Ticino told me (when I queried how it works for partial time spent residing in a/their canton), they (Ticino as a canton) do not bill anyone at all who is not resident there on 31st December!    
The comune/Gemeinde there also told me the same and that any case they as a 'comune' don't issue anything bill-wise until the Canton of Ticino has issued a decision! I never heard from them again regarding that year's taxation.

			House or apartment? 
I wouldn't do more than 80% financing - whatever your financial means may be at the moment and however low the interest rates are. 
Even if your income puts you in the top 1% earners in Switzerland.   
Not sure if property at prime locations is still a good investment - prices have plateaued, if I'm not mistaken.   
In your situation, I'd just put in a ""saving-year"" and see how far you can get.   
How much do you save per year now and how much do you think you can save?   
Given your cash-influx, you should have 500k in cash by next summer, easily. 
That should afford you a nicer property - but be aware that the 80% financing rule does not generally apply to higher-end objects (ISTR above 1.5 million).     
A lot of real estate is currently still being built (with a net influx of 80k people per year, that's necessary). We will see how that works out once the forex-shock really settles in and companies don't need new employees at the current rate anymore.   
After six months out-of-country, you will lose your B-permit. 
I think you can keep the mortgage (can't find the thread - I think it was discussed here before) 
You rental-income should (well: must) be declared to the Steueramt - I'm sure you're aware of that.

984	Financebankingtaxation	Tax from online shopping	JoshFromOz	2250	14	Location: Winterthur	29.06.2015, 01:19	"    For future purchases of goods worth Fr. 60 or more from abroad, you can register with and have them sent to a packet shop or the German DHL just across the border in Germany. When the parcel arrives, you simply pop over the border into Germany (or Austria, wherever you are) to collect it, paying a small fee, then bring it back yourself (on foot, by train, automobile etc.). This way you don't have to pay Swiss customs anything to import it into Switzerland.    
Because the limit on postal imports into Switzerland/Liechtenstein customs area is so low, there are these packet shops all along the Swiss border in Germany/Austria and they do a lot of trade.    
You can save the money and the hassle of Swiss customs procedures and fees!

986	Financebankingtaxation	Can a Betribung ever effect a non-swiss citizen ?	DJCOOL	990	3	Location: SAN FRANCISCO	02.07.2015, 19:37	"    A person's nationality is totally irrelevant for a Betreibung.    
Anybody can be served with a Betreibung in Switzerland, however, I believe in order for this to actually be served, the person has to be resident in Switzerland at the exact time the Betreibungsamt is asked to serve it, for at that moment in time the Betreibungsamt will verify with the Einwohnerkontrolle of the Gemeinde where the alleged debtor has an address whether the person is currently a resident and at what address exactly.    
If the person is not resident in Switzerland at that moment in time (has notified departure and has physically departed or was never a resident in the first place), I don't see how the Betreibung can be even be created, let alone served.  
I doubt that a Betreibung can be served to someone who is resident in another country.    
A Betreibung must not be served by ordinary post (although I do know of one case where it was), nor must it be delivered by registered letter. In theory it should be delivered exclusively in person. So it wouldn't be sent on to you through the post to your country.    
A Betreibung ought not to have any consequences for other countries such as in the EU, as the process concerns wholly persons residing in Switzerland.    
If the person has already been served with a Betreibung and then departs, this is a different matter, as the procedure is underway, but whether the procedure can then continue without you being present I am not sure.

997	Financebankingtaxation	Debtor being in the Social Service? [resolved]	gonzalocasas	2396	32	Location: Zürich	15.05.2015, 01:59	"    Yes, this is what they did in Zurich Social Service, except they also paid medical insurance directly, not only rent. They have the minimum health insurance, and they have not used it at all, i.e. no extra costs there. When they moved, Fribourg's SS was supposed to take over the payment of the medical insurance, but they delayed the payment claiming that is was still Zurich's duty, which a few months down the line turned out to be false, and they were instructed to pay. But they didn't, because they said that now they want to wait for the Canton to approve the ""Prämienverbilligung"" (reductions) before they pay out. In the meantime, nobody seems to have stopped the process and this is generating debt ever since.        They have nothing of value, and yes, most -if not all- is coming from donations and Brokenhaus stuff. But as I said above, consider the emotional cost to health of having your house searched and seized for valuables.        Yes, it could be an option, but I don't think doing that will stop the debt collection process, because the Betreibungsamt is a department detached from the Social Service one, and from the Gemeinde as well.   
And the Betreibungsamt acts on behalf of a creditor, the medical insurance in this case, so, unless they go clean the windows of the insurance and they are ok with it, I fail to see how that helps to resolve this concrete situation.

			Hello, 
Yes indeed the issue is more about the Bank which doesn't want to give access to US citizens to their Funds.  
In my case, my banker told me I could without any problem buy directly shares from any companies (from the USA, Europe, Switzreland or from any other country).    
However, for Funds he told me I had to make sure they were located in the USA. He told me, that I could check that by looking at the ISIN ( of the security. If it is based in the USA, the first two letters of the ISIN will be ""US"".    
What was less clear, was ETFs. Basically, I have the impression that the ETF needs to be also based in the USA. But I have trouble finding a way to filter out ETFs that are based in the USA.    
For example, I was looking for ETFs on this website:     
But I couldn't find a way to filter ETFs based in the USA. And I have trouble finding the ISIN for each security.   
I know that I am not allowed to buy this one for example:       
Do you know where I could find such ETFs? I don't want to need to buy individual shares, in order to diversify my portfolio. It would be too much work and money (fees)...   
Thanks again!

			Hi FrankZappa and Mirfield, Thanks for your replies   
I have met with tax officers in France and in Basel and I got the answers to my questions. I am transcribing them here in case another person will go through the same situation   
Situation 1, B to C permit: The taxation will change indeed. In Basel, the average tax percentage is 22,25%. When resident are on a B permit, the tax % is calculated based on a average depending on the situation (single, kids or not) and the company withold the money monthly. at the end of the year, they do a correction and eventually will retrieve more, to get close to 22,25%   
Situation 2, married to a french guy living in France. I will declare next year my tax in Basel as married, taking int account my husband fortune when paying the kantonal tax on the fortune (around 0,4% for everything above 150k for a couple) and taking into account my husband salary when paying the federal tax.  
in France, I will also declare my salary, will deduce my expenses in Switzerland (rent, transportation, train tickets). We will pay higher tax, but they will have to deduce the amount I will pay to Basel for my Swiss tax.   
In short terms, a LOT of paper work ahead of us!

			Why not set up another bank account with credit card?  UBS does both Visa and Mastercard and you can get an account in the currency he's likely to use most often.  Pay an initial sum into the account for starters and then simply pay his expenses money back into the account when he gets re-imbursed, keping it topped up as needed.  You can get UBS's Key Club with it so you earn points which can be spent on all sorts of things.

			I think you are muddling the situation. Your AHV / AVS contributions, can be paid voluntarily, and are only contributions for your state pension at 65 years old.    
The child allowance is paid out from an employers' fund. Until recently, if you were not employed you did not get any child allowance.    
One extra point the child allowance fund insists on: is a statement from your ex-wife's (or husband's) social security, (Can also be from a foreign country) that she is not receiving anything from them for the children.    
However if you were correctly employed, you could claim for your children living elsewhere in the EU.    
In your case it might take a year before they make a decision, if it was positive you would get the payments back paid to the day you arrived here, or the child was born here.

1014	Financebankingtaxation	Inheritance Tax for USA resident	applejack	1355	3	Location: USA	08.06.2015, 19:54	"    There probably won't be any tax credit because there is no US tax unless the CH tax resident is also a US citizen or resident AND left an estate over $5,340,000 (2014) or $5,430,000 (2015) or was a nonresident alien and had certain US property. There could be estate or inheritance tax levied by a US state if there is property there, or the decedent was domiciled there. No credit for that, usually, but I could conceive of some state of facts that would create a credit against the Swiss levy.   
I assume the notaire handling the succession will deal with the Geneva tax authorities.    
When there is foreign estate or inheritance tax paid, usually there is a credit for US federal estate tax. On rare occasions there is double taxation usually because the nature of the transfer or the timing of the transfer is incompatible. that normally means trusts, something that scarcely exists in Switzerland and when it does normally involves foreigners.

1015	Financebankingtaxation	Tax accountant for multi-national tax situation	rkweiss	773	1	Location: Bern	14.06.2015, 20:33	"    I would like to be helpful as I work on the three countries' tax issues (and some other countries too) and in fact pay tax to the three countries. But I do not (i.e. not ever) accept paying clients from the Internet. So what I can give you is general advice.   
TurboTax (you may need the business edition) should be sufficient to deal with your US tax issues. It is a very clever program. But you will need to learn how Switzerland, the UK and the USA define certain matters differently. If you come from a US community property state you are halfway there as in CH you need to file joint returns. You can in the USA but you do not say whether you are married so this may be irrelevant. (The UK, England & Wales anyway, have an arcane rule on recognition of community property when that has been established in another country, the technical name is immutability whereas the US rule (which you probably know but don't know the name of) is partial mutability.)   
For CH either your taxes will be a matter of your employer (since you are not a CH citizen as I understand it you can't file a full tax return as an option, and I am assuming you don't have investment interests in CH that would pre-empt that rule).   
For the UK, online form SA-106 is fairly straightforward. But unless you are dual-resident (UK/CH for example) or have rental property in the UK, it isn't obvious that you will need to file there after the year you leave. On the other hand you might want to contrive voluntary Class 2 NICs (if you qualify or can) to get a state pension. And you certainly should contrive 10 years (40 quarters) of Social Security contributions to qualify for Medicare since Part A is then free & gratis.   
Above all, don't panic. While PFIC and FATCA and all the rest are nasty & evil, don't let the nastiness get you down. British tax returns SA-100 are easy (apparently they are going to be abolished but that's another story). You might need a ""mandataire"" in Switzerland. But rely on TurboTax and you should be OK. Just remember to check the box at the foot of Sched B Form 1040 (answer the question about foreign bank accounts) and if you have more than $10,000 abroad, do FinCEN 114 (formerly FBAR).    
It's PFIC (Google it) that is the trap for the unwary. And I understand Swiss pensions don't have the exemption that the UK-US tax treaty offers. But then your lovely Congress keeps enacting statutory overrides to tax treaties: AMT and the 3.8% Obamacare investment tax are just two of them...   
Good luck. I don't check this forum often but you can try to send a PM and maybe I'll figure out how to read it...

			Ok well, double checked and it is as I suspected. The Mutterschaftsversicherung you are paying would appear to be synonymous with the Erbwerbsersatzordnung as it is flows into that pot of money. Everyone who pays AHV also pays into that (along with ALV/IV etc).    
For Zurich you can see the info here:

			Hello all, I am a newbie. I am need of guidance on Social security and AVH. I understand from the Totalization agreement that As I am a US Citizen and I am employed by a Swiss Verein for charity work around the globe and I do not live in CH that I am entitled to pay into AVH. I am under contract for just under 5 years. I am happy to pay into AVH system as I have 42 years paying into USA system.    
Does anyone know how I obtain a AVH number so I can accomplish this?   
I have never had one before and I would rather pay into CH system as I have maxed out USA system.    
I expect to be posted by this NGO in CH in 10 years time after I set up the charity in South America and North America....Any ideas?   
Thanks

			also you need to file Swiss taxes first and then those taxes are deducted from your U.S. returns.  Another reason to file an extension.   
and you need to think about what U.S. state residency you declare.  If you have a choice you should study the options because it can make a difference.

1027	Financebankingtaxation	Transfer UK pension to QROPS in Switzerland after 5 UK tax years	ak76	20650	71	Location: Zurich	19.01.2012, 15:19	"    KB, this is pretty much what I was looking for. 
I will reach my retirement age in about 20 years and I am only talking about a relatively small pension I am going to transfer.  
My 5th full UK tax year will be over in 3 months as I left the UK in Summer 2006, so I will continue to look for a QROPS in Switzerland that does not book the receiveing transfer into a pilar 2 so I could have access to the cash. 
I will probably wait until mid April to have it transferred, by then the QROPS will not have to report it. 
If this does not work I would still transfer it to a QROPS in Switzerland and have it transferred to my employers pension (non QROPS) after April 2012.   
I already transferred a small pension of about GBP 10k a couple of years ago into a pilar 2 QROPS, this had to be done there and then as I would have lost it if not transferred on time.  
There were no fees or taxes charged on this and from April 6th I could move this to my employers pension fund.

Can I expect the V Pay card to work at any major store (Coop, Migros, Manor, SBB) or will I run into problems?

1038	Financebankingtaxation	Returning to the US - transferring or cashing out Swiss pension?	cb07	2665	10	Location: Basel	04.06.2015, 13:37	"    Yes, this is also my understanding. From US tax perspective, contributions into Swiss pension scheme (on the employee side) are not deductible from taxable income and employer contributions also need to be added to taxable income.  
That's why it does not make sense for US tax payers to make voluntary contributions into the 2nd or 3rd pillar here.  
Based on this, it should not be a taxable income in the US any more. However, in Switzerland, at the time of payout, it is taxable income. The tax rate depends on the canton of residence (if remaining in CH) or on the canton of the domicile of the pension fund/foundation (if you are outside the US).  
As a US citizen, you probably won't be able to take advantage of this as you would need to find a fund/foundation that will accept you and only then cash.    
For  , the payout of the Swiss pension fund (or even transfer into the vested benefit account/fund/foundation) can be a taxable event in the case of move to another country. For example, from US perspective, if the transfer happens after the persons enters the US (assuming they will be taxpayer there), the value of the pension funds is considered taxable income from both Federal and State perspective.  
Sometimes it is best to leave CH, go to another country for a week or two (during which the payout happens) and only then enter the US for work. That should at least eliminate the Federal Tax liability (unless the person already spent >10 (not sure about the exact date) days in the US during the same calendar year prior to arrival. State tax law varies .. some states (like NJ) do not consider partial year so it is always taxable income from their perspective.

1041	Financebankingtaxation	Advice on how to get by cheaply on savings accounting for Swiss taxes/insurances	kinosfronimos	773	2	Location: Bern	03.06.2015, 19:32	" 
			
			Enter and register under your Swiss passport. You won't gain anything with the Greek one and might wind up with more hassles/paperwork. It's almost always cheaper and easier to be a local.   Yes, you need to register at the municipality. Not sure on cost. I paid CHF 104 for my first permit, if that helps.   
For insurances, as Medea says start with Comparis. To save money, take the mandatory basic insurance with the highest franchise (deductible). Don't bother with supplemental coverage. Depending on the model you choose (standard, primary doctor, Telmed, etc.) expect to pay 200-300/month based on your age and gender. If you can afford to pay 6 months up front, you might get a discount.   
Share a flat to save on expenses. You'll still want some sort of renter's insurance. If you're not in a remote area, use public transport instead of a car and you'll save the maintenance/insurance on that. Invest in a half-tax card or monthly travel pass for the area you live in. The half-tax card is around 150 annually. Monthly travel passes vary depending on region. Liability insurance isn't that expensive, and is highly recommended.   
If you're just earning odds-and-ends with tutoring, you won't be paying much income tax. You will be paying VAT (8%) on your purchases, so try to be thrifty with spending. Shop at Aldi and Lidl for basics, and if you need to shop at the big three (Coop, Migros, Denner) try to catch things on sale or even marked 50% off at the end of the day.   
Keep in mind - with many things, cheapest isn't always best.   So do your homework. Start with what you need and want, then choose the least expensive option among those that meet your criteria.

1042	Financebankingtaxation	3a account - which bank?	2x2	2954	24	Location: ZH	08.10.2012, 21:30	"    It can be. When you withdraw the funds (and they all have to be withdrawn by the time you retire) you will pay tax on the amount withdrawn. The tax is at a special rate, but starts going up more steeply above 50k CHF (about 7 years contributions). It's therefore worth opening up new 3a accounts each time you get to about 50k and to plan on closing them one per year in the years leading up to retirement. 
Your 3a accounts can be in the same or in different banks.

Anyway, it does seem unlikely that ZIB (an defunct international bank) would be operating your recent employer's pension scheme.

I did this when my first cheque arrived (I bank with the UBS and it was still difficult) I called and they sorted it before the second cheque arrived. They did say it could take up to three months so I was pleasantly surprised.

1052	Financebankingtaxation	Tax rebate from B to C permit	Spike	5438	8	Location: Zurich	14.04.2011, 08:05	"    B is more convenient. With C you will have to actively declare taxes.   
B might actually be beneficial, financially, as the basic premises in the calculation might work out in your favour. Example: You live ""at"" work - so no cost for commuting, no offseting in declaring tax. With B, some average distance is included.   
Whenever C would be (much) better financially, you missed out on going the ""Nachveranlagung"" route.

1053	Financebankingtaxation	tax question - is it worth it??	Michalis' question	1410	16	Location: Athens	26.05.2015, 15:13	" 
			
			Michalis, the way I see it, it is worth the risk if your plan is the following: Come for three months, work hard and prove your value, try to network- -  (cannot emphasize this enough) and get the next contract at a better rate. Underselling yourself for three months (think of it as a test period) is ok. Also, there is point in trying to save money for three months. Just invest your money on networking (drinking beer with colleagues in order to exchange information on your line of business is a very good way of networking)!   
And an advice of global value, do not burn any bridges. Try to leave your current employer on good terms (just in case you need to return there)!

1054	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on rental income in Valais	David Wilkinson	996	4	Location: Les Collons	27.05.2015, 21:15	"    Every property has a ""theoretical"" rental value (Eigenmietwert in german) - you are taxed on this value.   
If the property is rented out the pro-rata eigenmietwert + the actual rental is the amount you are taxed on.   
You can then deduct mortgage interest and upto a maxiumum of 20% of the total rental value (without receipts) as deductions. A greater level of deductions can be made but this needs individual receipts - and is often only done when you are make a major renovation.   
In your case they take the actual rent + 11/12 of the eigenmietwert. Even if you are only there for 1 month a year.    
Tax authorities consider a property should be used - either lived in or rented out.

1064	Financebankingtaxation	Working Remotely in Switzerland (tax / visa issues)	rarohde	2113	1	Location: 8050 Zurich	20.05.2015, 02:52	" 
			
			Getting the permit isn't difficult, your wife just needs to apply for a dependent's permit for you.  It should also include work rights as you will have the same type as she has.  You will need to apply for a Type D visa at the nearest Swiss embassy/consulate to where you live so you can enter Switzerland long term legally.       
The problems may come from the self-employment/taxation sides.  On the self-employment usually as a contractor I think the Swiss authorities would want to see more than one client for you to qualify, otherwise they'll still consider you an employee of your US company.  I suggest you contact the Zurich taxation office to find out whether it would be possible or not as technically what status you are defines who pays what for some insurances/taxes.         
More self-employment info here:           
Tax-wise, yes you will be able to offset/exempt some of the Swiss stuff, but you'll still need to file US tax returns and could owe US tax on top of Swiss ones.  Start researching here:       
At the Swiss end you could also hit problems.  Due to the US's FATCA law US citizens are no longer welcome here at many banks so your choices are limited: UBS, Credit Suisse, PostFinance and the cantonal banks of Basel and Zurich are just about it. You and your wife's accounts will also need to be reported on an annual FBAR form if the aggregate total comes to more than $10,000 at any time of the year.  You and she would also need to sign a W-9 form to allow any Swiss bank to pass your account info on to the IRS.  And more importantly for your business side no Swiss bank is likely to give you a business account I'm afraid.  Nor mortgage or investment accounts.   
Depending on your wife's salary and what you earn you would probably need to file a Swiss return each year if your joint income is more than CHF120,000.  The Swiss don't do individual returns, only filing jointly so both incomes would be taken into account when deciding what tax you'd pay.

1066	Financebankingtaxation	Help with Pension Forms--No permanent new address	dela	545	0	Location: Bern	19.05.2015, 22:01	" 
			
			Hi there,   
I am preparing to leave CH permanently in a couple of months and am in the midst of wading through the pension information on this site. I haven't yet found an answer to the following dilemma and would greatly appreciate any advice:   
I am a dual EU and US citizen, registered in CH under the EU passport. I keep a permanent address in the US but do not have an address nor have I ever lived in the EU country for which I hold a passport. I will be starting a new job in a different EU country 3 months after I leave CH. During the interim I will not have a permanent address anywhere in the EU and will be travelling. My question is: how do I fill out the pension forms with out a permanent address in the country I am moving to? My contract won't even begin until 3 months after I leave CH. If I put my permanent (US) address on the forms, won't they assume I am moving back to the US? Do I tell them I'm moving to an EU country or the US since there will be a gap?    
I'm so confused by all of this.Many thanks in advance for your help.

I will maybe attach a post-it on it that says to use my last name if they are not supposed to provide the value themselves. My guess is that they will use my account number which they will create when they receive this form.

			It depends how you do it - if you specify sending GBP, UBS will charge you an international transfer fee and give you a poor FX rate.   
If you send CHF, they'll charge you the international fee and Barclays will give you a poor interest rate at best, or refuse to take CHF, or charge a fee for foreign currency receipt.   
I'd recommend using xe.com, although it depends on the amount / frequency as to whether it's worth setting up.

			Thanks! I found the Google Play equivalent, and although it hasn't worked yet it's looking promising. Here are the instructions provided by Google for anyone else facing this issue:    
If you're having issues viewing your intended country's Play Store and would like to change your default payment method or update an existing billing address in Google Wallet, please use the following steps:   
1) Sign into your Google Wallet account to manage your payment methods ( )   
2) Delete all of your payment methods from Google Wallet, and only add a card to one with a billing address located inside your desired country   
3) Open the Play Store and navigate to any item available for download   
4) Click to begin a download until you reach the ""Accept and buy"" screen (no need to complete the purchase)   
5) Close the Play Store and clear data for the Google Play Store application (Settings > Apps > Google Play Store > Clear Data) or clear your browser cache   
6) Re-open the Play Store. You should now see the Play Store that matches your default payment instrument's billing country.   
If you haven't yet added a payment method to your account for the first time, please add a card directly from the Play Store with a billing address that matches your intended country location. Then, follow steps 3 through 6 to show your intended country's Play Store.

			jaudi, 
Thanks for clarifying for others. The value decided on by the executers for probate was, we thought, just a little bit high - given the UK market for single family houses. But we agreed, and it was accepted by the probate authorities. When the house went on the market we actually had a bidding war going on with two couples determined to succeed, so the final sale price is higher than even the executers expected.    
Good news that the Swiss won't assess CGT on the final sale of non-Swiss property. We're a little uncertain about in the UK, as two siblings - one UK resident and one Swiss resident, will achieve the gain.

			The ten year rule has somewhat lost its significance following the UK pension changes in April.   
Those over 55 who are looking to liberate 100% of the monies from their UK pension can do so immediately, albeit with the deduction of UK tax at source. (This may then be reclaimable under the UK-Swiss DTA).   
A more attractive option might be to transfer to a Maltese QROPS and withdraw all the monies under their forthcoming flexible rules. Under such an arrangement, the withdrawal is paid without deduction of tax to residents of Switzerland (on the understanding that the investor will declare it locally).

			it depends on the scheme you have with AxA or others. If it is the bare minimum I expect that this is not possible. Talk with them to have better possibilities meaning upgrading your 2nd pillar.    
If you are paying a bonus you may have an internal policy saying this bonus will not be subjected to 2nd pillar. not sure this is what you are looking for.    
The employee may pay more in to the 2nd pillar if the scheme allows it as there may be a maximum. As said depends on the scheme.

I'm new to Switzerland and I have been browsing this forum for a few month now and I like it very much. Helpful informations on many topics.   
I was trying to find answers to my question in Google and from my bank back home and I read quite a bit on the topic, but couldn't find information I need. 
I hope you can help me. 
I am an EU Citizen (Austria) and live and work in Switzerland now. I have saved some money from my work back in Austria which is invested in some ETFs and some money is on a bank-account in an Austrian bank. I pay KEST (25% on created income) there.  
My question is how do I proceed from now on, so I dont have to pay taxes twice. Is it possible for me to not pay the KEST in Austria? Or do I just pay the KEST in Austria and not pay taxes for the money in Switzerland? Or will I have to pay both?   
Thank you in advance for some information on this topic, any help and links to that topic is apreciated

			Wrong, you can't send CHF payments via SEPA, as SEPA payment is specific to EUR payments only and within Europe. However, you can send EUR payments from Switzerland as a SEPA payment to another EU country as Switzerland is signed up to this Payment Directive although it's not in EU.   
All international transfers are done via SWIFT but SEPA payment instructions are sent within the SWIFT messaging instruction.   
Think of SWIFT as a big ship and SEPA is a specially designed container, USD transfers will be differently designed container.   
Hope this helps.

When I finally found her, she immediately sorted out all the options I had heard about  and steered me in the right direction, clearly explaining why she recommended filing in a certain manner. And I find their prices are quite reasonable.   
I highly doubt most CPAs in America would have much of a clue how to correctly fill out a 5471, or even the conditions under which it is required. At least the ones I spoke with didn't. The penalties for doing it wrong are daunting.

			I wonder how many trolls have harassed their target person abroad by sending a styrofoam brick (or some other worthless product) and labelling it on the FedEx airwaybill as a $1,000 treasure.   
Some years ago I subscribed to a US Lexis CD-ROM service and the first CD arrived with a customs invoice based on the $1,000 annual subscription fee. FedEx went ballistic when I refused the parcel but in the end Lexis told me not to worry: they apparently paid the bill even though the goods were returned, and they re-shipped the first and then sent the subsequent CD-ROMs by mail marked as CD-ROM data hosts without value.   
Today of course data services are all online, albeit behind a paywall. But I remember from a university course I took that electricity transmission and imports and transit by pipeline are subject to customs clearance. I know this is a big issue for consumer sales now: ebooks are subject to VAT in Europe whether or not printed books are.

iii)  point 1.7 in your contract. This is called 2nd pillar ""2a"",  defined by  BVG, maximum insured salary is 84'600 less 24'675 = 59'925.- 
This  salary portion is called ""koordinierter Lohn""(KL). Depending on  the  employees age a certain percentage (increases are laddered) of the  KL  must be paid into 2a, whereby the employer must pay at least as much  as  the employee - thus 50-100% of all payments into 2a are shouldered  by the  employer.   
iv)  point 1.8 in your contract. Income above BVG maximum is called  ""überobligatorischer Lohn"", 2nd  pillar ""2b"". I may be wrong, but I  think savings for this part of the  salary are voluntary and fall under  ordinary insurance  laws, this would also mean that the employer is free  to also pay or not.   
Note that 84'600 = 3 * 28'200. This is referred to by ""das Dreifache"" in 1.7 as well as by ""300%"" in point 1.8    
Your  contract looks ok to me. Some employers (large ones mostly) have a  separate  ""Pensionskassenreglement"" wherein they define details,  especially if they provide additional benefits.   
The ""Mindestzins"" defined by the Bundesrat covers pillar 2a only.

The tax rules of the country your living in at the time you take the pension may well require further tax, just because they may not today does not mean they won't in the future.

But it seems very stupid since you end up paying more.

1092	Financebankingtaxation	How to do your tax return in Vaud	naza	14024	34	Location: Lausanne	13.09.2010, 13:43	" 
			
			Hi,   
I see a lot of people asking about Tax Advisors mostly to do their tax returns. I would like to take a different approach:   
Is there someone who would be willing to write up small explanation of how to do tax returns in VD? Or is there someone who could perhaps show/teach some of us how to do it (possibly even charging a fee)?   
I did see Richard wrote quite a compreehensive guide for canton ZH but for VD I suppose its different and I don't understand German          
I've tried using the VaudTax software but to be honest I am not sure I am doing it correctly and may be missing some important information.   
So, is there anybody out there willing to do this? Would others be willing to participate?   
thanks

			If you are an independent there is of course no limit. But if you are an employee of a company that pays your contributions to a pension plan, insurance and unemployment then there could be an issue if you work more than a defined limit of hours/week. The reasons:   
 - you have paid vacation during which you are not supposed to work; vacation is paid by company so that you come back fit again for optimal productivity. 
- the more hours/week you work, the higher are the chances that you'll get sick or a work accident; so here the insurances put a pressure on your employer to enforce the limit of working hours/week.

If it makes a difference, her current employer is a Canadian company registered to do business in the UK and she is paid under their PAYE system with UK tax and National Insurance contributions withheld. I think (but don't know for sure) there is an allowance of a few months before she has to switch to the Swiss systems. The Canadian company is my client. It will surprise nobody that the firm doesn't want to be considered doing business in Switzerland, having a permanent establishment there, or registering there for anything.

			Re upgradeable L permit and the 1st June EU citizen being allowed to get a B permit, you still have to wait for your current permit to expire before they will allow you to change permit status.     
My husband arrived here in Jan 2006 for a permanent job but was given a L permit.  We have been told that it was a luck of the draw as to what permit you got regardless of a permanent job situation or a contract one. The children and I have our permits dated from his entry to Switzerland, even though we turned up later.   
We have been having the same problem with getting tax back at the border. The guards allowed it for so long and now say they won't stamp the receipts as we have an L permit.  We cannot change our permits now, so say the Migration dept and have to wait until Jan 2008 when the current permits expire, then we will get the supposed wonderful B permit.   
Actually may go off and make a phone call again and see if this has changed.

			I had an audit of my GmbH recently for the first two years of operation.  I did it all myself. 
Actually it was quite painless. The guy sat in a corner on his own going through the papers. At the end he had some questions, the ones I could not answer I sent to my bookkeeper who replied to them a few days later.   
Basically it was OK, some raising of eyebrows over some of my expenses but nothing so serious that I had to pay extra tax or a fine or involve the bookkeeper.   
The guy said they like to do this with new businesses to check that decent records are being kept, it is more advisory than a proper audit.   
Basically took less than an hour, it is a nice day out for the taxman.

-I don't really see where the 4%-8% difference comes from. If it's really the case that you can't get more than 4% in your 3a, then presumably any balanced portfolio would have some lower yielding assets in it in any case, so just use your 3a for that part of your portfolio.   
-Around 30% to 40% of your income on the SMI return is likely to be dividends in the long term, which are subject to income tax, which is compounded, on your non-3a investment.   
-Withdrawals of your 3a investment are taxed at only around 4% in canton Zurich for a 100k withdrawal regardless of your tax bracket, and you can do it in stages.

			I'd think that, sadly, the bank is probably within it's legal rights, in that the fine print of big companies often says, in effect, that they may change their terms and conditions unilaterally, at any point.  And they have informed you correctly.   
Having said that, I can certainly understand that you're not happy about it!  I wouldn't be, either.   
Whether or not the landlord has any obligation to ameliorate the situation?  I don't know, but I'd recommend: 
a) talking to your neighbours who rent from the same landlord and asking them if they already have come up with alternative arrangements 
b) making a few enquiries with other banks, as to their charges for the same sort of account 
c) asking your landlord (perhaps together with your neighbours, and definitely in writing) to work with you to transfer the deposit to bank X or bank Y that you've already found out about (= you save the landlord the work).

1117	Financebankingtaxation	Declare worldwide income - Swiss tax form	Elmienb	678	0	Location: Zug/Baar	23.04.2015, 11:14	" 
			
			Silly question, for which I cannot find the answer online.       
We moved to Switzerland on a B permit during the year, and will be tax residents (based on the criteria). This means we have to declare worldwide income. As we are residents for part of the year online, the tax rate, thresholds etc. are all calculated on annualised Swiss income (as I understand). But what is not clear to me (and I could not find the answer online) is whether we have to also declare the salary income we earned in the months prior to becoming a Swiss tax resident.       
If so, where (in which section of the return) do we declare it? As I understand you can also claim back taxes paid on foreign income where a Double Tax Agreement exists (which it does), so how can we claim back the taxes withheld on that income (obviously only relevant if we will get taxed on the income in the first place)?   
Thank you in advance for help regarding this!

			Hi Morphopera!   
It is never too late to start investing in a Swiss pension! As a self employed, it's possible that you don't have an occupational pension plan (2nd pillar). But you do have the mandatory first pillar which is AVS/AI and unemployment insurance.   
You can still invest in a private pension plan which is the 3rd pillar (although you might not have the 2nd pillar)! Self-employed persons without an occupational pension plan can pay in up to 20 % of their annual earned income, but a maximum of CHF 33'840.    
You can also choose between the   one. With the first one, you have tax deductible contributions but you cannot take your savings out any time you like. The second one has fewer tax advantages but there are also less restrictions!   
You can have a look on this website that provides useful information and advice about pensions plans and Swiss life in general:    
If you need an english speaking advisor, a specialised agency like Creditloan can offer you a free analyse of your financial situation if order to find you a third pillar plan that is adapted to you!    
I hope I could help answering your question! I wish you the best with your future plans! Kind regards.

			Ok, the main Credit Suisse branch on Rue Pichard in Lausanne has a coin machine.  It credits your account.  As you walk in the lobby, it is the furthest one on the right.  It accepts coins in bulk, unsorted.     
It spits back out any errant euros as well as any silver coins.  I got back a 1969 1/2 franc.  Wasn't there another thread on these solid silver coins?

			Just wondering how unique and good an idea it can be if you're not willing to risk your daytime job for it? Not sure why you would expect others to commit to an idea if you're not going to put yourself 100% behind the cause.   
If it's low revenue but fun, then run it like a hobby, evenings and weekends.   
I could bore you to death with all the hurdles, but if you're truly convinced that you have a great idea, then go for it. Entrepreneurial spirit is often more important than just the product itself.

If that is accurate then it makes sense. And I'm not saying it's not, but the supervisor at my local taxation office didn't mention that one has to fullfill all those requirements. He kinda let it hanging.    
I hope it's like this then. Living with an average-low salary in Switzerland and having to pay 3000 euro per year in Greece just because, would be devastating.

As you mentioned, the 30 day period in a 31 day month is always 31 days. 
In February however, it is 29 days (a virtual day is counted for leap years). 
In October, it is 32 days because the month is longer because of the daylight savings change. 
In April and May, it is only 27 days because of the many public holidays which gives people more time to pay their bills.

1133	Financebankingtaxation	Tax Consultant - Kanton Schwyz	philh	3074	7	Location: Altendorf SZ	30.01.2011, 19:22	"       
Honestly, the only tax 'consultant' we have used - or needed - to do our Swiss taxes have been the helpful folks at the Schwyzer Steueramt.   
While I wouldn't dream of attempting my US taxes on my own, for those we need the professionals, although our Swiss taxes are somewhat complicated the process is still simple enough to handle on our own. When we have questions we call the Steueramt - our declaration has been reviewed by the same gentleman for some years now and his advise has been good.    
'Steuerparadis Schwyz' doesn't only refer to the (soon-to-be-not-so) low taxes, but in my book also to the helpfulness of the folks in cantonal government.   
So as a start, don't hesitate to call the folks at the Steueramt if you find you have questions.

1135	Financebankingtaxation	How do I take money out of my PayPal account?	Grid	2599	3	Location: Esslingen	03.04.2015, 06:43	" 
			
			Thanks for the info, guys. I figured out the whole thing pretty much straight after I'd made my post. I was just confused because you can't use hyphens on the PayPal website, which is why I went and typed in my card number, rather than my account number, which has two hyphens in it.   
Basically, all I had to do was remove the hyphens from the number next to ""ACCOUNT:"" which you can find on the back of your card, put 9000 as the BC number, because the bank I use is PostFinance, and it worked. It took a few days -hence my delayed reply- but everything's in order now. Whatever money I don't spend can be put right back into my bank account.   
Might as well post the details for others who may be as clueless about it as I was.   "	Posts: 5	Join Date: Mar 2015	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 7 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

I do acknowledge that most comments are based on experiences with other financial advisors, but it strikes me that there are no clients of WWB here. I would think that if this is a renowned institution targeting expats, there would be some clients on this forum willing to share their true experiences with this particular broker.    
I will show the comments to my friend, tell her to be cautious but in the end it is entirely up to her.

1141	Financebankingtaxation	Geneva accountants? Q on moving to Switzerland after selling a company (American).	khizr	579	0	Location: Geneva	06.04.2015, 15:03	" 
			
			Hi everyone,   
My wife got into a phd program in Geneva, and we are looking to move there end of this year! (We are American so dealing with all the tax implications)   
Does anyone have some recommendations for accountant/tax experts in Geneva they like?   
 I am needing to verify some info I received, and given the importance I want at least two more people to verify what I've been told.    
I am selling a business I've owned for 6+ years right now, prior to moving down there end of September and trying to verify what I've been told so far. I've had one accountant in Geneva tell me that as long as the sell is made before I move to Switzerland, I wouldn't pay any taxes to Switzerland. That seemed odd given the way the tax year works so I was trying to verify that.    
That accountant also said that there are no capital gains in Switzerland so I wouldn't pay anything on the sale of that business' shares. But some online materials seem to question that.    
I am wanting to super verify this as it is a large sum of money I've worked very hard for.    
Thanks!

Take Apple, for instance. It's fortunes were very dependent on the charismatic leadership of one person, Steve Jobs. What future would Apple have had if if he succumbed to illness a bit earlier or decided to immerse himself in Zen Buddhism ?

			Hi everybody,   
I currently work in Basel Stadt and live in Basel Land, but I am considering moving to France and buying property there.   
I got some very useful high level advice sifting through the forum, but I reckon the anwer lies in the ""it depends"" zone and eventually calls for some professional advice.   
Ideally, I would need a simulation to be carried out, comparing Swiss and French scenario side by side, including taxes (income, wealth, etc), social security, health insurance, in order to estimate the bottom line yearly net available income.   
Also evaluating other financial consequencies of switching to France would be appreciated. 
(E.g. I got that unemployment benefits might be different)   
Do you happen to know a french, english speaking tax consultant I can hire to get this done?   
Maybe some of you already went through the same process..or could redirect me to a post I missed..   
Thanks in advance,   
A.

			You are on the right track but not fully there yet.  As for a) yes that is a start.  But employer contributions also have to be included as income and tax paid, as the above post indicates.  Thus each year employer contributions have to be added to form 1040 and tax paid.   
Further, the 8938 and FBAR are just reporting of financial accounts, not for taxing.  So your total interest in your second pillar, not employer contributions, is to be reported on 8938.   
8938 is for FATCA reporting by individuals.  Foreign banks also have FATCA reporting.  Pillar 1 is exempt.  Pillars 2 and 3 no.   
If you also have pillar 3, taxation gets even more complidated.      "	Posts: 676	Join Date: Oct 2014	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 16 Times in 11 Posts	Thanked 270 Times in 176 Posts	considered knowledgeable

Also they will or should do your FBar filings. Your pension wont get declared in the FBars either. That goes on the 8938 form.

Does anyone else here with a B permit (or other permit that has you taxed at the source) work for an employer who doesn't do the taxation for them?    
I work for an embassy, but am   a diplomat, just a local employee of an international employer who is exempt from withholding my tax for me. The same goes for AHV (social security), but I had no problem registering and paying for that myself. The tax office, however, has no idea what to do with my case, and I am scared of a big bill and penalty next year.   
If anyone knows anything about how to proceed here, I would be extremely appreciative. Thank you so much!

There must be some sort of fee involved in transferring CHF into the euro account in the first place surely?   
If we were shopping or making euro payments on a weekly basis maybe it would be a different story.

			Generally yes, you need to pay taxes if you live in CH.    
For a Phd student its a bit different sometimes if you come on a scholarship / stipend from your home country then you have two cases. If the external source pays you directly or sends the money to your university/company to pay you and your lab expenses. In the second case I'm pretty sure taxes would be deducted before you receive the salary, for the first case you need to get the details from the finance department of your swiss employer or tax office in your city canton.

1172	Financebankingtaxation	Declaration of foreign real estate -- risk?	belgian beer lover	2798	22	Location: Vaud	07.03.2015, 23:37	"    Actually it's the complete opposite of communism.   
You could say its a soirt of communist system that the state imposes a currency. If instead you chose to barter or trade in some other way without currency, that should be no reason to evade taxes. Hence the concept of natural income.   
I was once explained it as follows:   
Suppose you own a house, and rent it out to a tenant, and your tenant owns an identical house next door and rents it to you, you both have taxable income, right? Now you decide to save taxes by swapping houses - or even by not sawpping houses but agreeing that you can both live rent free. You haven't gained anything tangible and you haven't lost anything tangible, so it's injust that you should pay lower taxes over this accounting formality.      Use the online electronic assistant. It guides you through all these steps.      Not a good idea.   
Actually talking to the taxman would have cost you less sweat and blood and given you more tangible and actionable feedback than starting a thread on EF. Being tired is no valid reason to fill in your tax form incorrectly.

			CGT is payable on the gain since some previously defined value and timepoint.  Normally that would be the purchase value and purchase date.  However, sometimes that changes e.g. inherited assets, the original value and date are no longer relevant, but the value at date of death becomes relevant.  It may be as you were absent > 5 years, you get to re-base your CGT as of the date of return (similar to if you sold and repurchased).  But I don't know.

between ZH and AG it works. I do not know whether canton A or B accepts it. Call your local taxman, I am sure he can help for this question. 
And don't worry. Your canton will calculate all taxes. Canton B needs to know your taxable income to correctly calculate the tax for the appartment. You will not be taxed twice.

			SEPA needs   of the following:   If all of the above is OK, the transaction may only cost the same amount as another transaction in the same setup would cost domestically. I.e. if an EUR-transaction from your Swiss EUR-account to another Swiss EUR-account would be free, it has to be free. If the domestic transaction is priced at ""x"", the bank can charge you ""x"", where ""x"" can be as much as they feel like.     
For recurring transactions from Switzerland to Germany (or indeed other places abroad), have you looked into currencyfair.com / transferwise.com ? (PM me for referral links, if you like those   .)

- Does anyone know a good & cheap tax advisor?

1189	Financebankingtaxation	wedding abroad and local church	giff	888	7	Location: zh	11.03.2015, 16:57	"    Paying the taxes does not matter at all.  But having no contact with your local church will be a problem - you need to get what are called 'letters of freedom' from your local parish priest say he knows of no reason why you can not be married in the Catholic church.  And there is the thing, if he does not know you, he can't give you the required letter at best all he can say is that he has no record of you marrying in his church and that may not be enough for the bishop in who's dioceses you wish to get married.      
But that said, a bishop is always prince in his own dioceses and can override all requirements if he so wishes.  So I'd say your best bet is to try and talk with your local priest here and see what his position on the matter is.  Some priests tend to be very flexible about these things and are able to produce the required authorisation from their bishop.  And if a Swiss bishop issues such an authorisation, then no priest in Italy is going to challenge it.        This must be very dated  because even 20+ years ago when I got married in the Catholic church we were not even asked such questions! And to cap it all we even had a muslim man as a godfather to one of our children.

I would not bother asking a broker, they will just tell you what is hot today, had they picked the stock 3 months before when it was out of favour that would be 1 thing. Of course they have no idea what will happen, if they did they would not have to work for a living.   
FWIW   is where I would put any spare money, I have mentioned it several times over the last couple of years but most of the experts disagree, it's beaten most active funds. Of course the class of stocks being bought have consistently outperformed everything else over the last 50 years, simple concept.

			The OP will be taxed at source as long as the permit is L or B.  
Only Swiss citizens or C-permit holders do not pay withholding tax.    
A different question is whether (besides paying tax at source) he must file a tax return or not. And that depends on income level for those who pay tax at source. As stated by others, the cut-off is 120K annual income (gross). From 120K above, tax return is mandatory for those who pay tax at source.  
Below that level, it is not required to file a tax return or even not possible in some case.

That's what I heard today from the tax administration. Well, quite simple approach although not explained in any documentation.     
Another thing I have learned is that I have to be prepared to do the full tax form next year. For single person if you have more than 56k money/welfare you have to switch to full tax. Funny thing is that you have to write to the tax office division 'impot a la source' that you have more than 56k and they will move you to the other tax office.

If you have just one job, a couple of local bank accounts and nothing overseas, have no spouse or children, then it is easy. So easy you can use the simplified forms. Heck, for a beer or two I'd come around and show you!   
If you have overseas property, have family, dependent children or others, make zillions of donations, have health problems that cost a fortune, hold loads of shares in companies all around the world, earn pension money, won the lottery, then it all gets more involved.... because you have to document what your situation is.

			Thought about this last night.    
FINMA will bring criminal charges. 
FINMA will lightly fine them; something fitting for the worst breach in the what Switzerland's 180 year history; although ok lets be honest swiss banking secrecy has only been around for 100 years. 
FINMA may even revoke their private banking banking license if they find them really negligent, can't comment on their controls; although I would be very surprised if FINMA don't come back with findings on a lack of due diligence. 
FINMA may also revoke their licence if too many criminals are dug up in their list of 24K customers...   
HSBC PB itself may cease to trade after getting the mother of all fines  
HSBC PB itself may also cease to trade after it loses 50% of its customers, they admitted losing 25% of the customer base; so assuming most of them leave; a good number of others will too. 
HSBC may see a departure of a number of staff prior to any publication of findings; some to escape prosecution, some to jump out of a sink ship.   
The EURO mole will disappear as did his LGT colleague to live a new life. 
The EURO tax authorities will have a field day; find, fine and maybe even jail some tax dodgers.   
One or more HSBC customers may sue HSBC PB for breach of contract as a LGT one did for damages...   
Any other thoughts, anybody...

1205	Financebankingtaxation	Taxes if lived in Germany but worked in Switzerland?	makaki	676	0	Location: Germany	05.03.2015, 19:12	" 
			
			Hi guys,   
i will try to make it short. So I will be working in Switzerland (at the border) and live in Germany. Now my question, since I have to pay my taxes to Germany, how the taxes are going to be calculated? Are they going to simply convert my monthly salary into Euros and then use the normal taxes calculations (eg  ) or are there different calculations for this case? 
Also is Switzerland going to deduce taxes as well?! 
I'm just wondering to know how much I will save at the end.

1207	Financebankingtaxation	Deferring Real Estate Tax	astrolake	579	0	Location: Zurich	04.03.2015, 12:53	" 
			
			I own my apartment in Zurich, but family reasons will have me moving to Goldau.  I've owned for 15 years, so the gains tax will be 28%.  It drops a lot in the next 5 years, going to 20% after 20 years.   
So, my questions are:   
1) Is the gains tax on real estate for any use?  If I rent it out for 5 years, will 
    I pay then pay tax due after 20 years?  (That seems like a no-brainer, but 
    I've been surprised here too often.)   
2) If I sell my Zurich apartment and buy in Goldau, I see that I get to ""defer        
    the gain"".  Let's suppose I hold the place in Goldau for 5 years.  Will I then  
    pay the 20 year rate on both?  The 15 year rate in Zurich and the 5 year rate  
    in Goldau?  Some other strange thing?   
Thanks for your help!

1208	Financebankingtaxation	Taxes for a professor working 2 hours a week	carloilsuperbo	542	0	Location: Geneva	04.03.2015, 11:54	" 
			
			Hello everyone,   
Just a simple question regarding taxes for a diplomat's husband (so a Ci working permit). I don't have a full time job but I occasionally give classes. I'm currently giving 2 hours of classes a week at a university in Geneva. I've just received my first payment and noticed that they only retained 6.25% as a ""deduction pour non independant"". However, the school did not retain any taxes as ""deduction pour impots a la source"". Is this correct? They tell me that because I only work 2 hours per week they do not have to retain any taxes at the source...   
At a previous school that I worked for in Gland they did retain taxes at the source, which makes me think that probably my new school is doing something wrong. I was wondering if someone could give me some guidance here. I guess what  I do not want to do is to have to declare taxes eventually, I just cannot afford to pay for accountant to do that on such little earnings.    
Thanks!

			Alpine greetings!   
I am a frontalier living in France and working in Geneva. I do not qualify for a quasi-resident status in Geneva, as I do not meet the 90% of income rule, so was wondering if I could reduce the tax bill by claiming back my parking fares and occasional bus trips withing Geneva? Can those be added to our deductible expenses?   
Many thanks in advance!

Clothing, equipment hire/purchase, lift passes etc etc all add up for a family.   
Not sure whether your general clothing allowance is enough. Winter boots etc for growing kids can wipe out 100 CHF in one hit.

			Hi Pam863!   
Welcome to english forum.   
The credited amount that you could be granted will depend on your  . According to the Swiss law, you should be able to reimburse your loan on a 36 months reimbursement duration, just with your personal surplus.   
This means that if you can afford monthly payments of 900-1000 CHF, you could get a 30'000-35'000 CHF credited amount rather than 40'000CHF. But of course you can then choose to reimburse this loan on a 3, 4, 5 or 6 years duration!   
The best solution is always to get some more information and advice from experts. I would suggest you to have a look here to know more about your personal loan options and get a free and non binding analyse.    
I hope I helped answering your question! Have a good day!

			Yet another tax thread.   
My Swiss friend who lives in Vaud asked me if I know any tax advisor to help with filing taxes. 
Her income is under 100K, but she spent a lot of her salary on training/education for her profession (CAS, MAS, training, supervision, etc) and I wonder what is the best way to deduct those from the taxable income. 
Anyway, do you think a tax advisor is worthy in this case, and usually how much does the service cost? 
Any info or thought is appreciated. Thanks

Customs value USD 50.--, i doubt very much if customs will be too interested in it, even if they open the packet as soon as they see what it is.   
Lets be honest a second hand wedding dress is probably not worth any more in monetary value, in sentimental value this is different but then no amount of money will replace it anyway so it's a mute point.   
If you're really that paranoic about it getting lost, then the only solution is to go fetch it yourself or pay somebody to bring it over in hand luggage.

1230	Financebankingtaxation	CH pension payout to a non-US citizen taxed in the US?	jcvidal	1236	5	Location: Zurich	18.02.2015, 12:30	" 
			
			Disclaimer: I am not a personal income tax expert. However, I am a US taxpayer.    
Assuming you move to the US during fiscal year 2015, and we are talking about the 2015 U.S. tax return (which you will file in 2016) - the first thing you need to determine is whether you are a resident or non-resident alien   for the year. Be careful, because the definition of resident alien for immigration purposes (green card) is not the same as the definition of resident alien for tax purposes. For example, you could be a non-resident alien (for example H1-B visa holder) for immigration purposes, but a resident alien for tax purposes.   
For tax purposes, you are a resident alien if you meet certain criteria, such as the ""green card test"" and the ""substantial presence test"" for the fiscal year. Assuming you meet those criteria, the tax treatment is the same as if you were a US citizen or green card holder - i.e. your 2015 worldwide income is subject to US income tax.     
If you are a non-resident alien for tax purposes (i.e. you do not meet the criteria as above), you pay US tax on the amount of your effectively connected income for 2015.    
The IRS website explains all these cases, criteria, definitions, etc.    
Personal advice: aside from reading the IRS website, now is the time to talk to a professional about your situation (not after you have already moved to the US), and potentially consider the right timing of your move to the US in the 2015 fiscal year vis-a-vis the potential Swiss income that you might have in the fiscal year. I hope this helps a little bit!

The above quote is now even more true because in contrast to the last couple of years, the SNB can actually run its own monetary policy and doesn't have to follow the ECB policy too closely.   
In the past, those who went libor were on the right track.   
Rates were supposed to go down due to the recently introduced negative interest, but this didn't really happen on a broad scale because banks claim they don't earn much (or nothing) on the current rates already...

1245	Financebankingtaxation	BVG for Self employed/GmbH	pasty	735	0	Location: Zürich	11.02.2015, 17:02	" 
			
			Apologies if this has already been done, I can't find the thread that covers it.   
The basic concept of BVG is clear to me. A percentage, based on a rolling scale by age, of your gross salary, which can consist of a compulsory, and voluntary element, and on the circa 80K threshold. I also understand that the setting up of the associated Freizugikeitskonto is free. 
However, I did read somewhere that there are certain insurance and possibly other costs, specifically BVG related, rather than those to cover me working on an employers site, that I have to pay.   
If I work through someones GmbH as an umbrella company, and get paid a salary of say 126K (the Arbeitslossenkasse , but exceeding the compulsory BVG threshold) what costs would I expect to pay and for what specifically? NB. All the costs would come out of my total gross income, the GmbH, I just pay them a fee for providing the service.   
Can someone point me to the appropriate thread?

			I am not an expert on this but normally credit card companies take a bit chunk extra on the exchange rate (can be up to 3,5%) so the official daily rate will differ substantially to what you were charged by the credit card company.

			How's your German? Perhaps you'll find this a little more helpful:       
Input your   income under ""Steuerbares einkommen"". Put the same figure for ""Bund"" as for ""Kanton"" (it'll be close enough; any differences are due to tax deductions available from the federal government and from the canton).   
Guesstimate your worldwide wealth and input that (in CHF, of course) under ""Vermögen"". Note, a good accountant/Treuhand can make a lot of your non-cash assets ""disappear"" or at least reduce for wealth tax purposes.   
The output is your income tax assuming no deductions. What you actually pay will be less, depending on how many supercars and magnums of champagne you can deduct.

That situation is a bit trickier, and to be honest I'm not the best person to ask... You could find a brokerage here in Switzerland to carry out the trades and then manage it from abroad, but not sure how that works without a CH address etc.. but it's not something I've personally done.   
I'd say contact a few brokers and see what they can offer for your situation

			I found myself in exactly the same situation. I opened local accounts in countries of interest. In the UK with Lloyds, in Australia with HSBC. They´re free and only ""really"" cost a line in the yearly Swiss tax-declaration.   
Admitted, it´s a hassle to keep them all up and running and managing the codes, pins and credit cards for all the different internet-banking strategies they use. However, I feel it´s worth it, as ""native"" accounts in the local currency usually pay the highest interest, and also like this I can use the associated (free) debit-cards locally. That´s the only way I found to actually ""use"" the currencyfair-rates for local transactions.   
By the way: A currencyfair-manager that I once chatted with over the phone suggested that they want to establish a credit card, with allows using the balances you have with currencyfair in their respective local currency. However, since that was ~2 years ago and nothing happened since, I guess they ran into problems making this a reality. I shall hope it´ll still happen one day.

1263	Financebankingtaxation	Credit history and cars on PCP	marv	656	0	Location: Lausanne, VD	02.02.2015, 18:51	" 
			
			Good day to you all. This is my first post on the forum so I hope I have done everything correctly.   
I know there are some posts on this already however they are all from a number of years ago and as we know, things change quite quickly in some aspects. 
I moved from the UK to Switzerland back in August and thoroughly enjoy it here. I am now looking to get a car and have a few questions about it. I wonder if anyone has done it recently?   
A bit about my circumstances first as this may be relevant: 
- I am here on a B permit since end of August 2014. 
- I have a permanent work contract with a Swiss company. 
- I have an account with UBS and also a prepaid credit card. 
- I have mobile phone contracts. 
- I am applying for a credit card (which my bank offered me a while ago but I declined) which I now think will be good for building a credit history if I pay it off in full each month.   
I am looking for a new car from a mainstream dealership on what would be described in the UK as a PCP finance agreement. It is one where you get a balloon figure at the end to offset costs and I believe from other posts on the forum that the Swiss call this leasing.   
My questions are: 
- How easy is it to get finance agreements from mainstream dealerships if you are on a B permit? 
- Will the fact I have phone contracts (2) and a prepaid credit card help my credit history (they are in good order) or would I need a proper credit card as well?   
Some old threads say it is quite easy and all you need is a B permit and a copy of work contract and bank statements etc but these were some time ago. I wonder if it is the same now?   
Many thanks in advance and best wishes to you all.

			Hi.    
Please can someone assist with my query below    
I am a foreign national and work in Fribourg. I currently have my tax deducted monthly by my employer. I live in Geneva and commute each day to work by train.   
I received my annual tax declaration form from the Geneva tax authority and I would like to know:   
1. As a foreigner, can I deduct my travel costs for tax purposes?   
2. If I submit my travel costs as a deduction, will I no longer be ""taxed at source"" and now taxed as an ordinary resident on all my assets? (So my tax status will be changed as if I were resident)   
3. As an unmarried person, is the tax rate lower when ""taxed at source"" or when taxed as an ""ordinary resident"" in Geneva? Which is more beneficial?   
Any guidance with this information will be greatly appreciated!   
Thanks!

			Just a quick warning. When looking over my credit card statement this week I noticed a number of iTunes transactions which I couldn't remember making. I then looked at the costs and they ran 100 chf, 100 chf, 48 chf... all in all over 750 chuffs has been rinsed off my card. I cross checked it with my iTunes account and there was no notification or record of anything being bought.    
I've cancelled the card and both iTunes and the credit card company are investigating so I expect to get a full refund. Just thought I'd warn you in case any of you are like me and don't normally pay that much attention to your credit card statement.    
A quick Google has shown this has happened to others and every case I read about was refunded in full. I just wonder if you were going to do some credit card fraud, why on earth would you use it to buy stuff of iTunes?!

			If you're from Norway, have someone from Norway pay your Norwegian cash into your account up there, and then transfer using currencyfair.com   
Changing cash is a guarantee to get the worst possible rate. After all someone has to deal with the cash for you, and they charge royal fees to do just that.   
Option B: try to find someone who wants to travel to Norway, and exchange cash with this person at the mean rate. This cuts out the middle man and guarantees the best rate for both of yee.   
Option C: Pay the fee @ SBB.

I think it would be reasonable to login just with your credentials (which does include a password), which is safe enough to access information such as your balance and movements - and only when doing transfers or other operations like that would you be required to increase the authentication through the card.   
I don't know how it is with UBS but I think they don't require a card reader device?

I am married to a Swiss and got my B-permit in June 2014, total number of days in Switzerland is ca. 70. No income in Switzerland in 2014 but I got some income in another country, paid there at source, there is a double tax treaty between these two countries.   
WIll highly appreciate if you can help me understand:   
- am I taxable in CH in 2014 (canton of ZH, if it matters)? 
- if yes, then any idea of the rate? 
- how shall I prove my income outside of CH and, in case I have to file some documents from the other country, do I have to get them translated and apostilled? 
- is there any manual in English on how to fill out a tax return?   
I have studied quite a few threads here but failed to find an answer to my questions. Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out.

			Not in the same league as a gold card perhaps, but I don't think the Migros credit card charges an annual fee, and you get Cumulus points every time you use it, which are sent to you quarterly in the form of money vouchers to use in any Migros controlled shop.

It might have to do with withholding tax or with selecting a specific place to stay than Zurich in general.

1293	Financebankingtaxation	Tax Declaration, for Tax Year 2014	Sbrinz	855	0	Location: Murten - Morat	20.01.2015, 12:41	" 
			
			For many years I have completed my tax declaration (Tax return) electronically, in Bern & in Fribourg. This year Canton Fribourg have a new system, and I came up against a problem that might affect you in the same way.    
When I have completed a form on paper, I have never left a field blank: I always added ""none"" or ""0"" and for years I have continued this habit with online tax forms. It shows you have read the question and either you have ""zero amount"" or the question is irrelevant.    
With the new Fribourg declaration I happily put ""none"" or ""0"" everywhere and when I clicked to send it off, the computer said ""NO"" and asked me how many trees I had and how much my temporary staff earned. I retraced my steps and I have come to the conclusion that if I had anything marked in the answer box / field, I was asked for further details.    
So I went back and happily deleted everything with ""0"" and the declaration form went off successfully.

1295	Financebankingtaxation	Credit Suisse student vs UBS student account	ihtxam	3827	14	Location: Neuchatel	18.11.2014, 21:47	"    I'm sure because with my Maestro I've never been charged extra for withdrawing from another ATM. Credit card whole different animal, you get a flat fee for every cash withdrawal and it's more than 5CHF I think. Doesn't make sense since overdraft from your checking account is basically free and goes up to about 300 CHF (helped in a couple of emergencies)   
CC costs are what they are, I couldn't be bothered to shop around to potentially save less than 20CHF a year... It's not that other credit cards don't have similar fees and at least there's no annual flat fee for the Campus account.

			Since I have a C permit now I pay monthly a similar amount to what was deducted earlier. Saves the hassle (I hope) of having to pay interest whilst getting interest (and better than at the bank) on my tax payments. 
Also saves me a headache at the end of the year when that big bill would come for taxes

So...if you're submitting a return (whether you pay Quellensteuer or not) you can choose to be taxed for the whole of 2015 at Zug rates, or you can apportion taxes for the year between Zurich (Jan-Apr) and Zug (May-Dec).  Only worth doing if the Zurich tax is lower (unlikely?!).

Rule #2: See Rule #1   
Rather arrange some kind of overdraft facility (expensive) or just a plain outright consumer credit with your bank.   
15% annual percentage rate (APR) for credit card credit - implied, for instance, by the ""partial payment option"". Come on, how absurd is that?!   
In Switzerland, credit card issuing is subject to consumer credit laws and rules, by the way. There is nothing to be gained (and a lot to be lost) to use credit cards for getting credit.

Im trying to move away from euros altogether and leave all my savings in the bank in Ireland.   
It seems PostFinance are the most recommended from here and another expat group so I think I will use them but get the Plus account.   
The only query I have is that my Visa Debit is accepted anywhere and everywhere, Im not so sure the PF card is, I buy a lot of stuff online abroad as well as the travelling.   
Can anyone confirm that say, Amazon and Aliexpress take PF card?

			Update. 
Basically, the woman behind the post-ofice counter made a big cock up; she filled in the pink payment form, but omitted the guy's name and address. So the money went to the UBS Saas Fee, but they had no idea who it was for. After visiting Postfinance, UBS and back again the PO, we finally arranged to get the money returned. Once it was in our account I organised the transfer myself through PF e-banking. The guy confirmed he received it the following day.

			One more thing. Your OP says you are coming to Zurich but you don't say where from. If you come from abroad, another aspect to consider is the residence permit that you will be getting. I don't think it will be very stable getting an immigration residence permit via a time limited contract. With the new law voted a few months ago would that be even possible? Assuming you get a weak B or even an L permit, your contract expires and they don't renew, you may be bound to leave the country. This will definitely handicap your negotiation potential to prevent them reducing the rate at every contract renewal. btw are you aware that it is a common thing they push the rates down every time they renew unless you get a huge leverage and your political skills are so awesome that you get them all at checkmate.

EmaF	5739	27	Location: Lucerne	05.09.2014, 14:39	"    You could transfer it straight back - in this case you only lose the transfer fee.      Because currencyfair, unlike any other fx-service that I´m aware of, is a peer-to-peer service: CF doesn´t change your money, you change money directly with other users. CF merely ensures that you can do just that.   
As you deal with other users, CF has to ensure the funds of both sides are immediately available. Otherwise, if one party simply decides not to transfer after engaging in a deal, someone would lose out.   
This also yields it pretty unlikely that you won´t get a rate that you don't like: ""Quick change"" is the option to just accept the next available rate, while ""Marketplace"" allows you to offer your money at a rate that you like. I always use the latter (Marketplace) and regularly get rates above the mean rate!

1319	Financebankingtaxation	Pension Second Pillar contributions	DaveA	28181	51	Location: Appenzell	12.07.2007, 17:11	"    MAximum AHV Loan is for 2007 79560. The ""koordinationabzug"" ie the AHV bit is 23205. Minimum BVG is then paid on the difference. This is described in Art 2,5+7 of BVG.   
To your other question. You have a good year and prepay several years BVG. This goes in your company ""pot"". On Jan 1 of each year it is then paid over to your employees accounts or paid monthly as you wish. Once it is paid into the pot of the accounts it can't be touched. Only you have several years of money paid in and when you liquidate the company you get to collect the pot into your personal pension fund. Simply put once paid in the money can't be taken out and there is no-one else left in the company to pay it to. So you land the jackpot all legitimate and above board. And of course you then have a big fat BVG. All you then need to do is wait five years and retire. Simple really... Of course you do need to get the employees etc first. 
The five year wait is a precaution I would take but technically it is not necessary. As soon as you are 58 you put your feet up take capital and bobs your uncle so to speak.   
Any more questions about second pillars?

1321	Financebankingtaxation	Tax return question	keenog	1802	11	Location: zurich	12.10.2014, 13:49	"    Quite right. On average, people pay more if they do a tax return, but it's only on average. It doesn't only depend on the communal tax, but also on your own specific circumstances such as what you deduct, whether you're married, etc, etc. In our case we get quite a bit back after filling in the tax return.      At least in Zurich, you don't get a choice. I asked whether I could file one when I earned less than 120k and I was not allowed to do so. I was worrying about it, but then as soon as I went over 120k in a year, the tax return turned up automatically all by itself with no intervention on my part. There are, I believe other triggers though, such as owning property or being married to a Swiss.      Are you sure? I had over 10k loads of times in individual months. I never was permitted to file a tax return (though I would have loved to) until the first time I made over 120k per year.

I do not think there is any way to claim if you earn under the threshold for lodging a tax return and pay Quellensteuer...

			I dont think you will be able to get unemployment benefit if you are self-employed. However, if you lose your main job, and you qualify for unemployment insurance then if you can get a side job and still get unemployment insurance, its Zwischenverdienst.

			Hi Everyone,   
I am considering relocating to Zurich to take up a job. My wife will stay in the UK for at least the next 6-12 months before considering relocating although she will come to Switzerland to visit.   
We own a house in the UK and pay a mortgage on it.   
My question s concerns the intricacies of the HMRC and their various terms regarding UK residency: ordinary resident and/ or domiciled. For example, will I be subject to double taxation - even if I will rarely come back to the UK - by dint of the fact that I have a wife and house in the UK.   
This would seriously remove any motivation to accept the job if I were to end up paying twice.   
Thanks in advance for any thoughts.

			I think we are cross puposes..   
The OP asked what rate to use for income and yera end balances.   
admin.ch publishes two official lists ""devisen -noten"" and ""jahresmittelkurs"", to be used for balances and income respectively.    
The ""devisen - noten"" list has two values, and you are right for money at the bank use the devisen first column.  You dont have the choice to use the second better rate unless you have cash. For GBP the two were 1.530278 and 1.455000.  The average rate was 1.997136

The trick is - you can not know that from IBAN itself.  I guess you would need to ask the recipient (or his bank).

I am told the buying part from the UBS hq branch is pretty simple.   
However selling is restricted to 25,000 CHF and only from the same place you bought (i.e. with the original receipt).   
Could anyone clarify?   
(And does anyone know what the rules are elsewhere in Europe or would Switzerland be the easiest place to buy)

Some work well with Reuters, some with ISIN, but never with all. If I were to run this avenue, I'd have to have my portfolios split amongst multiple services/websites which kinda defeats the goal of ""at a glance""...   
EDIT >> perhaps another way to approach this: do ALL funds have universal identifiers/references? Is the ISIN the global one?   
EDIT 2 >> The bloomberg website has a thing called ""WATCHLIST"" for those registered (registration if free). Does give the basics: purchase date, purchase price, day change, gain/loss to date (since purchase). No suggestions/recommendations on portfolio improvements or diversification but hey... a good start!!!

Otherwise with around $1 million and willingness to pay 1 to 2% annual fee ($10K to $20K, which will wipe your annual income) I believ that UBS, CS and Pictet are options.

			I always did my own US tax return until last year, when I realized I've been leaving out stuff all along (such as second pillar employer contributions, and I didn't figure that I was eligible for the foreign tax credit in addition to the foreign income exclusion.)  Too many complexities for me, living abroad.  I used H&R Block Expat Tax Services last year, and I was very happy with the service.  I believe they charge $150 for the standard expat return. They were very knowledgeable about the specifics of living and working in Switzerland.

			Out of curiosity, I ordered my account statements of AVS (1st pillar) and LPP (2nd pillar) and received them yesterday.   
The LPP statement is very easy to understand. It tells how much I have accumulated in my personal account so far, and how much I will have accumulated when I go retired (if nothing changes from now) and the conversion rate, and then the total sum times conversion rate gives how much I will get each year as the retire pension (from LPP) afterwards.   
The AVS statement, however, only gives a list of my brutal salaries each year and the corresponding employers, followed by a summation of all my brutal salaries I've gained so far in my life (hmm.. a lovely number but I do not know how it is relevant). There is no such a thing as how much contribution has been accumulated so far in my personal AVS account... How should I interpret this statement?

			I was asked to explain to Fid- why I had standing wire instructions to a US domestic bank account AND a domicile/permanent address abroad. I had to educate them on the right for non-residents to hold US domestic bank accounts (there are no restrictions apart from sanctioned countries, as far as I can tell) AND the right for non-residents not to reside in the US.    
They seemed happy with the explanations.    
They blocked further activity in US mutual funds though, through a separate process.   
Waiting (not) for the next steps. Many non-resident, whether still US or former citizens, and also on temporary visas, have IRA accounts from former US presence and hopefully we will be able to use domestic bank accounts to withdraw money when we retire,as I doubt it could be wired abroad directly.

You make no such declaration when you renounce.  Neither the Statement of Understanding nor the Oath contain anything about never intending to live or work in the US.           
There is, of course, an assumption that you're unlikely to want to return to the States permanently, but in these increasingly global days people will at times want/need to return to the States to live/work.  They will have to apply for the appropriate visas just like any other ""alien"" who wants to be let in.   
It is an unalienable right to be able to expatriate and doesn't mean you can be prosecuted for providing false info.  You haven't; you are still an ex-US citizen who is exercising the same rights as any other non-US citizen to enter the US for life/work purposes.

			I believe I might have found the answer to my own question. As the online tax form automatically deducts the amount of the pauschale only once you put a rental value into the appropriate box, I assume that the said pauschale only applies if you earn a rent, hence the general cost of the upkeep of a property cannot be deducted unless you declare eigenmietwert or rental income. Thanks for you help gents. (unless someone knows different of course :-) )

I use Interactive Brokers which are based in the US but they have a branch in Switzerland. For fees, they charged me $1 per transaction. If you dont generate $10 in commisions in a month, they will charge you the difference. I usually make a bunch of small transactions to reach the $10 minimum

After reading Connery's post, I started thinking: ""Hmmm... come to think of it I haven't seen one of those in a few years,"" which got me worried a bit.   
The odd thing is that the person working with me in Switzerland is actually an American, knows the American system, and has worked with several other Americans who returned to the US and were able to get this signed and stamped... But she doesn't know how or where they did it. I'm just going to show up at the SS building and see what happens.

			It is possible to be tax resident in two countries. With a dual-tax treaty, you simply pay the tax as though you were in the higher tax country.   
It is also  for one half of a married couple to be resident only in CH, while his/her family is in the UK - and the CH resident gets an 18K deduction from Swiss taxes. It depends greatly on your personal circumstances.   
Tax-residency is a complicated issue and you'd be well advised to consult an expert.

			Dear Colleagues,   
Loked for that in almost all official cantonal pages, but impossible to find a clear indication.   
I have a B Permit, and I am being taxed on the pay check (impot a la source). At years end, should I declare foreign income in the ""adjustment declaration""? or should I just disregard it?   
It looks like a simple question, but I couldn't find any official indication on it,   
Thanks,

Also, how is profit from a business entered on the Swiss tax return because on the UK tax return the profit shown is a gross figure and other things are taken into consideration before the final taxable amount is shown!

But seriously - carrying the toxic blue passport you have few options. In your shoes I'd first worry about who will still accept Americans. The Big 2 still do, provided that you sign the waivers and can show you are squeeky clean.   
As an American you might find that you have limited access to banking services - so first figure out who won't turn you down flat, then compare those offers. Many people find that going in person to the main branch helps, as local branches might not know how to deal with US persons.   
Good luck.

			Some wrong information above (surprise...).   
The 300 CHF limit applies to carrying things INTO Switzerland; exporting goods to another country would be subject to the limits that country imposes, which is unlikely to be 300 CHF.   
Goods bought for export (which is what has to happen to get your 8% or 2.5% tax back) have to be exported within 30 days of purchase.   
At the time of export you mustn't be a resident of Switzerland.   
At the time of purchase ... I don't know.  Many people I know bought lots of gadgets within the 30 days of their leaving, and in some cases had yet to de-register.  They all got their tax back.

1383	Financebankingtaxation	Life insurance Luxembourg	kikeo	610	0	Location: Zurich	28.11.2014, 10:14	" 
			
			Hi all,   
I inherited some money in France and would like to secure it as a placement for the future of my family; I'm probably going to open a life insurance contract in Luxembourg. 
Whereas I am very clear on what I can and cannot do as a french citizen with such a contract in Luxembourg, I find it difficult to understand what I can and cannot do as a (foreigner) living in Switzerland with a C permit.   
Is it allowed for Swiss residents to open a life insurance contract in Luxembourg? 
If yes, are there any restrictions for foreigners doing it? C-permit in particular? 
Switzerland is not really part of the EEA (signed the treaty but did not ratify it), is this an issue?   
This life insurance is exempt of taxes on increased value in both France and Luxembourg, I become tax  liable only when withdrawing the funds. The amount of tax I'd pay would  depend only on where I live at this moment, and on the conventions existing between my country of residence and France.   
I assume I would have to declare this in my assets when it comes to filing my taxes in Switzerland. Would this be taken into my ""global wealth"" and therefore have an impact on my tax rate, without being taxed itself? Or would I be taxed on the yearly perceived interest? Or on anything else?   
I'm at the moment working with a financial advisor in France who is also looking for info, and I will probably try and get professional advice from someone competent here in Switzerland. But if any of you has some experience to share, some advice, comments, or anything useful (or not), I'm happy to read it !   
Thanks, 
Kik'

But different handling by different Kantons in case of a change of Kanton would open loopholes to not pay taxes (or pay double, depending on direction of the move):   
Say you move during the year from Kanton A, which uses taxation based on Dec 31, and thus sends you no invoice. You move to Kanton B, which uses taxation based on Jan 1st(start of current tax year). Since you only just moved here you're weren't here on Jan 1st, and Kanton B doesn't issue an invoice either.   
Result:  
No taxes for the year you moved  
And if you moved from Kanton B to Kanton A you'd have to pay twice   "	Posts: 14	Join Date: Mar 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

We only have the tax consultants conclusion so far, so are still waiting for the cantons  final tax calculation. It is very reassuring to hear that the refund is typically very speedy. 
So yes I suppose we have to wait for a final tax calculation from the canton, hope that should be soon. 
We did ask out tax consultant who was vague and said she would chase it up if we hadn't heard by the end on 2014.

			Can anyone recommend a good credit card with travel/mile accumulation benefits? From what I gather, there are only 2 options: Credit Suisse, and Miles & More, but basically both accumulate or can exchange to Miles & More. Is there really no other option? In Canada we have cards that are not necessarily tied to an airline (Miles & More - Lufthansa/Swiss), and you can accumulate points to buy flights on any airline....is there anything comparable to that in Switzerland that I have yet to discover?

			Opening a regular checking account shouldn't be a problem when holding a G permit, as this (as already said) implies that you have a swiss employer and are living in one of the neighboring countries of Switzerland.   
It's likely that the bank wants to see your employment contract and a statement from your employer, but that's it, as there are working 288149 people with a G permit in Switzerland but residing in Germany, France, Italy, Austria and so on.

I haven't waded through to find out.  It did cause a hiccup in our mortgage application back in 2011, but luckily UBS agreed to give us one and I've renounced since so renewing it shouldn't be a problem.  That's what I've been reading more about here in the forum.  Americans who have mortgages aren't able to get them renewed so have to find another source - which suggests that new mortgages aren't being given out to American applicants either.

When I was filling out my tax return on the first page it says ""Verrechnungssteuerguthaben 2014"" which would translate as withholding tax credits 2014 - so does that effectively mean that interest income would be double-taxed in 2013 (i.e. the 35% WHT and final tax assessment) with a credit in 2014?     
I tried looking into this and found form 25 on the ESTV site, so will look into that further but just wondering if others had seen this too..     
thanks!

			Hey everyone, I'm also a NatWest member and have to make an urgent payment (to cover tuition fees). Unfortunately, I left the UK without ordering a card reader and now find myself in a similar situation to the member above.    
I've emailed, faxed, priority mailed, called, web-chatted, and even attempted to use a couple of Swiss banks' card readers* to access my account without any luck. Does anyone have a NatWest card reader they would be willing to part with for a short time? Of course, I would be extremely grateful and obviously happy to mail it back as soon as the transaction is made.    
*Apparently the majority of UK banks use the same software with their card readers, so it was at least worth a shot.   
Thanks!

Get some advice before making any decisions even if you have to pay for that advice.

			You created your pension fund(s) with tax free money, and now you take it out it will be taxed by the Canton where your bank account is situated.    
To avoid heavy taxation, and perfectly legal, you should open an account in a low tax Canton to receive the money from the pension fund. The bank will then pay the Kapitalauszahlungssteuer tax and transfer the money abroad.    
Depending on the amount of capital you will be taking out, it looks like Schwyz, or Appenzell are the best Cantons for lowest capital taxation. From the table you can see there are enormous differences!

I believe it will work like this: 
You will de-register from Vaud before 31.12.2014 and register with Schwyz. 
Vaud will return all payments of tax you have already made for 2014 to you.  
In March 2015, you and your husband will jointly receive a tax form from your community in Schwyz on which you will both enter all earnings etc. for the whole of 2014 and the tax you pay for 2014 will be based on the rates applicable for your community in Schwyz.

done and done - many times - not sure if it helps       I didn't get a close look to see how she filled out the form...will have to see.  Interestingly, I got a package from her yesterday that was full of gifts - she put a total value on those at $70 and the postage was $52.65 - and I had no charges.  It just always seems so random as to what they will check and charge for and not, which is certainly a sentiment I have read on here often - even the postal workers don't understand what gets checked and when.  Also, this package should have arrived a week earlier (yup - a 3rd package from same place was sent of other random stuff that we ""forgot"")  I often joke that the USPS is keeping its doors open thanks to her...    
It is hard to impress on relatives at times that gifts can come with a price tag here on the receiving end      
On another note - if I don't pay will they return it to the return address?

			This definitely depends on somebodys' personal situation, but the tax office is actually to help you if you ask - they're professionals too, and 100% free. Their angle may be a bit different than that of a professional, but an employee often can't do much to reduce taxes other than the obviuos (3rd pillar) anyway.   
So you might try both, ask the tax office for help and hire a professional, and compare. Chances are you find the professional isn't worth the fee.

If his accounts are checked, he will need to show purchase invoices and if those haven't been submitted for import and MwsT paid, he will have some problems. He will at least get the 20% MwsT back from the EU sales.    
If he's going to do this, do it properly. It won't really cost much more and will save him having to rent a warehouse!

			My guess is your only option is to stay tax resident in Germany. The link I sent you explains the procedure: you declare to the German finanzamt that you work in CH for 3 months and your income here. They will give you a bill for prepayment of your taxes and a document that you should send to your CH employer (called 'Ansässigkeitsbescheinigung' or 'Vordruck Gre1') . Based on this document your employer will correct your tax at source to tariff M/N (both 4.5% so it will not matter if your wife is employed or not). At the end of the year you file your taxes in Germany where among other deductions you can deduct the extra costs you made for working in CH, like the second household, and the 4.5% tax you prepaid as tax-at-source in CH. Do contact your German tax consultant as he might save you more money than you have to pay him in your not-so-straightforward situation. Good luck!

The program runs through December only.

			This pattern is consistent with my ebay-observations:   
If someone buys and In my ~200 ebay sales (all low value, so it didn´t really matter) I always sent out all items the next day if the buyer   ask for it. I always got the money.   
In 2 cases I received funny emails, so I delayed posting until I ""receive"" the funds. In both cases I never got a dime.     
On another note: If someone is online to buy stuff through the internet, I would never believe that the same person doesn´t have an e-banking account. Conclusion: Cash-inpayment at the counter to pay for an internet-purchase? I don´t think so!

			Plenty of Swiss company schemes on the QROPS list, but of course you're right Fatman.   
AT 15,000k, I am not sure that your diversification is worth much tbh in the grand scheme of things. More important is making sure (as you're doing already) that admin/management charges are actually lower in your UK scheme than here (often these increase once you become ""deferred"", ie leave employment).   
And even if you do in the future move to a company with a QROPS scheme, be aware that the advice I received from a tax guy, is that you might have an issue in the future. This is because if you leave that company to another one company that doesn't QROPS, you will be obliged to transfer everything across, which technically should put you on HMRC radar.   
If you really want ""nothing to do with HMRC"", I would leave as is, or transfer to a UK SIPP with lower fees if necessary and withdraw all at 55 (or whatever that age ends up being in the future). You will have no interaction with HMRC in that case.   
The pensions landscape in the UK is forever changing but at the moment it's moving towards more freedoms so maybe waiting and hoping isn't so daft right now, until the next election at least.

I had something similar at ZKB. It was just a friendly chat and he asked if I had any questions about any of the bank's services and he mentioned one or two that might be useful to me and gave me some brochures. There was no sales pitch beyond that an no pressure. He was surprised to hear that I was filling in my own tax returns and knew more about taxes and investments than he had assumed and at the end of our conversation I don't think he had any expectation to sell me anything, but he remained pleasant all the same. So much more pleasant than talking two some of these cold calling companies with their Generali schemes who go on pushing even after all the signals and indicators have gone to ""no"".

			Hi there,   
Since our arrival in Switzerland, we are having all of our accounts at Crédit Suisse. 
That was until this week, where I came across this study:    
I investigated deeper the topic and found out two very interesting grids from the ""Fédération Romande des Consommateurs"" (sorry it is in french, but there are a lot of numbers, and not too much text): 
* You are fine with dealing w/ your banks via the web =>  
* You prefer to have access to real people   =>    
This is a nice cheat sheet to help you out choosing your bank.   
On our side, we are gonna move this week from Crédit Suisse to BCV. 
We probably will have also an account at PostFinance for our ""partners account"". Like this I will be able to compare both e-banking application and see which one is best (it looks like PostFinance became worse with the latest version).   
Regarding credit cards, I advice you to go for a Migros Cumulus or Coop Supercard ones which are free of charge every year! And providing you some cash back (Cumulus).   
Hope this helps you save some bucks on this excessively expensive banking fees!!!

1452	Financebankingtaxation	Proposed Foreigener Tax	Dack Rambo	5918	90	Location: Switzerland	17.10.2014, 09:24	" 
			
			This proposal seems to reverse of what happens in Holland where although levels are taxation are high : in order to encourage big companies to move there with their highly paid ( and hence spend it mainly there) salaries they actually allow 30% to be untaxed : effectively getting them to be at taxation levels similar to competitor countries like Switzerland.     
I work in Zurich and within 2 buildings side by side there are three large Foreign companies shedding jobs ( 100s and hence around 20-30% )  because of the high FULL cost of Swiss workers : I am not talking about the senior ex pats I am taking about from PA to first line management :      
Now I am all for fair taxation but actually the people who make the decisions about company locations actually have no such thoughts : So the SVP need to keep their balance right : as many of you say : there is no way most of these ,low paid jobs would be taken by the local population ( even the youngsters where most concern is about employment , as still many apprentice roles remain unfilled in the less glamorous sectors)  : and at the top end it is so easy for a company to move when it only involves a 100 or so execs who have different values from most of the population.     
The SVP may get the Switzerland they want but find it a bit less well funded .. Interesting to see if common sense ( or financial sense which is a base Swiss value ) prevails

			I read it. What I remember from it is: ""Buy assets, not liabilities."" And the respective definitions are:   
asset - an investment, something, what brings money in. 
liability - a spending, something what cost money and brings nothing.   
now, what is exactly an asset and what is liability?    
It is easy to say, especially when looking backwards in time. The only receipts, which are given, are investments in real estate, backed with credits. So, there was a man, who had 10K, he wanted to buy himself a car, but he read a smart book and instead of buying a car he bought a house with 10K of downpayment and 90K credit, he rented a house, he paid mortgage with a money he received from tenants, than in 5 years the house was worth 200K so he sold it and made 100K out of his 10K. Than he bought a whole building  with his 100K, which he used a downpayment, took 900K from the bank, paid the mortgage using money he got from tenants. After 5 years his building was worth 2M so he sold it - now he had 990K which he made out of his initial 10K.    
I believe, the example above is extremely simplified. As we have recently seen, the prices of real estates are not going up forever. Althought it seems to be relatively safe investment, they sometimes go down, and the example above does not take into an account maintnance and administration costs. I believe, that the house, which was bought thirty years ago would be worth exactly nothing today, or even required some demolition costs, if the owners were not investing in it constantly.   
So, the idea of buiying assets is right, it is the definition of an asset, which is a problem. So, do not tell me what I should do ten years ago. Tell me what should I do NOW.

			When I left the UK I had around 20 years contribution to the UK State Pension and as I wasn't working in CH, I have paid my contribution each year, and now being back at work I have continued as it will give me the UK full state pension (once I get 30 years) plus any Swiss one I have built up. For the cost, I think it is worth it - even little helps as they say. But I won't rely just on that   - as it might be worth about £3.50 by the time I retire!

			Renounce. Obviously.    
You'll earn more than the threshold at some point in your career but the tax bands, rates and cost to renounce may well change at some point. The advantages of your USA citizenship are zero and your liabilities are potentially massive but worse, are unknown.

I have a quite clear picture of what I need in order to practice in Switzerland and I am aware that following decisions and regulations in effect from summer 2013 I am likely to not be allowed to do it. Or at least not as I want to. There are many places in Switzerland where I just won´t be allowed to practice and some where I might.    
I am probably not making myself clear: I may not care whether I practice or not in Switzerland. To be able to practice in Switzerland may be the easiest way but not the only way. Though it´s one of my main skills, practicing is not my only skill (by the way, nor is my only qualification/credential). Never talked about practicing in Switzerland (or anywhere) without my qualifications being recognized.

			The employer can't know the entire situation and is probably applying the correct rate (from his point of view). 
In those cases, it might make sense to file a correction (watch the March deadline of the following year). Bear in mind that the tax administration may apply the tax rate applicable to total income, from both jobs. Depending on the numbers, this may work against you. 
Your canton should provide an online tax calculator to do a very basic simulation.

1463	Financebankingtaxation	A swiss solicitor for banking, where can I get one?	_VWV_	561	0	Location: Zurich	10.10.2014, 13:28	" 
			
			Dear ALL,   
I am not 100% sure but perhaps I would need a swiss solicitor to get my pension money to buy a property in the UK.   
It is well described in this post:    
However, I just have no idea where to find that solicitor (also NOT in a way that the solicitors fees are more than my pension :-) ). Any help is greatly appreciated!   
Basically it should be a person who will get the money for me into his swiss account and transfer them to me or to my solicitor in the UK. (the pension can ONLY be released into a swiss account it seems - I will have to check that with Postfinance to be 100% sure, but so far it's been like that).   
As discussed in 2 threads in this forum PF has new rules and basically if you relocate to countries other than France, Germany, Austria and Italy - they close your account.   
So, please help me with your kind advice on where to find that swiss solicitor.   
Thank you in advance!   
_VWV_

How the balls are we supposed to know what kind of earnings we are allowed to include?   
Is it just me... or does it not make any sense that you should pay taxes for your employer's contributions? You don't get to see any of that 2nd pillar money until you retire, so why should you have to pay taxes on it until you receive it?   
I thought we were only double taxed on 3rd pillar savings. (First time by the US and second time by Swiss when you take it out.) Under my understanding, there wasn't a problem with 2nd pillar income. Am I wrong??

1468	Financebankingtaxation	P3 insurance product - exit strategies	JDB210	541	0	Location: ZH	08.10.2014, 09:13	" 
			
			Hi all.  When we first arrived, we set up pillar 3 accounts with a financial planner recommended by the company who described the account as the savings system, with the ability to withdraw the full amount contributed when leaving, for a business start, to fund pillar 2, or a house.  Fast forward to 18 months later, after reading some of the warnings here on EF and reviewing the paperwork, I realize that these are the pseudo-insurance policy accounts that provide no refund if canceled within the first two years and a mediocre return of substantially less than the amount contributed if canceled before the maturity date.  Continuing to contribute at the current rate until the policy has some surrender value would result in an even greater loss.   
At best, this is a negligent misrepresentation on the part of the agent, but legal strategies aside - is anyone aware of alternatives so that the money isn't entirely lost? Is there generally some sort of a conversion option? Or perhaps it is possible to change the monthly payment to something extremely low in order to wait a few months to pull out at least some of the amount contributed already?   
I am separately looking for a truly independent financial advisor with regard to this question as well as legal advice, but figured I would draw on the collective wisdom of EF in case someone else has faced a similar issue (I have read the thread about the gentleman who convinced the insurer to cancel the policy based on misrepresentation)   
Thanks.

			I'm rather confused about how Pillar 1 and 2 are taxed. Few people reported that US citizens have to add Pillar2 to 1 contributions as well as employer contributions (i.e. no tax credit on contributions), i.e. it is treated similarly to bank account: I pay taxes and deposit money to the bank account. 
Other people reported that after  they withdraw pensions and treated money as pension distributions, i.e. paid tax to Switzerland and then take foreign tax credit and pay taxes to US. 
To me this looks like triple taxation and more looks like people can not agree how to treat this plan. 
Does anyone know some reliable source which tell how to treat this plan?

			What should happen now is that in Jan/Feb next year your employer will send you a document detailing your yearly salary and any deductions you had up to September this year, giving a net figure at the end which is what you put on the tax form when you fill it in.  This document is sent with your tax form to the tax office.  You'll get one every year from now on.

			Hello, a friend just asked me a question related to US taxation that I can't help with - they will be moving to the US and want to keep their pension savings (2nd pillar) in a Freizuegigkeitskonto here. They were told by someone that the total sum will be considered taxable income in the month of the move to the US by US tax authorities. Of course, they will also need to pay Swiss tax at time of withdrawal (in many years ...) 
Is this regarding US taxation correct?

			you get tiered services with credit cards and the gold cards will have better insurance cover - like extra insurance for rental cars, flights, travel, etc.   
the basic card will have basic cover insofar that the issuer is jointly liable for transactions you make using the card.

			Agree with all the comments above.    
Certainly the IT experience would provide a strong background for a transition into a quantitative risk management role, but the lack of specific banking / financial sector experience will be a major challenge.    
I'd recommend that he explore specific opportunities to gain a clear idea of where his experience, talents and interests come together. Perhaps looking at roles on the GARP website (Global Assoc of Risk Professionals -  ) or on eFinancial News' website would be a good start in determining where his mix of skills would best fit.

			Just paid some funds to SA to pay for my holiday coming up in June    
As previous posters have said, I just made a payment from my bank account here using the IBAN or SWIFT code for the remote account.   
Actually, this was far easier and cheaper than when I had to do the same from my bank account in the UK - from the UK I had to fill in a paper form and take it in to the branch- it took 8 days to process and cost me 10GBP for the privilege. I managed to do the whole transaction online here, and although the earliest date that the transaction could take place was 3 days in the future when I filled in the form, the money arrived in the SA account on the same day that it left my CH account (today as it happens   ). The cost of the transfer from CH was 5CHF.

1491	Financebankingtaxation	a tax situation	charlesriver	810	3	Location: Aargau	25.09.2014, 00:28	    Thank you swisspea. I studied the details that the Gemeinde tax guy provided me. I think his calculation is correct. I also called the Kanton tax office and the lady said there is no table of rates available for me to easily verify the Kanton's calculation. But again, I have to trust they did their work correctly. One key thing is they used my worldwide income (i have a small rental income in the US) to determine the rate and my Swiss income as base for the calculation. I am actually ready to pay but just frustrated by the whole process and the surprise at the last minute. The accountant could not give me any definitive answer and I actually called the gemeinde a couple of times over the years but just could not get any conclusion. And now it feels like they want to get every penny possible from me once knowing I am leaving.

			The situation used to be that when one married partner was working less than 15 hours per week and earning less than 2000CHF/month they could be taxed according to tarif D (nebenerwerb - supplementary income) which was a flat rate of 10% and the main provider by B. This was the case for me and my husband a few years ago when he worked only a few hours per week. It looks like this changed from the beginning of this year, and now both partners are taxed to C, no matter how low the income of one of them is (you can find the changes for ZH on page 3 of the first letter  ). Obviously this is more disadvantageous the lower that second income is. Totally ridiculous, and maybe it is worth to file a complaint about this change calculating your losses compared to the old situation, and explaining that it discourages you, and most probably many more part-time working spouses from working at all? 
Actually, the new tariffs are disadvantageous for all married couples who both work and whose incomes differ, more so the more they differ, as before 2014 the person earning more was taxed to a lower rate than the one earning less (this was the 'wives' tariff C(EF) as obviously everybody knows it is always the woman earning less   ) - we ended up paying about 12% more quellensteuer overall since the beginning of this year because both partners now are taxed according to the same tariff.

1496	Financebankingtaxation	employed and independent	totoro82	618	2	Location: lausanne	22.09.2014, 16:01	"    I think it would be easier to work through an agency. Lots of rules and requirements to work as an independent, not like other countries.   
Example:     
Persons from third states can only become self-employed if they or their partner holds a residence permit 'C' or they are married to a Swiss national.   
Persons who are not married to a Swiss national or an EU citizen with a residence permit and who themselves have an ordinary one-year residence permit are not permitted to engage in a self-employed activity and exceptions to this policy can only be approved upon prior examination of the required documents.

			HR is right that they need to close the pension account in their pension fund if you leave the company. However, nothing prevents you from opening a pillar 2 account with a bank as suggested by Sbrinz and have your HR transferred there ... and take out once you reach the pension age.

You're letting emotions rule at the moment, but banking processes are purely rational activities governed by a wide variety of legislation.  Take a deep breath, calm down and visit your bank. It will all be over quickly.

			Hi All,   
I am working here since last 8 months for one of bank project. I am having 1 year (L-card) work permit. As informed by other colleagues who already worked here and now they went India, we should pay Personnel Tax to Zurich Kanton.   
One important thing is that, we are not getting salary by any Swiss company. Every month our salary has been paid by our Indian Company.    
So, I went to Zurich TAX office and told them all about my information and ask for Personnel TAX invoice, by then they told me I am not eligible for Zurich TAX. If I am getting salary from India then I no need to pay tax here. Even also I have shown them my Colleagues TAX paid papers, still they are saying I dont have to pay TAX here. Till date I have not received any letter or TAX Invoice from TAX office.     
Same has been discussed with our Colleagues, but they are not agreed to this.    
can anybody help me or give me proper information regarding TAX Procedure. It helps me lot !!!!   
Thanks in advance !!!   
Ranjeet.

			One option is a Pillar 3a account.  The interest rate won't get you very excited, but the tax deductibility is nice.  Of course the money is then locked up for the long term, so you need to factor that into any decision.

			I think I am in the minority here, and I am not positive they still take new U.S. customers, but take a look at Migrosbank. I have 2 accounts with them plus an investment accout (that they required in order to distinguish me as a U.S. tax person). Monthly fee for the regular accounts is only 3 CHF and includes a debit card. Annual fee for the investment account is about 30 plus small fees. At first I was mad about the hoops they made me jump through but after hearing everyone else's stories about their banks, I am rather happy with mine. Feel free to PM if you have questions about how it works.

The other point re mortgages and tax deductions is it's not a plain deduction on the amount as someone postulated above, but since tax rates are on a sliding scale, reducing the amount of your taxable income reduces the tax   too.    
Eigenmietwert can easily add 30k to your taxable income, and it's a hard pill to swallow to have to pay tax on income that is purely notional and not real i.e. it's not like you actually have the extra income with which to pay the extra tax

			actually I finaly understand.   
So it seems the percentage is shown in the pdf ""baremes 2013"" for the source taxation. depending on my marital status (married or not ,with children or not) and depending on my total taxed income, I can calculate the percentage my employer should pay.   
For tax returns if i have any deductions that were accepted or if the actual percentage should be lower than what my employer already deducted then I get a tax return.   
Anyway the values seem to be more or less right, so they did their job properly this year    
The more you earn, the more taxes you pay. Gotta love this system    
Thank you all once again and have a nice day...

			These are the kind of questions that scare me to death.  Would you mind posting where you obtained this recommendation?       
I've never reported Pillar 2 or 3 pension plans with my FBAR forms, only the maximum account balance in my local bank account for the previous year.  My bank is currently auditing my FBAR forms and Income Tax returns with their lawyers as required by FATCA and haven't mentioned anything about this requirement.       
I have a feeling that no one really knows what's required of us to ensure compliancy with the DOJ and all the IRS Publications I've read leave much room for interpretation.

1519	Financebankingtaxation	Tax and Deductions on Internship	Fredzzz	898	0	Location: Basel	02.09.2014, 02:00	" 
			
			I may start an internship in Basel, Switzerland, but was wondering how much tax I can expect to pay.   
It will be a full-time position, for 6 months. First question, will the taxes that will be deducted by my employer be based on a 12-month work period, even though the contract is only for six month?   
If so, this would mean I could get back some prepaid taxes at the end of the year, correct?   
Also, how much tax will I pay (per year or or month) on a monthly bruto income of 2500 CHF.   
I've tried using various calculators, but cannot seem to get an accurate result.   
I will most likely be living in France (just across the border) - don't know if this makes it any difference as opposed to living in for example Basel itself?   
Thanks in advance!

Little fish easily get scared off by the shadow of doubt. Given how closely persons and names are knit into this fund, in contrast with the almost anonymous and faceless bigger ones, wouldn't it be safe to believe that any such wrong-doing would literally obliterate these people out of business and the possibility of doing future business? Naiive as this may sound, I'm still old school on these things. So how big of a risk are we talking? Big enough to go straight to the master fund (GBP based vs EUR based, for all I understand)?

1526	Financebankingtaxation	WARNING! Fee to give up US citizenship increased to $2,350	MennoFloyd	-	0	Location: Deutschschweiz	28.08.2014, 03:16	" 
			
			There's someone in Canada, apparently Toronto, who is trying to get rid of his US citizenship before the price goes up to $2,350 on September 12. The Toronto consulate is backed up until January 2015 and Montreal until  mid-October. Here's ""Krackjack's"" status report on Isaac Brock:   
""Update for all, 
 So I have learned a couple of things in this whole exercise. That I thought I would share with everyone.  
 First off, there is no continuity between consulates. I have  contacted about 10-15 different consulates. The one in the Bahamas has  been very helpful, the one is Bermuda has said that they do not allow  for out of there service area to apply for renunciation and it takes two  visits at least two weeks apart. The Mexico City had a tone that was  very official stating the importance of understanding what you are  doing. 
The Tijuana one was much more friendly in tone and had a simple process in order to accomplish the renunciation.  
 Second, it seems as though there has been a breakdown in  communication or at least not an acknowledgement of the new fees. A  couple of the consouls have said that they are still going to be  charging $450 for the renouncing fees. With no indication of the new  fees mentioned. They are either ignorant of the fact or being very  disingenuous by not telling people up front about the upcoming changes.  
 At this point I have an appointment booked in Nassau on September 11.  
 So just waiting to see if anyone else comes through with better  options. But it looks like I will be flying to Nassau for the priviledge  of losing my American Citizenship.  
 What a farce.""

1529	Financebankingtaxation	Easiest way to make a payment to a domestic (CH) account	el_jefe	1255	3	Location: Zürich	27.08.2014, 01:18	" 
			
			Many thanks to you both!   
I should have clarified that this is currently a one-off payment, but setting up a proper online transfer for future rent payments would certainly be ideal.     
For now, I think I will stop by the Zürcher Kantonbank to inquire about making the payment there.  The fact that it is immediate, free, and involves one less party in the transfer make it sound like the best way to go.     
In the future, after I have my residence permit in process, I can hopefully dump some cash into a PostFinance account and use that for payments.  I fell it makes sense to stay within the local system when possible.     
For future readers, I'll post an update if I run into anything unexpected at the bank... but hopefully not!

1531	Financebankingtaxation	Working in Geneva, living in London - Double Taxation?	odoacre	920	0	Location: Geneva	23.08.2014, 02:26	" 
			
			Hi all,    
I did some research, but I can't quite find an answer to my question. Long story short, I am going to start working in Geneva. I am going to to there every now and then and taxation will happen at source. I am an EU national (not UK) and I am going to do my PhD in London, where I have a full-time student status.    
I am still formally resident in my country of nationality, and so I was last year, during my master's in the UK. I really don't know what could happen to me, taxation-wise. Anyone?   
Thanks a lot!

			Hi    
I am new to the forum. I've looked through the other posts and am trying to piece together an answer to the following (apologies if this is covered elsewhere).   
In a nutshell, I am trying to establish if CGT would apply if I moved to Switzerland upon the sale of my business. I believe it depends upon Canton but any guidance appreciated   
- I am UK citizen and been resident of Monaco for 4 years 
- If I sell my business (UK company) and moved to Switzerland (say Geneva), would I be liable to pay CGT on the sale of the business   
Any other advice on ongoing taxes payable is welcomed.   
Thanks in advance

I just skimmed through, but it seemed clear that what they're selling is not the data nor the actual identities of individuals, but the facility for 3rd-parties to target users based on the bank's own analysis of spending patterns. Which is no different from what many banks and other businesses have been doing for years.   
Importantly, the customer still has to give permission for the bank to target him with these 3rd-party offers, so shouldn't really make any difference to most sane people.

1547	Financebankingtaxation	Bank Docs to Comply with FATCA	Lienera	1763	10	Location: Uri	13.08.2014, 08:20	"    I'm not sure it's as bad as that. Salary and other funds transmission can be made to the account of your non-US Person spouse.   
FWIW things could be worse. I have seen a demand from Crédit Suisse to a depositor that his/her account be, or be made, compliant not only with US tax rules but UK tax law as well. And HMRC followed up rather quickly with a demand for an attestation (they did not require proof) that bank income had been declared on self assessment forms SA106.    
Swiss banks have been exorbitant in their demands to depositors with a EU/US connection. It isn't obvious that the banks can actually do much when they also hold mortgages and their depositors are net debtors, but of course they can try, and they can intimidate. As early as 2010 Swiss banks were withdrawing mortgage commitments they had made to US Persons, but as for mortgages already made I think they are stuck for the duration.

1550	Financebankingtaxation	Strange inheritance situation	amogles	898	4	Location: Zurich	12.08.2014, 12:26	" 
			
			Simple answer: No she can't worm her way out. She accepted the inheritance. She is now liable for the debts too...   
Her best bet is to do the ""Selbstanzeige"". The tax bill she will end up with is going to be much lower than if she continues to refuse. With a selbstanzeige they only backdate tax owing for 5 years (I think), whereas otherwise they will go back the full 10 years (again I think it's 10, I may be wrong in the numbers... Ask a tax lawyer to be sure).    
If the money (600k) was taken out of the accounts prior to death then there's little she can do. Had she been a legal heir she could have had some legal options to demand the money be paid to her. As she is not.. she doesn't. If it was cashed out after the lady's death, then legally it is her money and she has recourse to try and get it back. I'd start with those who had the paper work  .   
Eitherway, she should consult an inheritance and tax lawyer. ASAP.

			Hello All,   
It's a while since I used the forum, but thought there might be someone out there who can help me...   
Been back in the UK for two years but still have my ZKB bank account. Occasionally I log in to check the little bit of money I left in there for any surprise tax bills etc..   
I've never had a problem with the texts the online banking website sends to my mobile with an additional passcode. However, since I changed to an iPhone 5s on the same number, I just don't receive the TAN code that ZKB sends.    
I called ZKB who insist that the texts were sent with no issues at their end. I checked the number registered is correct and updated my iOS software on the phone - still no luck. I get other texts without issue so just wondering is there something else I'm missing?   
Any help or advice would be much appreciated,   
Richard

1558	Financebankingtaxation	Transferring savings from UK to CH	Merelli	819	2	Location: Ollon	05.08.2014, 10:52	"    Correct as far as I know. But really, how much tax would you pay on UK rental income? If you have no other UK income, then potentially nothing, or very little, unless you're renting out a huge mansion.   
And you do know that the percentages for the Swiss wealth tax are really very low?      Of course it counts.      Sorry to disappoint. But really, the numbers involved here are for most people probably quite small, so I don't think you have too much to worry about.

1559	Financebankingtaxation	Good Guaranteed returns from Investment.	swagata.manna	1271	3	Location: ZURICH	03.08.2014, 17:46	" 
			
			I think first and foremost the idea that there is a truly ""guaranteed"" investment needs to be dispelled. A guarantee is only as robust as the institution issuing it. One can choose between different levels of risk. E.g. US government bonds are considered very low risk investments, people sometimes going as far as labeling them `risk-free` in literature (mainly for financial instrument price modeling purposes). Note that US government bonds are guaranteed only as far as the US government promising to pay their obligations. Only recently this promise has been nearly broken (look up the 2013 debt crisis).   
Investments where the notional is guaranteed are also not entirely risk free. In case the bank/institution collapses, there is no telling when/if clients get their money back. Governments can decide not to pay their obligations or restructure them such that bond holders have to take a hit.   
All this factors into the interest on a ""guaranteed"" investment. Some years ago, one could open a bank account in Cyprus and harvest a nice and cool 6-7% interest rate. This was deemed risk free by many people. They were not investing in anything after all, just opening a bank account. Only last year cyprus went tits up and many people lost a lot of money by simply having their money in a bank.   
With that being said, the safest investments by retail standard will not yield more than a 1% a year, if even that. As other posters wrote, one is looking at small fractions of a percent. With sums below 10k, the interest minus account fees will be far below inflation in all likelihood. There is no real point speculating about the options here unless OP wants to park at least a six figure sum since it will not be worth the time spent.

My first advice would be to ask directly to the taxation office... Indeed, it depends of your type of working permit (tax at source or not).   
Also, you could find some informations here (in french):   (See section 2.2 on page 6).   
Basically, what it says: 
- You pay taxes based on your income only, but... 
- The taxation rate will be based on the total income (you + your wife). 
- And finally everything will depend on the double taxation convention, and for that I strongly advise you to see directly with the taxation office.

1572	Financebankingtaxation	Quellensteuer and doubts on the percentage	Evren79	979	2	Location: Zurich	26.07.2014, 21:42	" 
			
			Thank a lot Swisspea. 
I do receive a yearly statement from the company and I am sure they do pay taxes, I was just in doubt whether I was paying the right amount or too much. The thing is my payslip does not show how much they pay for my insurance but I take it it's the difference between what's stated as gross salary and taxable salary next to the Quellesteuer item.    
I think this pretty much clarifies my doubts and I guess I am paying what I should, I'll just check if it's correct for the amount for the insurance not to appear in the payslip.   
Thanks again for your help!  "	Posts: 50	Join Date: Sep 2012	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 36 Times in 17 Posts	earned some respect
1573	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss Banking laws amended to allow confiscations of bank deposits	Bichon	6320	62	Location: Ascona	21.04.2013, 18:15	" 
			
			What do you mean by ""confiscation"" here?   
If you are referring to depositor protection of up to 100'000 CHF (with nothing above 100'000 being protected unless you bank with a Cantonal bank that provides an unlimited guarantee, which in theory sounds great but in practice may be questionable), this is not really new and has been around since 2005. The scheme is required under Federal law and pushes all Swiss banks to effectively bail out the troubled Swiss bank:    
Most Swiss Cantonal Banks have an unlimited guarantee on bank liabilities, fully backed by the respective Cantonal government under Cantonal law. BEKB and BCV have no such cantonal guarantees and BCGE has a limited cantonal guarantee which will be fully phased out by 2016. In my view, Cantonal guarantees create an incentive for risky behavior which may push a bank to insolvency and force the canton to bail them out with taxpayer's (read ""depositor's"") money.   
If Switzerland were indeed to pass confiscatory measures à la Chypre, the consequences to the Swiss economy (which is in very solid shape compared to the ROW) would be so extreme and the resulting capital flight would literally turn the country insolvent.

			ATM machines warns you if they are going to charge you a third party fee. 
If you go to a normal bank ATM usually there is not 3rd party fee. 
If you cash from the small ATM in the grocery store in USA, then yes   
I never paid such a fee   
your solution is also good, but not very convenient for me 
I would prefer postfinance over dkb; maybe give a try to postfinance   
with postfinance, you just cash worldwide incl. Germany like you cash in Zurich   
no effort, no transfer, no planning....

			HI MDA,   
I'm new to this forum and intend to introduce myself in the appropriate subforum and all, but I saw your message and figured I could help.   
Although I moved to Vaud, at the beginning of my research I thought I would be commuting from Geneva to Vaud on a daily basis and took a look at banking.   
My personal opinion is that you are better off with PostFinance. The Private Account + ATM card is free if you have over 7'500 SFR. with them. Their ATM card allows for withdrawals worldwide for 5 CHF (look for the PLUS logo at the ATM!). No payments outside Switzerland though.    
So offset that drawback I also got a VISA credit card for an annual fee of 50 CHF. Honestly, it works everywhere in the world and I use it also here for buying stuff as they give you back 0.5% on every purchase so, if you spend enough, it may be even free! Also, the PostFinance credit card has the lowest foreign currency transaction fees I've seen so far: 0.9%. You'll need the B permit for this, but take it step by step    
Once I'll have over 25'000 with them (getting there...) I'll switch to the (also free with a balance of 25'000) Private Plus Account, which is basically the same thing but they waive ATM withdrawal fees worldwide.   
I think PostFinance is ideal for people like me who are starting out in Switzerland as their products are straight forward. It's also the cheapest.   
Later on I might be finding myself asking in this forum about investment accounts and the like.   
Welcome!

			The advice I got from a Swiss tax advisor  was against transferring my UK private pension for the following reason :   
1. If you want transfer your UK pension overseas it needs to go into a QROPS (qualified registered overseas pension scheme). Schemes like this promise to keep your funds in a bubble that replicates UK pensions environment, eg no withdrawal before 55. This is to ensure that you don't transfer overseas and then withdraw it all straight away for example.    
2. Say your employers (company a) scheme is QROPS, great. But if you change jobs  to another company (company b)  with a pension fund you MUST  transfer your entitlement from company a to company number.    
3. What happens if company b pension fund isn't a QROPS? Well the UK tax man could come after you.    
Now if you're close to or over 55 then it isn't such a problem. Also of you're sure you're not moving employers you can take a punt.    
Basically beware.

1580	Financebankingtaxation	2nd pillar lump sum withdrawal	FULMNTE	1278	0	Location: US	22.07.2014, 15:36	" 
			
			Great Forums! 
I did a search on this site and it appears that there are many different answers about the taxation of 2nd pillar lump sum distributions, so here is my specific situation:       -  German Citizen, moved to U.S. in Nov 1997 on anon-immigrant visa     -  Green Card in 2000     -  U.S. citizen in 2006     I worked and lived 8 years in Switzerland before moving to the U.S. During that time, I paid into a Swiss 2nd pillar/Pensionkasse. I made no more payments after moving into the U.S., but the fund accumulated deferred interest. The Pensionskasse will now cancel my membership by end of 2014 and I will be forced to receive the whole investment as a lump sum payment minus the SwissQuellensteuer.     I did declare the Swiss 2nd pillar on the IR Sand Dept of Treasury forms all these years as foreign deferred interest account.     Questions:     -  I assume that I will have to report all the deferred interest since Nov 1997 on my 2014 1040 Schedule B as an ordinary income, is that correct? I am ok with that...     I will not have to declare any employee and employer contributions to the plan as income because they are from before I became tax liable in theU.S., correct?     -  Can I declare the Quellensteuer paid inSwitzerland for foreign tax credit? Or should I get the Swiss Tax back as partof the US-Swiss Tax Treaty? I saw a Swiss form for re-imbursement of Quellensteuer that needs to be signed by a 'US tax respesentative'. Who would actually sign this in the US?     Any advice is appreciated Sorry if I overlooked the correct answer in my search...

A note to OP: everything is relative. Perhaps (given that you are Asian) you are used to million+ inhabitants in the same city and will find Basel quite a small village. Or you could come from a very small town in your home country and see that Basel really is a huge metropolis. That notwithstanding, coming by bike to Basel from the surrouding Baselland cities seems quite nice, as I see people doing this everyday. Also, the public transportation is, IMHO, very good.   
Best of luck to yall.

Ah, sorry. Ok.    
In Bern we would get the federal tax and the cantonal/local bills at the same time, from the same address, too. I know i could call a single number if i had a question about either. In Winterthur, i.e., Canton Zurich, they are separate. We get the cantonal/local each year, and in June of this year we recieved our first federal tax bill for 2012. The local tax bills come  from Winterthur and the federal from Bulach.  Maybe the difference was that we lived  in a small commune just outside of the city of  Bern, but Winti is a separate city from Zurich.    
We've never paid quellensteuer - no idea what that is in French, but for example what you pay with a B permit - taxes taken out of salary at source (employer).

In addition, the interest rates in CH are in general lower, are there any banks in CH that finance property in DE. E.g., in Thurgau?

I'm going to attempt to use TurboTax and see how they deal with the ""Other Income"" category.    
By this point, I think I've read every (recent) thread on this topic on EF - from that research, I think you're right, you either put employer contributions on Line 7 and don't apply the income exclusion (shown in Line 21) to that amount, or put it on Line 21 somehow.

			The amount you can pay into your 2nd pillar will depend on a variety of factors and it's the caisse which will be able to tell you how much you can pay in. 
The totality of the amount you pay in is tax-deductible. Note, in many cases, the tax is the primary reason for making payments into the 2nd pillar. Also it's also worth spreading the in-payments over several years. 
Note also, that you won't be able to withdraw your capital from the 2nd pillar if you do this, or at least not if you pay in during the last 5 years of your career, or else the tax people will get back at you.

			Most people don't realize that in your 2nd pillar you have an obligatory part and a sur-obligatory.   
1) The reform proposed by the federal government is only for the obligatory part. 
2) every amount you invest in 2nd pillar to reduce taxes goes in the sur-obligatory part 
3) the reform proposed does not affect those who leave the country. It wants to lilt the cash out for buying a house, starting an independent business or at retirement.   
For your information, there is about 800 billion CHF in LPP....145 billion in the obligatory part and 655 billion CHF in the sir-obligatory part.   
I will stay invest in my LPP to reduce my tax burden.

1607	Financebankingtaxation	Wealth Tax in Switzerland - seeking clarification, information	midwestlady	25091	55	Location: ohio	27.10.2010, 15:21	" 
			
			Nearly all your assets outside Switzerland will be included in the calculation of wealth tax, including those held in tax-efficient wrappers (like the 529 college plan).  Typically you need to declare any liquid assets, your house, and your cars.  Jewellery isn't declared, to my knowledge.   
I haven't heard about any exemption for a house in a foreign country -- as far as I know, the house is considered when calculating wealth.  You can, of course, deduct the value of any mortgage you have on the house, so you're only paying on the equity in the house.   
Unless you're fantastically wealthy, I wouldn't worry too much about the wealth tax.  In my case (with a ""reasonable"" amount of wealth and a salary above the US Foreign Earned Income Exemption level), my Swiss tax liability was lower than my US tax liability, eg, I ended up owing US taxes in addition to my Swiss taxes.  So regardless of the wealth tax, my overall tax burden was the same.  The only difference the wealth tax made was the size of the cheque I wrote to the Swiss vs. US tax authorities.

1610	Financebankingtaxation	Freelance taxation	kavehentezar	702	0	Location: Bern	01.07.2014, 16:23	" 
			
			Hi guys,   
I am a student in Bern and I have found a freelance job in a start-up company in Zurich for their supply chain management. They have decided to pay a small amount of money monthly, however, I am not familiar with swiss laws regarding taxation and what do I have to do in this case! I was wondering if you could shed some light and tell me more about taxation, AHV and if there are anything else that I have to know!    
Thanks

1612	Financebankingtaxation	Quellensteuer [withholding tax] after kanton change	Sikalnz	4411	15	Location: Bern	29.09.2011, 10:15	"       The above is misleading.  
You are taxed at the rate for where you are living in that month.   
Quellensteuer is calculated by the canton tax authority, using federal guidelines. The employers use tables issued by the canton tax authority. If you live outside the canton where you work, the employer must get the relevant tables.   
Here is a link for Canton Berne, see paragraph 3.1 (6) http://www.fin.be.ch/fin/de/index/st...erungen_de.pdf  
Note that it states there, that the actual withholding taxation is made each month, and is calculated on the date of the salary payment, not where you are at 31st December. (That is only relevant for Swiss and C permit holders). 
Google:    The withholding tax is deducted at the time of payment, bank transfer, credit or computation or demand except maybe at the source taxable person. The tariff classification must be checked before any withholding tax.  Die Quellensteuer ist im Zeitpunkt der Auszahlung, Überweisung, Gutschrift oder der Verrechnung abzuziehen bzw. allenfalls bei der quellenbesteuerten Person einzufordern. Die Tarifeinstufung ist vor jedem Quellensteuerabzug zu prüfen.      "	Posts: 8	Join Date: Apr 2010	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 3 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Hi 
Thanks to everyone for their support on this. I spoke today to ABB Kinderkrippe today and they were fantastic. They will write  to the Betreibungsamt this week (no charge) to get the debt removed and have also agreed for the landlord to call them directly if needed to explain it.   
The new landlord didn't see any issues with it and feels happy that its an honest mistake with a solution in hand. It didn't seem to be a blocker for them as the guy mentionned that ""if you get the apartment, you can just send the new documentation afterwards"".   
I'll keep my fingers crossed, but appreciate your advice

It is so frustrating to have to take the word of an ex wife as to existing assets, since she started off saying he was penniless and now we have uncovered millions. All of the money was hidden in bank accounts outside of Zurich- I have found 8 accounts  so far. None reported on tax return , so I know I have to pay those. no property, no car even was reported-I guess that crime does pay- for some people.

			Transportation budget looks low. If you don't plan to have a car, investigate the various public transport ticketing options for the area where you'll live. You can buy tickets per trip, per day, per week, per month, etc.    
If you're going to do a lot of traveling (why not!) consider the GA - the annual pass that lets you go on just about any bus, train, tram, ship, in the country. It is a big chunk up front but is worth it for many people. Also I think you can deduct at least part of the cost from your taxes.

			Hi all,   
I am Swiss and just recently relocated to the US. I am wondering if I have to declare my 2nd and 3rd pillar accounts next year when I am filling my first tax form in the US.   
What about the interest earned on my retirement accounts, are they subject to US income tax?   
I was also told by someone that if I want to fill as jointly I would need to declare the whole year in the US, even though I entered the US on my L1B Visa end of April. Is that true?   
Anyone in the same situation?   
Thanks

			Hi,   
You can report it on your end of year tax return. I have been in exactly the same position where I did some freelance work in-between jobs. there is a box on the tax return in Vaud exactly for this.   
You will need to look into the AVS. I forgot about this and received a hefty bill from them once my tax return had been posted.   
Don't know if you plan to do much more work, but be wary of the VAT as well. I think it is mandatory to register for VAT at about 75000 CHF per annum.

			Assuming you are: 
1. Working in Switzerland, with an L-permit 
2. Paid from the UK, on a UK payroll   
In this case, your employer needs to run a shadow payroll for Switzerland in order to pay social security contributions and tax at source.

			That's always been the case so I don't see why anyone would think otherwise, if you haven't paid in the full amount you won't get the full pension.    
Nor is the £155 a set figure yet either as far as I can see from the government website:       
Just says it'll be no less than £148.40 a week, but the exact figure won't be set until autumn next year. If you're born before certain dates you won't get it either - which is the case for me.

- don't spend more than 1/3 of your gross income on accomodation (be it rent or mortgage) 
- save at least 1/10 of your net income every month (1/6 is average apparently) 
- always have at least three months of salary in reserve and don't touch that money except in dire need. 
- remember to put some money aside for the tax man 
- if you're spending the rest, that's fine   
Of course whether or not this is realistic can depend on many circumstances.

			FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network), the US Treasury's unit that is responsible for the infamous FBAR, has engaged in illegal hiring practices, according to the New York Post:   
""The Office of Personnel Management, a federal agency that governs labor  practices in the government, determined that the Treasury’s Financial  Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, illegally screened  candidates in a quest to hire only lawyers for certain jobs, the  officials said.""     
Referring to US government hiring regulations, and not to the FBAR, a consultant said: “  that a  normal layperson looking at this says, ‘I can see why they would want  someone with this skill,’ but that is contrary to how the government  operates.”   
According to the article, the illegal hiring case has been recommended to the OPM's Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel. The  job offers for the 11 lawyers were rescinded earlier this year.    
Menno, of course, hopes that FinCEN will get out of its sticky wicket soon so that it doesn't miss a day in helping US expats to comply with the byzantine FBAR rules.

If you already have a Visa card, I don't think you need a prepaid MasterCard.   
Traveler's chèques are okay as long as you use them in big cities or major tourist attractions. They are not always being accepted in remote areas of USA or Canada. Also if you are purchasing (exchanging) $ or C$, ask for $20, C$20 notes. Avoid $50 and $100 notes... Enjoy your trip!

			I do the single payment option. 
You don't need to fill in all the address info. 
Fill in the name of Beneficiary: PayPal International Ltd 
Leave everything else as it is. 
On the Notification line(s) I always put my email address that is linked to the paypal account and the transaction code (from the paypal info.) 
If you want to put a booking text, it's up to you, that just appears on your statement. 
That's it I think.

Use the pdf linked here (probably the ""N"" version with no church tax)   which shows the tax rates in Aargau based on income (for tax at source)   
At the moment he will be paying tax at level BxN where x is however many children you have. Once you start earning he will move to the table CxN.   
If you are living abroad, is he coming ""home"" at least every two weeks - if so he may be able to also deduct the cost of the flights and something towards the cost of the swiss appartment plus additional living costs. All this would need to be done yearly between Jan-Mar for the previous year.

			It sounds like your company have paid kantonal tax but not federal tax. If they haven't paid the federal tax the 8k could be about right for a salary under 120k. We receive our tax bills at various times over a 2 year period for each year. Provisional kantonal tax bill in feb after the relevant tax year, them bundes tax in the April, then the final tax bills a year later. For example we have only just paid in full for 2012. If the bill is unexpected or you have cash flow issues they do let you pay it in instalments, with interest added at the end. You just need to speak to the gemeinde and they send out a new bill.

			There is no need to declare anything and there is no tax to pay on the transfer.   
For wealth tax purposes it should also make no difference, as wealth tax is on your worldwide assets anyway so it should be included on your tax declaration whether it is in a UK account or a Swiss account.

1665	Financebankingtaxation	Becoming a local employee after some time as an expatriate...	cpatenall	728	0	Location: Chernex	27.05.2014, 12:37	" 
			
			Hello, all, good to be making my first post after some time as a lurker...   
I've been working, and paying taxes, in Vaud as an expatriate from my UK company for about three years, and am considering a firm offer to become a local (Swiss based) employee.   
I have a UK pension with about 27 years of contributions, which I will stop contributing to when I make the move, and start to contribute to my Swiss employer's scheme.   
I only plan to work here for two or three more years, and then take early retirement and move back to the UK and find some part time work to top up my UK and (tiny) Swiss pensions.   
Are there any major potential pitfalls with regard to taxes, UK state pensions, pension arrangements in general, that I should look deeper into before committing to the move?   
Thanks in advance to any insights or information you can share!

1666	Financebankingtaxation	Tax question from one going mad	dorrie iten	740	1	Location: zurich	23.05.2014, 17:33	" 
			
			I assume you are saying that you did not include the Swiss Social Secuirty on your US Form 1040, is that correct?  If so, I believe you will be fine.  The Swiss Social Security is not taxable under the treaty.  You technically should have been completing a Form 8833 every year that it was not disclosed, claiming a treaty position.  It would not make sense to file amended returns, as it will not change the taxable income or tax due.  I would suggest filing a form 8833 going forward, claiming the tax treaty provision.   
Hope this helps!

Tax liability will only be on approx 105 k due to AHV, unemployment insurance & pension contribution. 
Deduct 3% training costs , 2.5k health insurance , lunch & travel costs will give a taxable income BELOW 95k , so roughly the same liability tax at source.

			Thanks for responding. Problem is, with such nasty vibes as there are now between Switz and U.S., the folks at Internal Revenue have succeeded in intimidating us, and punishing us, going after the small fish while they should be going after the large ones. So while my moral compass is veering wildly from north to south, I can't decide what to do. If I confess that I have just forgotten to pay my Swiss social security, will they believe me? Well, that is what I intend to do, and it is, in fact, the case. I think I believed subconsciously that what I get here for SS, considering the peanuts they pay me there, I should darn well keep! All of it! Especially considering that I am taxed here on it, as well! What a joke..

			See here for details:     
= In general you can only reclaim actual tax and duty. Administartive and handling fees are not reclaimable.  
- There will be a fee of at least CHF 30 for this.    
OR: You may do an exchange/repair delivery. But then sender has to clearly state that smaller dress is an exchange for the large one. Not all sender are capable of doing the paperworkfor correctly for this. If the paperwork is not in order you may be stung with other handling fees and additional tax and duty. Tax and duty may be reclaimable if you can prove the exchange delivery.

			I read your topic very quickly-   
But seems to me that you want to know how much tax will be applied to you-   
Why not doing it yourself?   
1)You're local or have special situation which makes you doing the full declaration. Then use fritax. Then you will know the total amount of taxes owe or due to you, and divide that by 12 to know how much it is per month.   
or Comparis with ""Tax Calculator"":         
2)You're taxed ""a la source"" then the calculations are a bit more complex. It depends on your employer, the month, etc... 
You could use Comparis and ""withholding tax"".   . 
It might not be 100% accurate, but close- The variations depend on your monthly pay, if you get extra, etc...     
Again to be accurate, you could make a ""simplified declaration""  (something with different name in Fribourg):   (google translate it)   
Or to accept the ""withholding tax"" made by your employer/state and just divide the total paid in a year by 12 to know the monthly tax rate.     
That's the 2 ways you have to know how much tax you would have to pay monthly or yearly.

			If you are transferring any amount of money between US and CH be very careful about what exchange rate you are offered (check in relation to the interbank rate) and ask about fees. Usually banks on both ends take a cut and you have little visibility ahead of time. I have been very happy with the services provided by Worldfirst.com. They take a % of the interbank rate, but no other fees and you have the option to place orders targeting a specific rate. Super transparent and easy process. 
Good luck!

			Normally ""Warranty Return"" would suffice, this is the phrase that was used when I was receiving goods in the UK that were being sent back to the customer in the US.   
However you may have two problems, firstly that their was no record of the laptop being returned to the US for repair, and secondly by implication from your post, it is friends shipping it to you rather than Dell so custom may find it suspicious that something is coming as a warranty item from a private shipper.   
Best bet might be to contact Fedex/UPS or US customs and get their input as that is what they do as mostly here you will get a persons best guess rather than a definitive answer.

			I had the same situation. UBS refused to make our two accounts joined (or make one account joint I mean), and the family pack sucks if you do not need two credit cards, then it is expensive.   
So we both left UBS, and went to PostFinance. They do normal joint accounts, and you can have one account each to yourself as well, and if you want to, add power of attorney to those, so one of you can deal with all accounts online in one go. Very handy if usually one of you pays the bills, as you can choose between all the accounts then, or transfer instantly between accounts etc.   
The only thing PostFinance did not offer us is an account for the rental deposit. So our mietzinskonto stays with UBS, but it does not attract fees by the way. (They also offer accounts in other currencies, e.g. Euro, which is free if over >7500 CHF a month on average (not each day >10k as with UBS), and in other currencies like AUD for 2 CHF per month).

			Could not the grandparents in this situation set up an account in their own name and specify in a will that account X is for grandchild X and account Y is for grandchild Y - or a single account with the according percentages for each grandchild? Would this be that much worse in terms of tax liability? Because if not, it may save a lot of complication (e.g. opening a non-resident account for a minor).   
If they don't die when the age limit is reached, transfer as lump sum (tax trigger). If they die, inheritance tax.

			If the problem is the volume, most banks offer USB connected readers where you can scan them into the e-banking avoiding having to type them in.   
 Otherwise, no option really. Orange slips are often the only way to pay bills here.. old fashioned? Absolutely.  But the reason why they are the norm is the extremely low cost (to the company), compared to credit cards.    
After all, when you get points on your credit cards, where do you think these are coming from? From the very high fees that card companies charge the businesses for each transaction, ie, you who perhaps paid a higher price so that the shop owner can afford to accept credit cards.

			Hi thanks for all the replies.   
The coins may have a value to someone, but most are modern coins (there are a few old ones in the bags of 10 and 20 rappen, but I haven't the patience to sort through them).  There are a few thousand francs in the larger 1/2 and up coins, which aren't too bad to roll or spend, but the 1000 francs in 5, 10 and 20 rappen presents the problem, as we'd love to do more than sit and roll coins over our holiday.  We are doing a similar thing in Germany with euros and DM but the Deutsche Bundesbank is an easy stop to get them converted there.

You have to pay tax on this (Quellensteuer) and the amount of tax is dependent on the canton where the financial institution which holds your account is based. If it is in a high tax canton, it may be worth transferring it first to one in a low tax canton then transferring the balance to your foreign bank account.   
Canton Schwyz is a preferred canton for these sorts of arrangements because of the lower tax.    
I don't believe that you need the services of an intermediary for such transfers.

			First time on this forum....my question is:   
How are AHV benefits declared on US Income Tax forms?   
2013 was the first year I became eligible to receive AHV (pillar 1) benefits.  My pension is a small amount since I was employed only one year but paid into the AHV regularly throughout the past 27 years.     
I know I must claim these benefits on my Swiss taxes and pay tax on it, but I am thinking that I also need to pay taxes on this AHV amount  on my US income tax.   
From my limited understanding of reading the tax guide and instructions for form 1040, I think I need to enter my AHV amount under line 16a ""pensions & annuities"", but I am wondering about 16b ""taxable amount""?  Is there a formula which determines if these are taxable or not?   I have also seen mention of Form 1116 Foreign Tax Credit.  The instructions to this form are like Greek to me!  Can anyone advise me?

			Austrian law.    
Hmm, thats the Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch.          Unless your contract states something else, the gerneral contractual rule in Austria is: If you are unhappy with the service rendered you can either request fulfilment plus a penalty for a delayed delivery, or request fulfilment within a resonable time limit or cancealtion of contract if there is still no fulfilment.   
Do not expect anything else then requests for payments if you do not follow the procedures set by the law.   
As state above: Registred mail is the way to go for this.

If technical analysis would work, all those companies making technical analysis software should be making tons of money and not selling the software.   
Technical analysis is self-defeating. No serious media house takes into account this method, that's why they don't even mention it. Why? Because its like alchemy, like magic, has no foundations, no theory behind it.

1739	Financebankingtaxation	Einzelfirma as a B-Permit holder	ToniT	1602	5	Location: Zug	21.03.2014, 13:58	"     
You can have your own Einzelfima if you have a B permit.     
You will pay income tax at the end of the financial year (so the next year) when you get your income declaration papers from the tax office. When you have an Einzelfirma you declare the income on your personal tax declaration. (I recommend having an accountant to do it all)     
Companies here (your big companies) like to use agencies because it makes their life easier. Agencies in CH take a huge commission for doing very little and they minimize their liability by having you be payrolled. If you are pay-rolled and you have a B permit you will pay tax at source. (the agency will deduct the tax from your income and pay it in on your behalf)

G: you calculate taxes is your country of residence (Exception: Work in Geneva). Depending on the country, the Swiss will want different things from you.

			Hello everyone,    
Apologies first, if my question is answered in one of the digests, but I was not able to find it. Thanks up front to those who help me find it/them.    
I have swiss nationality, but I now live overseas, along with my family (we are all registered at the local Swiss Embassy).    
I know that foreign non-residents in CH can claim deductions on CH income, for family back home, mortgage back home, etc. etc.    
I'm thinking of coming back to CH for work. However, family would still be overseas.    
As a CH citizen working in CH, can I still claim tax deductions for my overseas expenses - e.g. overseas family expenses, overseas mortgage interest (primary residence? even though I would have to register in CH), etc? I would be in Kt. Zurich.    
TIA!

			What I've seen: 
- The numbers of both earnings are put together 
- The mortgages come into the equation somewhere, I never understood where 
- The deductions valid in Switzerland are applied  
- The marriage tax scale is applied to get the right % 
- The earnings are split again and those from Switzerland are taxed with the % applicable 
- The UK tax people do what they want, the Swiss tax office doesn't care 
- For assets, ask the tax office, I don't know cases.   
The tax office in Basel is quite good, they even coordinated with Italian tax authorities, a colleague of mine's husband works in Italy. So it works.    
Depending on the canton, it is more favorable or less favorable to be married when calculating taxes. To be clarified with your canton, dear OP.

I have an sarl which is pretty much dormant as I have a full time position now.     
Is it possible to do the end of year filings myself or must I go through an accountant? I just want to avoid paying for what is essentially a dormant company - last years receipts would have been less than 15k.   
Also I am the sole owner of the company and would like my wife to take full ownership.  How can I do this?  Do I need to go through legal again?

			I suggest you contact your cantonal tax office first.  That's where your husband would send his form to I think and they should be able to advise you on what to do next.  If they're anything like Fribourg's office, they'll be quite helpful and will even help you fill out any forms needed.  And they're free.    After all, they want to make sure people pay what taxes they owe so have every incentive to help you get it right.

			You probably should have a look at Spain's double taxation treaty with Switzerland (which would be available in Spanish somewhere in the Spanish tax website). These treaties tend to be similar regardless of country but it is better to check the specific one. How the swiss Quellensteuer in particular works within these treaties confuses me.   
For a specific tax year (note that e.g. the UK does not start the tax year in January - I don't know about Spain) one of the typical things that counts for how to proceed is how many days you spent in one country or the other.   
Though, if someone in the forum is more knowledgeable about these topics I would also be interested in the response.

- Get an apartment in apartment hotel (with it address an contract) 
- leave my address on Geminde 
- went to Migration office and with those papers asked for Ausweiss 
- get from them a stemped copy of form that I needed to apply for Ausweiss 
- open bank account (Postbank) with that copy paper, actually I was using it for whole month for everything, because I didnt get the Ausweiss for so long. 
I opened bank account on first day, the same day that I apply for Ausweiss. I am EU, maybe that makes things different. A coworker that helped me doing this, asked at Migration office to get a proof that I am in the process of Ausweiss.

			There is this from the ch.ch website:   
Early withdrawal when becoming self-employed  
You may also draw on your pension if you become self-employed and no longer need to pay into a compulsory pension plan.   
""What you need to do 
You must provide proof to the pension company that you are self-employed, such as a rental agreement for office space, purchase of material, AHV confirmation, entry in the commercial register, etc.   Married persons must provide the written consent of their spouse (the same applies to persons in registered partnerships).""   
I don't know, but I suspect the authorities might look closely at a GmbH who suddenly has a pension plan and then closes down.  I also doubt that transferring funds from the Einzelfirma to a new GmbH would meet the criteria for taking the funds out of the account in the first place.  I'd talk to your cantonal tax authorities about this, if your accountant doesn't seem able to provide an answer.

			It does look like it.    
If you have already paid in for 5 years and are Swiss / EU citizen and you are moving outside Europe, then you can make further payments for AHV/AVS/IV into the system, PDF files in all languages here, (Only for yourself: family dependents have to qualify by themselves, children need special permission)        
You can apply here before you leave, ask for the form at your local AHV administration. 
You must apply within one year of leaving Switzerland (and thus stopping your AVS/AHV payments)

1786	Financebankingtaxation	Pay off mortgage, or stay flexible?	Phil_MCR	3652	26	Location: Basel	15.03.2014, 16:28	"    Erm, you are aware that all those mobile phones, tablets and what not you love have quite some gold in them... and Apple has probably a bigger stake in the current gold price than the Swiss national bank... anyway: Phil, I am in a similar situation and decided to pay the low interest mortgage back as slow as possible and save my money on the side. My mortgage is a rather flexible one, so yes, if interest rates would miraculously skyrocket could I still pay it back then. 
I have a terrible track record in investments, so I won't recommend anything. However, with a 10-20 horizon should it be pretty hard to not beat the Libor. And even if you don't - staying flexible simply gives you a ton of options - who knows: Maybe you want to start a company in five years and would need the capital? Maybe you see some great investment opportunity or another apartment you really love in a few years? much easier to have it in the bank already than trying to get another mortgage then.

			Hi Clint. Switzerland has since the last 2 or 3 years (I guess) been using something similar to the US credit reports. However, unlike the US credit reports, they are used here more to see that you do not have any negative credit information, as opposed to looking for a long credit history in order to trust you. Not having a job here is not a detriment but you do need to show you have some source of income. When I moved here five years ago from the States I applied for a gold credit card for which you are required to have a minimum income of 100,000 francs a year. Although I supplied my 1040 in which it showed my net income surpassed that amount, I was still asked to put a 15,000 to 20,000 deposit guarantee. But, if you do not feel like locking in that amount of money in a savings account, you can always get a Visa or Mastercard with a 5,000 CHF limit pretty easily from Cornèr Banc ( . Unfortunately, their site is only in German or French.   
As far as buying a card, you are normally asked about your employment in order to be extended some sort of financing. So, as long as you have a job here, you will be fine.

			Hi   
Does anybody here have experience filing tax returns on income earned from internships in the US on J-1 visas? I understand a non-US resident of Switzerland is potentially eligible for a tax refund, but I'm not 100% sure, based on the information I garnered from searching the web. Especially, I wasn't able to find out whether the US has a tax agreement with Switzerland stating that former J-1 interns are exempt from some or all US taxes.   
Thanks to all the US tax experts, who can shed some light here. Would be great to have some pointers regarding how one should fill out the tax forms in the above case.

I actually wrote a reply this morning from work but for some reason, it hasn't shown up.   
What I said was that you can buy a good spotting scope on the   site which is like a Swiss equivalent of Ebay. I purchase stuff there regularly.    
I took a quick look and found lots of scopes, most of which don't have bids on them yet like this example:    
The vast majority of stuff I've bought from Ricardo has been paid for at the seller's bank or at the Post Office. When asked, they enclosed a paying in slip ( ) which I duly filled in and presented with the right amount of money and  , a couple of days later I've received the goods.

			Tried to search the forums for an answer but was not successful...specific to Basel-Stadt:   
1) There is a possible tax deduction of 18000CHF for ""other personal expenses"" on page 34 of this document. Any idea what that means?       
2) Can I claim tax deductions on money that I send back to my home country every month for parental support?   
3) For work-related expenses like food, transport, etc - surely it doesnt make sense that we should keep receipts for our lunch expenses as supporting evidence? That will literally drive me crazy!   
4) If you earn more than 10000 CHF a month but only work 6 months of a tax year cos u moved to Switzerland in June/July, do you need to file a tax return for that year assuming you hold a B permit (your gross income will be much less than the 120k CHF threshold)?   
Thanks in advance for any replies!

1805	Financebankingtaxation	Corporate restructuring, distressed debt, LBOs, etc. in Switzerland?	LCF	1102	0	Location: Zug/Zurich	12.03.2014, 06:29	   Hi everyone,       The distressed debt industry in CH seems to be quite a mystery or perhaps non-existent. I am a corporate finance student at the University of Virginia researching this industry as a potential career opportunity in CH. Ive found bits of info here and there but am having trouble seeing how it all fits together and characterizing its culture within CH. Does anyone on here know the inside scoop?        I do realize that CH is tiny with fewer conditions for bankruptcies. But Im still hopeful to find a job in this area! Im trying to find out who the biggest players are and what the industry culture is like (Ive searched in German as well). I have found companies such as Capvis and Partners Group, but cant find much info aside from whats already on their websites. CS and UBS are both huge players in the US and globally but I cant find a single job posting on either of their websites which works specifically in this industry. I have found a lot of information on the legal structure of bankruptcies, but little on deals and movements here. It seems like few PE or other funds specialize 100%, i.e. carry out LBOs, etc. but rather invest partially in distressed debt securities without taking a major stake (hopefully Im totally wrong).   I would be delighted if anyone working in this industry could share some inside information on the topic. I will gladly invite you for coffee, cakes, etc. if you would be willing to help a student (I am here for Spring break).   Thank you very much for reading and any advice!

1808	Financebankingtaxation	Quellensteuer tax filing?	zxd	1000	1	Location: Zurich	11.03.2014, 11:53	" 
			
			I dont know about St Gallen, but other cantons (VD, ZH) have a form for re-calculation of the Quellensteuer, just for cases like that.    
(If it exists, you may have to act quickly.. in VD they only accept it up to 15 march.).    
But note,  : they will only ""spread out"" the salary within the months you worked for the same employer and at the same % (if part time).  
- So if you got a bonus one month, they will spread it out over the year (which is good). 
- But if you only worked 10 months in the year,  they they will   spread it over the months you didn't work.  
- Equally, if you changed jobs (and had different salaries), they will not spread the salary of one employer to the other. But they will even out the salaries within each job period. 
- If you worked part time and changed the % of occupation (eg from 40% to 60%), then this doesn't matter, as the % tax rate you pay is based on the FULL time 100% salary, ie, if you had worked all year at 100%.

They do seem to be going overboard with the US angle at the moment.  There's another thread where they're requesting/demanding proof of US tax compliancy or you accounts are getting frozen.    I'd try UBS or Credit Suisse instead.

1811	Financebankingtaxation	Postfinance mastercard balance	jackgedas	963	1	Location: Zurich	10.03.2014, 09:33	" 
			
			Hello,   
The account limit of 1'000 Chf is the negative amount you can reach at max.  That does not necessarily means the amount you can spend from card per month. Indeed, an example:   
- Imagine you have a 0 Chf card balance. 
- You use your card for 300 Chf. So you are at -300 Chf balance and thus spend 700 Chf more (as the limit is -1'000 Chf). 
- You load your card with 500 Chf. Your new balance is +200 Chf (-300 + 500). That means you can now spend 1'200 chf on your card (you have +200, you can reach -1'000).   
It is important to understand that you can load a credit card with more than the amount due and then have the possibility to spend more than the limit given.     
Also, for your questions, hard to answer without more informations: 
- Did you use your card after or just before paying 600 Chf?   
From what I can see, my guess is: 
- You had -1'000 Chf Balance on your account number 
- You paid 600 Chf 
- The total of the card should have been +600 Chf but maybe you used it for around 250 Chf a few day before or after loading it? That means 600 - 250 = 350 Chf. 
- That's why you only have a +350 Chf on your card instead of a +600.   
And for your question, according to the screenshot, you owe 643 Chf to the bank.   
Best regards,

			In case you don't know (and in case anyone else is reading this):   
You can file an extension to qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Credit (so that you can qualify for Swiss residency and then claim the FEIE).  Basically, you can take the FEIE for the period in 2013 that you were living abroad, as long as you later meet the requirements for the physical presence test or the bona fide residence test (basically, as long as you live overseas for a year).   
You need to send in a request for the extension, which is form 2350.   
However, the FBAR form for year 2013 still needs to be filed online by June 30, 2014.

1815	Financebankingtaxation	Need funding for MSc studies at ETH.	kirill	2861	11	Location: Belarus	05.07.2008, 21:11	" 
			
			Dear all,   
sorry if this is the wrong section.   
I was admitted for MSc program in Physics at ETH Zurich. 
They kindly granted me tuition waiver and a stipend of 3800CHF for the first year. 
According to the ETH handbook for intl students I will need around 20000CHF per year to cover my life expenses.   
So the question is how to get missing 16K? )   
Anyone aware of any stipends, scholarships, assistantships, etc that could help me? 
It seems like I will be allowed to work only after 6 month  in Switzerland but  in the handbook they do not recommend to rely on that.  
Is that possible to find a company that will pay for my studies if I agree to work for it for a couple of years after I've graduated? (I heard this sometimes works in France) 
Probably I should mention that I'm Belarus citizen which is not part of EU.   
Will appreciate any helpful information.   
Thanks,   
Kirill

I just finished my interview and if all goes to plan, sometime in the coming 6 months I should have the passport. Excited as I am, this will impact many, many things that I should plan and prepare for: driving license change, banking details, etc, etc   
My search of the fora did not give me any results to check before posting, so here goes:    
I am at present married to a Swiss but with expat, tax free, contract. Our joint gross remunerations are used to determine the bracket we fall into but then we apply it only to my wife's income. This is about to change, and not clear-cut 1st of Jan kinda change, but rather sometime mid year. Effective then, we will be a Swiss household with both contributors taxable.    
Two things:   
1) my contract: I'm working with HR to have the package equalized to accommodate taxes and still bring the same cash in the bank. They are, at this time, unclear how this is gonna work out. Hypothetically, if they say ""we ain't got no money for your swiss badge"" and gently ease me under the full blow of the tax bus - do I need my lawyer on speed dial?    
2) Taxation cut-off date - the way I see it, several scenarios: 
a) pay all 2014 taxes as before, and start paying ""as swiss"" as of 2015 
b) pay X months of 2014 as before, then 12-X months as swiss 
c) pay all 2014 taxes as swiss, since fiscal year is Jan-Dec   
Obviously, most concerning is scenario C) where some months where I was receiving expat pay I will have to retroactively pay tax on. Seems unnatural to ask employer to reach into pocket for this, so I would be on my own here. Is this scenario at all possible?    
Any tips and references welcome   "	Posts: 445	Join Date: Jul 2008	Senior Member	Groaned at 3 Times in 3 Posts	Thanked 352 Times in 134 Posts	an excellent reputation

			Or get somebody else on the phone. If that guy is from the Gemeinde contact the Kt office, or otherwise the other way around contact the Gemeinde. Ask them to explain to you why you didn't get it paid yet.

			If you want your final tax decision quickly (for example so you can fill out the US tax forms for this year) then ask them to process it quickly. Usually they will prioritize you if you ask them nicely. I'm in that situation that I need the final tax decision until mid-May, so I'll be writing them an Email after submitting my documents.

1819	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss banks-Tan generators		1083	1	Location: Zürich	05.03.2014, 20:35	" 
			
			To answer your question: I would consider Post Finance (card reader system) or for example ""SMS-TAN"" (Raiffeisenbank / several Kantonalbanken / etc) to be probably ~the safest. 
BUT your tan being ""hacked"" is actually not the danger of E-Banking. Having worked for half a year in this area I know that the real danger are Malware, Trojans, Viruses which are on your computer and just ""copy"" your session ( ). So for actual safety the most important thing is that you have an Anti-Virus software installed and use the internet safely. If you really want the safety even against such things then there's only one option I know of:    
Multiple banks offer that you can order the sentinel directly from them. For example St. Galler Kantonalbank, Thurgauer Kantonalbank, Basler Kantonalbank and also some private banks as Julius Bär. Best ask in advance if you choose another bank. But the Sentinel can also be used with (practically) any other bank.   
I hope this helps.   
Oh and one other note: There is no 100% safety. But if something happens there's a huge chance that your bank will cover any loss as it's really bad for their image if it gets public that there was a breach somewhere and a client was robbed.

The legislation is very clear.

			I would recommend a normal accountant in the UK.  Just talk to them....it should not be complicated.  I know one but have had no dealing with them for nearly 20 years!!   
I'd say you have lots of chance to avoid taxes and I'd expect a UK accountant to recommend payment in dividends, maybe via a UK limited company.

1823	Financebankingtaxation	Tax question for college loans	AngryPhysicist	709	0	Location: Zurich	02.03.2014, 15:16	" 
			
			Hello everyone, I am basically brand new here in the forums. I have  question about taxes. I am doing my masters here in Switzerland for a  over now and have been working part time. I am still dependent on my  parents for some support, especially for paying the interest on student  loans back in the US while I finish my masters here and find a much  better paying job.    
Unfortunately because of FATCA I have to do  my own taxes. I am not going to end paying anything because my income  here is less than 10k CHF. The problem is how can my parents get a tax  return on paying the loans? They are cosigners but I am technically not a  dependent anymore.   
Any insights?   
Thanks, AngryPhysicist

1824	Financebankingtaxation	URGENT HELP - Withholding Tax (Taxed at source)	Gee10	2159	18	Location: Zurich, Switzerland	27.02.2014, 19:58	"    Now I am confused  
You don't want to tie up the extra money early by paying tax at source but you would put it in a pension pot where you can't get it until you're 59 ( possibly ever!).    
Just kidding.   
But really I have been taxed at source and now I'm not, the difference that you pay isn't so much. In a way it is harder to budget because you have to set some money aside to pay the tax but you don't know how much. I was brought up on tax at source and just prefer it that way.

1825	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss Pension for US Employee	Zacharymia	1592	9	Location: Basel	31.01.2014, 10:32	" 
			
			Re Swiss pensions and US citizens: My understanding is that, essentially, anything you do to lower your Swiss tax bill will make your US tax bill increase. Also, the employer contributions to your Swiss pension fund (pillar 2) count as taxable income on your US tax declaration. The pillar 3 is a voluntary contribution that is tax deductible on the Swiss tax declaration but as stated above, it essentially just shifts the tax burden from the Swiss to the US side. It would seem to make financial sense to renounce US citizenship for long-term residents of Switzerland.

			what I found out is that the swiss pension accounts are exempt or FATCA           
However does it mean they need to be reported and taxes need to be paid on interest earned?

			There should be an easy way around this and that's to open the account only in your husband's name.  If you have no signing rights or power of attorney over it, then it doesn't have to be reported so theoretically they should agree to let you have an account.     
Otherwise, try opening the account at another branch.  People have reported here that after being refused in one branch they've been accepted at another; this has happened even at different UBS branches.   
If neither work then try UBS or Credit Suisse.  If they say no to a joint account again ask if they'll accept just your husband as signatory.

I also forgot to say that my husband and i also don't share an account with UBS (because I am American and have my own salary), so it was particularly inexcusable that they did this- as far as UBS is concerned, we are merely roommates!  When I called, furious that they had cancelled my card on my solo account without a call from me, there was no apology or explanation. They did at least waive their usual fee for replacement, though...   I am definitely not a big fish!

If your mother is UK domiciled UK IHT, she would be liable to UK IHT rules on her world wide estate, merely transferring the money to the UK is of no consequence. The liability to IHT is on the estate of the dead person, rather than the person receiving. Life time gifts utilise the Nill rate band in any case.

			We are moving to Switzerland in July 2014 to verbier . My question is, my husband works in Nigeria six weeks on six weeks off, the company pay his tax at source I.e in Nigeria. Is he liable to pay tax also in Switzerland? Also as he is only in Switzerland for 6 months of the year does he have to become residence in Switzerland or can he make Nigeria his main residence ,hence saving on healthcare as his company already pay this.    
Thank you in advance

1839	Financebankingtaxation	Voluntary Pillar 2 Contributions Cap	RichEagle	2401	2	Location: Geneva	23.02.2014, 20:11	"    If you are aboard you will be taxed at source (This goes for Swiss as for foreigners). The source is the actual place where the company resides which will do the payout from the Pillar 2 system into a regular bank account.   
There are special companies in low tax cantons (Schwyz, Zug) for just this procedure. Given you are in Geneva your tax savings may be substantial. 
Also the tax rate for the pay out is lower than for normal earnings.    
But there is a minimum waiting period of three years ( ) before you can cash out the newly added funds.   
Finally, do not cash out everything at once. Two or three payments can lower the total tax.   
Here you can find a table of different places/different tax/and different pay out amounts. (The text itself is in german, the table is half way down, numbers are numbers in German as well as in English, right?)

			You should only have to pay AHV for money earned in the years you were actually resident here. There is always a delay or catchup with these payments depending on how stable your income was from 1 year to the other. My payments were always based on the previous year until I informed SVA of changes.  
I guess it also depends on how clean you left things here when you left CH and also your desire to pay into your pension fund here. 
So....either call SVA and ask them what your obligations are, or....not

			I was asked the following question today, maybe someone of you knows a qualified answer:   
Self-employed entrepreneur with an office in Küsnacht (near Zürich). At home, he has an office room too. The room is only used as an office and has all the necessary infrastructure such as computer, telephone, books etc.   
Is a tax deduction possible for such a home office?   
For an employee, it would only be possible if the employer does not provide for a suitable office. For a self-employed entrepreneur on the other hand, it is probably just another business expense but as I am not a tax expert, I do not know if that is correct

You normally have to post a security deposit of 20 - 30 % of the total value of the goods.   
It isn't applicable to the case above, which I understand as permanent import to the US, via Switzerland.

Transactions importing is a PITA to do, but better than manual entry.   
But it is very useful and, I would say, easy to use for budgeting.

1863	Financebankingtaxation	Fixed rate mortgages on the rise?	guest	763	0	null	null	" 
			
			Got an email from comparis the other week:   
""Mortgage interest rate increased greatly in 2013. Prices for fixed mortgages rose by up to 35 percent by year´s end. This is shown in the Mortgage Barometer from comparis.ch. The period of record-low interest rates is over for the time being.   
The benchmark interest rate for a 10-year mortgage climbed from 2.0 to 2.7 percent between January and December. And so for many home owners the psychological pain threshold has been exceeded. They want a shorter financing period and increasingly prefer medium-range terms with less than 2 percent interest. The proportion of 4 to 6 year term lengths was already 31 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013  nearly double that in summer.   
Stabilisation of interest rates at the higher level is expected for the near future. The reason for this are monetary policy announcements by the Swiss National Bank and the US Federal Reserve.""

it depends. If these books are a part of an advanced education you can deduct them with the fees of the university (point 215). If you just buy them for business purposes, there is already a lump sum deductet which is 3% of your income, min. CHF 2K, max. 4K. If the cost of the books exceeds the lump sum you can deduct them by proving the purchases with vouchers.

			Comparis is OK, but:   
 - it wont tell you what your tax-free deductions will be (eg travel to work, social security etc). In CH a lot of the tax savings are becasue of the tax-free deductions, can get to 20k+social security easily (you have to calculate them manually). So income in comparis should be taxable, not total salary...   
- comparis doesn't to different income for taxable income, different for tax rate. So may have to do two times and calulate manually.    
For best results, I use my canton excel calculator (which is not Zug). Very accurate, esp as tax varies A LOT by the TOWN you live in, so you can chose the correct town. They have a version for foreign stuff, with does the caclulation correctly with foreign homes.

(1) the tax at source, so   8.66% (They will take away 6k from your 'netto', then re-calculate Quellensteuer, which could be at a slightly smaller rate, eg 8.62% and then refund the difference).     
(2) No. But you can leave it there till you get to retirement age (even if you move abroad).  If your plan is to withdraw the money in a few years, there is no point in having a 3a in the first place.

Or could anyone confirm if the SBB Visa Prepaid is indeed a Visa Elektron which allows no exctra charge when booking with Easyjet?   
It would indeed be an useful information. So far I see the combination of SBB Visa Prepaid and Migros Mastercard Prepaid as ideal for me...then I can book everywhere (air flights I mean) with no extra charge (Easyjet requires Visa Elektron and Ryanair requires Mastercard Prepaid)...

At the moment the fixed terms rates are low.  Personally I don't think this will last. There is ever so much QE those early adopters will push for crippling interest rates as part of their rent-seeking. So maybe you are better off signing up now, and paying up front, rather than letting it slide until later when the net present value will be considerably higher.

A good thing?	webdev	926	3	Location: Zurich	01.02.2014, 02:33	"    While I still see a difference in the rental market, I've noticed that in the last 5 years or so  - the property bubble - that the price of single family homes no longer corresponds so closely with tax rates.   
Within a 60-75 minute drive to a metro employment area, a single family home in high tax community will now cost just about the same as a similar single family in one of the Steuerparadis towns. This is, I assume, driven by the scarcity of housing more than anything else. Demand for the privacy and space is so high for that the ability to save taxes seems to be less of a factor in this particular market these days.

With the above scenario, both pensions should be combined and paid in the country you live in. Agreements between the the UK and CH allow this. 
The tax you mention, is presumably income tax. This should only be paid once in the country you live in.   
It is unclear to me why you are being taxed in the UK. If this is because of a much larger private pension scheme and you have addition income from the UK then you should seek expert advice. Try googling for more initial info and try finding out such things as QROPS (maybe this is too late for you).   
What passport you hold is irrelevant. Naturally you should have the permission to live hear (B or C).    
Finally, beware of finical advisors...

  My wife has a C permit (German, living in CH for 5 yrs), and I have a B permit (NZ, living in CH for 5 years). In September 2013, my wife paid her tax upfront. It was strangely calculated (about 3 times of what she would have paid before when paying Quellensteuer)  on both of our incomes even though I am already taxed in Norway. I work in Norway and dont receive any salary here in CH. What role does my income play in that regarding my wife`s tax?

3) Use an ATM that accepts Postfinance card and withdraw from there.   
So based on experience the third option is usually the best....anyone can comment for Australia / New Zealand?

1903	Financebankingtaxation	Resident of Switz shareholder of US company	MaksymLib	517	0	Location: Zurich	23.01.2014, 12:48	" 
			
			Greetings. 
 Here is my situation:   
I'm citizen of Ukraine, used to live in USA few years. More then two years ago left it (not I'm not ""US person"" from taxation point of view). I another person  invested into a C-corp there, in which I also was CEO till dissolution. in Sept 2013 the corporation was dissolved (last tax return filed).    
We have some profit acumulated on accounts, which are to be redistributed during dissolutio.   
the company is 50%x50% by me and that another person, also living in Switzerland.   
What I need (and what my US CPA doesn't know and says he will need to do research about that as that's not their specialization) is to understand:   
Getting to account  bilateral tax agreements Switzerland-USA ,    
1. should USA company pay any taxes for distributing profit to non-residents? 
2. Shoudl we pay taxes in US? FIle there anything? 
3. should we file this profit in Switzerland?       
Thanks!

			The only way to get it repealed is to find some way that it benefits Joe or Jane Six-pack   makes it a political win for whatever party drives the nail into the proverbial coffin.   
Selling it to the public will be hard, but not impossible. The best angle would be to place the controls Stateside that would require all *United States Banks* to report on (or possibly even delay pending IRS approval) any transactions over a specific amount that enters or leaves the country to the IRS for them to follow up on. That way, the onus stays on US businesses, instead of foreign ones and the local public gets to pillory their ""local rich fat cats"", and expats can finally open and maintain foreign accounts.   
It ain't perfect by a long shot, but it's a damn sight better than what we currently have.

1908	Financebankingtaxation	Which debit card should i choose?	Roulin	2326	9	Location: Sankt Gallen	21.01.2014, 13:40	" 
			
			Hi Roulin,   
since   are usually not in CHF anyway, why not try to get a €-account with   (it´s free and includes a VISA-debit card).   
Then transfer your CHF-funds with   or   to your German €-account.   
You will be able to pay 1:1 in €s, online and when visiting   of the €-zone. For payments outside the €-zone they charge 1.75%, which is probably still better than most CHF/Switzerland based cards.   
If you visit the whole wide world, dkb allows withdrawing cash, free of charge, anywhere! So dkb.de is a real joker without apparent catch.   
I know they open accounts for Swiss residents. Not sure if 18-year-old students can also open an account - but I guess they´ll be happy to, as the average Swiss student will eventually become good customers. So why not give it a try. (If you do, please give us feedback about the opening process!)   
Rgds, 
Christian

Foreign income, such as rental income, is generally used to determine your tax bracket, but is then deducted from your taxable income. But hey, that's just my .2c with no guarantees.

I'm working on that though, I've started consuming only Swiss cheese and Swiss chocolate. After three weeks, I prefer square flags and I've started to spontaneously blurt Swiss German profanities so that's progress. Well, I think I'm speaking Swiss German but I can't be certain till I arrive again and try out my new vocabulary.   
After various calls, I can confirm I can open an account at many banks, in person, with a passport and visa.   
5 weeks from now at my current intake of cheese, I should be sufficiently natualized to start my new role and bank account in Switzerland.   "	Posts: 20	Join Date: Aug 2013	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Whether you'd get a B permit depends on the type of contract you have and also the fact that there are quota restrictions on 5-year B permits for EU-17 nationals at the moment.  If the quota has been reached you'd be issued with a one-year L permit instead.   
I would contact the Zurich/Frankfurt tax offices and see if they can give you a clearer picture.

My wife also uses shopbop.com and has been very happy (they are owned by Amazon now). They offer upfront low cost import duties and have even refunded money when the amount was less.

A little late but... according to  , you must own your L permit since 3 years at least. Of course conditions may vary from one bank to another, but I think it would be difficult.   
You could also try peer-to-peer lending (  Also, not sure if that is really secure (another thread asking some informations about that).

No.      
However, most couples will have joint income above the 120k threshold and will therefore be completing tax returns even if they have been subject to the withholding tax that most people call tax-at-source.

my husband is trying to move his canadian pension plan over to Switzerland to fill the gaps in his current plan but was told that this was impossible and his assets would be moved to a restricted account in Canada instead - having worked in the area here I know that Swiss residents leaving the country are entitled to collect their accumulated pension so I can't see why this should be different for Canadians leaving the country.   
Has anyone transferred their assets over, and if so, how did you apply for transfer? Unfortunately the canadian embassy has proven to be very unhelpful so far..

Just one thing that's not 100% clear to me on PostFinance   
I'm a regular internet shopper (as most people nowadays). Since they don't provide a ""maestro"" card, is that one able to shop online? (i.e: amazon, ebay, etc) 
And one more thing regarding the free credit card from Migros or Coop. Do they charge interests if paying in only 1 payment or it's free? (no split payments)   
thanks!

			I don't know what figure you'd use for calculating your tax, but I'm sure if you have a word with the Vaud tax office they'll be able to give you a rough figure to work to, based on your earnings, so you can start setting money aside.  And yes I'm sure you'll find some there who speaks English, can advise you and give you a lesson in filling out a Swiss tax form too.     
Canton and commune taxes get paid here over a period of months usually.  Cantons may vary in how many months - here in Fribourg we pay for 9 months from May to January, get our next tax return done by 1st March and get the new payment slips for the coming year in late April/early May again.  If you want you can also pay the amount in full and save a few francs so there's a choice of options.  Federal tax usually comes in a lump sum figure, but if you ask you can probably get some payment slips to pre-pay monthly if you want.  We do this over a 6 month period and then pay any outstanding amount when the bill comes in.   
What I do is use our PostFinance account for things like tax, etc, transferring a set amount each month from our UBS account.  The same principle would work for you.   
I don't know about the pension contributions, but you'd definitely need to get Swiss health insurance as it's mandatory for all residents.  I think you might be able to set up a Pillar 3a pension fund, but you'd need to check on that to make sure, either with the tax office again or with your Swiss bank.

			My friend and his girlfriend were living off 2500/month, paying two rents and saving money. So as long as you are careful with money, the amount you state is more than enough. Generally, I agree with all the above comments.   
Apart from getting accepted, it is quite difficult to find a place to rent in Zurich. ETH has some offers but they usually allocate them for limited period of time. Many students live in cities nearby, some even commuting from Konstanz (in Germany).

1947	Financebankingtaxation	"Should I keep old orange ""Versement"" slips ?"	dan2k3k4	893	4	Location: Geneva	02.01.2014, 14:04	"    That's a good advice. I used to keep them in files by theme for my own record for many years. You never know. Just in case of claim you might need to provide a proof of payment. Those who use electronic banking system, can easily check online history few years back.   
Optionally scan them all to store in electronic format.

			Does anyone have experience of how HMRC treats pay outs from Swiss life insurance policies? I was convinced to take out a life insurance policy many years ago when I worked in CH for tax efficiency/saving etc under Swiss tax law. When returning to UK I was advised to keep making the payments but recently someone suggested I would have to pay tax in the UK, when it matures. Any advice? Or can anyone recommend a good tax adviser in UK or CH who know about these things?

			It's quite scary how easy it is for people to get your pin, methods I'm aware of:   
Bogus workmen replacing valid chip and pin machines with ones that log your card details and still allow transactions to take place.   
false fronts on ATM's - usually the lighted bar with the bank name on it and a card reader over the real card reader.   
Plain and simple looking over your shoulder or using binoculars or similar, I think something like this was mentioned here on EF.

			It's quite simple really, You will need to do a tax return for the whole April-April year in the UK ( then deregister if appropriate) declaring all your UK earnings. When you start in CH you will be in the quellensteur (sp?) = PAYE for the first few years anyway, so no need for a tax return unless you earn more than 120K in a given calendar year.    
Have a look through the   forum for lots more detail about the Swiss side of things.

			With leasing a car the bank own it & they make the tax savings. If you had a loan it would be deductible.   
For companies of course it's deductible as an expense rather than depreciation on an owned car.

That's not the case. You   file anyway, and I do. Why? Because if I don't give them any information, they'll go hunting for something that's not there and possibly make stuff up. It takes me no time to fill out the form and mail it, and then there are no back-records for me to fill out if I ever decide to give up the blue passport. Now, for those who do have high enough income, and other assets or investments, the tax paperwork can be a nightmare. I am SO thankful my husband and I opted to keep everything separate from the get-go. It has saved us a lot of headaches.   
Now back to the bigger picture - As others have pointed out, this file vs. not file issue isn't directly related to FATCA. FATCA is about reporting assets that exist anywhere on the planet, regardless of whether those count as taxable income. It's this law that the banks are scared of. It's why they are requiring every American customer, regardless of whether said customer has a penny or a billion in the bank, to waive privacy under Swiss law and to allow the account information to be disclosed to the IRS.

1964	Financebankingtaxation	Theoretical Tax Question: If you won lottery	diamondscan	5826	33	Location: Zürich	28.06.2012, 14:35	" 
			
			I was wondering something similar the other day. If I were to win a nice sum of money in say November/December, but didn't cash the ticket until the following January/February, when would I be taxed as having the income, the year of the winning or the year of actually getting the money?    
Again it was along the lines of thinking about moving cantons to pay the lowest amount of tax possible, as I understand that if you move cantons part way through a year they will tax you pro rata, so moving canton in December if you need to claim the income at that point would not really be worth it. But if you can move and claim the next year when you are in the nice canton you could be a lot better off.   
But then again, this is all dreaming, and would be a very nice problem to have...

He signed a sub-leasing contract with the tenant of the app (who is his friend, and funny the sub-leasing contract has a rent of 0 CHF). Then he went to the commune with the sub-leasing contract and the original main leasing contract to register himself. The officer there took the contracts, said nothing and asked whether his name is on the letter box. He said no so the officer added c/o to his address on the registration card. So I guess legally speaking he is OK.   
Though, he does not really live there in his friend's app. He actually lives with his fiancé in another nearby canton. The reason why he cannot register in the  nearby canton is that he is non-EU and to live in the canton different from where he works would incur additional paper work. Anyway they are going to marry in several months so hopefully this will finish soon.

			I´ll post a few screenshots, I guess this will make 100% clear what I mean:                                                            If you´re resident in the EU they charge LUX-VAT, but then they also charge in EUR 1:1.   
If you´re resident outside of the EU, they don´t charge any VAT (see above), and charge in USD.   
I don´t mind being charged in USD, but I´d like to know before.      Of course you´re right. I´m not going to play cat and mouse with them   I still like their prices, and I´ll continue to use them. This disallows me to reverse the charge, as otherwise they will cancel the contract with me.   
So I just sent a general email to Visa, asking them to look into this vendor. Maybe it´ll change something, otherwise I´l just accept that these guys are slightly insane. (Just like me running after this, since the actual loss is minimal. It´s just annoying and shouldn´t be the way it is, that´s all)

One thing I forgot: you don't need any special permit as far as I know to open the account and DKB is probably as safe as the banks in Switzerland.

1994	Financebankingtaxation	buying services in UK, invoice to swiss address, paying VAT?	jimdrake	8639	36	Location: VD	01.07.2011, 15:08	" 
			
			Hey, I'm not trying to get a company to do something that they shouldn't!   
Just trying to understand the law and do things correctly.   
If tax is not due then why is that tax evasion? If the tax is VAT in the UK then that's 20%. 20% of the cost of a wedding is a big thing! And that kind of money should not go to the government if it's not due to them according to their own laws.   
If someone offers to me not to charge VAT then I am not going to complain. If it was the wrong thing to do then it was their fault to offer and so it is their problem if they get an audit and a fine.   
If I am asking someone to provide without charging VAT them I would rather understand before asking!

1995	Financebankingtaxation	Pay into 2nd pillar: voluntary contribution	MrVertigo	1452	4	Location: CH	07.12.2013, 12:32	"    Not sure I understand you question... But here goes...   
If you look on the statement you will see that there is a line indicating the maximum amount you are allowed to buy in.  This amount will normally amount to the short fall in the obligatory amount (not to be confused with the BVG amount) or perhaps a little more.  So when you buy in, little or none should end up in the extraordinary amount, because it is first applied to the obligatory amount.   
Once the obligatory amount is fully ensured there is no possibility to have further funds applied there until such time as a new hole opens up, which normally happens when you receive a pay increase and provided your overall contributions do not exceed the max buy in amount.   
What can happen is when a hole does open up in the obligatory amount, there is still to much in the extraordinary amount and so the maximum buy in amount is still zero.  In such cases you are not allowed to top up the obligatory amount from the extraordinary amount.

			Some interesting replies. Of course I am aware of ebanking etc., but I was struck (and not for the first time) by the fact that clearly many people, like me, pay most of their bills as they come in and that there didn't appear to be anything in place to help those who for whatever reason have no-one to do that kind of task for them.  
As a result of this I am going to suggest to my parents that they put their relevant information somewhere safe and tell me where it is... But I still wonder about those who have no-one to rely on.

			you're shocked at the tax you'll pay because you are putting in your brutto amount into the calculator....this will simply never be the case.   
You have social and other deductions on your incoming - bonus included.   
The tax you'll pay is actually very reasonable.   
Do note that rent in low-tax locations is typically higher and to an extent offsets the gains in cheaper tax rates.....

			You continue paying tax at source (2nd paragraph), but the taxes will be sent to your Gemeinde, and used to offset the taxes calculated on your tax return.  This could mean a refund....or it could mean a bill, depending on your personal circumstances, and the tax rate o your gemeinde versus the Kanton's average.   
For now you don't need to do anything, but you will need to complete a tax return.  The gemeinde will send you the forms (first paragraph)

2007	Financebankingtaxation	Benefits - kids education invoices and tax	pitinswiss	1384	8	Location: Basel	15.11.2013, 15:55	"    Just an FYI - you will run into the same issue in most countries - it isn't necessarily a Swiss thing.   
In every country we have lived, the benefits attached to an expat contract have been taxable - the value of that benefit is added to income and the whole shebang is then taxed.   
Some companies use a gross-up formula to allow for the tax increase.  But that really doesn't solve the problem. The gross-up-for-additional-taxes amount is of course added to your taxable income, generating further tax... and so it goes.   
Death and taxes. No getting around 'em.

2009	Financebankingtaxation	US tax return - FBAR	Monkey72	4425	32	Location: Basel	27.02.2013, 17:00	"    So, English is not your first language, is it?  When information is ""reported to"" the IRS via a form, it quite clearly means the IRS gets that form.   
If you are still in denial, try   and read carefully: 
""Q. How do I verify that my FBAR was filed? ...an FBAR filing verification request may be made in writing.mailed to: IRS Enterprise Computing Center.... Detroit, MI 48232""   
Now, can you read the address clearly?  You can verify the FBAR was received by writing to the IRS.  Not to the Treasury, but to the IRS.  How could the IRS verify an FBAR was received if the IRS did not have a copy? (I hope this is not too complicated for you.)      ""Making stuff up""?  Now you are simply a liar.  The link I posted to the Internal Revenue Manual states ""FBAR reports are filed at the Enterprise Computing Center (ECC) in  Detroit, Michigan. Filings can be researched on the Currency and Banking  Retrieval System (CBRS) or on IDRS.""  The third link I posted explains what is IDRS.    
You may not understand for whom the IRM is written, but that's not an excuse.  You can read the link and understand (perhaps) what is written there.      That you have a job and offer your opinions are not in dispute.  Your ability to understand what is written on the IRS' website is another matter.

Or is there some amount  added to your income based on the market value?

			Hi All,   
I was informed by the accountant during the Income tax returns filing process earlier this year that there is an option to get tax relief on the amount one spends on supporting dependents (in my particular case, she said parents) residing in  countries.    
She said to claim the tax relief one has to provide documentation. I did not get into the details at the time but wanted to check if anyone in the forum has any hands on experience in doing this?   
I wanted to do some ground work first before getting back to my accountant for specifics.   
Look forward to notes on experiences or advise.    
Thanks and Regards, 
MM

2018	Financebankingtaxation	Elimination of foreign earned income exclusion	Karl	3076	19	Location: Here	23.07.2011, 11:24	"    Capital gains are not normally taxed for private individuals... unless you count as a (semi-)professional trader for tax purposes. 
[-> the capital gains are large enough that they count it as a source of income similar to a full or side job]   
You normally have to declare trading activities in your tax declaration.   
The relevant tax circular is (in German):     
They lay out a number of cumulative conditions under which the tax authorities will for sure NOT consider you taxable:   
-Held the securities for longer then 6 months 
- Transaction volume over the tax year not greater than 5x value of the held securities at the beginning of the year 
- Capital gains less than 50% of your declared income 
- No leverage or the interest on leverage lower than the taxable income from dividends  
- Derivatives trading limited to hedging    
In practise they won't care about the above rules for small amounts, but for large capital gains where the above is not fulfilled they will look into it and decide if you are taxable or not (not fulfilling all the conditions doesn't mean you necessarily have to pay tax, but I would get professional tax advice in such a case...)

This year the IRS changed the rules in getting one. They have made it significantly more difficult to get one...(the number was misused for a long time) Its no longer enough to just get one, you have to reapply every 5 years for one and do the whole complex application process from the beginning.

			You can use the 2nd pillar to buy your main residence property also outside Switzerland (within EU countries). It's clearly stated   on the BSV site.

			This is a big questions   
Fees verses commission. (Different advisors and firms will charge in different ways depending on what the client wants)   
A life bond will pay a commission which can be upto 7% depending on the product and how long its held for. The client then has an annual fee to cover the cost, but can be arranged as a flat fee.   
Initial advisor Fees are usually between 3-5% depending on the amount of work that goes into the solution.     
I would always suggest to negotiate, but sometimes there are no ways around it.

2044	Financebankingtaxation	Moving from Lausanne to Geneva with the same salary in Lausanne?	pk86	2467	8	Location: Germany	29.10.2013, 23:29	" 
			
			Just to share my experience.   
I worked 3 years in Geneva. I was lucky to have a family friend who was willing to sublease his studio in the city to me. It was supose to be temporary until I found something. He was getting a bit upset though (and understandably so) that I had not found anything in 3 years. I was looking at ads every day, visiting lots of apartments and filling more applications than I can count. I even widened my search to beyond my means and never got a single apartment.  
I then moved to Zurich and found a place within 3 months with less efforts.   
I have lots of friends in Geneva area and they all pretty much say that finding a place anywhere between Lausanne and Geneva in impossible without good connections. My suggestion would be to keep your apartment in Lausanne and commute. Or option 2 (I am semi-serious) is that you wait outside a real estate agency and start flirting with an employee. Get in a relationship with one and you will get the keys to an apartment you want.   
Good luck to you.

			Hi,   
I walked into Wells Fargo, I was trying to get a prepaid Visa card...and they suggested it would be easier to just open an account. It is very simple, they just needed my Passport. I have a debit card on the account and use it to pay for Hulu etc. There are now some costs having the account but the usefulness makes up for the costs.   
Another way of having a debit card for another country such as the UK is to create a virtual credit card e.g.    
It helps to into a branch and I do not have a US address.   
Have fun

2050	Financebankingtaxation	Bank account needed for short-term too?	menorca	1382	6	Location: bonn	14.10.2013, 21:57	"    Since you´re asking me directly - no idea!   
Your government manged to scare banks worldwide, so that many now don´t open accounts for US-citizens anymore.   
Even non-US-citizens ""suffer"" from that, since everyone now has to sign a form stating that you´re not secretly a dual citizen, i.e. presenting a random passport to the bank while also being a US citizen but not mentioning the latter.   
I really wonder why I should sign a form about some US laws, if I want to open an account in ""country x"" while being a citizen of ""country x"". The ""usual test"" (what if everyone did the same) also yields unbearable results: Imagine all countries would/could demand this: Everyone would have to sign ~160 forms (1 for each country), stating you´re not a citizen, just to be allowed to open a local account?   
Just to be clear - the US government causes the trouble, not US citizens, of which I think quite highly    
Possible remedy: Get rid of your US citizenship   "	Posts: 6	Join Date: Jan 2013	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

What I don´t know is how the customs declaration works. However, it must be possible somehow.   
For EU returns he uses a friend´s address in Germany. I have no idea how he handles non-EU returns, but it seems to be a nightmare convincing customs that they shouldn´t charge for return shipments, however ultimately possible somehow.

			Yes, the US address is probably what triggered it.  
So a case of mistaken identification by amazon. But they try to be ultra careful. Now you cannot do much, either you do nothing and they close the seller part of your amazon account, or you apply for a TIN (USA tax id number) and give it to them. (if you search online you'll find many people in your case, and split about 50-50 between which action they did.)

2054	Financebankingtaxation	Cheapest Prepaid Card for Travel, Foreign Exchange	mountains	3541	4	Location: Europe	26.10.2013, 13:22	"    Thanks Chris, feel free to post your referral link here (if it is not against forum rules - I allow you to do so  so anyone find this helpful can get you EUR 5.   
Kalixa is a UK card, here are some reviews I found on the net:    
True, I asked for the cheap solution and you delivered - truly. However, as I was thinking about the issue and here is what I found:   
- What is nice about the Kalixa card: card to card transfers (&low fees, obviously) 
- Though it doesn't seem like to allow you to have multiple cards on your name (to easily transfer funds between your cards, hence manage your balance and have a safety backup). Yes, you might register additional cards in the names of some family members, not a criminal offence in Switzerland I guess, but ask the same question in the UK or US  
- Weak point: seems like not strong customer service when you have some problems abroad, I don't know how fast they can send you a replacement   
Compare that to  
- If you lose it, replacement is sent by courier 
- You are legally allowed to own up to 5 cards 
- Though I don't know of card card to card transfers, which brings back from the excitement 
- Definitely on the more expensive side with EUR 4, CHF 5 ATM withdrawals, 1% load fee, EUR, CHF 1  purchase fee. OK, not the most expensive and I can say I might be able to live with that if there were (at least free) card to card transfers 
- All in all, seems like much better customer service if you got into any trouble abroad.   
Consider the situation for safety, you travel 3 cards. If there are no card to card transfers, you might want to load them with 1000 each. If there are card to card transfers available for the same peace of mind even 1500 would be enough dispersed between the 3 cards, but not in 500 - 500 - 500 increments, but let's say 1000 (safety net) + 100 (Internet) + 400 (daily shopping). Sure, the remaining 1500 will not give you much in interest if you put it into a bank account but if you invest it into a profitable venture the extra income would justify the higher expenses of something like the TravelCash card, if it offered card to card transfers at least.   
I found that prepaid cards in general have their place for travel, in general easier to dealt with than bank accounts.   
(+ 1 credit card, just for extra safety + rentals)   
Chris or anyone, what are your thoughts? Perhaps do you know of any such offering I have in mind? Even if it is only available for selected people. German cards? 
Like: 
- you can have multiple cards 
- card to card transfers 
- good customer service, fast card replacement 
- maximum medium fees   "	Posts: 68	Join Date: Apr 2013	Junior Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 7 Times in 4 Posts	earned some respect
2055	Financebankingtaxation	Which Bank I should choose?	Julia_Karai	12565	75	Location: Quarten (SG)	26.06.2012, 13:29	" 
			
			On the whole the cantonal banks and Raiffeisen have relatively low fees. Raiffeisen banks have a pretty thin network and unless there's a branch not to far from where you either live or work, that might be trickier, though these days with e-banking and ATMs, you don't actually have to go into a bank branch too often these days. 
I don't like the big Swiss banks, UBS, CS. In my opinion they're not interested in small accounts and their fees are excessive. 
I would go for either the local cantonal bank or Postfinance - they all seem to publish their fees online these days on their websites. For credit cards, try Migros/Cumulus, which as others have said is free, though they charge higher commission on foreign transactions.

2060	Financebankingtaxation	Financing my studies in Switzerland	hameerabbasi	1062	2	Location: Islamabad, Pakistan	24.10.2013, 15:41	"    Island Monkey is right.  You can work 15 hours per week, but because you are not from the EU, you cannot do so for the first 6 months of your time in Switzerland.  If you work as a TA or something similar at ETH, you should expect to earn about 24 CHF per hour.   
Also, I don't want to be a downer, but as a non-EU/swiss who applied to ETHZ and EPFL I have some experience in this area.  I attended a university in the US (top 50 University, global rankings), was an honors student, GPA of 3.66, a girl (makes a difference for Engineering), had study abroad experience, a series of internships, 85th percentile for GRE, and was heavily involved in student activities.  All this being said, I was not accepted to ETHZ (I did get into EPFL however, which is how I can be here).     
ETHZ has many, many highly qualified applicants, and so they can turn away people who would normally get in elsewhere without a second thought.  They also have a stricter limit as to the number of international students that can be let into their program, as the education is heavily subsidized by the government. Because of this, I have heard mumblings of a movement to reduce the number of international students until they get more money from the government.   
You may want to remember this information, so as to put your aspirations into perspective.     
All that being said, however, there's nothing to stop you from trying!

And your future employer can definitely wait until you get here - it does not take that long to set up payroll.    
But in any case since Switzerland is part of the SEPA agreement, you could always given the BIC and IBAN for your current account in Italy.

2063	Financebankingtaxation	Telecommuting to the US	stitz	1748	0	Location: Zurich	21.10.2013, 17:56	" 
			
			I've read a number of the threads here regarding telecommuting. Unfortunately I have not been able to clarify my questions.   
Does anyone have any experience with living in Zurich while telecommuting to the US?  My company does not have a Swiss / European office.  Is this feasible?   
Do you have any recommendations for a labor attorney / tax accountant in Zurich?     
I would like to speak to a professional to weigh my options.   
Many Thanks,   
Stitz

2067	Financebankingtaxation	Tax INCREASED due to paying 3.a	ip2012	1556	17	Location: 8053 Zurich	16.10.2013, 22:00	"    It wasn't the 3a that increased your tax, it was that you moved from ""tax at source"" to ""normal taxation"".  (The 3a actually reduced what you liability, but is still 10k higher under nornal taxation than tax at source).    
You can do much except:   
- think that eventually everyone goes on to normal taxation, eg when you get C permit, or buy property, have foreign properties/incomes, etc..   
- think that maybe, you already should be completing the normal taxation anyway (based on your circs, etc). So perhaps it wasn't the 3a that moved you on to normal taxation, but the 3a made the canton realise that you should be doing normal taxation already. If they had realised later on, they may ask you to fill in tax returns for previous years, ie,  have 10k x 2 to pay in one go..

			So far, whenever I entered a ""normal"" domestic payment into PostFinance, it is executed by Postfinance at midnight. The recipient can see it from Midnight if he´s with Postfinance, and from around 8 in the morning with any other bank.   
""Any other bank"" means Berner Kanonalbank, Credit Suisse, UBS and Raiffeisen where I´m sure of above through experience, I´d be surprised if it was any different with other banks.

			Hello All and many thanks for the replies. I said I would post once I had seen the Tax Advisor so that I could feedback on their actual advice too.   
So indeed owning a property in Basel Stadt means that you have to pay both Eigenmiert Steuer and bundessteuer, the calculations are as follows;   
Eigenmietwert Steuer. 
eigenemietwert e.g. 200,000 CHF 
4% of 200k = 8,000 
Then 23% of the 4% ie 1,840 CHF per annum   
The calculation for Bundessteuer is the same calculation for ALL cantons (Eigenmietwert is calculated differently per canton so always check)   
Bundessteuer calculation is as follows 
Eigenmietwert e.g. 200,000 CHF 
4.2% of 200k = 8400 
Then 11-12%(but max 12%) of the 4.2% ie 1008 CHF   
The annual tax bill in the above example would then be 1840 + 1008=2848CHF   
I went and spoke with Grether MacGeorge in Basel (I have no affiliation to them) and they proved friendly, excellent English and answered all my questions. So on case anyone else is looking for tax advice they seemed pretty switched on from my encounter with them.   
So thanks for those who took the time to reply to my original question and perhaps the above might also be useful to others with similar questions in future.  "	Posts: 130	Join Date: Dec 2007	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 81 Times in 39 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Generally your girlfriend is exempt from tax, but it depends on her contractual status.   
If the child is recognised as your child and you pay support, you can deduct eligible childcare expenses up to the limit (canton varies on this).  One usually needs an attestation from the establishment for this, then you file with your taxes.   
Be aware on child benefit, either she or you can claim but not both.

			I'd be happy to ask and get back to you. As for me, it is extremely likely that I would retire in the UK... in saying that, it is far in the future.   
I don't have a pension yet in the UK, as it will be my next job that will be saving for this (I was a student before this one). I also don't have a vested benefits account and I think I read that Novartis will just transfer it to one in Zurich automatically- I will need to clarify this.   
If I see this money upon my UK retirement I will be more than happy. I will just make sure to make copies of the relevant forms and keep them safe.

My post has a mistake: I accidentally used UBS´s cash rates, not their credit card rates. So this should be exactly what you´re looking for here.   
You should also be aware that carrying more than €10k into the EU requires you to declare the amount with customs officials on arrival. Failure to do so may lead to the amount being seized and reported to revenue/authorities (of whereever you live)! You will have to go through lengthy and complicated procedures to get (some of it) it back. Not declaring it alone is already an offence, so you´d be liable to pay a fine in any case.

			ok i got it!  got my running shoes on!  I did find some articles assessing the usefulness of these wrappers, one from the Daily Telegraph.   But even that conceded that they do have their uses.  especially if you are going to be moving around a lot, and for some tax payers there are tax advatages (for others not).   I do have the charges in writing now. I actually approached the broker, having sold our house, and needing to invest the proceeds, so it was not cold calling.     
I'm also considering using a platform to do direct investing (having seen the thread on that subject on this forum).  Have been doing some investing directly with fund managers over the last 15 years, but i don't know easy that will be once we are nomadic again, and not having much time to keep current, or reliable communications.     
Thank you all for your input!  i feel very encouraged to do some running training!

It says I need to get a document from the tax authorities stating that we were resident in Switzerland for the tax year.  This is for the double taxation agreement part.  Do I just need to contact my local (Fribourg) canton tax office for this or is it something issued from the Federal side?     
Also I assume that I can just make a PDF of the document and attach it to the online tax return?

			If you're classed as a UK non-resident, there shouldn't be any need to declare the Swiss side of things.  That's what I've just been told by HMRC today.  We own a house in the UK, not rented out though, but don't meet the residence criteria because we spend less than 183 days in the UK a year.  We report any interest on a couple of UK bank accounts and that's it.   
I think you need to tell them you're living/working in Switzerland and have been for the last few years and see what they say.  But from the info you gave it seems as if you've paid taxes in the right places so ""A"" would be the one to sign providing you're non-resident in the UK.

No it isn't legal for you to store money in a Swiss bank.  Not that you'd be able to as you don't live in Switzerland.  All Swiss banks have chucked out their American clients who don't live here while those that do have to sign a W-9 allowing the bank to pass their bank account info on to the IRS.   
You can't dodge your US tax obligations so don't even try.  File and pay up what's due to Uncle Sam.

2085	Financebankingtaxation	HELP - Taxes: deduction medical costs refused?!?	belgian beer lover	2365	15	Location: Vaud	06.10.2013, 10:43	"    With the ""simplified declaration"" you will always get a refund or it will be the same. You'll never have to pay more. It still uses the ""tax at source"" formula to calculate tax, but with additional deductions as mentioned. Of course if those deductions don't apply to you you don't get any refund.   
But this does not help the original poster, as he cannot put his medical expenses on the ""simplified declaration"", as he found out.    
In contrast, the ""full declaration"", if accepted by the Canton that you can do it, uses a totally different formula (Eg distance in km from home-to work is relevant, fortune tax is relevant, etc) with different rates, so the calculation will end up differently than tax at source (with or without the ""simplified""). It can be higher or lower. In CH there is never ""correct"" tax, there are parallel systems and you pay depending on the system you are on.

			I highly recommend Rebecca Heid at  . I own a small business here in Switzerland and she knew   what the filing requirements were in my case and how to fulfill them. When I finally found her, she immediately sorted out all the options I had heard about  and steered me in the right direction, clearly explaining why she recommended filing in a certain manner. And I find their prices are quite reasonable.   
I highly doubt most CPAs in America would have much of a clue how to correctly fill out a 5471, or even the conditions under which it is required. At least the ones I spoke with didn't. The penalties for doing it wrong are daunting.

2088	Financebankingtaxation	renovation deductions	Alari	907	1	Location: Basel	07.10.2013, 14:31	"    More-or-less yes, as the principle (in a nutshell) in the USA is that they tax you the difference of what you paid in CH and what you would have paid in the USA. So anything you save in CH, is just added on top in the USA stuff.   
Also remember that if you claim renovations on your Swiss tax return, they will expect to see a higher ""value"" for the property, which means higher ""rental value"" and higher ""fortune"", ie higher Swiss taxes as the property is now worth more.

I think the banks here do the same (with an outgoing, and receiving wire fee). xe.com doesn't do it. I don't know about IB, but if they dont do it, then i may switch to them.

2101	Financebankingtaxation	Getting bank account without giving info to US	Olstand	7439	89	Location: Switzerland	25.09.2013, 11:28	"    Yes, but it is also not universal in Switzerland that a bank asks people if they have US ties. Sure if you're opening an account with a US passport or a foreign passport that has a US place of birth. They don't ask 100% of applicants. (i helped someone open an account recently, who was non american, english speaking and they were neither asked about americanism nor did any paperwork reference it)   
Also, perjury is a bit tough, no? Its not a court proceeding. They could close your account, but not much more

			Well if you really can't get an account opened in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, what about trying for a CHF denominated account in another SEPA country?   
Switzerland is in the SEPA, and although I'm not 100% sure on the rules, I think swiss banks will have to make transfers in CHF within SEPA for the same they charge for national transfers.   
The potential issue would be that your account in the other country would be in EUR and then receiving the CHF gets converted in a poor rate, but if you can open a CHF account that would be solved.   
Worth investigating anyway.

2105	Financebankingtaxation	US taxes, Social Security	seekinganswers	1054	0	Location: Renens	30.09.2013, 17:30	" 
			
			Hello Group, US Expat here   
Because I now receive US Social Security payments, income I make here in Switzerland makes part (up to 85%) of my Social Security income taxable in the US.   
The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion form (2555EZ) in Part IV says to enter the foreign income ""earned and received"", also to enter it on the 1040, line 7.  What I received is the amount stated in my employment contract.  Even though that amount will be excluded (it is under the Max exclusion), it still influences the amount of my Soc Sec that I must pay taxes on - there is a long worksheet to calculate the taxable amount (Pub 915), and it requires foreign earned income to be entered.   
The problem is this:  while I received what my contract states, it is technically my net income.  For the salary certification, the employer worked backwards to figure what gross income figure was needed to end up after all the deductions with my contract amount.  I had no clue about this, as they gave me 4 years of salary certifications only a few months ago!   
The question:  can I report my contract amount as the foreign income, or must I report this much larger backwardly calculated figure?     
When I first came to Switzerland my employer told me there was a tax treaty between US and Switzerland, to protect against double taxation.  So I never even thought about US taxes.  Ignorance is bliss, but the bliss is morphing into pain.   
Thanks for looking in.

Our UBS preferences are in English, but they only seem to apply when using the UBS machines, otherwise we are defaulted to French.

I originally had a great deal of difficulty finding someone who was willing to speak in English (my German is not so great).    
If you have any appropriate contacts or know of any relevant associations / agencies I could contact, please let me know.    
Thanks in advance...

However, I am now plan to fly out of CH from Basel Airport.    
Do you know if the Switzerland Custom Office at Basel Airport will stamp on the form? Do they have a working hour? For late flight, how could I get a stamp on it?   
Thanks,

I now have the UK tariff code 73 21 1900 confirmed on both side, good really as these are international codes.   
Now to get an EUR1 form you have to pay £6 for the forms to be shipped and £46.50 for them to be registered, so finally more in fact than paying the CHF13 per 100kgs as the unit is now confirmed at 350kgs plus packing so 400 or 4 x 13 = CHF56.

2118	Financebankingtaxation	CHF and EURO to pounds	jenniferhuang90	1844	7	Location: Brig	17.09.2013, 00:23	" 
			
			You are looking at completely the wrong rates for the exchanges here anyway.      This is the UBS buy rate and not the sell rate, the current mid rate is 1.4759 so I doubt they would sell you GBP for 1.4005 CHF   (1/0.714) 
Their sell rate is probably in the region of 1.536 or 5.1% so you pay CHF50 to exchange each CHF1000       This is also incorrect, they would buy pounds from you "" 1.376140 but they won't sell at that price. Assuming that this is their buy rate, I would imagine that their sell rate would be in the region of 1.5760 i.e. 6.77%!!! or nearly CHF67 per CHF1000!      This seems closer to reality where they are charging you around 430 pips or 3% from the mid, so you're being charged around CHF30 per CHF1000.   
If you have a UK bank account and if you are a frequent visitor to the UK, there are other brokers I would recommend like Swissquote.ch (75pips + £10 transfer fee) / currencies.co.uk (less than 75 pips and no transfer fee)

			Very easy, you add up all the 4 dividends using the CHF rate on the day in question & place the dividend & tax deducted on the form. Send in a copy of the 4 dividends , a print out from a US online account is fine. You will also get annual tax certificate from a US broker if you have one.   
DA1 :-  Generally 100% of the tax deducted is refunds in about 2 months, then you pay the actual tax you owe when your taxes are calculated. Fill in appropriate parts of the form, they will correct any errors   it's what you pay taxes for!

			Unless your returns are going to be complicated it would be cheaper to ask the canton taxation office if they could help.  I know the Fribourg one does.  They even run evening meetings in February where you can go and find out how to fill in the forms, ask questions, etc.  Contact the Lausanne office and ask if you could make an appointment to go over the form or see if they may have similar meetings you could attend.   
Once you have done one form, it's pretty easy to use it as a template for subsequent years.

			Hi,   
It seems that the impôt a la source for me and my husband is calculated in a wrong way because now we are both working and for both of us the B0 column is used, and we should be taxed by C and C0.   
First I was on B0 and my husband was not working, but he started few months ago and I don't know why, but from his company they put him also on B0.    
Was anybody in the same situation before? Should we announce that there is a mistake? 
Would we pay the difference for the previous months if we announce? What will/can happen if we don't announce this mistake?   
We are really not happy that we need to pay more taxes, our salaries are not so big anyway, but I would prefer paying more over having problems with the system...    
Any advice?   
Thanks in advance!!!

2130	Financebankingtaxation	exemption from the UK VAT?	chill_lee	1109	8	Location: Züri	10.09.2013, 18:33	"      In my experience:   
- first you have to find a store that does tax free (not all are obliged to offer it). Then each shop has its own policy on min spend (eg £50 or £100).  
- You shop around the store, then take the receipts to their tax-free department in the store (signs in store). You show passport and Swiss permit and fill in the forms. 
- At the airport, you (i) must carry the stuff with you through security (ii) follow the signs to HM Revenue and Customs. You show the goods, boarding pass, passport and Swiss permit and they stamp the forms that youhave ""exported the goods"". Note that you must be flying to somewhere outside the EU (eg Switzerland, USA, Japan, ...). 
- Then it depends on the store policy. MOST stores by far use a company called ""Global blue"" (and the forms you'd have will say global blue on them). In that case you just take the stamped form to the global blue kiosk at the airport, usually next door to the HMRC office. They give you an immediate cash refund, but they take a cut (a %) of the refund for the service (no choice). 
- Other stores, most notably Selfridges, dont use global blue, but instead give you a pre-addressed envelope. You return the stamped forms to them by post (can do once back in Switzerland, but the envelope is pre-stamped for UK so may as well put it in the mail box at the airport). When they receive the form back they refund you the full amount to your credit card.   
The only catch in my exeperience when flying is that you need to have the goods (""intact"") with you through security to show to the customs office. So cannot be anything bulcky. It has to be small and valuable, eg jewlery.   Some people say they have managed to find an HMRC officer before checkin and managed to get the form stamped there, but I have looked many times and did not find anything.

                                   Switzerland is racing to end a bitter dispute with Washington  over Swiss bank accounts held by US tax dodgers, but observers warn the  new-found peace could come at a high cost. 
The lower house of the  Swiss parliament voted Monday in favour of a law that will require  Swiss banks to report the holdings of their current and future American  clients to US tax authorities. 
The approval of the US Foreign  Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which aims to block Americans from  hiding money from the taxman in Swiss accounts going forward, comes just  over a week after the Swiss government agreed to a separate deal to  help the country's banks make amends for past wrongdoings. 
Swiss  banks are believed to have accepted tens of billions of undeclared  dollars from US citizens, though they now refuse such money, and Bern  insists both recent deals are needed to end a dispute that has poisoned  relations between the two countries for years. 
Critics however  warn that the deal aimed at settling past wrongs, which comes with stiff  fines attached, could prove deadly for many Swiss banks. 
""It's  devastating for Switzerland's financial industry,"" said business lawyer  Douglas Hornung, warning that even bigger penalties could be lurking  around the corner if European tax authorities decide to follow in  Washington's footsteps. 
The deal offers individual Swiss banks the  opportunity to avoid US prosecution if they agree to hand over  information on US citizens' accounts and to pay an ""appropriate"" fine --  assessed at 20-50 percent of the value of undeclared accounts,  depending on the time they were opened. 
Banks that opened  undeclared accounts for US clients before 2009, when Washington launched  its battle by slapping UBS bank with a whopping $780-million fine for  complicity in tax evasion, will face lower penalties. 
But fines will be stiffer for banks that scooped up tax-dodging US clients after that. 
An  unspecified number of banks already under investigation by US  authorities will meanwhile not be eligible to take part in the  arrangement. 
The Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) hailed the  agreement as a way for the banks to ""settle their US past quickly and  conclusively."" 
But spokeswoman Sindy Schmiegel Werner acknowledged it was unclear how the Swiss banks would weather the storm. 
""We  don't know how exposed each of our members is,"" she told AFP, insisting  though that accepting the deal was necessary to clear away the legal  uncertainty that had been dogging the industry for years. 
Walter  Boss, a tax lawyer with Poledna Boss Kurer AG in Zurich, said  uncertainty was ""one of the worst enemies in the financial world.""   
But more clarity could come at a steep price, even for banks that maintain they have done nothing wrong. 
Forced to cough up US client records, they are basically being ""deemed guilty until proven innocent,"" Boss said. 
Hornung was even more critical. 
""It's not really an agreement, but more of a dictate from the United States,"" he said. 
And  after suffering the onslaught from Washington, the biggest danger could  lie ahead if European tax authorities decide to take the same route as  their American counterparts, Hornung warned. 
""Certainly, the  European clientele is much bigger than the US clientele. If the  Europeans take the same road, the small banks simply can't survive,"" he  cautioned. 
Schmiegel brushed  aside that concern, pointing out that US tax law is very differen since  it is applied to all citizens, regardless of where they live or work in  the world. 
""I don't think the European Union will proceed the same way the US did,"" she said. 
US tax law is meanwhile creating headaches in the run-up to the implementation of FATCA, observers say. 
Fearing  the workload of ensuring compliance and especially the consequences if  they slip up, ""banks have been actively eliminating American clients,""  Jackie Bugnion, a Geneva-based tax expert working for the American  Citizens Abroad lobby group, told AFP earlier this year. 
""It is no  secret that many Swiss and other non-US foreign banks are already not  seeking nor accepting US clients,"" agreed lawyer Samuel Lohman, who  specialises in international law. 
Since  FATCA applies to all American citizens, regardless of their incomes or  fortunes, this can have a devastating impact on a wide range of  Americans, blocking access to mortgages and investments. 
So much so that a growing number of dual citizens have been giving up their US passports. 
For the banks, Americans have become ""toxic"", Hornung said.

			Hello everyone,   
I work in Switzerland and have been living in France from November 2012-September 2013.   
I finally managed to get my head around the taxes, declaring all my income and receiving my tax bill for 2012... which ended up being zero as I was only there for 2 months of that year.   
Now I've just discovered I was also supposed to fill in a Form 3916 to declare bank accounts abroad and I'm terrified I'm going to get a huge fine. None of these accounts receive money that was not already on my French tax declaration, so I didn't think it mattered. I have a Swiss one and a few UK ones from before I moved to France and the income goes into each of these. But then I've already declared the total amount of this income prior to it going to these accounts.   
Should I just run to the tax office and fill in this form and try to avoid getting a fine? I'm worried it's too late.   "	Posts: 23	Join Date: Aug 2013	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 12 Times in 4 Posts	earned some respect

2147	Financebankingtaxation	Capital gains tax rule in CH for sale of a UK property?	jammidge	2801	6	Location: zurich	30.08.2013, 19:45	" 
			
			There is no capital gains tax in Switzerland, at least in the way it operates in the UK.    
Instead you have to pay a ""fortune tax"" based on the assests you own on 31 Dec every year. This includes bank balances, cars, properties, land, etc. The annual tax is fairly small, usually < 1 per thousand.    
So if you have an expensive vase that you sell for profit, you wont pay any capital gains tax, but next year your combined ""fortune"" will be slightly higher.   What's more, foreign property is excluded from your ""fortune"", so you dont pay fortune tax for it, but foreign cash is included (but as mentioned, we are talking of an extra tax of a few 100s per year a most).    
The only exception is Swiss real estate, which has capital gains tax, and can be high if you sell a swiss property in the first few years after you got it.    
Other thing to know, is that Unlike UK, Swiss tax ""gifts"". In the UK you gan give a home (or anything valuable) as a gift to someone (eg relative) tax free, as long as the previous owner doesnt die within 7 years (or inheritance tax may be due). In Switzerlad gifts are taxable.    
So many people do this: 
- when living in the UK => time to ""gift"" some valuable items (eg money) to my children / relatives 
- when living in Switzerland => time to sell my shares, and other valuables for profit.

2164	Financebankingtaxation	UBS to Bank of Scotland	HS983	1364	11	Location: Saint Louis	14.08.2013, 21:05	"    The reason for the detour is the way ""clearance"" is organised.   
Obviously, if someone sends money from bank A to bank B, the money has to be transferred between the banks in one way or another. Banks do not transfer individual amounts between them, they ""clear"" balances at the end of certain periods, usually every day.   
Example: Bank A and Bank B do have direct clearance between them:   
In one day: 
100 customers transfer a total of 1million from A to B. 
90 customers transfer a total of 900k from B to A.   
At the end of the day Bank A owes Bank B 100k, as this is the total difference.   
Now if bank A and B do not have direct clearance between them, they work with their ""correspondence banks"" to enable the same clearance indirectly. For this, they charge the (IMHO inappropriate) fee.

2170	Financebankingtaxation	Question re: credit card for airline miles	genevainseptember	5165	16	Location: Geneva	05.02.2007, 01:42	"    The annual fee is flat, so it really depends on how much you spend as to whether you will get miles outnumbering your annual fee.  And hopefully it goes without saying that you should only be spending what you would have spent anyway, just that you are being smarter about putting it through one card. I am getting better at it; e.g. I buy everything I can on the credit card (as I have already paid the annual fee) including petrol and groceries, so that it all gets the miles too.  Amazing how much that adds up to in a year!    
The Swiss credit card, as mentioned above, now gets you ""Miles and More"" since Swiss was acquired by Lufthansa,  and as mentioned above it is usable on the Star Alliance Network, which really is a very good network and certainly covers the continents and countries that I need to get to for free.        
Go for it ...

			The interest rate the canton pays is better than what our bank offers - so paying in advance is a fairly decent 'investment'.

			It does sound like I've done everything I'm supposed to do. The Tax Office informed me that I should receive my main tax bill very soon.    
It will be a bit of a headache next May when I have to declare taxes from the UK and pay from the UK. I asked the Tax Office for the IBAN/swift to pay my taxes into and I hope to God they are correct.   
I also think it's weird that when I left Basel I got an official Deregistration document with a stamp... and yet when I leave France all I do is hand in a forwarding address to the Tax Office. I've been told that when I declare taxes in 2014, I mention that I left France on 30th September. Still, I would just love to have an official deregistration document. :/

I still don't know if 15% is effective rate or not, but it is not important now. This seems easier and cheaper, then to terminate deposit and lose interest there.   
P.S. PostFinance seems much more suitable for my needs. I'll probably move to them when return to Switzerland.

No we are not. We are on the direct tax regime. I can assure you that I know exactly what regime we are on, we are after all the ones filling out the tax returns, receiving the calculations from the tax authorities and paying the taxes.   
We were NOT under the 'tax at source regime' once myself and my son moved here and have made three declarations so far under the direct tax regime.

Having the amount paid in full every month is preferable and a big advantage since why would you not buy something you didnt have the money for, I have always paid credit card bills in full as long as I have ever had a card as I dont like giving unnneccessary money away to the banks.

			There are cantonal guidelines. So if your daily lump sum allowance is lower than these guidelines, you will most likely have no problems with your deductions.   
Also, some larger companies get their expence policy approved by the tax authority of the canton. In those cases it will for sure be fully deductible.   
If your lump sum is higher than the guidelines, you may still get it approved. You may however, have to show them a reasonable case that you actually spend your lump sum on business expenses. So keep all receipts.   
Remember all these rule are cantonal/communal, not federal so what is accepted in one one commune may very well not be accepted in another.   
Generally, if you have no lump sum and instead get all your expenses reimbursed against receipt, they are usually no problems with the tax authorities.

With the number of foreigners out there living in different cantons, it seems incredible such a loophole would exist.

The scenery is so very different, is it's probably the greatest attraction.   
I object to paying 5 CHF to park in Engelburg, even early season when very few lifts are open & the lift pass is full price. Gouging visitors is common in CH, which is why I only ski in Verbier as it's covered on the Chamonix pass (free parking as well)

2193	Financebankingtaxation	Wrong Tax code	ruskasinthehouse	1109	3	Location: Winterthur	02.08.2013, 13:49	" 
			
			When I was in your situation a few years ago, I just went down to the local tax office and they send a note with the new tax code to my employer's payroll. Up to here all well and good as they adjusted my code quickly and started to deduct tax at the lower rate.   
However, 2 months later my husband started working again so we went back to the local tax office and again they adjusted the tax code. However, this time my employer did not act on this so they under-deducted tax at source for 3 years and I had huge tax bills when I filed my tax returns as a result. I hadn't realised that was the reason why I had to pay more.    
I recently moved cantons and my employer received a notice with my new tax code. They then ""realised"" that they had under-deducted source tax and wanted to deduct back-dated even though I already paid via my tax returns. In the end we settled that they will just deduct the difference for 2013 - all of which does not make any sense to me as I will have a much lower tax bill for 2013 (lower tax location) and will get a repayment. But they insisted they must do it so I had a huge catch deduction - quite irritating.    
Just mentioning all this as it is a good idea to check that our employer is applying the correct tax code.

			As jgl51 says, forget about the payment slips.  You need the name and address of the client, the BIC/SWIFT number and the IBAN number.  Also use the reference number given on the slip so the client can identify which invoice payment you're making.   
Never heard of a blue slip, they're only orange or red as far as I know.  And yes, you'll have to arrange for payment in Swiss Francs.

Of course on your UK tax return you've declared all this already as income right?

2199	Financebankingtaxation	Verrechnungssteur for Interest?	jttraveller	1710	9	Location: Ostschweiz	12.01.2009, 14:19	"    I am also in the process of doing the same this year. You are right, applying with filled form and bank receipts is right process (perhaps also copy of the permit, though I have not been advised to do that).   
I have been said this is done so as to blanket tax everyone 35% as a preventive measure. For smaller fish (which I am for sure), this tax turns out to be very very less indeed so when one fills up the form one can get   refund from tax office.    
I am also told that one can apply for the previous three unclaimed years too if one so desires. Since I came to know about this refund only now, can someone confirm this information? (God, I definitely should spend the refund on German classes so as to be able to understand these things better!! )   
Whereas for bigger fish in the ocean the tax bracket of course gets steeper. At some point probably it gets so steep that 35% looks lucrative, then it is Grey to me. Whether an individual can in principle NOT inform the tax office and thus enjoy his ""only"" 35% tax deduction or not. with all the bank secrecy laws in place, it makes me wonder.

2206	Financebankingtaxation	Importing NEW furniture by transport agent	kroger	1253	2	Location: Zurich	23.07.2013, 14:14	" 
			
			I shipped a household of new goods from London to Switzerland after we bought a place and I left a UK licensed mover to handle everything, including certifying export to Habitat and John Lewis the stores where we bought the stuff. In due course I received VAT refunds.   
The mover used a customs broker who had me sign documents regarding my move. I don't know exactly what was charged, but my recollection is that there was no tax, just fees.   
It isn't my job to understand the Swiss tax law; that's what customs brokers are paid for. If they get me a good deal I am glad.   
An anecdote: Once, when I was a diplomat in Abidjan I gave a businessmen's luncheon and one of the invitees was the manager of the embassy's customs broker. I commented with satisfaction that we as an embassy didn't have to pay any bribes. He laughed and said ""It's all hidden in the fees. We pay what has to be paid.""   
He knew his job and I didn't. There was a scandal with the embassy there once when, as a result of a disagreement, a container was held at the port until all the stuff in it had spoiled. The moral: Don't try to outsmart the experts.   
The moral risk in Switzerland is low; that was there and this is here.    
But I have also used a shipper who advertises from time to time on this forum. He shipped new goods from London too and whereas he ""lost"" the tax papers and I never got the VAT refund I was expecting, neither did I have to pay any tax nor did I get any border documents from his driver. They told me a long story that their van was unloaded at the tunnel from Italy but they still didn't have to pay anything.

2208	Financebankingtaxation	Can I have *both* 3a and 3b pension?	defcon3	2642	9	Location: Geneva	06.12.2011, 16:40	"    As far as I'm aware (think I probably actually read it somewhere here on EF first  ) it is advisable to split up into different accounts, e.g. when you reach say ca. 25k in one 3a account, start a new one. The reason being that when you cash them in upon/after retirement, you have to cash in the whole account (no part withdrawals) which you are then taxed upon (as income??). So if you have several smaller 'pots' you can withdraw one at a time as you see fit over time, thereby minimising the tax impact in a particular year. So basically, to my basic understanding, it is a way of deferring the tax burden until a later date, when you no longer have a regular income.

As long as there's someone living on 80k in/near Geneva, then it's possible for someone earning 120k to put a third of their salary away.  It's all a question of what they're prepared to sacrifice to do it.

			If you just fill your car abroad and travel into Switzerland, no refund is possible, but also no Swiss inport tax is due.   
If you fill in metal fuel containers /jerrycan / bidon in your car, Swiss tax free limit is 25 liters, above that you have to pay Swiss tax of 8% vat, and import duty 0.75CHF per liter. Max is 5kg of fuel per person per day.  
Art 34:      
As far as getting refund from the country abroad, impossible if you bought at a petrol station.. For larger quantities, (eg a tank of mazout for your heating system), bought from a refinery.. possible in theory, but not worth in practice as raw petrol has essentialy the same price world-wide, except from taxes, so you won't see any financial benefits.

2222	Financebankingtaxation	Closing of CH bank accounts of US citizens - payments to CH from abroad	zourab	1957	8	Location: Geneva	11.07.2013, 21:22	"    The English version of the Swissinfo article is here:    
I'm not so sure about Dodd-Frank being so much an obstacle as FATCA but I haven't looked at the issue of jurisdiction (of a bank doing no particular business in the USA but having one or more US-based customers).   The key words in the article are ""actively do[ing] business with US clients"". But I would think that they mean ""soliciting US clients"".    
If you look at the Lloyd's of London cases at   you will see how regulatory jurisdiction can and is waived by the parties even when it shouldn't be.    
In real life, the banks just don't want to be bothered and they have to have a reason to take the trouble and/or the risk. That means having substantial business or a sponsoring firm or a large account, having an established mortgage that can't be called early by the bank.   
Years ago there were cheap workarounds for paying Swiss bills from a foreign account. One I used was Swiss travellers checks, but these, formerly issued by the Swiss Bankers Association with American Express, have been abolished. Then there were Eurocheques, but these have been abolished too. Electronic payment from a European account via IBAN is relatively costly for small transfers but it's mechanically easy online. PayPal may be a possibility and I'm sure there are other ways that I haven't thought of yet.

2223	Financebankingtaxation	Two inconsistent deadlines	jerusheng	748	0	Location: Adliswil	11.07.2013, 20:41	" 
			
			Dear forumer,   
I've settled down for more than half a year now. This ""more than"" just gives me a change to enjoy the struggling with tax return forms. The first thing that puzzles me is what actually the submission deadline it is. There are two dates listed on the bottom part of the first page:   
Einreichungsfrist erstreckt bis: 21.07.2013 
Frist erstreckt bis: 30.09.2013.   
Google translator tells me the first one is ""submission deadline extended to"" while the second is ""deadline extended to"". Seems more reasonable to understand that I should submit the form before 21 July; but what is the other deadline?   
Thanks in advance.   
Regards, 
Cheng, a new Englishforum member

			Sorry I fail to see their point.   
As far as I get it, married international commuters, working in Basel, but whose wives do not live in Basel:         
Well, in Vaud they will be considered as ""single"", so would be even worse off (as they dont live in common household with wives).    
Plus, the calculation is incorrect: in the examples, if they earn 150'000 and 200'000 gross, they'd be taxed using the ordinary taxation anyway (as over 120'000) so the level of tax at source is irrelevant. (not very good accountants, it seems)

2230	Financebankingtaxation	UK fails to get tax from Swiss bank accounts.	MsWorWoo	1783	16	Location: Zürich Nord	05.07.2013, 17:19	"    That's an interesting proposition. In fact one could argue that English domicile is closer to (Spanish) Vecindad Civil.    
What you say is true only in part, and I don't mean to flaunt my knowledge (my mémoire de maîtrise en droit happens to be on the subject). My commune d'oriigine is a place I have never lived in, and been to only for brief visits; I have no living relatives there. I can't recall if my daughter, a surgeon, has even visited there but that's her commune d'origine too. My mum was born there.   
And her domicile of origin for all English-law purposes is New York City, where my father was born.   
As one of my professors argued (and hey, he drafted the Restatement, Second, of Conflict of Laws) and as I said earlier, one can have different domiciles for different purposes, and never mind the private international law issues because different legal systems define it differently. It all comes down to ancient ecclesiastical law. And hey, you still pay British tax from 6 April to 5 April: how crazy is that?   
(Another London-based daughter of mine, a barrister, also has a domicile of origin in New York. And given that she has never married she is more likely than the other to have retained it. And FWIW the children of neither would have US citizenship (an issue of residence) and yet, for English-law purposes (if not income-tax purposes due to later legislation) could be deemed still domiciled there all their lives.)   
I would not say that the definition of domicile for either English or American law is ""vague"". Rather it is difficult of proof in many cases because it depends upon intention, and (at least until we had mobile-phone cell-tower records) facts that often were lied about by (non-)taxpayers.   
As for Sharia (a subject I've written published articles on): it is not unusual for English and American courts to recognise plural marriage, but it's almost always in worker compensation, wrongful death and life insurance cases where the deceased was temporarily in that country and his multiple families remained in his country of origin. Recognition of a foreign domicile used to be important in Wills cases but there is a The Hague convention on recognition of Wills and anyway a private international law rule on intestacy and succession that is likely to supersede the ""ordre public"" rule against.   
Thanks for your contribution, which gave me an excuse to rant.

			As soon as you move, your tax at source code should be adjusted (I say ""should"" because my husband's employer has not adjusted his. To make things easier for them, they only operate codes for Geneva and Zurich. Zurich clearly being lower). My tax code was adjusted for the month I moved so I'm already paying a bit less.   
Worth remembereing that tax at source is an average and depending on your gemeinde, Pillar II & III contribution etc, you may still be required to pay more or have a refund when you come to file.   
As you said, you will pay taxes where you live at the end of the year. Federal tax does not change but your cantonal and ""city"" would. We moved recently from Adliswil ZH to Pfäffikon SZ and the saving is about 40%. So, for 2013, we only pay tax in Pfäffikon and nothing to Adliswil. We got letters from both tax authorities confirming that.

			Our situation was that we paid our deposit on our flat in Switzerland just before we moved here. So at the time were UK residents, but only for a couple of weeks. 
We have received no correspondence about tax from Credit Suisse, who held the flat deposit.  We moved in February (within Switzerland), so the money has been removed from the account, and the account closed.  We received a registered letter from CS to our new address asking for 30% of the deposit.  We only got this letter as there were insufficient funds in the CS account to cover the tax demand.  According to CS they would have taken the money, had it been available. 
So had we not moved, we would be none the wiser!  Due to the nature of the circumstances we are, according to CS, not liable to pay the tax, but we need to explain why in writing.  Basically explain what the account was for and include copies of our permits. 
We are probably not the only ones in thus situation, worth checking if you are affected, and soon. Tax should have been paid on the 31st May.

2241	Financebankingtaxation	Salary was taxed at source, why we still have to pay more tax?	Mig	2241	11	Location: Ecublens	19.04.2013, 22:21	" 
			
			We get a tax agent to do our tax returns. It's very straightforward, I agree, but the agent charged us less than 200chf to do all the documentation, as well as lodge the request to extend the lodgement date, and I think it's worth it for the peace of mind of knowing that a professional has looked over it all and their estimate was just marginally higher than the actual, and prevented a major error at the tax department end.   
8000 chf as an adjustment sounds extremely high after Quellensteuer - unless your combined household income is upwards of 200,000. Our salaries look very high because we get a fee discount for our children's schooling (teachers, part of the package) and that is taxable...   
It may also be possible that one or both employers deducted tax at source from the wrong table - my husband is considered the 'primary' income earner, and my tax at source is higher than his, because my salary is considered to be 'on top' of his, plus the child rebate comes out of his salary as well... I earn less and my tax withheld is more, but it all works out 'in the wash'.

You can bring 300 CHF over the border without declaration, so your packet should be fine.   
If you already have a GA/ZVV-Abo, then this will definitely cost much, much less than the Swiss customs' fees.  Even if you   pay for the train, I wouldn't be surprised if it   ends up cheaper, given the ridiculous amounts charged for processing.

Almost any investment on behalf of this non-US child falls afoul of US law unless some unrelated non-US person (presumably at high cost) takes charge. Of course the situation could be worse: there is a notorious case of a developmentally-challenged adult in Canada who has never lived in the USA and who cannot renounce his jus-sanguinis US nationality but whose disability allowances are compromised:    
It is no wonder that (judging from the discrepancy between the number of US citizens believed to live abroad and the number of tax returns and FBARs filed from abroad) so many dual nationals seem to throw away their US passports, avoid US assets and ignore the IRS, assuming that no future tightening of controls by the USG will force the Swiss Government (and the Canadian and other foreign states) to treat their own citizens as subject to foreign allegiance. Contrary to international law and practice, but that doesn't seem to bother the Congress.

I thought we understood the rules for inheritance and tax (in Vaud btw) but hadn't heard of the Hague convention applying to wills. My wife has a Swiss will for the property and the UK will specifically mentions that. The current 13 families manage quite well at the moment, often sharing together. Long may that last. 
We accept that at some stage we will require professional advice to resolve the situation. 
Thanks again,

			All tax calculators are estimates - so much depends on your exact situation.   
If you really need down-to-the-penny figures, your best bet will be to pay a tax professional to do an estimate on your exact numbers.   
FYI, I've found the Comparis calculator is usually good enough for major decisions, such as whether to accept the job or not, or where to live. Anything else I speak with a tax pro.

2277	Financebankingtaxation	When to renegotiate a new mortgage?	Karl	1023	1	Location: Here	11.06.2013, 13:46	"    IIRC we have to notify the advisor 24 hours before expiry if we do not wish to roll over - but then, we keep it all in 3 month LIBOR these days. A quick chat with your mortgage advisor might be in order top check conditions of your loan - also a good time to set the stage for negotiation.       How much does the bank value your relationship? If you are considered a good customer - that is, they make enough money off you   - there is more room for negotiation. Nothing ventured nothing gained, why not ask?      Sort of - we have experience of paying off a tranche, which is essentially the same as switching to another bank. When we notified the bank that we were paying off a fixed tranche, suddenly the advisor called to try to talk us out of it, offering some interesting rates and alternative investment ideas for that money*. Most advisors don't want to lose the 'easy income' of a mortgage, so if you really are prepared to walk you are in a better position strategically.   
*Unfortunately he couldn't get it through his head that there was no tax advantage for us in keeping the mortgage and none of his investment ideas were appropriate for US citizens...

2278	Financebankingtaxation	ANOBAG vs. self employed vs. freelancer in Germany	eru	1525	0	Location: Basel	11.06.2013, 12:25	" 
			
			Hello,   
there are some topics about self employed in EF, but few answers.  Id try to ask once more    
Im IT freelancer in Germany, but for some reasons Id like to move to CH and work for german customers  partially on german territory (3km behind the border), partially home/CH office. I have at the moment one main german customer.   
To get swiss permit  I see two possibilities: ANOBAG and self-employed (sole entrepreneur).  The second one seems to be difficult, because I have only one non-swiss customer, strictly speaking my german agent which isnt a customer. I could try to prove my Selbständiger status with inquiries and offers from swiss customers (which I had to decline). Also Im approved freelancer in Germany, but that dont care swiss authorities.    
Get ANOBAG status seems to be easier. For me it looks like ANOBAG have to pay slightly more, I mean social securities. Is this true or is the difference bigger? Has ANOBAG any other disadvantages?    
Of course I could stay german freelancer and live in Germany. I would pay higher german taxes but if you compare lower swiss source tax you have to take into account mandatory social insurances (AHV, IV and EO, summed 9,7% (?)). Comparing so the difference isnt so dramatic   
I know, of course, I could open a GmbH. I see that as the last possibility, because Ill probably fire a swiss resident as director. I think that will be expensive, beside of other administrative costs   
What would you recommend me?

If you plan to own a car, then things get tricky:   
Old car = MFK review, insurance, rego, etc.   
Then there is the whole parking issue, plus a billion speeding camera's everywhere...... from what I've heard about Italian drivers, this maybe the death of you.     
Alternatively, and highly recommended = Public transport.   
An annual fee for a ""Half Tax card"", and depending on your budget, perhaps an abo for the entire public transport system of ""zone 10"" in Zurich for regular daily travel,  
""All Zurich"" is more expensive but will cover you for the entire Zurich Canton. 
On 85K, I'd step aside from the ""GA"" for all of Switzerland though..... for that you can still hire a car when required via ""Mobility"".

			I also get annoyed by arbitrary inflation of the value of an item, even when it is clear on the invoice, aside from any admin fees, that happens sometimes on import.   
But I pay up and use other means to ensure I am ahead on other wins - eg by using a paketservice over the border or tax-free shopping at home.   
I get the same sense of satisfaction as if I had somehow won the argument on my wrongly charged VAT, without the hassle of having to do it.

			To answer that one; only withholding tax of 5% on the interest may be charged by CH.   
Annoying thing may be that CS withholds the standard 35% (on the interest of the financial year) and that you need to apply for a refund. Whether this is worth the hassle with the current interest rates I leave to you (if it is, I salute thee!!)

Just google it. You could just take CHFs and exchange there.   
Otherwise, the second best option will be your Swiss debit card (not credit card!) and use of ATMs. Just keep in mind you'll be charged 3 to 5 CHF for each withdrawal so better withdraw big amounts less often.   
Buying GBP at the airport or probably anywhere else in Switzerland will get you less for your money.

I again sent them scanned copy of Meldebescheinigung and they unblocked it and within one week I received card and online banking details.

2300	Financebankingtaxation	US Taxes tips & info - beyond the FEIE	vinczebarni	9776	146	Location: Affoltern am Albis	21.05.2013, 14:31	"    Then why bother filing when no interest exists in explaining how such is to be done?      Most Americans in America, absolutely!  Most Americans in Switzerland, probably not.  TV generally comes as a standard package with rentals, meaning that renters may not know that they have ""pay TV"", would not know how to cancel the subscription, may not even be able to cancel the subscription and are unaware that the subscription, who's amount is unknown, must be deducted from the monthly rate when reported as a housing exclusion.   
I wouldn't be surprised if the vast majority of Americans in Switzerland are including ""pay TV"" with the rental rate when deducting such with the housing exclusion.  As such, stateside Americans could easily define Americans in Switzerland as being ""tax cheats"", if they wanted to, and wipe out their life's taxed savings.      An American fresh in Switzerland won't have a clue about Billag, Cablecom, Swisscom or any of this, there is certainly no information to inform them about this, and you yourself stated that it is perfectly acceptable to not inform Americans about their filing requirements so that they are absolutely clueless when filing, if they even know that they have to file!      So, when audited, one can excuse errors by stating: ""I used common sense""?      Explain.  May an individual deduct the most expensive internet bill for the ultimate TV enjoyment and best phone experience?

If you're worried about fraud, however, I can tell you that my credit card details were stolen once (not the actual card) and used (to buy airline tickets, of all things) and it was taken care immediately by UBS.  No fees, no arguing.  They simply cancelled the card, sent a new one, and sent a form that listed the fraudulent charges that I had to sign and return.

Does anyone know someone (English speaker) who can do this for me at a reasonable cost. My only income here is my salary (taxed at source) so it should be fairly straightforward but with my German I don't want to take a chance!   
Many thanks.

			We are always very careful with this just in case. At a tangent, we recently send a fairly substantial sum of money to one of our daughters in Spain. It automatically flagged up a 'warning' sent to our Bank Manager who tried to phone us, but we were in UK by then. The payment was delayed as he could not reach us - he then used his judgement to allow payment as he knew our daughter's name and that she lived in Spain. We saw him yesterday and he explained what had happened, and said in future it would be best to phone him if we have to do it again (I hope NOT ) - so he would know it was 'kosher'. We kept messaging daughter to ask if money had arrived, and panicked for a while as we didn't know why the transfer was delayed.

2336	Financebankingtaxation	Very confused about tax on UK property	djc1885	7771	22	Location: Villars sur Ollon	16.12.2009, 15:01	"    It depends on what purpose your mortgage was used for and whether there is any income to offset against it.   
As Andy02 states, the application of the funds determines in part whether or not the interest is deductible to start with. Were the funds applied for the purpose of generating taxable income? You cannot claim the interest deduction if, for instance, you increased a mortgage to purchase a private car or a holiday.   
If the funds were used to purchase a house, but that house is being used privately with no rental income or any income generated is exempt from income tax (e.g. charitable purposes) then again the answer is no.   
If the income is below market rates (e.g rented to a family member) then there may be a deduction but you will need to declare as income the market rate and not actual return of income before any calculation of net profit/loss is made.   
As PWC said, the interest needs to be allocated to what it was spent on, and the income status of that spent item needs to be determined before any deduction can be considered.

2337	Financebankingtaxation	American inheritance tax in CH?	narco	4428	8	Location: zurich	28.05.2010, 20:13	"    Yes, all estates of ""US persons"" are subject to US federal estate tax (the US does not have an ""inheritance"" tax although some states do; inheritance taxes generally vary according to the relationship of the recipient (as does the German IHT; thus UK ""IHT"" is also an estate tax despite its name)). There will be a credit towards the US federal tax for any Swiss/cantonal inheritance tax paid. If there is property located in a US state or a state deems the person domiciled there, it may also assess tax.   
That said, there is no reciprocal tax collection agreement between the USA and Switzerland and thus if there are no assets of the succession in the USA there are no means for the IRS to enforce the tax unless the heirs have a US connection, visit the US or have assets there.   
Read this memo, formerly distributed by the Swiss Embassy in Washington:    
Civil-law ""succession"" is not by means of an ""estate"" (""une masse"" in French). The legal heirs and the testamentary heirs of any discretionary portion of the decedent's assets gain direct title. It may thus be difficult to achieve the unanimity needed to file IRS Form 709 and apportion the tax fairly among the heirs, even more so if there are minors involved. If there is a surviving spouse, the chances are nil that Swiss court will assist in the creation of a QDOT (you can Google that, it's a trust that permits the postponement of US estate tax on assets passing to a spouse at death).   
But: there is a principle of ""transferee liability"" that would enable the IRS to seize any US assets of an heir to meet the estate tax (death duty) liability of that person in respect of inheritance from a decedent whose succession passed with unpaid tax. The fact that the decedent's offspring are (you say) American citizens suggests that the IRS will have jurisdiction over them. And where an executor or an administrator fails to file Form 709, or is not appointed (or doesn't exist, as in Swiss law), it is incumbent on the heirs to file it and pay any tax due.   
Bear in mind that few estates are actually subject to US estate tax. It is a base canard, propagated by anti-tax people like Grover Norquist and by propagandists acting for the very rich, that ordinary working people, owners of small businesses and family farmers will have estates subject to the tax. In 2011 the exemption amount (unless changed by Congress) will revert to $1 million and the federal tax rate on amounts above that may be taxed at a rate up to 55%; in 2010 there is no estate duty at all. Google 'estate tax exemption' for more information.

2342	Financebankingtaxation	Tax implications of contracting in Germany	xFrog	1296	0	Location: Zug	29.04.2013, 22:34	   I am an EU National and Swiss Resident with a C permit.    I have self-employed in my own Swiss GmbH established in 2012 in Zug to provide IT Consulting/Contracting services.   Since August 2012, I am working as an IT contractor for a large ERP implementation for a customer located in Germany. I am working roughly 70% on site (3 weeks out of 4), commuting from Monday to Friday.   I have spent about 50 days in Germany in 2012 but the number of days is increasing rapidly for 2013 and the project may extend further in 2014.   My understanding is that if I remain below 183 days in Germany per calendar year (1st jan.-Dec 31), I should avoid having to pay taxes in Germany.   Is my understanding correct? Should I be safe from having to pay taxes if I physically remain below 183 days in Germany?   Is there also a number of days not to exceed within 2 or 3 consecutive years that I should consider?   To make things even simpler, the service contract is not directly with the German company but through a UK agency. But to my knowledge should not make a difference.   Thank you in advance for any feedback/comment   Cheers,   xFrog  	Posts: 3	Join Date: Aug 2011	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present
2343	Financebankingtaxation	Spousal income tax rate	3girlsmum	3227	16	Location: Lausanne	25.04.2013, 21:08	"    Since the kids turned up we've been largely a single income family. In the UK, I was on £50K. A couple both earning £25K were several £1000 better off than us, since they received tax credits for their kids and a lower tax bill. The ""married persons"" tax allowance I receive didn't really make up for it.   
If my wife had worked here while we were still on Quellensteuer, we agreed that part of my income would be transferred to her, so that would be the same as if she was taxed first and me taxed second. Now we're off Quellensteuer (and she is working), it  . Since this is the case, I can't see how it encourages wives to stay at home.   
It used to be that the UK taxed jointly, but apparently husbands and wives (particularly husbands) knowing their spouses income was a gross invasion of privacy, so they went for separate taxation. Then introduced tax credits which require knowledge of your spouse's income...

			I would hold onto the money instead of converting it to francs at this exchange rate. If you are unsure of your status in switzerland its best to keep it there lest you pay conversion fees. I would draw down the money gradually when i do shopping in germany or buy a car there since you already have the cash.

			Thanks to all advice. Yes, true that they are more cautious about laundering and I want to respect that, but I was so upset with PF's inconsistency of advice. Luckily I have Global Premiere account with HSBC in multicurrency and my RM agreed to receive that transfer because he knew me since old last name and HSBC went through many details with me to change my last name, signature, etc. I did not think of this option coz there is no HSBC Premiere in CH and the nearest location I can get access to my cash without fee is France. But now this seems the best option for me and more reason to go to Paris more often!

			Another question of PostFinance Mastercard - Prepaid/Value:   
Anyone know how to top up the prepaid card via eFinance?  Number one son claims he should be able to do it, but I can't see any option when I look at his online screen.  I can see the card balance and transaction screen, but that is all.   
In fairness to him the promotion material seems to suggest it is possible but...   
""Free, by inpayment slip, at the post counter or via e-finance""

Changing may create a short term problem... I have been with M&M for a long time and have a very high limit.  This limit is important as I travel on short notice and can be up to a few times in a month.  Walking into a new credit card solution would take a while to build up to that limit.  One does not walk into a platinum card    
Side note to TO, some people want free and waste time searching and changing... I want quality and stability.

2. Don't know- 
3.""3. Unless you have large medical bills you are unlikely to be entitled to a deduction. Yes you need backup."" 
-> to be accurate it depends on your canton rules.   
Additionally, as said, it has to be large- in Vaud it's 
 ""Part excédant le5 % du revenu intermédiaire (code 700 DI)  
Frais résultant d'un handicap : frais effectifs (voir directive)""   
So it's like 5% of the total income of a specific step in the calculation tool-   
It also says if it's cost resulting from a disability, then it's the ""actual cost of the medical expense""?     
You might want to consult the ""deduction list"" or help from your canton's income documents.

			Did you pay tax on the employee and employer contributions during your time here?  If so, then it would not be double taxed.  I understand you would still have tax on the earnings though.   
Swiss pillar 2, like most foreign pensions are non-qualified in US terminiology, thus taxed as noted above.  And as such are not transferable to US qualified plans.

			I would imagine no, simply because, as you say, the US government (your employer) reimburses you for many expenses you spend here.     
If other things quilified (such as car tax), they would reimburse them too, rather having to go through this convoluted way of paying and then claiming allowances/deductions in the the tax return afterwards.   But dont you receive anyway extra salary allowances if you are deployed, to cover exactly things like that?

Nein.      
That looks like you get the standard deductions (Kinderabzug) and nothing else. 
Standard is 7400 Staatssteuer and 6500 Bundessteuer per child, provided the child is in the first education (Erstausbildung) and whose support is paid for primarily by the parents. Valid for the child to age 25. 
See §24.1 in the 2012 Wegleitung

			My husband did his with our bank, UBS, when he was redundant for a year.  It's a special account just for pension money and will stay there until you get a new job.  When you do you can then close the account and have the money transferred into your new company's pension scheme.   
It's called a Vested Benefits account in English and there's more info here:       
Any of the major and cantonal banks should offer a similar account I think so ask your current bank to see what they have or go somewhere else if you prefer.  It doesn't have to be kept at the same bank as your other accounts so shop around.

			I read somewhere the amount of data is 160 times larger than previous leaks.    
It really has been a huge task, and I am very pleased some of the super rich are being caught. What do you do after you have spent your first million? Governments everywhere are desperate for tax income, especially in the third world.    
To keep the opinion that they can spend this money better than an honest government is extremely arrogant. One Spanish lady has about 140 million in wealth, she keeps it offshore so she can pay for her art collection, which is exactly against the principles of Pablo Picasso: he painted prolifically so that his art would remain low priced and available to everyone.

In Vaud: it says clearly in many places that such people ""must file a tax return"". So definitely compulsory, not a choice. However, you cannot file until they send you the details / forms / codes.  So you cannot ""cold send"" one tax declaration (not even online), they have to invite you first.  But, I don't know if you just wait till they realise and send you one, or you if they don't then you should contact them and ask for one. - who is to blame?   
In my case, I contacted them and they send me now a form to complete.  Just because I thought that, usually, the Swiss way of doing things would be, once they realised down the line they would ask me to fill a form for the previous years,... and as im my case I have to pay extra, I'd rather get it over with, rather worry all the time about a potential huge cumulative bill...

2384	Financebankingtaxation	Impots a la source	dan2k3k4	1902	4	Location: Geneva	05.04.2013, 10:50	"    Correct, except if you work in GE and live in France: they will take GE import a la source too (by agreement between France-GE, apparenty), which is offset from your French tax return ... (just in case you 'forget' to pay the French tax authorities).    
But even Geneva's ""high"" tax rates are lower the neighbouring countries.   
Vaud is lower (but not really half..), so you could save if you move to Vaud. But it probably has to be quite a bit into Vaud, as the neighbouring properties are already taken by people who thought about it before you :-)  . Also need to check the permit, as non EU need authorization to change cantons.

			As a general rule, you'll get the best rate by making withdrawals from ATMs abroad, despite the fee. You'll get the money exchanged at a bank-to-bank exchange rate and not the hard currency rate, which is better for you. However the fixed fee (generally around 5 CHF) means that it makes little sense to make small withdrawals, so go for larger amounts each time you make a withdrawal (around 200 CHFs or so).

			Thanks so much for the reply but unfortunately the 2 sections under Code 410 treat the interest income differently and that's where my problem lies. If I file the CD as a Comptes bancaires then the interest income is included as part of the 1500 Fr. deduction allowed for interest under Code 480.  However, if the CD is filed as a Fonds de placement then the interest isn't counted in the 1500 Fr. deduction.

2388	Financebankingtaxation	Tax relief on unoccupied UK property with mortgage	esctosh	2523	30	Location: Luzern	03.04.2013, 16:18	"    That is cometely untrue. There is a double tax agreement between the UK and a switzerland . Tax on rental income is paid in the UK. I do this via self assessment. As the net profit is below the annual allowance I pay no tax. But this is still my tax assessment for the year. I cannot then be double taxed in Switzerland.    
My situation anyway is that the property is unoccupied and up for sale. So the question is can I offset my expenses against my Swiss income as I no longer have a UK income to offset them against I.e can I take advantage of the double tax arrangement in this way ?

As far as Contributions is concerned, I am paying all the contributions separately. This option was under Pension Fund which has two components a) Risk Premium b) Savings Account. The 2K is going towards Savings Account under Pension Fund.

			Must be all that money we have with them  . Rather, that we owe them - they hold our mortgage and we are in a small town.  Maybe the guy had nothing else to do.  Frankly, I was afraid he was telling me they were going to have to terminate our ""relationship""!  And maybe because Raiffeisen is like a coop and being a ""member"" we are technically part owners of the bank, or have a share in it.  So not quite a bank, I guess   
Edit - and technically I think he was calling to explain the situation to me and wanted to know if I wanted to come in and talk to him about it or discuss it over the phone.  I assured him that I am aware of the situation and don't need any further explanation.  I hope I didn't mis-speak!

2394	Financebankingtaxation	Investing in UK ISA from Switzerland?	Pachyderm	3501	17	Location: Zurich	28.03.2013, 09:33	" 
			
			Thanks, everyone. Some very useful points, in particular the one about ISA contributions being taken down and used in evidence by the UK taxman when it comes to residency status.   
On balance, I've realised this not a good idea, and will not try adding to my existing UK ISA.   
A couple of points:      In the short term, no, but my ISAs are long term investments, so at some point in the distant future, if and when I return to the UK and want to withdraw the ISA proceeds, UK tax would become a consideration.      Great point, thanks.        I do have a UK-based brokerage account for non-ISA stocks and shares. I've heard good things about IB but already have an account with SwissQuote who match my (modest) trading needs while in CH. Thanks for the info though.      As others have said, that doesn't sound right. An existing cash or S&S ISA should still operate as normal with deposits made while you lived in the UK. Where you subsequently move to should not affect that.       Depends on how long you've been non-UK resident. I believe you can contribute to a SIPP for up to 5 years after leaving Blighty, and still get tax relief on anything up to 3,600 UKP.      No thanks! There is a tiny chance you'll win the jackpot but the stats show that on average, your winnings amount to about 2.5% interest. Unless you have a big win, you are actually losing money in real terms with Premium Bonds.   
Looks like my best option is to pay the sum into my standard stocks and shares account.

2398	Financebankingtaxation	Reclaiming Source Tax / Quellensteuer on Income Received After Leaving Switzerland	thetraveller313	2342	0	Location: Zug	28.03.2013, 04:39	" 
			
			Dear fellow EF members,   
I have been puzzled with a source tax issue and after looking through the threads in the forum with no luck I have decided to create a new post.   
The issue here is on the exorbitant source tax levied on one-off bonus / large salary payments.   
I used to work in Switzerland as an expat and left late 2011.   
I was always taxed at source and filed a tax return at the end of the year to claim any overpaid tax. Most of this overpaid tax came from a bonus payment 
which would normally be paid all in one month, increasing the Quellensteuer rate for that month significantly.    
I never bothered asking my employer to spread out this amount over the year to decrease the monthly Quellensteuer as I was always able to claim it back from the tax return. Besides, most employers would probably not bother doing it anyway.   
This is where things went wrong. I had a deferred bonus payment that I only received in 2012. I have been informed by my tax accountant and the Kanton tax office that as I had left Switzerland on the payment date, I will not be able to file a tax return for 2012 and hence no return will be given.   
This sounds a bit silly as the high Quellensteuer rate is based on the assumption that this bonus amount is a recurring monthly payment while it is simply a one-off.   
Under Quellensteuer Tariff A, anything above 60k is taxed 24%. Assume that the payment was a one-off 60k you would have to pay this 24% tax. If this was distributed across the year resulting in 5k monthly payments the tax would be 3.16%.   
This means that you have effectively handed out 12.5k worth of tax you'll never see again.   
Has anyone else had bonus / large payments paid out after leaving Switzerland?   
If so, were you able to claim some of this overpaid source tax back?   
I would really appreciate any advice.   
Thanks.

			Pre-FATCA, I wasn't living here yet but being married to a Swiss citizen, I asked about getting a Swiss bank account. They said no problem, if you have at least 1 million CHF, otherwise forget it.    
The whole experience was a bit fun. I went into Credit Suisse at the Paradeplatz. When I asked about opening an account, they had me fill out a form and then wait. On the form you had to check a box that said if the amount was more or less than 500,000. They took me to a private room and gave me a beverage. The guy who helped me was very nice and courteous but afterwards I kept wondering what kind of service I would have gotten if I had checked the over 500,000 box?

I'd contact your local office and ask them if it's possible.  If you filled in the tax form, you should have kept a copy for yourself of the figures.  Again, if they're wildly different from what you expected ask to meet with someone to explain why.  They're usually quite helpful.

			Yes.. complicated. But in most such cases, you cannot arrange your life according to the tax rules, you do what you have to do, and then pay whatever taxes are appropriate.    
But talking to an accountant (eg un UK preferably as it is there the 'problem') may help, as eg. he may tell you eg. that for your salary in your case, it may not matter if you live in uk or ch as far as where taxes are due, because the 2 countries have agreed that it should be taxed in the country where the company is (im making it up it's not that simple).  But it can get very comlicated, in cases investment or self employment income.

I have just received an invoice from the Zurich Steueramt for my 2010 Taxes which I did not expect. I have about 30 days to reply if I disagree and I would like to find a good Tax advisor that could have a look at my tax declaration and all the items to make sure this charge is correct.    
I used the support of a Tax accountant back at the time and I am not very happy with it as my situation is a bit more complex, so would need someone with clear Tax knowledge and who has experience with foreign residents in Switzerland for Swiss broad taxes as I have moved now from Zurich to Zug.   
Thanks in advance for your help!   
Joan.

Thank you for your reply , I may be able to gain an extension from the sheriff as I've had 2 already but that's a very good point I struggle to get my solicitor to work efficiently so it make take some time with my Nana's! I'm thinking the best thing is to present the list of assets as it is and add any others at a later date . I'm just worried because I have to take out a caution insurance policy and this determined by the amount of the estate .   
Unfortunately the duper's solicitor has objected to my guardianship giving me lots more hoops to jump through , they of course believe they are protecting their inheritance and have done nothing wrong , however they have supplied very minimal information !!   
I definitely take your point on board about the time aspect though , thank you for pointing that out x

Poor legal drafting on the Swiss side and the British nanny state make this a bit more complex in practise, however it is not impossible.   
Before starting to jump through the hoops, think carefully about doing this especially if you have a UK defined benefit pension as the transfer value is unlikely to be worth as much as a deferred pension. Also the transfer eats up part of your Additional Contribution possibility without getting the tax deduction. The most logical reason I have heard to want to do the transfer is to get enough money into the second pillar to be useful in a house purchase (see Accessing While in Switzerland). See Pension - Moving my UK pension to Switzerland   
So you still want to do it? An UK pension fund will only transfer pension benefits directly to an overseas scheme if that scheme qualifies under UK law as a QROPS scheme. These schemes need to comply with a number of fairly onerous reporting requirements towards UK HMRC, and as a result only major international employers' schemes tend to go along with it. A list of QROPS schemes is available at   Swisscanto are not QROPs and have no plans to become so.   
If your employers fund is not a QROP and you are talking about a transfer large enough to make the fees worthwhile then there are several providers who can offer transit pension funds that are QROPs approved. Be aware however these providers are interested in building long term relationships not being ports of convenience. Some of these providers are referred to in this thread Freizuegigkeitskonto [vested benefit account]

2427	Financebankingtaxation	Good US Tax Attorney in Zurich	paestum	5152	11	Location: Italy	27.07.2010, 18:06	"    Tax attorneys and accountants serve different purposes. Some US tax lawyers are also qualified as CPAs, but you would not want to consult such a person for routine taxes; more for complex estate planning.   
Tax attorneys (like myself) deal in tax philosophy and law, not so much numbers. I do returns for friends just to keep abreast of procedure, but it would not be economic to take on that kind of work generally: an accountant will have specialized software, be more efficient, and cheaper. (For example TurboTax has a professional edition; as do several other software suppliers. I don't do enough such work to justify buying it and paying them royalties on a per-return basis.)   
A major international tax firm (Big 4, etc.) would also be a ridiculous expense unless your employer is paying. A lot of laid-off City types in London went berserk when they lost that perk.   
Those who work in Switzerland and do not have tax equalization deals are bound to be double-taxed in several ways. There is not much you can do about that. Those married to Swiss and other non-Amcits have a serious estate planning problem since the usual rules for US-based mixed couples don't work abroad. (Forced heirship; QDOTs may be impossible, etc.)   
Good luck.

You can only deduct these if you fill in a tax return - whereas the Pillar 3a tax rebate is available to everyone who makes the contribution during the tax year.  There is a separate form for this which you fill in and send to the tax office by 31 March.   
Whether it's worthwhile for you to fill in a tax return will depend on how big these tax-deductible expenses are for you, and the tax rate of the town you live in.

2437	Financebankingtaxation	Expat Tax filer in NYC or Boston for US and Chinese married couple	JohnStGallen	821	2	Location: St Gallen	12.03.2013, 18:24	"    Let's address you and your wife separately first, and then together:   
You - From your profile I see that you're a British citizen. If you are not also a U.S. citizen/green card holder, and if you did not earn any U.S. income in 2012, then you do not need to file. Your income would not be included on your wife's return.   
Your wife - She earned income in the U.S. during 2012, thus she is a resident for tax purposes for that year and will have to report worldwide income. She would file as ""married-filing separately."" You are wise to find an accountant to help you sort this out because...   
Together- In Switzerland married couples have to file a joint return. You'll need the accountant to sort out the taxes she paid here and whether she'll get credit for those on her U.S. return. It's possible your combined income for CH in 2012 was taxed at source or not high enough to file here, in which case you'll have to track down that information in order to fill out your wife's U.S. taxes.   
Another catch - Because your wife will be a U.S. resident for tax purposes in 2012, she *might* be subject to FATCA requirements. You can search the Forum for a bunch of info, but basically if she (or the two of you together) held $10,000 or more in any account worldwide for even a day then that has to be reported on a separate form. Forum folks, please chime in on this one because I could be and hope I am wrong!   
Going forward - In 2013, assuming you and your wife are not citizens/green card holders and have no U.S. income, you won't have to file again.   
Whew! Good luck!   
Forgot to add: Your wife can request an extension until October due to being overseas. I am not sure if she can do it online, but for sure she can download and mail the form.

			Update: 
I went to the tax office in Lausanne.   
As expected, as i don't have >120K income and i'm ""a la source"", I only could do the ""declaration simplifiée"". The civil servant helped me good to fill that form and also could calculate an approximation of what ""I Should"" get back.   
We will see after it will be processed and refunded, because he said they were additional elements they were using, not known to public.   
But the guy was very helpful and the entire thing including filling additional docs took no longer than 15min.   
So the VAUD TAX is simple, well explained, but needs lot of time to read everything. 
The ""simplified declaration"" is harder, a bit more obscure, but with help of the civil servant it's a quick document.   
Gosh... I saved* thousands chf of doing it myself rather than paying a tax helper!!

			Sort of.  What I did (at the advice of my tax advisor) was to make my best guess as to what work would fit into what bucket.  I took fixing a problem as tending toward ""Computerhardware- und -software: Handel -- Reparatur- und Servicearbeiten"" and telling someone how to do something (answering questions) as ""EDV-Serviceleistungen"".  Then I filled out these two forms and sent them in:           
On the second form I listed the percentage breakdown of my income:   
30% sales (1.3% tax rate) 
45% ""Computerhardware- und -software: Handel -- Reparatur- und Servicearbeiten"" (1.3% tax rate) 
25% ""EDV-Serviceleistungen"" (6.1% tax rate)   
The MWST people responded and told me to just file everything with a 1.3% tax rate.  They included a MWST Abrechnungsformular for my business where I just put in my total Umsatz for each 6-month period and then calculate 1.3% of that as my MWST payment.

			EUR _ CHF Analysis from xe.com:   
EUR-CHF retraced the recent rally on fund profit taking and corporate  demand for swissy. The cross fell sharply from 1.2570 highs to just  under 1.2400. The pace of the turnaround forced out weak longs in  EUR-CHF and the tone is more defensive as a result. Selling pressure was  noted just over 1.2450 in Asia and early European accounts pressured  bids in front of 1.2400. EUR-CHF price action looks mobile though and  one leading Swiss name has readjusted a long EUR-CHF trade to target  1.2750 from an intial target of 1.2550. We expect dip buying to  continue, with barriers at 1.2575 and 1.2600 a target.

			If the household earns under 120k, then the tax at source covers everything.   
If the household earns more than 120k, then you need to do a tax return at year end.  The tax return gets submitted in your gemeinde.  The town then checks it, calculates the tax for town and Kanton, and then informs you.  They take the tax at source into account, so often nothing to pay at this stage.   
The town then informs the federal tax authority of the tax return, and any remaining balance of tax at source.  You get then a different bill (or refund) when the federal tax people have done their maths.   
For 2011, I got my local tax confirmation in September and the federal tax confirmation+ bill in January 2013.

			There is really no problem in working in the UK on a Swiss contract. Yes, you're likely to have to pay taxes in both countries, but any tax you pay in CH will be offset against tax you pay in the UK.    
Note that tax liability is mainly to do with where you are resident, not where your employer lives. I do a lot of work for a UK company from Switzerland, and pay not a penny in UK tax.

I agree the exchange rate is a problem at the moment

I now have a UK state pension and a small private pension. I plan to remit the amounts to Switzerland each quater or so.   
I assume the value of my UK home will need to be declared until it is sold and that it may affect the tax bracket rate

			Your employer should give you a document that states all your income and contributions... and that is the basis for your tax return.   
Hopefully they will declare the correct amounts - but the problem will not be yours - as long as the tax office doesn't think you've deliberately tried to hide payments or whatever... do you have monthly salary statements and details of payments from the employer to your bank account ?

2463	Financebankingtaxation	Personal Selling and Taxation	SwissMs2000	545	1	Location: Cham, Zug	01.03.2013, 13:59	"    Business/entrepreneur is probably the better forum.   
If you sell occasionally, goods you have owned for a while and didnt borrow money to buy them any gains you make are most likely capital gains and not taxable.   
If you buy goods to resell etc, you are running a trade and the gains are taxable as income.  There is not a fixed test for the cut-over point, but there are guidelines.   
You can probably get away ebaying as a hobby, but not much more.   
If you expect to sell over c.70kchf per annum you must register for VAT (MwSt).

			There's generally a sliding scale associated with a fixed term's early payment penalty... i.e. it costs a fortune in the first year and not so much in the final year. You should ask the lender what the penalty would be if you paid off the mortgage tomorrow, without introducing any other factors. At least then you've got a baseline.

2475	Financebankingtaxation	Can I open a Swiss bank account in England?	Symone	5303	8	Location: England	21.02.2013, 14:54	" 
			
			Some points:   
First of all, to answer the main question, you *cannot* open a Swiss account from London. Swiss law says that for opening an account the bank must meet the customer on Swiss terrotory (so you have to visit Switzerland at least once).    
First for the non-Swiss partner: Banks separate foreign customers as those living in Switzerland and those who dont. If you live here (and have a residence permit to prove it), opening an account is straightforward. If you do not, then generally you can only open savings accounts (so no Maestro card or online banking) but most require at least 50000 franks or even more. Generally there are no monthly fees. But you may have to visit a big branch where they can deal with non-residents. Banks have a right to reject customers.    
Second for the Swiss national, it is easier, but again you must visit CH and also you face quite high charges if you are not living/working/have property here. Basically banks want ex-residents to close their current accounts when leaving (Credit suisse charges 40 CHF per month).    
So basically in your case it's best to wait and do as soon as you arrive. It takes no time at all, you visit a bank and get the account number on the spot, and you can then use online banking to tranfer from UK to Switzerland.

There is a separate scale for ""non-married"" and a ""combined married"" tax scale. But the ""marriage penalty"" is caused by a double income couples are effectively being bumped up  a notch.  Worst case scenario is where both partners earn about CHF 75'000 until 125'000      It depends somewhat in which tax bracket you are... and in single income marriages, there is no marriage penalty. It only affects double income marriages.

			Your employer or tax office can answer this question. We probably have too few members taxed directly and experienced in this situation.    
Even though you applied for a tax reduction, why do you think you will get one? Taxed at source means being taxed in the Canton where you work, not where you live (I am fairly certain that statement is correct)

You can't simply consolidate all your years in different countries as a continuous contribution. When it's retirement time (hehe probably 70 as said above) one gets partial pensions from all the different countries one has contributions in, as long as there is at least one full year. 
I suppose it can work out in your favor considering how low the basic pension is if you complete 44 years in CH alone, but it's a hassle. 
So I guess the lesson is: start saving privately.

I like to joke that ""France is very French"", so as a single person without French it is not much fun. The most expat place is probably Pays de Gex (West of Geneva under the Jura mountains), which is a melting pot of people from all over, many working at either CERN or the UN. However, it is basically just one big housing estate. I think that living in Geneva is probably a better option, while you ""get a life"".

			Yes, that actually makes sense for money laundering etc.    
I think it really depends how much its worth to you and the sending party. I would guess that if you open a UBS GBP account (UBS seems to be the intermediary for your or their bank) and have it wired there in GBP it would *probably* survive the transfer in the same currency. But the FX rate and fees will almost certainly not make it that attractive. Probably the most cost effective was for the sender to use XE or transferwise amd send to you in your preferred currency.

2508	Financebankingtaxation	Help with employer stock purchase-US Taxes	kiwiguy08	652	0	Location: Horgen	03.02.2013, 18:41	" 
			
			I have a somewhat perplexing case as I try to fill out my US tax return. My employer is a swiss subsidiary of a European company. This year we were offered an employee stock purchase program with the following conditions....   
-15% discount of the corporate stock price   
-those purchasing stock would receive a 2000 euro bonus from the employer which would buy us the corresponding number of shares (also at the 15% discount)   
Has anyone had experience with these purchase plans in the US or as an expat?    
-Does the employer bonus count as taxable income this year or the year i cash in the stocks? (3 year freeze, can be reduced by special circumstance) Is this bonus earned income or unearned income and will the gains (if there are any) be taxed as income or a capital gain?   
-Does the 15% discount count as earned or unearned income. (can be deducted with FEIE)? And when is this reported? this year or when cashed in   
Thanks for any help that you can offer

2509	Financebankingtaxation	Lombard Loans	Caviarchips	3630	14	Location: Basel Stadt	30.01.2013, 00:06	" 
			
			A Lombard loan is similar to a deal with a pawn broker. You give some security and the bank makes no pretense at considering your ability to repay. You simply get a loan based on the security you can provide.   
Here is how it could work happily in a rising market assuming you can borrow 70% of the value of the security . . .    
Starting Capital in shares of value 100'000 Fr. 
Use the original 100'000 Fr. shares packet as security and obtain a Lombard Loan for 70'000 Fr. which you use to purchase shares. 
Use the  70'000 Fr. shares packet as security and obtain another Lombard Loan for 49'000 Fr. which you use to purchase shares. 
Use the  49'000 Fr. shares packet as security and obtain another Lombard Loan for 34'300 Fr. which you use to purchase shares. 
Use the  34'300 Fr. shares packet as security and obtain another Lombard Loan for 24'000 Fr. which you use to purchase shares. 
Well, you could carry on but let's assume you stop here. 
From your original 100'000 Fr., you have now over 270'000 Fr. in shares working for you, busily earning dividends and increasing in value all for a miserable say 2 percent interest per year of the total loan. Wow. Lombard Lombard Lombard $$$.

			Hi, I tried to search in the forum but couldn't find the answer..   
In 602.101 Claim for refund AVS form it requires following document: 
Legalised, current residence certificate for your family and yourself as well as for the planned place of residence abroad for each member of your family.   
So does it mean that I have to find a lawyer in Geneva to legalise my Swiss permit card as well as my ID card from home country, or they also accept a copy?    
Considering there are 3 persons in my family, and each legalise document will cost about 150 chf, that's really a big money...150 * 6 = 900 chf..

2514	Financebankingtaxation	Accounting Course in English	Confloozed	4271	6	Location: Zurich	27.01.2013, 18:13	"    It depends are you talking about manufacturing something? Jim2007 is talking about costs, labour, inventory all in one as in the costs and the labour are used to make the inventory. Manufacturing accounting is a bit complex but you will still struggle without Dr`s and Cr`s so I would still start with book keeping and then move on to Cost accounting if you want and need it. Provided by Cost and Management accountants institutions I wouldn't do an MBA module I doubt it would be detailed enough.   
I read that you wanted to learn about costs, labour, inventory as separate issues. Like maybe a distribution business or restaurant. Which is simpler from an accounting view.

2515	Financebankingtaxation	Transfering a Pensions	Valhura	714	4	Location: Basel	30.01.2013, 20:53	"    You question is quite hard to follow: 
1. Was your existing pension saving transferred directly from one employer to another. There should be no commission or loss on this. You should be able to see the transfer in on your new statement. You should have got confirmations of the transfer out. 
2. Not 100% of your contributions go into savings. Some are for insurance components such as death or disability due to illness as well potentially as some management costs.   
Im not really sure I understand the other responses so far.  In almost all Swiss employer pension funds your savings as far as you are concerned are pretty much like cash at the bank in a fixed interest account.  Yes the fund has an investment strategy, but this is to ensure the pensions annuity and some other insurance elements can be funded for the long term.

			Your salary and husbands salary are General income. The interest, dividends, cap gains, rental, is the passive income.   
So you would effectively do this:   
                           .................................GENERAL ................ ........                          ...........PASSIVE 
TOTALS..........         HUSBAND.......     WIFE         .................HUSBAND..........          WIFE 
 243,000.........       150,000     .......80,0000...............          10,000..........         3,0000   
-11200..........             -5600 .............       -5600 (professional deductions)   
 -1000                 ..............................(interest expenses)        -500               ................-500   
etc 
etc     
All these numbers will be on your Swiss TR Seite/Page 2 and 3.   
Then you arrive at the net figures being assessed in Switzerland.   
Out of the 100% taxes accrued in the year, use the site, split it accordingly to the net numbers based on the respective % to the total.   
Paid method is what you physically pay in the year, accrued is what you have accrued in relation to that year i.e. you might pay 20,000 in withholdings, but your final bill may stipulate you owed 25,000 in total, even though the 5k balance was not paid until the following year, you accrued it in the year being assessed. You can not switch from accrued to paid. Once on accrued, you stay there. Paid is preferred in theory, but in practice, many localised here will be on the accrued method for timing reasons.   
When there are additional payments/adjustments made, in later years, technically you are supposed to amend the US return. In theory, we tend to just make adjustments to the next year to compensate/offset.

			It's feasible, but not easy, you would need to go to a freight forwarder who would take care of sending the articles back and reclaiming VAT. With the admin fee you would end up owing money quite likely !   
I would suggest that unless you are sure about the bits you order, find another way to get them. Go to Germany and bring them back yourself ?

I am not sure about the interpretation ... if you leave Switzerland, you can take the 2nd Pillar with you (after paying taxes on it), so maybe that makes it ""under your control""?  I think these 2nd Pillars are not run by the government or the employer, they are essentially private.

			Sometime back in Feb I paid for a trip for a weekend of huskie sledding with a company calling itself ""Husky Zermatt"".  I turn up at the agreed location but the guy never turned up, citing several reasons like the fact that he couldnt get the dogs on the cable car as it was too busy and then later claiming that he lost one of his dogs.  Anyway, the guy agreed to refund me the money I had paid in full, plus to pay for the hotel for the night as we were effectively stranded in the middle of nowhere.   
After multiple reminders and several months later I had still not been refunded so I started a betreibungsbegehren against the guy.  They couldnt get hold of him at the address I had for him, and the police had to become involved.  Eventually he showed up at the betreibungsamt and made an opposition of payment.  So the next step i took was to file a case with the District court of Brig to overrule his objection.   
Problem is that the district court of Brig has returned my claim saying that he is not registered at the address where he says he lives and so they cannot hear my case.  The betreibungsamt were not clever enough to get his proper address when he walked in off the street to file the opposition of payment.   
Does anyone know what I can do next?  On an aside note, if he is not registered in Switzerland and yet he is running a business, is there a way I can get him into trouble for this.  Can I for instance get him investigated on tax issues?  Basically i want to make sure he hasnt gained in any way from this sort of scam so that noone else with lose money the same way I did.  I noticed on a site that he is selling his dog trailer, so it would seem hard to imagine he can continue his business without one, so be careful before giving any money to this company ""Husky Zermatt"".

			It may have something to do with this:       
I get the feeling that the banks are using FATCA and other agreements as a way to charge some clients more money.    
What is the address on the UK account?  Is it still a UK one or did you change it to a Swiss one so the statements, etc, are sent to you here.  I don't know, but that might help to show the bank that you're not resident if the statement has a Swiss address on it.

I think this is the market value of the property plus some other factors (such as rentability etc)   
Here's a link which might explain how to calculate the valeur venale.    
I can give you the figures for our house in Belgium via PM if you like although maybe the simplest solution would be to ring the tax ofice and ask them.

2549	Financebankingtaxation	Comparis now charging?	Ace1	1352	9	Location: Engelberg & near Basel	16.01.2013, 18:47	"    I disagree, a mortgage offer is personal to your particular circumstances e.g. location of property, value, personal earnings etc.. And so what Comparis does is collate all that information and fire it off into a   where providers can bid for your business based on the information presented. Some will surely come up with preferential rates, over and above what they advertise. Sure UBS lowered their rate (2.7 -> 2.3%), but only when I threatened to walk to Basler Kantonalbank if their didn't.. waving my offer from BKB under their noses.   
Just to re-iterate, this is not like price comparison (passive), its an active process which takes a few days and where Comparis will step in at different stages to make sure things go smoothly. And the most important thing is that it saves time, you may be able to achieve comparable results by walking into 10 national banks and having a chat, but some don't have the time to go to Bern, Geneva, Zurich, Solothurn etc.. to do that.

2550	Financebankingtaxation	BCGE to BCV Customer - HELP	guest	2070	3	null	null	"    BCGE and BCV, along with all other Cantonal Banks, are not the same entities, although they are organized and regulated by the Association of Swiss Cantonal Banks (Verband Schweizerischer Kantonalbanken / Union des Banques Cantonales Suisses).    
Each Cantonal Bank has a different ownership structure and many (particularly the two biggest ones like ZKB and BCV) engage in more sophisticated banking solutions.    
BCV, for example, is a publicly traded entity in the Swiss Stock Exchange with approximately 2/3rd of the shares owned by Canton de Vaud. Under its charter, the Canton de Vaud bears no legal responsibility to back a single centime under deposit (although there is a Federal Depositor Protection Scheme under the Swiss Banking Act which ensures ALL banks in Switzerland must chip in to guarantee up to 100'000 CHF per depositor in any Swiss bank going belly up).   
ZKB, on the other hand, is 100% owned by Kanton Zürich, and all liabilities are fully backed by the Kanton. Whether this makes ZKB ""safer"" or not is hard to tell as it can create an incentive for more ""risk-taking"" in the bank itself. One can expect that if ZKB ever needs a bail-out, it would be at a time when the economy in Zürich would be toast and the biggest tax payers in the Kanton (Credit Suisse and UBS) would themselves be under serious distress. Where would the Kanton raise money to bailout ZKB? Higher taxes (i.e. the depositors). In other words, there really isn't such a thing as an unlimited Cantonal Guarantee since the depositors would have to bail out ZKB in one way or another.

			A broader issue is that the US IRS will begin collecting non-US bank account data under a new law called FATCA. The IRS has NOT issued any data security guidelines regarding FATCA and many of us fear that this sensitive bank account data on Americans abroad may end up in the hands of terrorists, extortionists and/or kidnappers. An editorial writer in Lebanon wrote an article called ""FATCA's Security Problem"" in December 2012. Here's an excerpt:   
""However, there is one aspect of FATCA that has not been sufficiently  examined, but that remains potentially hazardous. The American  government is effectively asking foreign institutions to prepare  detailed data bases of American citizens, with no guidelines explaining  how this information must be protected. For a country obsessed with the  security of its citizens in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, such  behavior is paradoxical, indeed astonishing.   
Foreign financial  institutions will effectively become vast repositories of information on  Americansincluding what they earn, the sources of their income, what  they spend, where they live, who their family members are, and so on. In  their zeal to implicitly label Americans living abroad as tax cheats  requiring monitoring, the sponsors of FATCA have shown utter  indifference to the safety of their citizens.   
In some countries,  the American authorities are well aware that their enemies have ready  access to financial institutions. The Lebanese Canadian Bank scandal, in  which bank managers were accused of helping Hezbollah launder money,  showed that this was true in Lebanon. What is to prevent anti-American  groups elsewhere from gaining access to data on American citizens, and  possibly using this to their advantage? FATCA helps make it eminently  possible.   
Strangely, we have heard nothing about FATCA from the  State Department, which is responsible for Americans overseas. At a time  when American embassies regularly issue advisories to citizens to  guarantee their safety, we are seeing the IRS asking institutions abroad  to gather the most sensitive facts on Americans, with no oversight. The  irresponsibility is breathtaking. Worse, because FATCA imposes pariah  status on Americans abroad, whatever rightful protest they have against  the legislation will sound suspicious.""

How interesting.... Looks easy to sort out thank goodness. If you own property in a different canton to where you work then everything goes though the canton where you work.  Of course... The other canton did not tell us to stop paying them the tax though.    
Apparently you can photocopy the tax forms and just send the copies to the gemeinde where your property is.   
If you own a property in CH and are on B permits you can file a tax return like on a C permit or earning over 120,000 chf per year.    "	Posts: 41	Join Date: Jan 2011	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 17 Times in 13 Posts	made some interesting contributions

I tried to find my pension myself with my ahv number with no luck. I will be 62 in March and if I'm entitled to a swiss pension is that age too early? I already receive a uk pension.

Unless you have to do a tax return (see other posts, generally if you more than 120k) you should be asking your HR dept to calculate the correct amount and credit you with the difference on your next payslip. It's their legal obligation to deduct the right amount and pass it to the authorities.

Just a quick question, I'm struggling to find any information online.   
If I move to Zurich, open a bank account and after 2 years (for example) I want to move back to the UK, where do I stand with transferring the money I've earned/saved to my UK account. Will I be taxed in the UK on my savings or is it ok because it's been earned whilst I've been living in CH over two full tax years?!   
I'm a contractor and the agency organise all my swiss taxes etc prior to paying me.   
Hope you can help!

			hi,   
what is the general tax + insurance + pension reduction if i work in zurich? is it worth moving there from london? i heard its different depending on Kantons, with Zug being the lowest, how much will it cost to rent a 1 bedroom apartment in Zug?   
i got an internship for credit suisse in london and if i get a graduate offer, im thinking of negotiating with HR to start my career in zurich (i used to live here in 2010). Because im holding an Asian passport, my friends told me working in Zurich (he lives in Aarau and only pay 22%ish including insurance) can save up a big sum on tax compare to London (can be up to 40-45%) not to mention the rent in central london is insanely higher than switzerland. i've no insider information on whats the pay, but after glassdoor googling, its somewhere around 50+ k pound vs 90-100k chf a year (i assume before tax).   
thanks!

This also applies in case of provisionally or permanently falling below the CHF 120 000 limit in the years following the event.

Document    
Note: when married, the taxpayer is the Husband, and both parties become one taxpayer with one taxable income.

2586	Financebankingtaxation	Bank transfer takes horribly long - consequences?	dougie	934	5	Location: BE	01.01.2013, 11:24	"    Yes. The transfer is normally executed the same the same day, but since nobody is normally working the 24,25,26, 31,1 and 2, there are only two working days until the 3rd January, so processing is slower than normal.

Found a lot of links to tax accountants, but don't need any tax return help at this point.

			If you have standard online banking that is provided by most major banks here, you can do it yourself for a fee of about 5 CHF. You just need the bank name and IBAN number. Takes about 5 minutes.

2589	Financebankingtaxation	Tax question about office deduction	guest	765	4	null	null	" 
			
			Just spoke to my accountant   
She told me that they accepted it in 2010 for nov and dec (when i moved into the more expensive flat) so they will need to have good reasons not to accept it now   
I am not living there anymore so will be easy to prove that i needed it only as an office as i have pictures of the room from when i advertised my flat   
They really were just trying to find ways to charge me the extra tax, simple as that. My accountant has already found little things which i can appeal so will get onto it after the new year   
Thanks for your advice people

2597	Financebankingtaxation	US tax on Swiss pension savings?	Goldtop	12164	17	Location: Zurich	07.05.2009, 09:39	" 
			
			I am no tax accountant or specialist but have researched this quite a bit over the last week...on if one should report Pillar 2 pension contributions on your US taxes as ""earned income"".     
Summary, you ask 5 tax accountants or advisers you get 5 different answers on if yes or how.     
Basically, the tax treaty with Switzerland is pretty vague on the topic.  I have met US colleagues that have not included the pension as income & have filed w/o issues.  However, it appears if one leaves Switzerland and requests for their pension funds to be released then a tax official from your home country must sign / stamp that they have been informed...so I'm not sure what would happen then if you had not reported it as income.  Therefore, my conclusion is if you can fit it in under earned income with no additional tax burden (via foreign tax exemptions / deductions) then you should.   
Here's part of the text the IRS sent me when I enquired:

			Please stop bickering and looking for a way around having your name on a bad-boy list.  If I am not mistaken, the records will show you had a Betreibung but is was paid in full.   
Pay the bill.  Get confirmation it is paid.  Then politely ask the Betreibungsamt about your status.  If it is still indicated, politely ask for it to be removed.  If it isn't removed then mark it off to experience and a dumb decision... and get on with your life.  It is not the end of the world.   
Intrum Justitia... that is a story by itself.  They cash in on 35-50% of the collected sum, and then some.  If anybody wants an insight on IJ, please ask in a PM.

2603	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss-GB Tax Agreement Bank Charges	AnyOleJoe	8416	86	Location: UK	24.11.2012, 21:06	"    I read in a number of articles that these Swiss agreements may have unearthed from intel from caught high net worth tax dodgers /embezzlers giving up the names of others to reduce their severity of prosecution. Once the whistle is blown I guess it's inevitable to cascade.   
I read while this is aimed at targeting the high net worth stashers, I guess even the genuine who may have a Swiss account from previously working in Switzerland face giving up their annonimity at the very least which is unlucky. However it also stated somewhere that the 21-34% one off charge, is what HRMC are trying to recover as if it were taxed from the beginning and that after the one off payment, if the assets were not from proceeds of criminal activity, the assets would be tax ""regularised"" and the account holder issued a certificate to prove this.    
Surely for this group of people it is a way to make their undisclosed assets tax compliant AND retain annonimity. Which is a little unfair i guess to many like the OP.

Now if I spend 10k in December I can either use the credit card and deduct 10k of debt or I can just spend the cash. Either way I'll end up with net assets of 190k at the end of the year. Doesn't make a difference.

They'll know you're not resident when you filled in your P85 form and sent it to HMRC saying you have permanent employment abroad. However, if you did have permanent employment here in Switzerland you'd have a B permit.

I am also a Migros customer, so am strongly considering getting a Cumulus CC now as the points in that add up quite fast too... I am able to collect 500 Cumulus points quite easily every quarter, which means CHF5.- x 4 coupons every year... that too on a free credit card... not a bad deal at all... however I am already in the 2nd year of my PostFinance card, so I'll wait till it is over and cancel it before I get the Migros card...

			Hi 
If your turnover/income is 4000.-- or below in a year, you do not need to file as self employed. Simply file your income in the tax statement. Turnovers below around CHF 6000.-- have a minimum contribution of around CHF 400.-- a year (AHV). Tax authorities in Zurich are informing AHV if your income surpasses 4000.- as self employed, then all the paperwork will be sent automatically.   
Also, a filing as self employed at the commercial register is only required as from turnovers of above CHF 100'000.-

Normally, refunds at the border or via such groups as Global Blue.  I would not accept somebody showing up with an Ausfuhrschein.  Too risky for me

			Under the framework, Swiss banks would report directly to the IRS on any U.S. owned accountif the account owner consents. (Even that is technically a criminal violation of Swiss bank secrecy laws, but the Swiss authorizes have agreed to grant an exception.) If a  a U.S. account owner doesnt consent to such reporting, the information will eventually be handed over anyway, after a process described by a  Treasury official during a background briefing for reporters. According to the official, the Swiss bank would give the IRS a summary of the number of accounts and total value of accounts owned by recalcitrant U.S. citizens who  refused to permit their information to be sent directly to the IRS.  The U.S. government would then formally ask the Swiss government to collect and turn over information about the account holders on the list, under the terms of  a separate agreement covering the exchange of tax information.

			You can check the tax rates for the various communes (including Zurich city) here:     
For Zurich city the rate is 119%, for Zumikon (and some other communes) the rate is 76%... did you tell your accountant exactly where you live in Zurich?    
Just going by the postcode won't help you since it is the actual boundary of the commune which decides where you are taxed. In extreme cases the houses on one half of the street might belong to a different (lower-taxed) commune than those in the second half of the street...

			I have read all the threads re debt but none of them seem to cover my problem.  I am owed a large amount by a national health insurance company, who have only reimbursed me approximately two thirds of what they owe.  As a UK pensioner, who retired here, with neither income nor pensions from CH, the UK via KVG, pays my health costs under a bilateral agreement.  In ignorance, when I arrived I took out health insurance here and it was some time before I learnt of this. The UK has now repaid this company in full for all the costs I have incurred.  In return the company is obliged to refund me all the premiums I have paid.  This they have only done in part.  I propose contacting the Ombudsman, Krankenversicherung in Luzern followed by l'Office des Poursuites but any other suggestions as to how to proceed would be most welcome.

			This sounds fishy to me. Some guy comes to your house, he's not from the company you owe money to or the Betreibung and yet he wants you to pay? How the heck does he know you owe money when you don't?    
Good for you if you didn't pay, and take a careful look at the bill once he mails it to you. You first need to know what company filed the Betreibung before you can figure out if it is legit. In fact maybe you can contact the local office and get it straight from them what the outstanding bill is.   
Good luck!

2639	Financebankingtaxation	Why is the tax system so complicated !?!	Justlanded	2797	28	Location: Geneva	28.11.2012, 23:46	"    Why does it sound strange?  
What you have above is your net annual salary. assuming the CHF13,000.- in deductions is correct and that you apply the correct tax rate then you should have the correct Netto.   
I am not entirely sure if all social, pension and insurances are deducted before the tax rate is applied but I can probably check once I get home. But the pension and AHV are defo deducted before the tax is applied as the pension is taxed seperately when you reach retirement age so they can't tax it twice.   
There was a nice calculator from   which used to give a good breakdown but it no longer works and keeps asking for a password. Grrr   
The only variable in all of these calculations is the tax rate, which can easily be deducted from your gross salary. So as a rough guide I would say:   
Net salary = (Gross x 0.9 ) x (1 - tax rate)    
Here I am assuming 10% deduction for pension, AHV and insurances.   
Based on (tax at source rates in Geneva you provided  ), your marginal tax rate 17.28%, so my rough estimate would be:   
Net salary = CHF9,000.- x 0.9 x (1 - 0.1728)    "	Posts: 14	Join Date: Nov 2012	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

Example 1:   
I purchase goods from the UK for approximately 280 pounds(362 fr) inclusive of postage. I know the courier will send it to me simply because i ordered shoes and they always ""upgrade"" me to that service. therefore my other charges would be :   
1. The customs charge of 35fr.   
2. 7.6% Vat = (0.076)(362)=28fr   
3.Any other Charge?

			I have noticed how close people stand to you when you are paying for something, particularly with an ATM card. It is really annoying. Once I asked the guy next in line who was practically standing on my feet if he wanted to pay for my groceries.    
But that being said, at the SBB machine where there is a queue, it is best to cover the code machine so that only you can see it. Also, with everyone always in such a big hurry it is easy when rushing to forget something. Take a second to check that you have everything with you. Don't take your card of your wallet and put your wallet back in an open bag when using the machine.

			You will pay tax as a CH employee, & be liable in full for UK taxes. Any tax paid in CH will be credited against your uk liability. Getting out of paying UK tax is quite difficult unless you have a full time contract of employment & leave permanently which means for at least a full tax  UK tax year.   
In zh there are only 2 days a year cou can give notice a year, so you could be on the hook for almost 9 months rent here. Getting a flat will not be easy either, I would let the employer find & pay for your accommodation , possibly in a hotel.   
If you have a British (EU) passport you will be able to stay & possibly be entitled to unemployment pay, if you have been working as an employee in the UK before coming to CH.

			I believe that Credit Suisse no longer does this. They did it for me once, and it took several weeks. I signed the form in the presence of my CS adviser, he sent it to CS Boston with his testament as to who I was, they sent it back with the guarantee finally. I was then told that it could not be done again in the future. Wouldn't hurt to ask though.   
Last year, I went through an extensive interview by phone with Vanguard, my custodian, and they did not require a guarantee. They asked questions about things which I had no idea that they knew.

			I`m an accountant (Australian qualified) but I am NOT a tax expert. I lived in the US and was in the opposite position of your friend. I was working from home in Switzerland for my job in NY when we first moved here.   
If your friend is on assignment for a month or two I suspect she will be ok (not required to file US returns) but if she is there for year + then I assume she would have to be liable for US and New Mexico tax. But if she is there long term then I don`t know why they wouldn't pay her out of the US (unless they don`t have a payroll there which is why I continued to be paid out of the US while working here).   
If I was your friend my first stop would be to her HR, maybe they have some experience with others in similar positions.

You do not see it directly, only as described above. It is deducted from the taxable income. You should see it if you compare it to the original taxable income in your income statement. But if they ask you to do the full tax thing, then you would have had to do it anyway I assume, otherwise the simple refund form would have been sufficient. They will probably remind you to do the tax declaration next year too   (with or without the Säule 3a).

In Pillar 2 you need to replace withdrawals for property purchase in certain circumstances, and any withdrawals for purchases, divorce etc will be shown on your yearly statement.    
So Pillar 2 allows you to recover withdrawn funds in later years particularly if you sell the property.   
Pillar 3 does not. If I withdraw I can't replace it later as its a non cumulative yearly limit, that I can't recover or restore later.   
Therefore as the tax break is more restrictive, it's more attractive to the lender and the reason many now prefer Pillar 3 pledges to Pillar 2.   
Basically if they can avoid future Pillar 2 re-adjustments later they will. In addition Pillar 2 pledges are much more difficult to enforce through the courts, as the court is left with the paradox that if they bankrupt my pension, the state may have to support me more in retirement.   
Finally with prices twice what they were some years ago, the risk profile has changed for these deals for the banks, and they see what has happened in other bubble markets like Ireland, Spain etc.

5'510*1.038^34+5'510*1.038^33+....+5'510*1.038^1+5  '510*1.038^0 = around 390k, which is equal to the ""capital formation 397,243"". Just they divide the gain into two items ""interest and compound interest"" and ""capital gain"".   
Then they charge 23'431 CHF to the 3P, I think it correspond to the tax to be paid when the 3P is withdrawn at once. They assume it because they are comparing to an alternative investment. The motivation of investment is not directly for putting money aside until retirement, but for gaining money and having access to that money. If the 3P will not be ""cashed in"", this 23'431 should be added back to the 3P return, the result of which is still less than the alternative investment. In this sense this 23'431 is not very fair for 3P because it assumes that 3P will be cashed in. But the comparison can never be fair in this case. Assuming that with an alternative investment you will be forced to keep all the money till the very end (which you actually have access whenever you want) is at least as unfair as assuming you will be forced to cash in you 3P (which you actually can keep until the end). The two ways are just very different in terms of flexibility and availability.

			You definitely need to check your contract to see if it permits you to undertake outside work.  Some companies will not be happy if  you're doing work for someone else that's almost identical to what you do for them.  Most are quite happy if it's a completely different area, for example you work in the pharmacutical industry, but also paint landscapes for sale.  Check the contract and also let your main employer know.

			Dear jttraveller,    
Life would have been much simple would it have been the process. It takes long time and plus if you are expats working in ch and you want to claim other expenses there are many forms and supporting docs which you will need to submit.   
Some canton have online apps but not sure if your canton have one.    
Atleast I had to follow this process and got some tax back.   
But at last it depends on Canton as every canton have their own TAX dept.

Yes, I have no Forfait fiscal/Pauschalbesteuerung.   
Ah right so while the income from any property will not, my rates could change and I pay more tax anyway?   
Okay, seems fair enough. The amount I expect to get per year is around £5,000... in the grand scheme of things that is not very much although I don't want to be taxed to death obviously    
In my opinion it is easier to manage things if it is in a shell company that and if things go to hell, limited liability is always a good thing    
I think I will see a tax advisor and discuss this in greater detail, I was just hoping that I could work it out from online research so I can save a bit of money short term

			First you ask for advice now when the advice arrives you decide that because you received advice at work that suits you better financially that the answers on here should just be ignored. The wealth tax yes it exists but on the bank account balances I suspect you have it is likely to be so low (approximately 0.3% - 0.5%) that its hard to understand why your want to not declare and remove the risk you get discovered in future   
Your colleagues are simply using the approach that the swiss tax authorities dont care or are too silly to realise that someone who is a recently arrived person from another country will not have any bank accounts there. Heh yes I arrived last year but heh I have absolutely no bank accounts left where I came from!

2678	Financebankingtaxation	Using Pension Money for Real Estate - Rollover	JamesAG	1010	4	Location: Schliengen, Germany	15.11.2012, 12:02	"    I know that it is possible, as I took a second withdrawal from my PK last year to help pay for the new house.    
However, I'm trying to avoid having to go through the formal depost / withdrawl process, as this will cost me a lot of money - I would have to pay taxes on the money again (I paid the 3% tax when I withdrew it the first time, and I would now be liable for 35% German income tax, because I will be registered in Germany at the time of this transaction).    
The reason I've asked here is that I am getting conflicting / confusing answers from the so-called experts. UBS (the bank where I have the mortgages) isn't able to give me a clear answer, the notary claims that I don't need a trust account (Zahl- und Treuhandstelle), and the Basel Kantonalbank (where the rest of my PK money has been deposited) hasn't yet gotten back to me. I was hoping that someone could provide some experience or tips...

			Hi,   
I am about to arrive in Switzerland and have been using Comparis to get a rough guide to what tax I will pay. I will be moving soon but my wife and kids will stay in the UK for the first year or two. The Compares tax calculator asks if I am married, which I am, and then about my kids. As my kids are non-resident, do I put them in here or not ? It seems to make a huge difference to the calculations.   
Thanks

			First and foremost: No panic! I'm sure that you will be fine. There is no bad scenario here. French tax offices just want folk to fill in their tax forms properly and pay them the correct tax. They are not nasty.   
Second: There is no rush. The tax year is not the calendar year. So I suggest you go and see them when you have time.   
Third: As I said, you have already paid tax on your salary in Switzerland. It cannot be taxed again in France, due to the bilateral agreement. So there is nothing else to tax, unless you have shares or some other source of unearned income. Even then, there are allowances before the income becomes taxable.   
So, good luck and don't worry  .

They're expensive to buy and I typically only read the reports on a few stocks that I own, so it's not really worth it to buy the whole thing.  If I could find a place to read them for free, like a local or business library, that would be great!

I'm not sure if there actually is a way to get the money back should you need it, but if you have the money and don't plan to do or buy anything big with it, it's a rather good investment IMO.

			I know this post is an old one, but i just some research regarding this, so thought ill post incase someone else has the same question !   
The post will always delay the execution of your payment for two days, it might  be mentioned in your online banking already but the money is not really available until two days later. During those two days postfinance stores the money in one of there own accounts (a VERY big pot) and earn a nice amount of interest on it. (last year alone they made 17million on these delays)   
But from bank to bank if you make a transfer before lunch time it should definitely be done the same day !   
in regards to 2funkys question, if you do it by the machine you cant withdraw or transfer more then your limit (5000 CHF) but if you go into the bank and show your ID you should be able to take out as much as you want or I guess have..

			It could be a long shot.  I suspect with an online retailer they wont do DutyFreeTax forms like the highstreet retailers, but they may do the direct VAT Retail Export Scheme HMRC forms, you will have to ask them.   
My tailor does this and it is great because you get the full 20% back without the exhorbitant charges the retailer and DutyFree take.   
If you can find a retailer that will support one of these, when you leave the country with the goods get Customs to stamp the form and return it to the retailer who credits you the VAT back.  In practise at City Airport this is a ""postbox"" and you leave an SAE to the retailer.  At LHR it may be an officer, or a ""postbox"" system.

			Also, you can only file married filing separately or jointly if your spouse has a US SS number, otherwise ""head of household"" with NRA spouse is the only option.   
Actually, looking through some old returns, I see that originally I was filing as married, filing separately for some years before switching to ""head of household"", so if you don't meet the requirements for ""head of household"" (such as no kids), then filing separately is the one.  Also, I see that while it asks for name and SS of spouse, I only entered name as she had no SS.

			Hi All   
Does anyone have experience with banking/trading stock/mutual funds in Singapore?   
Any preferred bank? DBS Vicker? Standard Chartered?   
My investment is usually very very passive, focusing mostly on index funds and few US/UK stocks.   
any advice?   
thanks!

			As you are disputing the bill, you should visit your Office des Poursuites and ask them for advice,      
When you receive a summons from the Office des Poursuites, you must object in writing within a short time, 7 days(?) otherwise you will be admitting the full debt.    
As others have said, do you have a contract? If not, do you have a witness? Consumer protection is very weak in Switzerland.

			Having had advice from various people on this forum, I decided to try the wechselstube service and have been using it for a while   
Now it appears they are abruptly closing accounts without warning due to Swiss regulations, this is the message I got after sending a routine payment:   
""Unfortunately new regulations in the money transfer business have such a  great impact on our daily operational service, which in consequence has  led to the closing of client log-ins of private individuals. Therefore  we did close your log-in after the transfer of the money.   
Best regards Martin Streb      
kmuOnline ag      Tel. 061 406 97 97""   
Anyone about to waste time filling out forms or spend 25 CHF having their ID notarized - don't bother.            
Also, I can no longer log in and check any of my payment history.  There was no warning of this change or anything, which leaves me feeling they are really quite a bunch of amateurs and not to be trusted.   
Given that wechselstube is mentioned in so many places on this site, is there any way for the site admins to put a red flag against them?  I'm happy to forward a copy of the full email to the people in charge.

			It may depend what canton you live in. For Valais, I looked into this before:     
(in french, page 22)   
As I understand it you can deduct public transport costs.    
Or, if it is necessary to use a car due to distance from public transport, you need your car or you work irregular hours, then you are allowed to claim mileage allowance for travel to and from work.

			Hey everyone,   
I have a specific question regarding paying a pension (for a kid) and the tax implications.   
So the story is that we are getting a kid soon   We are a not married and both working. We do live together and are not separated, I'm trying to do some tax optimisation: I wanted to know if you think it is acceptable to pay a pension to the mother of the child even though we live together?   
This would allow me to deduct that pension from my salary which is much higher than hers.   
If acceptable, do you know if we need to provide a proof other than bank transfer receipts to the tax authorities? Do we need to show some kind of contract or court order or are tacit agreements acceptable in this regard?   
Thanks in advance for your help, most online documentation on the subject relates to divorce. Today when signing the paper to declare that I am the biological father at the town-hall it mentioned that the mother has the right to ask for a pension... which gave me this idea.

			The withdrawals are worldwide free with both the EUR and CHF cards. 
Naturally exchange rates and fees still apply. 
One benefit is that it costs 2 CHF to send cash online when not in EUR in the EEA. But receiving in GBP\USD is free with plus if in the same currency.   
For ex, my UK bank charges me £10 to send Gbp to my PoFi GBP account, PoFI only 2 CHF in the other direction.

2735	Financebankingtaxation	International weekender status and final tax return	disht	539	0	Location: Pfaffikon SZ	19.10.2012, 11:33	" 
			
			I managed to get international weekender status for 2010. I received my final tax return from canton Zurich (Staats- und Gemeindesteuern).   
This paper says my income was 0, my property was 0 and my tax is 0. It also does not say anything about the source tax and withholding tax that was payed by me in 2010 so they claim they owe me nothing.   
Relecant info: I am taxed at source and I earn more than 120000 CHF per year so I have to file a tax return.   
Is the above tax calculation by the authorities ok? How am I supposed to get the tax at source back? Anyone who has done this before and can share their experience?   
Thanks in advance.

The exact way you pay differs from canton to canton (for example, in canton NE it's monthly invoices whereas in ZG you can opt to pay either all in one go or in two instalments).

			Many thanks indeed to all who've replied so far, and Zuger, I'd be happy to meet up sometime when we've finally made it there... we'll be in the Alicante area.   
Regarding the pros and cons of registering for the NIE number and keeping below the radar, this would be permanent move for us... we rent here in Switzerland and would certainly rent in Spain, to begin with at least, until we decide whether and where to buy. Other than the job itself, we'd have no residency claim to Switzerland so we would definitely be liable for Spanish tax.    
To be honest, whilst I'm sure there are loads of loopholes that can be exploited, I'll leave it to the accountants to establish what can be done legally to reduce the tax burden. Obviously I don't want to pay any more tax than is necessary, but we'll have 2 kids in the Spanish education system, be using the national health service, etc, and I have no problem financially or idealistically with paying for it.

			Unfortunately the banks can do whatever they want in this situation to U.S. clients, depending on their level of tolerance for added bureaucracy from across the pond.  These forms to be filled out by tax preparers are simply CYA measures for the banks, as I understand them, to shift liability in case something goes awry.  As others said, if you don't want to fill out the form, or deal with the hassle, don't--but your account will likely be closed as the banks don't want to attract *more* attention from foreign tax investigators.  Retail banking while living in Switzerland is still largely available at a number of banks, though some have added paperwork to the process. (and some just say no.)  Once you leave Switzerland, unless you are a whale to qualify for private banking, your account will be closed.  Of course, any one with more info please correct me...

Fees wise they are the same more or less. I will point out that with Credit Suisse I can get another card free for my wife so that I can keep an eye on her spending . Maybe UBS provide a similar service too.

			What's the limit of contribution for people receiving unemployment benefits? Is it same as that of people under employment with second pillar or same as that of self-employed people, who doesn't contribute in second pillar.   
People receiving unemployment benefits don't contribute in second pillar, does it mean that they can contribute more like self employed people??

2761	Financebankingtaxation	Quellensteur tax declaration	guest	1300	3	null	null	" 
			
			To get the tax forms, your income is probably over 120K. The adjustment between the Quellensteur varies depending on where you live. In Zurich the Quellensteuer is lower than the local tax percentages, so there's usually tax owing if you don't find lots of deductions. Even at 120K exactly (my husband earnt 500chf over one year  ) the adjustment was about 5000chf! That was in the city of zurich. I think for most areas it's the opposite - you could in fact get a reduction in your tax with the return and get a refund...   
I would definitely recommend you find a tax advisor to do your taxes. If you prepare all the information clearly, they should not charge much. They should be able to tell you up-front what their normal fee is. We've been paying 150-200chf for an agent to do our returns...for two income earners (you are taxed together as a 'household' so the returns are all included together in the same documents).   
Hope that helps... it's a bit complicated with the variation between town to town, depending on whether the employer has deducted the Quellensteuer properly in the first place, and what other tax deductions you have. Our tax agent did provide an estimate on how much tax was owing, but it was quite a bit higher than the actual.   
We also found it extremely easy to ask for a payment plan for the back-taxes. The bill came for around 3500chf and we asked for it to be split into three payments...no problem...two days later we got the pay-in-slips separated into three payments, with the due dates on them...

The smaller banks will negotiate on properties postcode by postcode. Being a foreigner, not understanding the subtleties of the local market, that expertise means a lot. You can still put down 20% or more, and get a better rate, but at least you know they were willing to lend more. Better to have the safety margins in case you are ill for a while, loose a job, etc.

2770	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss income or US income?	LearningAlways	792	0	Location: near Lausanne	03.10.2012, 12:46	" 
			
			Hi,   
I'm a US citizen, resident in Switzerland on a B permit thanks to my husband's job. I work independently for Swiss clients and get paid here in CHFs. I am also currently doing some work remotely for a friend in the US. She says that she needs to file a W-2 with the IRS for me if she pays me more than $600, which she most likely will.   
I think I'd prefer to have this income from working remotely considered as Swiss income - from the threads I've read here the Swiss will think I should declare it here - but I don't want to have to pay both AVS/Social Security, and I don't want this income to interfere with us getting the Foreign Earned Income exemption.   
Has anyone else dealt with this situation, and what did you learn? Should I just cap my remote income at $599 and then declare it here? Does it make a difference where the remote income first gets deposited in a bank?   
Thanks!

			If you rarely travel by air this pretty much kills both the insurance and the lounge benefits. BTW I'm not sure that the lounge benefit is completely free and unlimited - the documentation seems a little fuzzy to me. I have the feeling that you can only use it perhaps a couple of times a year and then you have to pay more.   
The concierge service means basically that you can have someone book restaurants and shows for you - if you have plenty of money and are short on time this can be valuable (provided that the service is good). If you find yourself bargain-hunting tickets or if you're not going out much then you won't really use it.   
Unless you spend at least 20k CHF a year using credit cards it doesn't sound like the deal for you!

She told me that She and her husband were both audited when they went back to the USA..... And they work for the IRS...!    
But she did say they focus on people who have physical assets in the US (incase something needs to be confiscated) and incomes of over $150k per year.    
I think the IRS can only ask you for 3 year of previous tax receipts, so 2005 should be no worries what so ever imho.

I don`t think you have to but it could stop an audit as most salary only tax returns without a lot of deductions are pretty much an open and shut case. The only thing they could be looking for on audit is hidden assets.   
The IRS are not going to start an international audit if they think the most they can get is a few grand. Just not worth it.

The way you seem to describe it you earn and spend in CHF and have savings. If you're planning to go back to the US the only negative about the USD getting even weaker would be the ""increase"" in your salary for the tax returns.   
Send all your money back to the US, the exchange rates historically good. All your savings, investments would then be in the currency you plan to live in eventually. No exchange exposure at all.

This all sound a bit jumbled up.  I am assuming we are talking about defined contributions here (not the rare Swiss animal defined benefit/final salary scheme).   
Legal minimum contributions to the second pillar are based on age category and are to be shared as a minimum equally between employer and employee.  The employer can chose to contribute more and/or make both the employee and employer contribute more.   
These contributions are based on your actual salary payments.  Your ability as an employee to make extra contributions will exists because your lifetime maximum contributions are based on your current salary and age related contribution %.  You might also be allowed to buy early retirement contributions.   
Some of the contributions (say 1.5% of salary) go for insurance components (eg widows pension, death in service) and administration.  The rest is your saving pot (guthaben/avoir veillesse) which is portable between employers (or into a free-movement blocked account freizugigkeits konto if you do not go directly back into employment).  The savings amount grows each year with tax free interest, again there is a legal minimum rate and the employer can pay more too.   
When you go to a  new employer you just carry on saving each month. If that employer has higher contribution rates you will save more, if less you will save less (even if you were already maxed out on extra contributions).   
When you retire you can take a mixture of lump sum or pension.  If you take a pension it is the last employer's pension fund that will determine the annuity rate you get from your saving pot (with a legal minimum rate).  If you take a lump sum you are taxed depending on your canton of residence if you still live in CH.   
The pension fund manages the pensions savings of all the past and present members to be able to i) cover costs ii) pay annual interest on current members iii) be able to fund the transfers out and pensions until the last member dies (eventually). If there is a deficit of assets vs actuarial liabilities they may need to take measures to restore positive funding such as reduced interest, higher funding etc.   
Thats a quick overview, hopefully helpful.

Can anyone point me to further details of this. I have submitted tax returns in Vaud and can see no mention of how to include this in tax returns etc.   
Follow up question: also, anyone know how dividends from foreign companies taxed? Is it just a %age of the dividend, is there a credit for the foreign tax (if any)...

2794	Financebankingtaxation	B permit, taxed at source and additional foreign employement	GP85	616	0	Location: Germany	24.09.2012, 13:26	" 
			
			Hi everyone, I've been looking for an answer on the forum with no success so I thought starting a new thread. Here is my current situation:   
EU national on a B permit expiring in 2015, working as an employee and taxed at source. So far, so good.   
I have now been offered the possibility to get an additional job from a foreign (EU) company. The company I'm actually working for is aware of this and for them it would actually be fine if I would take the offer since the activities required by the foreign company would be carried on evenings and weekends.   
Being taxed at source I currently don't have to hand in any tax statement at the end of the year, what would be the implications in case I decide to get this second job? My guess would be that I would have to pay social costs on that salary which would then be added to my total income and taxed accordingly, the reason why I'm asking opinions is that I've been told that when taxed at source you're not liable to declare other incomes.   
Of course I will speak with a professional in case I decide to take the offer (any suggestion for a reasonably priced english speaker in Geneva area appreciated) but for the moment I thought I could take advantage of some advice here on the forum    
So many thanks to everyone who will take his time to provide me with his experience/information on this topic.

			As everyone says use the hole in the wall but I don't think you can get 2000 in one go. You could of course take your card inside and get the currency over the counter. In either case expect a to pay about 2% commission (difference between official exchange rate and tourist rate).

It is common in North America to setup a corporate entity to trade in the markets - is this done here at all? Has anyone setup a corporate-type trading account with Swissquote etc.?   
If so, are there any other benefits besides the usual legal protection and potential deductions? Also, which canton would be good and do you need to be a resident of this canton?   
Thank you.

2812	Financebankingtaxation	anyone interested in a discussion about Switzerland's economic prospects?	hankag	2509	39	Location: uk	13.09.2012, 14:31	"    Staying calm to confront conflict is a good strategy, yes, at least as a first approach (in some situations an individual must evaluate if the aggression has gone too far, you may concede).   
But I am not so sure that the root of conflict foreign - local is only the primitive group bonding thing. In my perception 'The Swiss' are rational, well travelled, reasonable people (except for some, as usual), and when I have seen 'The Reasonable Swiss' complain on immigration they always mention the economic disadvantage topic, that their sons can no longer live in the city due to housing prices, etc etc.    
In my opinion a minority is 'primitive' and hate for the shake of it, a majority is simply worried about the economic prospect for their children. This is why I don t get why their children can not have same opportunities to get a good education.

2821	Financebankingtaxation	deregistering from church/religious tax	farfallina	8291	51	Location: Zurich	07.08.2012, 16:56	"    Yes, we've had this discussion before I think. But it is wrong, in so many ways. The Church here is really struggling to cover their costs, in fact are getting further and further into the red. They have to cut staff, services to the community, the elderly, the infirm, etc- and have had to sell a large amount of their properties. Would you expect to go and play golf at a Club where you refuse to pay for membership? I have discussed this with some of the Vicars in my area - and they just don't know what to do- as they are getting further and further into debt.   
 Of course they want to do the Christian thing - but they still have to be paid and house, feed their families, pay for the minibus to take the handicapped and the elderly around, etc. How can they run a Church in a Christian manner for not money at all. And those good Christians who DO pay, however kind and open-minded, are getting a bit cheesed off with all those who say 'NO' on the tax sheet- but expect all the services to continue to be provided. 
It's wrong in so many ways. I am NOT religious, and I don't pay my Church taxes - but I do support what they do for the community in other ways, and they respect that. Difficult to respect those who refuse to pay .. and then ask for support when they need it. Costs are enormous.

			I guess the answer to my question is just NO, there is no bank in Switzerland that competes with the Interest I could get in the UK or the rest of Europe,    
Thanks for your replies, as of trading I have done that before but to busy to be on top of it at the moment and the only time I trusted a broker I lost allot of money.   
NOW, this might be a little complicated, I found that UBS will give me 1.25% interest on a certain account up to 20k, now lets say for arguments sake, that if I had 60k I would hardly make any money at the end of the year since I only get 1.25% on 20k and 0.2% on the rest 40k minus 35% verrechnungssteuer.   
BUT, the big but, if I opened 5 of these accounts in UBS which only take 5 min once you already have one, I could put 15k in each get the max. interest (1.25%) on the whole 60k and would not get charged Verrechnungs steuer since it would be less then 200 CHf per account...   
And since its considered Kapital gains, I would not have to pay tax on the approx 800 Chf at the one of the year.   
Now were is my mistake ???   
Thanks guys

AFAIK swisscard offers a prepaid Mastercard, might be an alternative.      Most students don't. That's exactly why the banks issue cards with low credit limits for students...   
I don't know if that's an option, but transferring a substantial amount (by your standards) from your US account to CS and leave it there for a while might help as well. Would show them that you actually have the means to pay your credit card bills.

2837	Financebankingtaxation	Importing personal stuff, lots of questions sorry..	satans worm	650	0	Location: New York	05.09.2012, 23:18	" 
			
			ok, i have done some research but would like to summaries my position on how i understand a personal import should happen 
Basically the plan is to rent a van from Sixty, driving it from Zurich to Suffolk via channel tunnel (van will be empty). 
loading the van with my stuff and possibly putting my back out on lifting the slate bed pool table   then after visiting friends for couple if days driving it back again. This time using Freight service eurotunnel along with all the prostitute murdering lorry drivers    
Going to drive the Belgium route instead of the highway/toll in France which i believe is a bit cheaper and maybe an hour longer, im guessing 9 hours Calais to the Zurich border.   
Which leads me onto alot of questions   
Soooo 
i would have already filled out a 18.44 form and have a list of items that i am bringing over in as much details as i can. 
I am assuming i do not need to notify anyone in advance on my import, just turn up with the 18.44 and a list of 'stuff' (plus b permit, rental contract, job contract and inside leg measurement) 
The smiling jolly customs man then goes over my van using a very small tooth comb and charges me tax on the pubic hair i failed to declare. 
i then drive home, get cornish pasty(yes rich thats you) to help unload the stuff and put his back out on the pool table. job done. 
Now i dont speak or read any german (and to be honest im not much good at English either) so the offical web site is a bit of a mystery to me, however with the help of google translate it seems the times you can go through the customs is 7.30 to 5.00, which is a pain as i live around 12-13 hours door to door away meaning apart from a 3 oclcock start and praying for no traffic and a fast freight service through the tunnel, i wont make it in time. 
Are any of them manned later for the customs duty?  
If not i could leave in the afternoon then stop off for the night somewhere in Europe, which makes me nervous leaving my worldly belongings in a hired van in a public car park (given the size of vans i dont suppose any will fit in secrured parking that tends to be underground) 
Any recommendations as to where to stay, just need to put my head down for 6 hours or so with the van relatively safe not too far off my route.  
How have people done this in the past from England?? 
I dont want to go back to customs the next day as it would mean having to rent the van for another day at chf200 a day so i would prefer to avoid it if possible. 
another issue for me is that this is my second move of stuff, the first was only basic items such as bike and xbox (you know the essentials  ) that was done by a moving company. 
I made it clear to them another larger load would be needed and recently asked them if they ticked the partial move box to which they didn't directly reply and just said it shouldn't be a problem. :/  
Can i ask the customs what they have on record before i bring my stuff over so i know what to expect re tax on importing the goods, and can kick off the issue with the removal firm before hand,  
Huge post i know, but if you haven't fallen asleep by now reading it, is there anything i have missed out that i should think about/doing in preparation? 
Thanks

At such a low income level, it's perhaps not unsurprising that the vast majority of your income is taxed at a very low rate.   
Here is a clearer table showing what the quellensteuer / withholding tax should be, based on gross monthly income:      "	Posts: 15	Join Date: Aug 2012	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

I still have a us bank account, and from Switzerland I will just use online bill pay (actually for many things I will have to use online bill pay).    
And in regards to you question about my etrade account, yes, my pay (which originates in the US to be clear) is deposited there and I withdraw funds through the ATMs in CH. Btw, for international ATM withdrawals I find etrade is by FAR the least expensive US bank to use. No set per use fee and only a 1% foreign fee which is much less than most US banks.

			I want to store some gold within Switzerland and at the moment have not come up with an ideal solution. Also I have come to the conclusion that it is desirable to get it outside of the banking system.   
I have looked at these two that are perhaps worth considering. In one it seemed to me expensive to keep it there and in the other expensive to put it in, or at least I thought it was expensive but I have no idea of what the going rate should be.         
So just wondering if anyone has any further suggestions or advice.   
I'm resident in the UK but come to Switzerland quite often so visiting is no problem at all. In fact I'm going tomorrow.

The rate was best in one of the exchange places inside grand bazar(from the ones I checked). Most of the exchange places in the city give better rates than ATM withdrawal(I did that and checked the rate), but you have to haggle. In all the exchange places I went to, I got a better price than what was displayed on the board, so be aware.

2846	Financebankingtaxation	"Swiss company not paying back ""loan"""	Alex999	1083	4	Location: Zurich	02.09.2012, 20:10	"    Normally the shares will be valued on the basis of some conseravtive multiple of trailing EBITDA. Such investment is generally targetted at creating value on a sale or IPO, but only if you are still on staff at that point. Its not so strange for the company to buy back the shares to reallocate to your succesor.   
However, it sounds like you are not per se unhappy with the value but with the fact the price remains unpaid, which I can understand.  Personally I have only seen deferred payment clauses where the company is legally unably to pay the cash due to solvency issues.    
The docs mentioned previously are the only source of guidance to help further.

This is very interesting.  Why did the US government not inform Switzerland that the US government would be guilty of a federal crime if Americans were denied mortgages due to their national origin, as a result of US policy?   The US government is now guilty of being a federal criminal and attempts to justify such failures by pointing the finger of blame at others?

			Today I went to open a student account at Zürcher Kantonalbank and was told that as a US citizen I am no longer allowed to open any accounts with them. They said the practice is new and in response to how many difficulties they have had with US citizens opening Swiss accounts and evading US taxes.    
The representative said that most all other Swiss banks are also blocking accounts for US citizens regardless of having a residence permit. The exception seems to be PostFinance with the Swiss Post.   
The Swiss government requires foreign students here to show financial means of supporting themselves by using a bank present in Switzerland, yet they block us from opening Swiss accounts. Awesome.

			You are making this a lot more complex then needed.   
Firstly most swiss banks have the option to withdraw euros here directly from an autobank in switzerland. The rate is usually also very good and I would say its less then the approach you are using of using your US bank which would be charging you an inbuilt exchange rate anyway.   
Why did you apply for a german bank credit card since you dont live I am not surprised they rejected you. We have Zurich Kantonal Bank credit card which if you have a silver card they have a way of avoiding the fee if you spend 10K in a year on the card. The fee they charge to spend in euro zone is only around 1.25% I think but given things are cheap there anyway then its pretty academic to even worry.   
As far as your online shopping and lack of fees I think you will find there is already one built into the exchange rate conversion of Euro to USD.

The OP needs to look around the house to see if there might be a safe someplace (as was mentioned).

2867	Financebankingtaxation	American marrying Swiss tax confusion!	TaraDalziel	4207	20	Location: Luzern	16.02.2012, 15:34	"    1. It's really quite confusing - so don't rely on online comments here. It's too risky to follow mere advice of this forum. Best to pay a US Tax accountant to get some advice.   
That said, as soon as you have   of your husband's assets - be it his bank account or other investments, you will have to report these both with your 1040 (form 8938) and FBAR (TD F 90-22.1).   
You may find it especially helpful to read the FBAR instructions, such as those listed here:    
Now here some details from          Certain  U.S. taxpayers holding specified foreign financial assets with an aggregate value exceeding $50,000 will report information about those assets on new  , which must be attached to the taxpayers annual income tax return. Higher asset thresholds apply to  U.S.  taxpayers who file a joint tax return or who reside abroad.      reporting applies for specified foreign financial assets in which the taxpayer has an interest in taxable years starting after March 18, 2010. For most individual taxpayers, this means they will start filing   with their 2011 income tax return to be filed this coming tax filing season.     Upon issuance of regulations, FATCA may require reporting by specified domestic entities.  For now, only specified individuals are required to file  .                 Refer to   instructions for more information on assets that do not have to be reported.             A specified individual is:                 A specified foreign financial asset is:             · Stock or securities issued by someone other than a U.S.  person   · Any interest in a foreign entity, and    · Any financial instrument or contract that has as an issuer or counterparty that is other than a  U.S. person.      Refer to the Form 8938 instructions for more information on the definition of a specified foreign financial assets and when you have an interest in such an asset.                             · You are a U.S. citizen whose tax home is in a foreign country and you are either a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period that includes the entire tax year, or     · You are a  US citizen or resident, who during a period of 12 consecutive months ending in the tax year is physically present in a foreign country or countries at least 330 days.                      Reporting specified foreign financial assets on other forms filed with the IRS.     If you are required to file a   and you have a specified foreign financial asset reported on  ,  ,  , Form 8621,  , or  , you do not need to report the asset on Form 8938.     However, you must identify on Part IV of your  which and how many of these form(s) report the specified foreign financial assets.

2868	Financebankingtaxation	2nd & 3rd pilar taxation in the US	rog	4428	17	Location: Zurich	02.03.2012, 10:00	" 
			
			As a latecomer onto this thread, I find myself in similar situation, although I wasn't as smart by taxing everything in Switzerland before becoming resident in U.S., so I have to pay U.S. income tax on both 2nd/3rd pillar.   
I moved in 2010, cashed out in 2011. The Swiss withheld the Quellensteuer on both pillars, which you can reclaim if you transfer into another pension plan (such as 401K). As my employer doesn't have such a plan and I have a W2, I had no option other than to distribute both pillars. I also got hammered on my 3rd pillar with Zurich (getting back less than I paid in after admin fees).   
As a dual citizen, I never filed my taxes and am playing catch-up for last 8-9 years (only myself to blame for that). Can anyone tell me what is the best way to report contributions and how to calculate deductions? As I recall, the Lohnausweis does not provide company contributions, only personal contributions.

2870	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on shares	samj	3206	7	Location: Zürich	16.08.2012, 17:35	"    You don't get taxed on RSUs until they vest, in which case they will be considered as income and you have to pay income tax + social contributions on them. Various arrangements are done by companies to avoid having to pay a huge amount, like selling some of the shares to pay for the tax liability and you would only have to pay the social / pension contributions.   
As for the ESPP, if they are not restricted then just sell some of them to cover your tax / social / pension liabilities either automatically by your own company or through who over holds the shares for you. If they're restricted then AFAIK you don't have to pay anything on them apart from tax on dividends.   
I am not even sure if you even pay wealth tax on RSUs, as their value can not be determined until the vesting date.

2872	Financebankingtaxation	US IRS helps itself to Swiss income	Dual US/Swiss Citizen	8575	106	Location: Aargau	26.07.2012, 10:27	"    Just the opposite, IME.   
One factor influencing our choice to live in a low-tax canton was our US tax liability.   
Living in canton Zürich and paying higher CH taxes meant a larger deduction (foreign earned income) from our US taxes - and that large deduction kicked us into the US alternative minimum tax.    
Living in a low tax canton means I pay a larger proportion to the US, avoiding AMT. There are quite a few Americans in my corner of SZ for that reason. Sure, we pay far more overall than our neighbors who are not burdened with the blue passport, in fact we pay as much to Uncle Sam as we do to Helvetia - so in that sense we don't reap the benefit of low SZ taxes. But at least we aren't hit with the AMT on top.   
I wish I could afford to live in SG...

from the tax reclaim point its about 8 minutes to be back in the public area.    
go towards D gates, on LH side is a yellow walkway with "" no way back"" go thru and come out near the baggage collection customs.   
easy.

Ok! I agree with you. I rather prefer a bank than insurance companies.  
Now, my question is: if I want to have a life insurance what can I do? Is it better to have it decoupled from 3rd pillar? (which I don't know if it is even possible...)

			Re: three year waiting period.   
I think that is the case, and even if not (enforced) - be careful of trying to cycle earnings through the pension with the aim of withdrawing straightaway/soon.  This can be deemed 'tax avoidance' and although you will not get into trouble legally, I believe the tax man can levy surcharges in lieu of previous tax reliefs.   
May be particularly of note for those planning to leave CH (for non-EU shores) and take their pension pot straightaway.  Note sure whether it applies equally to Pillar 2 and 3 - I discussed cashing in Pillar 3 (incl. previous years contribution) to use as a mortgage deposit and no-one mentioned such issues - indeed I have the impression it's quite allowed to cash in Pillar 3 for this purpose and re-invest in a new one - there is a thread somewhere where Richard explained more.

Which probably means another toll charge for the remainder of the items to come :-(

2888	Financebankingtaxation	Tax percentage in Basel stadt	Haiswiss	7458	8	Location: Basel	25.08.2011, 19:53	"    I'm not surprised that you're surprised - BS has got a much worse reputation for tax than it deserves.   
I just compared my tax bill in BS on Comparis against a few other towns around Switzerland: I pay practically the same here as in SO, BE or FR, a little bit more than if I lived in BL or VS, and considerably less than if I lived in GE, VD, NE or JU.   
So for me, BS is very similar to other places in Western Deutschschweiz and clearly cheaper than Suisse Romande.  Of course, the Innerschweiz cantons are the cheapest of all.   
But don't forget, the biggest saving you make living in BS is doing your shopping ten minutes away in France and Germany    With a family, that can be a bigger saving than any difference in tax.

			We were in the same predicament.  This is what we did:   
(1) We got a credit card with Capital One.  It has no annual fee, no foreign exchange fee, and a pretty competitive exchange rate (within about ~0.5%).  We use it for grocery shopping and big purchases.    
(2) We opened an account with PostFinance and did a wire transfer from BofA about a week later.  We didn't need to actually deposit any money to open the account at PostFinance.  It had a zero balance for a while.   
BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE U.S., go to BofA and set up full authorization for phone wire transfers.  Wire transfers cost $45 a pop, if done in dollars.   
Make sure you transfer dollars to dollars.  If you do dollars to Swiss francs, BofA charges 5%.  They will tell you there is no foreign currency exchange fee but, if you ask at what rate the money will be exchanged, you will discover the hidden cost.    
PostFinance converted the dollars for us automatically.  The exchange rate was about 1% from market.   
To wire transfer the money you need to give BofA the SWIFT code for PostFinance. The people at BofA don't always know.what that is. (The code for PostFinance is  .)    Try to locate a big branch of BofA in a big city where they have done this type of thing before.   
(3) We brought U.S. dollars with us for immediate/emergency expenses.  We exchanged the money at the main train station in Zurich.  Exchanging the money was easy, but it was also the most costly (3% for amounts over $3000 and 5% for under $3000).   
HTH.

			Yes! You pretty much got exactly where I am coming from. The company did not have adequate accounting software which is why they brought me in, and I've been bringing everything up to order up until now on a good platform and it's going well. Obviously I'm not happy with what the previous accountant did, but I can't exactly blame him either, because I saw how inadequately the company used to provide him the information to do the books (unorganized invoices and bank statements in a big folder). I'll see if I can go through the process with him and then continue doing it myself.

ive read on the viseca website, about a guideline on how to recharge, and its written....      do i just need to bring my prepaid card on kantonal bank and deposit? just like an ordinary EC-card?   
or if it does, how long does recharging takes effect?

2915	Financebankingtaxation	PIN on a credit card	russiangeneva	3981	23	Location: Geneva	20.01.2011, 13:06	" 
			
			Alright, an update.   
Got an advance from the hotel, at 5% fee. Secondly, went to an exchange office (at the train station) and exchanged CAD to CHF by drawing funds from the credit card. They checked the passport and made an old-fashioned carbon copy of the card with a slider contraption. They also said that a Maestro debit card would work too (but not a Plus card, which is what I have).   
Entering 6 digits out of 8 won't work, because of how the PIN is verified by the card' chip (I'm partial to the smart cards, used to write software for the terminals).   
For the same reasons it is not possible to change the PIN on a card without having the card present. Moreover the PIN can only be changed at the issuing bank branch.   
One thing I haven't tried is going and talking to the teller at BCV/UBS/etc. There   a slim chance that it would work, but I somehow doubt it. The same PIN length restriction is probably present at the counter terminals.

2917	Financebankingtaxation	Public sector pensions?	symphara	588	0	Location: omw to Zurich via California	24.07.2012, 13:27	" 
			
			Apologies if this has been asked and answered before - I did search but found no information on this particular topic.   
I was wondering if public sector pensions in Switzerland are funded by contributions during employment or through general taxation, as is mostly the case in the UK as well as other countries. As in, should the tax revenue somehow disappear in the UK, the reality is that most public sector pensions could not be paid, as there are no ""funds"" or ""savings"" per se, they rely on the tax payer (along with state borrowing) to fund the ongoing payments.   
By ""public sector"" I specifically mean non-private, i.e. administration (e.g. parliament), general bureaucracy, police etc.

			Hi!   
I need a little help with my current situation.   
At the moment i live in Hungary. But I've got a job in Switzerland. Im planning to move to Germany, so I will be commuting daily to Switzerland. But i will be a sales manager, so i will be travelling in East Europe a lot. I have some relatives and friends owning a house near the German-Swiss border, so i would be residenced to their address.   
My first question is how far from the border do i need to have a residency in Germany, which is considered near?   
What and where is the most prosperous way to pay taxes?   
Where can i find infromation about this? (outsider links or threads in this forum would be appriciated)   
Thanks in advance guys!   
Bye!

			The other obvious question that i have is how one can be expected to get any sort of IRA based tax advantage.  As I understand it, putting money into a US IRA wouldn't shield you from Swiss taxes and putting money into a Swiss IRA increases your US taxes by a fraction of what you save.   
I am still trying to get a handle on the various rules.  Sometime next year, I might will be looking for a not too expensive CFA type with knowledge of both US and Swiss tax code.

I'm not totally sure what Deduction CP is, but guessing that's your contribution to Pillar 2.  The Impot a la source is your tax at source - looks like you're in a higher taxed canton.  So... you could move to a lower tax canton and you'd pay less tax (but more in commuting).

Just write it exactly as it is ""My main interests (family) are abroad and I travel there frequently"" on the front page and return it. I had asked Zürich Steueramt and they confirmed such a clause does exist and I am free to exercise it. So I did.

			We have a similar situation. House in the UK in joint names. Rented out so the income falls well below the personal tax allowance. We declare the property here in CH but I don't think it affects our liability here too much. We don't intend to return to the UK, but with the housing market, no point trying to sell it. We complete a non resident return for HMRC so we are exempt from charges levied by our letting agent etc. We do this every time the tenant changes and we speak with HMRC to check the status hasn't changed and we don't need to do a return.   
We will take further advice when we come to sell.   
oh, and look to change your mortgage to an offshore one. Isle of man, HK etc

			I'm hoping someone who knows a bit more about Swiss labour law will give you some advice, but on the basis of what you say it sounds as though your employer has given you some kind of independent contractor status because you are expected to pay all the social charges etc. It raises the question of whether your residence permit actually allows this. One would need to check your contract and find out if it really complies with Swiss law etc. etc. If the status of the company has changed they might well have to pay you their side of the social charges. Unless a more knowledgeable EFer gives you a more coherent answer your only way of finding out where you stand would be to consult a lawyer. Once you know where you stand you can decide what to do about what what seems to me to be a slightly insecure position.

2951	Financebankingtaxation	Buying a house in France - Tax	copes	3635	23	Location: Versoix	30.05.2012, 13:18	"    I believe that fatmanfilms is wrong on this one. Sounds unlikely, I know... Here's my version:   
The standard scenario is that a Geneva frontalier is taxed on income at source in Switzerland and in France on everything else. No deductions to income are allowed in Switzerland, apart from those due to buying extra pension rights. The fraction of income earned in Switzerland has no effect on this setup.   
Recently the law has changed so that frontaliers earning at least 90% of their global income in Switzerland can get deductions from their income tax, by opting to fill in the standard GeTax form. This change allows me to claim back commuting mileage, health care etc. from the Geneva tax authorities. Still no change on what is taxed on the French side, though.

i manage to get a Prepaid MasterCard now from Kantonal Bank last Saturday. on the application form, there is this, ""Initial Charge"" option, and i set 300CHF plus my normal Kantonal Bank Account Card Number, when i recieve the card it contains 0 balance,and my Kantonal Account lose 300CHF, im not quite sure for what is Initial Charge. i believe it will be the charge of my card once i get it.   
but according to the mail they sent on me, charging requires 3-4 working days, so could it be that its not the right time yet? today is Monday.    
what does Initial Charge really mean?

			There are plenty against the peg, as you say its artificial.   
However consensus was the CHF was totally over valued due to the flood of risk averse currency buying. Anecdotally I tend to agree.. When the CHF was at its strongest everything abroad seemed somehow too cheap.   
Now whether the Swiss tourist industry and export industries need so much protection from global realitites of competition and globalization is another question.

			Hi everyone. I would like to get the tax return after buying stuff in germany. I live in Schaffhausen and I don't have a car, so I travel to singen by train. I can't get a stamp on the border as people who travel by car. How does it work? Can I get my documents stamped in Singen or in Schaffhausen's station?

2961	Financebankingtaxation	Claim back 35% interest tax	freeworld	2676	4	Location: Zurich	01.01.2011, 22:00	"    I have updated information:   
Yes you can claim those back. Even with B or C permit.    it means you need to make a declaration   you will never see the entire 35%.    
The taxman told me those 35% are to make sure people will declare. If you don't they get the 35% entirely. If you do, they still going to tax you on it (federal + communal tax).   
So if you have 201CHF interest, they'll take 35%: 
Removing 70.35CHF. 
To get those back, you need to spend lot of time finding and filling forms, paying stamps, wait months.   
Finally you'll get back something like around 30-40Chf as they will tax you on those 35%...     
Summary: you're have to pay taxes, taxes, taxes even if you earn ridiculous amounts of interests.  You also need to waste lot of time in doing administration things for a small amount. 
Finally, it also remember the wises how bank ""interests"" are a joke and how you should find a much better, safer, way of using your savings.   
You've been warned.

			Use this government tax calculator to get a good estimate of your taxes.    
The form doesn't ask exactly where you live, so the communal tax is aproximate, and is the average charged within your canton. You can adjust the rate for the calculation if you know it exactly.    
If you are being presently taxed wildly off the result, then go and see someone!    
Choose your canton and the year you are interested,          
Adjust the tax rate boxes if they are not correct for where you live.    
Complete the form and press ""calculate"", the result is displayed:    
Simple Tax - this is the ""basic tax rate"" an indication, set by federal parliament for the tax year in question.   
Direct Federal tax, this is for the 12 months (Jan to Dec), amount you pay   
Cantonal tax in CHF (Factor times simple tax) and the amount you pay    
Communual tax in CHF (Factor x simple tax)  and  the amount  you pay (Average only?)   
Church tax in CHF (Again, the simple tax is multiplied by this factor) the amount you pay   
You can print the page. You can save the result, and re- load the saved results for other calculations.  
. 
Look out for the book on Amazon ""Living & Working in Switzerland"" buy the most recent edition.

Most people who act as Treuhand here would be about the same as Accounting technicians in the UK/Ireland and they are not allowed to offer services to the public unless under the supervison of a qualified accountant!   
There are in fact only about 5,000 CPAs in Switzerland, which is a very small number given the size of the country.

			Anyone know of a good unbiased reference that might help me with the question of where to put a lump sum from the UK in a medium-term, low-risk account of some sort? There's oodles of stuff out there on the web, I know, but mostly it seems to be aimed at either the investment types looking for quick bucks fast (and presumably not always finding it).   
Personal experience would be good, or just anything about obvious things to avoid or other pitfalls.

2972	Financebankingtaxation	Help with choosing a Pillar 3a provider	kiwiguy08	963	0	Location: Horgen	02.07.2012, 15:17	" 
			
			So I have been seriously thinking about getting in on the Pillar 3 action. I checked at my local Zürcher KB about the interest and it was at 1.5%. I thought Id check comparis to see what other banks were offering. Apparently Creit Suisse is offering 2.25%.    
My question is if choosing one bank over the other has bearing on taxation when i take the money out (3-4 years) the way that pillar 2 does. Perhaps Basel is offering a higher interest because their Hq is in Basel which has much higher tax rates than ZH.    
So does it play a role??

			As I understand it, Post Finance is still on the road to becoming a ""real bank,"" and is trying to comply with regulations bit by bit.  With FATCA, this means dropping cross border business with Americans (as many other banks have done) and PF will automatically send account info to the U.S. beginning in...2014? I think.  To opt out of this automatic exchange, an American client would face the 30% withholding tax.  For a simple retail account, for an American living in Switzerland, PF seems the easiest.  For more complicated financial services (complicated being relative) like investing...I don't know.     
I have been under the impression an American buying foreign stocks on a foreign exchange is not worth it because of the added IRS headaches.  ETFs bought through an American broker would be easier.  Just what I heard..

			Hi Alex,   
I'm not sure you ever got an answer to you inquiry.  A lot depends on if you are a US passport holder.  If so, then any contribution you make is nothing more than a deposit into a regular banking account (for US income tax purposes).  You see, the amounts you contribute, and the amounts your employer contributes are all considered normal income.  The US does not recognize CH pensions as pensions. They are nothing more than another banking account.   
Does this help?

			This is really sad indeed and I do not know what else Switzerland could have done. I read recently where the US continued to allow Swiss citizens to enter US without a Visa for the 90 day period. Big deal! US is pissing -off  a lot of their citizens abroad, and wherever possible many are giving up the blue book. It just isn't worth the hassle. US is not what it used to be and US citizenship has lost its value for many hardworking expats.

			Be very careful, I went through the motions a few weeks back thinking I was going to be taxed by both countries and it turned out when I did the calculations I would actually be operated at a loss as here in Switzerland (Zurich) I only pay 8-9% tax on my earnings the rest is social security, pension and sickness and unemployment. Altogether these account for 35% of what I earn each month so I'm left with 65% take into account the the basic tax rate in the UK is 21-22% I think it would mean they'd want 13-14% so that leaves you with 51-52% of what you earn on the first 42K GBP

			Agreed - if you look at your registration papers, you'll probably see a restriction ""Halterwechsel verboten"" or something like that. It means that you are not allowed to re-register this vehicle under another name.   
What I have seen done is that you can try to find someone to assume the lease for you - then agree with the leasing agency that the new ""owner"" will take over the lease and make the monthly payments until then end of the term, then either buy the car (residual value) from the leasing company or be liable for any additional costs (high mileage, damage, etc.) that would be due when the car is returned. In this case, you could get out of the lease, but you won't make any money (other than saving the 500/month leasing rates, insurance and other costs).    
In any case, talk with your leasing agency - it's their car, not yours, until it has been paid in full.

I got an excellent rate, but they charged a fee for the wire transfer. £10 I think. Certainly CHF24.50      My transfer completed in about 24 hours. that was Credit Suisse to Barclays. Of course, YMMV.   
With xe.com, the rate varies with the market, whereas the Interbank is (I think!) the median price from the previous day.   
I've just compared xe.com with the interbank rate at  . xe.com was £16 better over the deal, but once you subtract the transfer fee there's not a lot in it.   
With xe.com you have to set up an account and they need to see documents, etc. Then they want to speak to you.   
When you use the xe.com web site to set up a trade it's a bit unnerving as the page offers you a rate and there is a 30 second countdown. Especially when you're a bit drunk  .   
So what I think I've learned is that for xe.com to be well worth it, you need to be moving a lot of CHF and at the same time watch for the going exchange rate to move quite a lot in your favour versus the interbank rate.

2995	Financebankingtaxation	Kinderzulage (child allowance)	RobFish3	11068	19	Location: Zurich	01.09.2009, 18:08	"    Yes, you're right, the rules are a bit different for self-employed people.  It also depends on the canton - in Vaud, for example, the tax deduction rate is 1.3% for 2010 rather than the 3.3% you're paying (sorry...).   
I think the Kinderzulage 'ceases' below a certain income level because an individual child can only be named once for receipt of Kinderzulage, or as part of unemployment benefit, etc - I guess those on lower incomes are still receiving a sum of money towards children but it just has a different name/ code.   
I can see why you'd consider it a bit like UK Child Tax Credit in your self-employed situation, but just to clarify for others - assuming you are salaried with kids, you will be eligible for Kinderzulage here at a set amount per canton, and you cannot claim UK Child Benefit at the same time.

			Yes, you will get charged if you withdraw from ATM's that are not your bank's/PO's.  UBS charge CHF3 for withdrawals.   
Not sure what you mean by Swiss specific VISA cards?  It will be issued by a Swiss bank like UBS, but you can use it worldwide the same as the UK ones.  There will be the usual charges for purchases bought outside Switzerland and for converting into Swiss Francs, but that's the same anywhere.   
I'm not sure about your rating.  The Swiss are only now getting into using credit cards more; usually they pay cash or via a debit card.  When we first came over 14 years ago very few places accepted credit cards and if they did it was usually their own brand credit card only and some still do that.  Now more places are taking credit cards in general, but it is still much rarer than in the UK.

I really can't tell if you're being serious on this thread??   
Anyway I'll assume you are   
Companies like this work on commission, lots of it, all paid by you, your first few (or more) years of premiums all go to them, and that's if they are legit, if they aren't then they are just stealing from you.   
Read the links Reb77Br very kindly provided, the company folded and seems to have reappeared with all the same staff, and everyone lost there money, but it seems that doesn't matter to the local, they'll happily run editorials singing there praises just as long as they get paid, morals? responsibility? seem in short supply.   
Much like these companies that will find you a loan, no charge to you, how do you think they get paid? when you can just go to the bank directly and get a loan much much cheaper.

3003	Financebankingtaxation	Reporting Withdrawal from Pillar 2 to IRS	almeida	4850	6	Location: USA	07.02.2012, 04:03	" 
			
			Hi athgeneva.  I spent a lot of time researching this.  I talked to the IRS a few times via their 1-800 number, but we never contacted a tax advisor.  The IRS told me that distributions from Swiss pensions are considered income.  As advised by the IRS, we reported the total distribution on line 16a of our 2011 1040.  This was the ""Avoir de libre passage"" I mentioned previously.  We also had to fill out line 16b, which is the taxable amount.  The IRS told me to take the total, subtract the cost (i.e., her contributions to the pension), and report the rest on 16b.  Unfortunately, we didn't have a complete history of her account, so we had to make a best guess.  One of her statements showed her contributions and her employers' contributions separately, so we used the amount from that statement as her cost.  As I said, the total, minus that cost, is the taxable amount, which we reported on line 16b.  Basically, her employers' contribution and all interest was reported to the IRS.  We reported the same amounts to Massachusetts for our state returns.  Both our federal return and our state return were accepted, but who knows if we'll be audited in the future.   
A lot of people claim that the IRS doesn't recognize Swiss pensions and therefore they are not taxed, but that isn't true from what I've read of the US-Swiss tax treaty and from what the IRS agents told me.  It's possible that we overestimated the taxable portion, but we figured what we did was safest.  Also, for us, because there wasn't that much money in her pension, the end result wasn't much different if we changed the math.   
Let me know if you discover anything different.  Good luck!

			I think you should give the payment in advance a try. You are a small business and once you become bigger you can give them a 30 day credit. Or, you may want to allow them to pay half in advance and the other half in 30 days. Some online retail businesses like Ricardo in Switzerland ask for upfront payment. Do not be afraid and think that you will lose customers. If you have something they want, and you wrote that it is something they cannot usually get in Switzerland, have them pay you upfront.   
Paypal is quite versatile and they also accept credit cards etc...You are running a business not a charity, and at the moment you need a cash flow. Only allow 30 days for repeat customers...Good Luck

3011	Financebankingtaxation	2ieme Pillar withdrawal	athgeneva	942	0	Location: New York	15.06.2012, 15:32	" 
			
			I moved from Switzerland 11 years ago, and have just been advised by BCGe that I must withdraw my 2ieme pillar (I am a US citizen). My french, after all these years, is less than fluent, and I've received wildly conflicting information on what needs to be done with the withdrawal and eventual deposit in the US.     
Will the balance be subject to a tax in CH? If so, what % and how do I handle this? When setting up an account in the US, are these considered pension $ or after tax $? Should I be moving funds into an IRA or a straight investment account? How do I report this to the IRS? What should I expect in terms of tax in the US? By moving them before age 60 (I'm 50) am I being penalized and is there anything, contrary to what BCGe say, that I can do about this? etc.   
Would appreciate anyone with experience in the this area offering opinion, and eventually contacts for professional who could advise. I am completely frazzled.

			As eluded to above, Credit Suisse has ""further to go"" in terms of improving its capital ratio. Both banks have the same target to acheive by 2019, UBS is ahead of CS on its progress towards this (by about 4bn). In addition,  CS may have to cut dividend, which it has paid every year for 150 years. UBS may have to as well, but only started it again this year.   
Poor form by the SNB in the way it was announced i'd say.

			Dude, you overexcited yourself for nothing, unfortunately.   
The VAT for food in france is only 5,5 %. It's different for alcohols, etc...   
So basically, you would have been through the hassle of ""customer service"" + hassle of customs + usually the administration fee (global blue or shop) for... 15 euros. (if you spent 300euros)   
I agree it's not bad (as you spent quite a lot) but it's really not worth the hassle.   
Also, you should have verified  the conditions by asking them (although once I asked and they told me it's 19% VAT but the lady made a mistake and the other lady corrected  ).   
By the way with the strong Swiss franc and the lower price of items in the shop, you still have made quite a bargain. Hey we can't win all the time.              "	Posts: 217	Join Date: Nov 2011	Member	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	Thanked 160 Times in 62 Posts	earned some respect

If you cancel you only pay for the classes you attended.  After two weeks you pay the full course but can pay monthly.   
Seemed good to me as I was expecting to pay the full course in advance when I signed up as it was only a week before it started.

			in your tax return you can deduct a ""forfait"" for the use of public transportation calculated based on the number of kilometers between your home and your office. If you want to deduct the GA, assuming its costs are higher, then you can try but I would advise you to justify in an enclosure why you absolutely need a GA for your work and why that is a cost that is necessary for your work (which is deductible). But be aware, it is either the forfait or GA, you can not have both...    
I did it for my own and it worked. The tax authority will most probably assume that you take each year a new GA, therefore no split to perform in costs.

			The 10k rule is an aggregate rule. So, your non US accounts exceed 10k on aggregate then you list ALL accounts, even if max balance was $1.   
If you had 5 accounts with max balances of $1,500 you would not need to file.   
As per above, if you have non wilfully neglected to report certain accounts, file amended. The IRS will not penalise you providing income from those accounts was properly reported.

			Yes you can buy gold at the UBS counter but when you want to sell it you have to have a UBS account since UBS does not give more than 25K CHF in cash. Do you know of any precious mettals dealers where you can get paid in cash?

I have no idea when the tax started or at what rate it was however I do know it's been 35% for a very long time.   
Bear in mind a Swiss tax payer can recover in full & then pay their actual marginal rate if they fill in a tax return.

The sole reason I mention ""came after 2005"" is a small print on the questionnaire I had to fill-in to receive the estimate: figured this should matter or have some impact on what I can/cannot buy back.    
Most certainly, I will first open me and my wife 3a accounts for the year and then decide what to put in the 2eme   
I didn't know one could have more than one 3a account, thus acquiring flexibility with his/her savings. Will open my first this year and shop around for another one next year. Any tips as to how to do this? Can I have multiple 3a accounts with the same bank/insurance/fund, or should these (is it smarter to) be different each year?

			OK, I just called Social Security in Frankfurt. A very nice lady explained that when I am ready to apply for Social Security benefits, I tell them about my Swiss AHV payments, and according to this new agreement between Switzerland and the US, America will apply my AHV payments to my US Social Security benefits so that I have the minimum of 40 quarters credit, while at the same time I don't lose my AHV benefits.  A good deal, I would say. I think, though, that I have to keep paying into AHV until Swiss retirement age even if I am in the US.  If anyone knows more about this, I would like to find out.

			Hi all,   
I am planning to return to the States where I have only 19 quarters of Soc Sec taxes paid in out of a necessary 40 to receive SSI upon retirement.  I have been paying into AHV here for much of the last 20 years, however.  My question is whether I can pay into SSI back the last few years for 1) alimony earned in the US giving periodic workshops, 2) alimony received here, and/or 3) income on US properties I rent out? Also, once I go back there do I then pay to both SSI and AHV (so my AHV doesn't lapse)?   
Social Security dept is sending me to IRS to answer any questions. My accountant here is trying to tell me that you pay only one country or the other, that they have some kind of agreement, though I remember that it was important to keep payments coming to the AHV even when we lived abroad for 8 years.    
Does anybody know how to handle this so one receives social security from both countries?  Is it allowed to pay to both (I would need to backpay a few years to SSI to get to 40 quarters by age 65).

The closest I have seen and not sure where they are here is to have an SMS capability on expenses.   
There is an online statement viewing and you can have the statements emailed and automatically setup to pay the statement each month from your bank account so you pay zero interest as there is no overdue amounts.   
Also the first specification asked for a credit card capbable of worldwide and minimum switzerland applicability I believe they all do this.

			Nice to see someone had good advice before coming here, I for one had none and was told conflicting things. Your friend was indeed correct If you're not out of the country for a whole tax year you have to pay taxes in the UK when you return.   
My searches to find some loophole have proved fruitless so I'm thinking of knocking it on the head and going back as lets face it, it's a bit of a sham in the sense that I lose 30% of my income here (only 8-9% in tax) and then the taxman in UK wants a slice on top.

			Not having a credit profile won't stop you opening accounts when you get here.  It will only limit your ability to get credit.  If you're willing to put CHF 5000 credit into your credit card account when you arrive and never go below zero then some banks will give you a credit card.  Sure, that means it's effectively a debit card rather than a credit card, but it will get you started on building the credit history, and aside from the one time transfer of the starting CHF 5000 balance, you'll have no other FX costs ....    
However, if you're not a fan of ""unnecessary costs"", then prepare for a shock.  You may think its cheaper to run a local CHF credit/bank account than UK accounts, but ... there's no free banking here in Switzerland.   
In other words, it may not save you as much as you would hope to switch to a CH account: negligible credit interest, CHF for a credit card, CHF for a debit card, CHF for transaction fees unless you have sufficient credit balance.  All the info is available on the banks' websites.  Take a look at ubs.com .  Or try the ""budget"" accounts offered by laposte.ch or migros.ch .

You can hold your account in virtually any base currency you want (CHF, USD, GBP, etc) and you can trade on all the major bourses.     
Customer support is provided via a European-based team (in London, I think) and is available in both European and US trading hours.   
They're also the cheapest in the business, although if you're an infrequent trader bear in mind that they have a USD10- minimum monthly charge.  If your trading, your trading fees count against this.

3066	Financebankingtaxation	Investment strategy during 2012 Euro crisis?	Pachyderm	2074	0	Location: Zurich	17.05.2012, 16:45	" 
			
			Apologies for the length of this message but I suspect many others out there in EF-land will be asking similar questions. I often see remarks on the forum about investment but I wanted specifically to ask for a little insight into the current (May 2012 ->) crisis in the Eurozone, and what the options might be for the private investor.   
I have 3 UK-based investment accounts spread across a personal pension (50%), some tax-free ISAs (20%), and 30% in a general stocks and shares investment fund - tax payable. I can't close the pension fund till I retire in 10 years, but the other two I can close any time I please. All of them give me total freedom to invest in the markets.   
In the last month, the total value has dropped about 10%. 
After a rocky investment history over 10 years, earlier this year I thought this time I am going to do some reading, adopt a mainstream strategy AND STICK WITH IT WHATEVER HAPPENS.   
So I spread my cash over a variety of mainly steady, well diversified sectors, geographies and investment types. One difference this time is that I've been looking for a greater focus on income i.e. dividends to be reinvested.    
So now, a few months in, I'm seeing a significant loss, but am still trying to stay mentally strong, given the usual pattern of cashing out too soon (and then regretting it). However, this time things seem worse, with all sorts of apocalyptic commentary about the total collapse of various countries leading to a domino-style collapse across Europe and the capitalist world. I see no respite.   
I can feel my mouse finger itching to run to cash before I lose everything -- or an amount from which I will never recover.   
Advice please! I know there are professional investors and bankers and financiers here. I am curious to know how you are dealing with the current situation, professionally or privately.   
I suspect that my own financial arrangements as described are not untypical, so if you were me, what would you change, if anything? Or would you just sit tight and ride out the storm (confident that the storm will have a sunny ending)?   
Thanks for any advice, insight, ridicule. Or please share your own investment dilemmas. At least we might feel a bit better if we jump off the Titanic hand in hand.

If you are not married, each of you (both working?) must submit a tax declaration*.  You decide between the two of you where (on which tax declaration) your dependents go.   
* or for Quellensteuer, tell the employer that there are dependents that you are reponsible for (did that at beginning of first full calendar year) and they should alter your tax bracket accordingly (happened to me).      It's more a question of residency I'd have thought, and thinking back to various papers I had to fill out, this was indeed it.  If you child is resident here, then you will the lower tax bracket.  If your wife and child are resident outside CH, you can get tax relief for any maintenance you give, but the tax rate would be for a single person IMO (IMO, i.e. this is more my conclusion).   
N.b. note that kinderkarten (in Zurich at least) is compulsory from c. 4 years onwards (dates are 'strict' and are changing this year I believe).

			Since several people have mentioned on a number of different threads that they have had trouble opening bank accounts, obtaining mortgages, or have been forced to close bank accounts because of their US citizenship, I thought I would post this here.    
American Citizens Abroad (ACA) has just posted the following on their Facebook page:         
Please contact the journalist and share your banking stories if you have any. We need all the media attention and coverage we can get on this issue.    
And if you are a US citizen, please support ACA. They're a non-partisan organization representing US citizens abroad and do a great job advocating on our behalf on banking, taxation, citizenship and voting issues affecting Americans abroad, and need all the support they can get.

Looks like you can get the vat back from switzerland only if you pay first the right VAT in UK. This because of the ""Reciprocal right"" between the 2 countries. 
Any thought?

3080	Financebankingtaxation	Nachtraeglich veranlagte Steuer zur Quellensteuer	telandy	1005	5	Location: Thurgau	11.05.2012, 22:59	"    For what it's worth, the tax authorities are very happy to allow you to pay at a later date, and the interest rate they charge in the intervening period is very low.  The calendar year in which I pay my Swiss tax is an important part of my US tax planning, and often it is better for me to pay a few francs of interest rather than having to pay the tax in a given month.   
My accountant always handles this for me, but my understanding is that it's very straightforward -- simply ask the authorities for permission to pay later and agree with them when you'll be paying.  For cashflow reasons, I usually propose the same month I get my bonus.

			Yes, I was wondering that too, biff.  If they live in the US, why would they want a bank account in Switzerland, pay in $3,000 and just leave it sitting there?   
Was it even a dollar bank account?  Can you have one of those in Switzerland?  I know they do Euros as well as the CHF, but do they open bank accounts in other currencies?  If not, then presumably the dollars were converted into Francs on receipt and given the slide in the exchange rate I'd be surprised if it was worth $3,000 today.

3091	Financebankingtaxation	Should I get married?	bigbeard	2189	24	Location: Rolle	06.05.2012, 18:06	" 
			
			I have been in your girlfriend's situation, though I was married. This is my experience to answer some of the questions above.   
She will need a visa. She needs to go to her local Gemeinde within 8 days of arriving in Switzerland to register and get her B permit. Yo should go with her to declare that you will support her. They may want some further declaration from you that you will continue to support her because you are not married - you should check on this before she arrives. Whether or not the permit says that she can work does not matter. As she is an EU citizen she is entitled to look for work here and when she finds a job she just goes to the gemeinde and tells them, they will want a copy of her contract. (I started my new job last week :-)   
She cannot take out health insurance until she is resident here. I registered as resident before I came over here permanently - my husband was already here, like you are, so this was easy. The advantage of doing this before the last few weeks of pregnancy is that you can decide where to give birth, have some checks with the midwives here, and generally not be stressed about the whole thing. I continued to have check-ups in both CH and the UK in case there were any later complications that would prevent me coming to join my husband the month before my due date. Sure you pay a bit extra in a few months health insurance than if you leave it to the last minute, but thats a small price to pay for peace of mind and good health.   
I continued to visit my husband and go back to London for work until i went on maternity leave and then I moved over here permanently. I was tax resident in both the UK and Switzerland for about 18 months. This is fine, as long as you pay all your taxes to both countries.   
No one can tell you exactly how much tax you might save by getting married, but in general Switzerland is supportive of the family unit and you will find your life here a lot easier as a family if you are married. If you decide not to, don't forget to look up all the threads on here about having to declare your paternity etc, and also check into the potential nationality implications for your child of being born in Switzerland to parents of different nationalities neither of which are SWiss.   
If you want further info on my experience feel free to PM me.

3097	Financebankingtaxation	How much do you spend a month EXCLUDING rent/housing costs?	guest	8277	30	null	null	" 
			
			My way is the complete opposite. I say I will save a certain amount every month and ration the rest. This is probably not the best way to live but it has taught me how to be disciplined. As my salary increases, my savings per month also goes up proportionally.   
But if I do a breakdown, it would be something like this: 
GA 275 
TV, Internet, home phone 100 
Mobile 10 
Food 400 
Utilities 50 
Misc 250 
Total: 1085 == round up to 1100 excluding rent   
Ways I save... 
- Shop near closing for 50% off stickers 
- Keep over 7500 in your post finance account (or 10k with UBS) and you will incur no monthly fees 
- Don't own a car 
- Outdoor activities   
I grew up in extreme poverty so I am used to being thrifty.   After fixed and variable costs, saving around 40% of net income.

			I hold a Swiss passport and am about to transfer back to Zurich (for good) after 6.5 years in Dublin and have a question regarding pension transfer;   
If I choose to retain the Irish SCSB right to a tax free lump sum at age 50 (I have an option to waive this right for reduced tax liability in Ireland before I leave) the Irish pension provider, should I choose to transfer the value to Switzerland, will include details about the tax free lump sum portion at age 50.   
I am trying to understand whether it is worth paying additional tax now to avail of this tax free benefit at age 50 (I'm 45 currently) - but I am unable to find out which, if any, Swiss pensions honour this sort of arrangement (my Irish provider suggests yes, but I can find nothing via Google to confirm...).   
Any ideas? I have to make a choice by close of business tomorrow!   
Thanks, Richard

How does one get treated for CH tax purposes if only I become a resident of Switzerland (e.g., my spouse does not join me in CH during my initial 2 year contract).    
Do I just get treated as a single person? Or, a joint declaration is filed to include spouse's US income (and US taxes paid), so I can enjoy the MFJ rate?

And even if it was possible why would you want to be at the mercy of the markets and the bank exchange rates and fees for every single direct debit that you have set up on your account in the UK???    
Transfer money to the UK through a broker. I use  , they specialise in this sort of thing and you can choose when you want to transfer and agree a rate that you are happy with, 70 pips or less and no fees. Many other brokers are out there, I have posted many times about this so you can just search and you shall find.

From the IRS ( ) 
""The aggregate value of all foreign financial accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time during the calendar year to be reported.""   
Even worse, this includes accounts that you don't actually control, like renter's accounts, since you are defined as having ""a financial interest"" in the account (you get interest, you get statements once a year on the account).  However, you can differentiate these accounts on the form (TD F9022.1), for example saying ""account opened by landlord, no signature authority"" on a renter's account.   
(As an American who has lived here for 6 years, gotten married to a Swiss man and had two kids, I know way too much about the US tax code.  Yuck).

			I've ordered from AllSaints in the UK and their system kindly removed the VAT for shipping to Switzerland, so by the time I'd paid the import duty (and more importantly, and substantially) the admin fee, it was still less than the VAT. So that was a result. I don't know if ASOS does that.  Of course if you have to return anything, the postage may make it not worth it in the first place.   
Amazon parcels get through unscathed, but that'll be because they're always under the limit.

However it is not unusual to retain a significant debt on property even after retirement. 
You'll need to do simulations yourself, or else can a neutral tax advisor to help (getting your bank to help will not provide really neutral answers!)

Thanks - have a few friends in France who usually act as my depots but this is one case where I actually want the delivery to CH as it is cheaper then paying the (not very much cheaper) postage rate to France or Germany PLUS the VAT.  This website is well set up and as soon as I put in a CH address, the VAT disappeared (I find often you have to contact companies to get the VAT removed ... and woebetide if they've never done it before ... )which was almost exactly the same price as deliver to CH - so overall getting it at the same price as I would if I'd got it delivered in the UK (where postage is free but VAT is charged).

After all this, I suspect the easiest thing to do is to just withdraw a few thousand CHF with my American debit card and use it to set up a local deposit account with cash.    
Of course, once I start getting my paychecks, I still need to figure out how to wire money to the US, and how Swiss savings and investment accounts work...

			Sorry to hear this. You've been scammed by someone posing as an expert and, naturally, you believed what the so-called expert told you.    You paid the maximum amount because this is what he recommended? More money from you means more commission for him/his employer.   
Makes sense to start recording the phone calls/conversations.

3115	Financebankingtaxation	Strange deductions from bank account	silverburn	1090	1	Location: Unterageri	24.04.2012, 12:56	"    The second one is the tax deduction on interest due to you, which is 30% of interest paid on your balances, interest is calculated on closing daily balances and accumulated till the end of the year. Strange that it's done on a monthly basis, normally this is done at the end of the year.   
The first one I'm not sure about, maybe it's interest for when / if you've gone overdrawn for a day or two.

			Hi  
Thanks for taking the time to post but unfortunately none of these apply in my situation. I am pretty familiar with what happens with the customs applying tax but it's the incidences when either the service isn't physical or it hasn't been charged by customs that I am interested in... 
So it's more about what happens when your company accounts are checked... 
Thanks.   
PS I originally posted this in Business and Entreprenuer as it is very much a business rather than consumer question... the thread got moved, perhaps I didn't give it a good enough title... but I really need an answer from a business perspective...

			You say you are a US citizen, therefore, you are always a tax resident of the US irregardless of days spent in the US. You are fully subject to US Tax.    
The fact that you're telecommuting from Switzerland means that you are conducting business in Switzerland. You are taxable in Switzerland.    
This is a typical expat scenario. If you remain on US payroll, you need to fill out a Form 673 and request your Payroll manager from US Federal withholding. Also, have them turn off state withholding if you've broken state residency. If you don't do this, you will have cash flow issues.    
Side note: you risk the issue of having to pay Swiss social security if you don't apply for a certificate of coverage to exclude contribution on the Swiss side.   
You will pay taxes in Switzerland. On your US return, you will declare your world-wide income, exclude a portion of it under foreign earned income exclusion. The residual tax amount not excluded can be reduced through your foreign tax credit (granted that they relate to your foreign work days).    
FYI, you should let your company know that you're telecommuting from Switzerland. Depending on your role and responsibility, you may have created permanent establishment for your company in Switzerland.

Switzerland has decided to give in to demands by Britain to modify a planned bilateral tax treaty, after continued opposition to the accord.   
The finance ministry on Friday said both sides agreed to raise the minimum rate to legalise untaxed assets from 19 per cent and 34 per cent to between 21 per cent and 41 per cent, similar to a deal between Switzerland and Germany.   
The agreements still need approval by all the country’s parliaments in order to come into force next January.      "	Posts: 6	Join Date: Apr 2012	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

If I'm charged a fine for late submission I'll be having a chat with Colfina, I think a 60 day turnaround is too long, or clients should at least be warned in advance if that's going to be the case.

For example if BS tax you individually or jointly. In your circumstance it could well be beneficial to be jointly taxed.    
If you are EU then you have the right permit. If not then you do not unless your partner is Swiss.    
With respect to moving not being an option. Why don't you get on a tram and travel to Obi (Dreispitz) that is in Münchenstein... not exactly far but BL and hence reduced taxes...

Even when I file the return, I was told that my rate would not be recalculated for the first 6 months based on my Zug rate for the last 6 months. Bummer!

People can take 100% of Pillar 2 to buy their main home in CH or the EU without deductions. The same is true if the become 100% self employed & stay in CH.   
If you change job in CH 100% of Pillar 2 must be transfered to new employer or to your own fund if you dont have a new job to go to,   
Of course with Pillar 3 they may have been stuffed with life insurance so anything is possible.

			I think there is a bit of misinformation here.  I believe that in the case of a US person receiving US$, they can receive as much as the giver gives, but the donor (giver) has to take care of the taxes.  Right now, the amount tax free is $13,000.   
from the IRS website FAQs on gift taxes: 
Who pays the gift tax?        is the source   
but this is probably a moot point if both parties are here in CH?

			As mentionned before: usually you can't decide yourself which bank you want to use this has been decided for you already by the owner. Also the money will be blocked and you need the signature of the owner in order to transfer the money out of the account and this will only be done once the apartment has been handed over and no repairs etc. are outstanding. I had to wait nearly a year for my last deposit to be transferred to my bank account after I left the apartment. So it does not really make a difference what bank you use. Just use the one you're already in contact with.

			Hi!   
So, I have the Swiss Permit B since I am married to a Swiss citizen (we have been together for +8 years, married for +3 and I've had my permit since February 2011).   
I got admitted to a post-graduate school in the Netherlands and hoped that I would be getting scholarships. It seems that I will have to pay the full tuition and I was wondering if anyone knew if there is anywhere in Switzerland where I could get a student or personal loan. I would have my in-laws as guarantors.   
I have read other posts but they don't seem to help my specific case.   
Thanks for all the help...and enjoy Spring!!

On top of that they are on a B-permit here, so he/they must have an employer here and will probably pay tax (Qst anyone?).   
Somebody ""advised"" them that since hubby was in Angola for more than 183 days, he would not become taxable in Ch (which is wrong). Now OP may be faced with double taxation, which can add up.

Usually the Zurich tax office automatically extends the deadline for those who are taxed at source. The new deadline may also be printed on the main tax form at the bottom left corner - not so easy to find.

3161	Financebankingtaxation	Ball park on tax	neojynx	495	0	Location: Rennes, France	30.03.2012, 18:12	" 
			
			HI   
I currently live in France with a French family (wife, 2 kids) so we count a 3 people under the French tax scheme.   
I will be working in Geneva in a couple of weeks time on a 3 months contract.  Would there be any obvious advantages to living in France (ill have to move anyway, but leaving the family in Bretagne, so still paying rental on my house).  So was thinking of moving to another place in France near to Geneva, so stay under French tax scheme.   
Or would I be better moving and staying in Switzerland?   
I know it can get rather complicated, so looking for a high level answer if possible.   
thanks   
G

			The following applies for Zurich (probably is similar in other cantons):   
In order to ""overpay"" (or pay what you expect you owe due to changed circumstances, i.e. higher bonus, etc.) on the Federal Tax (Bundessteuer) you have to request a new payment slip. In essence you have to ask for a ""correction of the provisional invoice"".  
In Zurich you can do that online:    
For the Cantonal/Commune Taxes you can use the blank payment slip and pay what you think is about right. I am guessing if you really use it as a interim deposit (i.e. paying twice the amount of last year, etc. they'll probably give you a call).

As you have a return, you earn over 120k & there is a good chance you had a further liability. I assume you realise you are liable for WORLD WIDE income & there is also a wealth tax in CH.

3167	Financebankingtaxation	Are large money transfers to Germany taxed?	daninschweiz	972	0	Location: Zurich	27.03.2012, 13:10	" 
			
			Hi All, 
I am leaving Switzerland to move to Germany.  In my time here, I have built up some savings and would of course like to take it with me. 
Would I be taxed for transfering a relatively large sum of money to Germany (lets say over 10,000)?  I am not an EU or Swiss citizen if it makes any difference.  I would like to transfer it all in one go as the FX rate would be better but don't know if larger transfers attract attention so its better to break it up into smaller ones?

3174	Financebankingtaxation	Tax refund, taxed at source in Aargau	htliu	1781	0	Location: Untersiggenthal	25.03.2012, 01:40	" 
			
			I started to work in Aargau at the beginning of 2011 on a B permit. My salary was over 120K. My wife and son live with me, wife does not work and son goes to Kinderkrippe on a half-day basis. I have the following questions for 2011 tax. 
1) Do I need to file a tax declaration? The only document that seems to be tax-related that I have received is my salary certificate (Lohnausweis). 
2) It seems that I am eligible to get some tax back for being a non-christian and for expenses for my son's day care. What should be the Steuer Nr I should put in those tax reclaim forms? Can it possibly be my AHV Nr? In the tax reclaim form for child care expenses, it says in the beginning that each parent needs to complete one form. Should the expenses be split between the two forms? Since the spouse information is already there in the form, for each parent to fill a separate form does not make too much sense to me. 
3) Is there a deadline for such tax refund requests (Rückerstattungsgesuche)?   
Thank you very much for your help!

			I have the same experience; straight into your own bank account - you have a 'running' tax account with the tax authorities, your employer is just passing on the tax they deduct from your salary, but it doesn't work the other way around. So fill in your own account details and  - hopefully - you'll get a refund.

			It is actually quite straight forward: you go to the SVA and fill in the self-employment form, provide prove that you have customers (existing contracts are a plus) which includes having business cards and/or advertisements/pamflets showing what you work on, and then they approve that likely after some extra questions. They then send you a bill every 3 months for the percentage of AHV/EO/etc fees you have to pay,you pay that and done.   
Just pass by them with the details you have and they will help you out. From my experience the have quite friendl people there.   
As for taxes, you just fill in what you earned, provide copies of the separate bankaccount that you use for incoming payments (thus keeping private separate from business for clarity)and presto. Done.

			Why not give them the P60 ? Or ask your company to write out your salary statement for the period, showing deductions for social payments, NI etc.    
You can claim for everything here, they will tell you if it is inadmissable. You need an accountant: the first time at least.

			It's called  ""Kinderzulage"" and is paid by my husband's employer based on the amount of children we have.  We currently receive 1040 chf per month, for children ages 13, 15, 17, 19.  We still receive it for the older 2 because they are full-time students.  Once they do not work, we will not receive it.  They are both U.S. and Swiss citizens.  This money has nothing to do with interest income.     
I have been including it as earned income.  The irs website:       
lists 'family allowance' as an amount that should be included.     
However, I came across a forum of expats in Germany.  Some were advised to include it as income, some were advised not to.     
Just wondering if anyone here had additional information.

3197	Financebankingtaxation	Credit Score Rating/Agency in CH	tactica	4395	3	Location: Geneva	16.03.2012, 12:08	"    Well every credit card provider looks at the payment history differently, I mean if you have a good history of paying interest over a period of two years with a medium size balance then they would look at you like a cash cow generating money for them. if you are the type who spends money on the credit card regularly and pays it off at the end of every month, you might not look so good for a provider who wants to target customers of that kind but you will be quite favoured for a provider looking to get customers to increase their volume of transactions and hence the fees they get from retailers.   
It all depends on the provider's target customer base. So just using a credit card doesn't necessarily increase your likelyhood of getting a loan or a mortgage with others.

3198	Financebankingtaxation	Mutual Funds ROI	Trader J	3908	28	Location: Zurich	14.03.2012, 16:59	"     
Alpha should not be considered just returns above a benchmark. Firstly we are talking about EXCESS returns so the classical models say we adjust for risk free, but most importantly alpha is the excess return we have (the intercept on a regression model) when we take into account ALL RISK Factors.    
Don't get sucked in by a fund manager who has made 4% over risk free when the S&P has a return of 2% above risk free. Far more likely his return is some alternative source of beta rather than true alpha.   
Beta (market based returns) are still going to be the bread and butter of most peoples portfolios. That being the case the most sensible financial planning move most people can make is researching the cheapest way to take on this risk. ETFs are todays instrument of choice for that.

Which number should I report as my total foreign income, and which as foreign tax paid, in my Canadian tax forms?    
I heard that I also need to show proof to the Canadian government that I pay taxes in Switzerland. Will that exempt me from paying the Canadian taxes?   
Any experience or help is greatly appreciated!!

3209	Financebankingtaxation	pay taxes for property outside Switzerland?	elephant	5909	14	Location: BL	10.03.2012, 12:33	" 
			
			Definitely worth checking out with a tax advisor, as different cantons have different rules, but from my understanding the situation is as follows:   
* all income should be declared, as should your global wealth. These are taxed separately. Tax on fortune is really small (unless you are really, really wealthy - and they you should definitely be seeking professional advice  ) 
* Your income from movable assets (salary, dividends, etc) will all be put together to be taxed, irrespective of where it has come from (i.e. irrespective of which country it has been earned in) - however, you can also deduct tax paid, loan interest etc, etc. 
* Your income from immovable assets (property) is not taxed per se, but is taken into account when working out your tax rate. The tax rate you pay on your overall income goes up depending on how much you earn, so if you earn for example 50,000 CHF per annum you could be on 10% tax on that whole 50,000 CHF (these are made up figures by the way just to provide an example!). If you earned 75,000 CHF, your tax rate on the whole amount (not just the 25,000 over 50,000) could go up to say 20% (again - fictitious rates, but do note that the tax rate is not linear - it seems to go up exponentially after a while!). Again, you can discount things like mortgage interest, agent fees, repairs, etc.   
So, if in my fictitious example you earned 50,000 in a mixture of wages and dividends at a tax rate of 10%, but then earned an extra 25,000 from property overseas, you would end up paying 20% tax on your 50,000 CHF instead of 10% - so it is really a stealth tax   even though you would not be officially ""taxed"" on your 25,000 CHF of property income.    
With regard to past tax returns, I had no idea about this when I got to Switzerland (was being taxed at source) and only found out after two years that if your assets are over a certain amount (not that high if you own property) you should actually do a normal tax return - at least in Geneva, so we got an accountant to help us do backdated tax returns for 2008 and 2009. The GVA tax authorities were all ok with it - I think they are generally fine if a genuine mistake that someone is trying to rectify.

3210	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss inheritance law applied to American with dual Swiss citizenship	bmjnyc	3673	5	Location: fribourg	10.03.2012, 20:23	"    You have two separate issues here: inheritance law and tax law.     
(1) Inheritance law (and how a will should be written) is a state (not federal) matter.  If your mother does not have a will (valid per the law of the state where she resides), then the state will determine which heirs get what percentage(s).  You do not, ever, want to be in that situation.   
(2) Any ""US person"" under the tax code (which includes anyone holidng a ""green card"") is subject to federal estate tax.  There is no choice in the matter.  (Some states may levy an estate tax, a further complication.)      The attorney & your mother are simply wrong. You do not have a choice about making Swiss law apply to a US resident.    
However, you can (and should) have your mother go to a US attorney in her state of residence, and draw a will, for the reasons I noted above.   
Via careful planning (e.g. using gifts or a trust), much of the estate tax can be legally avoided.

Of course, it being about 250 of German MWST, that'll be about 150CHF Swiss MWST when you declare your import of whatever you've bought.

			Folks,   
From searching the forum, I've understood that profits on share trading are added to income and taxed as such. Since I lost money through (private) trading last year (can't be the only one in 2011   ), are there any options to deduct losses from taxable income or do they only classify it as money that's already been through the taxation system? Not huge amounts (and yes, I did sell the shares purchasing others instead so it is ""hard"" cash, not paper losses) but always looking for options to reduce tax. Based in Geneva.

			You can't claim the payments as you live in the EU, but when you are 62 years old you can apply for a Swiss pension (I assume you are female), you can do this in English via your home national pensions office.    
If you gave us your last Swiss home address, we could also give you the address of the pension office here. Then you could write and ask for a statement of your account. But as I say, this isn't necessary, as DHSS Newcastle or Dublin process your application.

			""My personal opinion on technical analysis is that it doesn't work and if it did it would prove that markets are not even weak form efficient. It's easier to make a model fit the facts ex-post, but far harder to predict the future. "" 
Right on! 
I have a personal belief in the markets that just because things are the way they were before, does not mean that, that is a pure indicator the way things will be. I find it more true to analyze for example, what a stock may do with government intervention. Everyone says helping a stock/company is in effect nationalizing a company, but this is not communism. I look to back in the 80's when the US gov't intervened and came to the rescue of Chrysler, and Lee Iacoca's plan for the company, and how people rallied behind this company. And how Carl Icahn came in and started buying up shares. Where did Chrysler's stock price go? Now we all know where it went last year, or rather after it was bought off of Daimler, but there was room to sell it from the 80's til then. Then I look at Citigroup, and the government intervention, and the stakes taken by Paulson and the Saudi prince whose name I cannot remember, and efforts by Pandit, Geithner, and so on. This is the type of data I think, that is in the past, could be useful now. Not candlesticks, head and shoulders, etc.   
I remember as soon as the market started rallying every single analyst they could find and still now they were talking about what letter recovery this was going to be, a U, V, W, L, M. All this kind of talk is useless.       was ""calling"" the market crash, in effect 2 years out, but so was I. I am not a college professor, but I don't understand why no one else saw this coming. I thought everyone did. Now, my father's an economist, and we discuss this kind of thing often, but all the info was out there for everyone to see. You didn't need to dig thru any secret files in a library somewhere. Except, you had for every 1 analyst saying the market was going down 1000 saying that oil was going to 200 a barrel. Based on what? Candlesticks? What the market had done the last 12 months? If we used that sort of reasoning to predict the future, and allow the markets to trend on it, we would be at 500 dollars a barrel of oil, regardless of demand or what people can actually pay based on their salaries and what they need to live. It's why I don't listen to analysts except when they are all bandwagoning, and then I need to look at the opposite of what they are chiming on about. And I don't buy/read how-to investing books. The only way I invest is with alot of research, and I have to believe the company's fundamentals  are strong, they have as low debt as possible, their shares are not too diluted, they are not in markets that have bad exposure, I can get a decent leverage, and of course, most importantly, they have a quality product/s.    
I have watched the markets since I was a kid. For the last 5 or so years daily. I keep notes on what I see, if I see a company outside in the real world I hadn't heard of before, I write it down, especially if I suddenly see alot of their trucks on the road, or their product being sold. And if I were to have day traded with about 5000/USD to use, I would have made a very nice sum. But I do have to work, and it's not an option so far. I think a trader has to take a pint of fear with their daily bread to be trading. Being arrogant or otherwise is foolish. I think steel nerves or some 18 year scotch is the alternative. Because trading a stock purely on technicals, and not knowing anything about the state of the companies affairs, it bald face stupidity. I do know some ""tricks"" to maximize buying and selling stock, which I think anyone who trades already knows...   
Never buying a stock at the opening bell, unless it's a pharma. Wait 15 minutes or so for the profit takers to drive down the upsurge. 
Never buy a pharma on good news unless you are planning to sell it in 30 minutes after you buy it. Pharmas should always be bought before anyone else knows them, or at the beginning of the rumour, buying on the news are for those really the last to arrive at the party. If you think that there is still room to grow, buy it the next day or late in the afternoon. 
Bankruptcy filings. This is a good way to make some quick cash. People are naive. I made this mistake once on a low leverage company I had bought. When a company files for bankruptcy, it should not be too big of a suprise. Don't sell with the rest of the sheep. Wait until the next day. People usually sell at whatever they can get for it because they think that the stock is immediatly worthless. It will be eventually, but not today. You might be selling at a loss, but not selling it for nothing. Now, when a company files for bankruptcy, there is a segment of the population out there that thinks that they are going to be rich, because, for some strange reason this stock is selling so low, or in bankruptcy proceedings the common share holder is going to come out on top. They are normally wrong. But buying a stop as a short, you can profit off the morons. Look at Washington Mutual. It's a Zombie stock. It's the value of the paper, not assests. It went down to .05 euro and should have gone to the grave, but for awhile it traded up to .10 to .13 to .20, and last month it went as high as .50 euro cents. And if you check the message boards they are on fire with all this speculative talk. Worthless talk, and worthless paper. But when there is a rumor or the hopes that a bankrupted stock will go up...Other examples....Arcandor, South Texas Oil, Visteon, GM. They all had this upsurge. First the no-holds barred sell off, then the speculation.    
I am rambling now. So I will stop myself.

			I think you've misunderstood this a little bit.   
The 3 pillar pension system here is all tax deductible, i.e you can use that to reduce your taxable income.   
1st Pillar is the AHV or the social security contributions, this is deducted at source for all employees and is available for the self employed on a volunatary basis I believe.   
2nd Pillar is the BVG, which is also deductible at source and is offered by employers, where they also contribute a similar amount to the one deducted from you. (not all employers have this)   
3rd Pillar is a volunatary contribution into basically a locked savings account where the interest is paid without witholding tax, and is taxed at a favourable rate (no idea exactly but there is a calculator somewhere) which is solely dependant on the amount saved within it at the time of cashout.   
However, the third pillar concept has two parts a and b, one is tax deductible and the other not, and is simply a savings account,  basically something like if you want to have some extra money when you retire just shove it in a bank account somewhere.   
The monies put in the 3rd pillar account can not be used to trade securities by yourself, however you can opt for a managed securities account with a predefined level of risk etc. I personally have never bothered. It is also worth noting that you can take the money out when you leave the country or use it as a security / pledge towards a deposit in a purchase of a property or when starting a business.   
This is how I understand it, there might be some bits that might not be 100% but this is the general jist of things.

			I update this topic about tax deductions to ask about ""¾ de la déduction pour personne à charge"".   
We discussed with my colleague who was told that a ""personne à charge"" can not be his wife, not working.   
Does anyone knows what qualifies for a ""Personne a charge""?   
PS: I asked the tax man by email as they are impossible to join on the phone, he sent me 2 emails, once saying ""it counts"" once saying ""it does not counts"" (no explanations given). And the description is very unclear...   
Thanks

			Hi EF,   
For anyone interested or didn't know here is the form that people can use to claim some money back (if applicable) from their taxes for 2011.   
The for is for those living in BS but I am sure if you google it you can find the forms for other cantons.     
On a side note, does anyone know if I have to send in copies of my Lohnausweis and receipts for transportation and further education courses with the form or do they just look for them later?

3243	Financebankingtaxation	Leaving Switzerland and taking my pension fund	Dack Rambo	8836	35	Location: Switzerland	08.11.2011, 17:18	"    Assuming you mean a company pension - 2nd pillar - its all very automatic and straightforward. Give them a ring and give them a heads-up that you're leaving shortly and they should be able to give you a rough value, and then send them your deregistration letter once you've deregistered from the commune/gemeinde.   
Withholding tax will be payable based on the canton in which your pension scheme is incorporated. If its in a higher tax canton, or it's a large amount, you can move the money into a vested benefit account in a low tax canton and then cash it out from there. We moved hubby's scheme from... um... Bern, I think, to a UBS vested benefit account which is incorporated in... um... Basel, possibly. It wasn't the cheapest possible place, but it was super simple as we already had a relationship with UBS, and it saved us around 1k in tax so was worth filling in a form.   
Otherwise, you can just ask the pension fund to pay it out as cash into a bank account of your choice. You'll need to provide notorised permission of your spouse if married; the pension scheme will send you a form and you just take it into a notary and have them countersign it.

Does yours not have this?   
I really like having a Raiffeisen account, if for nothing else but the Museumpass option. I estimate that we easily save CHF 400 a year on entrance fees. As long as one thinks of it as a credit union (which it is) rather than a conventional bank such as UBS, it makes it easier to understand why they do some things in seemingly strange ways, such as the fact that different branches can have different rates for interest-bearing accounts.   
Just my two Rappens.

3249	Financebankingtaxation	Tax Change from ZH to Thalwil	CornishPasty	1791	2	Location: Horgen	24.02.2012, 11:55	"    I assume by ZH you meant Zurich city?   
Tax deduction/withholding at source is based on the standard tables provided by each canton.  In your case, the tables provided by Canton of Zurich.  There is NO difference in the withholding wherever in Canton Zurich.  The withholding is based on canton average and will not change just because you move from the city to Thalwil.  If you earn more than 120k a year, then you'll eventually be filing your tax and you'll pay the difference or receive a refund.  If you're under 120k, you can still file for an adjustment, though not required.   
However, since your move from Zurich city to Thalwil involves no change of canton, you will NOT be benefiting from the lower tax rate in Thalwil for 2012.  For the entire year of 2012, you will be treated for tax purpose as someone living in Zurich city.  The lower tax in Thalwil will only kick in beginning in 2013.  This is how it works with the tax code.  Unless you move to a difference canton later in 2012, you'll be taxed as Zurich city, not Thalwil.   
ps. If you do change canton during the year, then it's pro-rated.  Within the same canton, it's based on where you live/register on 1/1/xxxx of the year.     
Sorry for the bad news!

Your normal annual pay of 80k. Plus the extra 20k for that month x 12 months = 240k.

The person writing these emails is either a) totally incompetent, b) trying to fob you off for an easy life, or c) both.   
Don't take this lightly, and don't drop it until you are completely satisfied it is resolved. An email will not carry as much (if any) weight with a court as a hand-signed letter, should it get that far. If they're prepared to threaten a legal process in writing, they also need to withdraw that threat in writing. Stop sending emails to them, all your correspondence should be by registered letter, and keep a copy of everything for yourself. Escalate it if you're not getting what you want, find the CEO's name if you need to.   
I know all this may sound over the top, but stand your ground - you've got a lot to lose, they've got nothing. There's no point taking chances with this.

He forgets to mention following things:   
 - a study from Vontobel showed that coop has a higher margin (10.7%) than most retailers in Europe (Tesco, Carrefour and Migros).    
- Coop bought TransGourmet last year and this had an impact on the profitability.   
It's always easier to play it soviet-style economy: controlling consumer's freedom. Use consumer as scapegoat instead of pointing own bad management decision on the timing of buying TransGourmet.

I have my vested account benefits at chaeis.ch that was transferred from my prior employer in Switzerland to them because I had not had enough time to open an account at a bank instead to get it transferred.   
From my understanding, the way this works is that I cannot touch the money until after I leave Switzerland to go back home... If this is true, what is the process to conduct this ""withdrawal"", and what paperwork do they normally need? If not true, what is the process for that because I would like to buy a home.   
I also ask because I have contacted them before about the matter, but nobody there can give me a clear answer other than to contact my commune and do it through them... But that makes no sense?!

			Thanks to everyone for your responses and getting me back on the right path. After looking at the calendar, I can use the automatic extension overseas residents get which goes until June 30th. Since I moved here July 6th of 2011, I will meet the physical presence test before the deadline and get a small refund.  Through gritted teeth I will follow the IRS rules and obey like a good little citizen. Again thanks for all those sane folks who slapped a bit of sense into me. I was getting that ""F the Man"" feeling and I needed to be talked down. At least I can buy a nice plate of rosti and a beer with the refund....maybe.

			I believe this is what you were looking for (on federal level).    
This is regulated in an act (Bundesgesetz über die direkten Bundessteuern (DBG), direkte Bundessteuern = direct federal taxes). But I agree with the others above: get a qualified answer by a professional if it's that important to you otherwise you just use a calculater and you enter different salaries and will see how the rates changes. It's no rocket sience after all!

			Make sure to go to the main branch for your bank, even if it means you've got to travel a bit. If your own bank won't do it, you might want to give one of the big commercial banks a try, or even one of the cantonal banks - even if you don't have an account there. They may accept it, or at least be able to tell you how to cash it.

			I opened an account at UBS and they allowed me to deposit a check from the US account into my new swiss account.  the rate was not that bad and the funds only took a few days to clear.  The bank tellers are not all familiar with the process, so you may have to ask your account officer to explain it to them - but it was really pretty painless.

			The approximate 25% overall deduction info you received from HR is pretty accurate. I'm in a similar situation to what you've quoted living in Vaud, being single with no dependents.   
As for receiving a tax refund it depends on the individual situation so no one here can really tell you what you may or may not receive. I have received a refund in the past but again it depends on what you can claim as an expense when you file your return.

If nobody else knows your username and password and your iphone is stolen then there is no chance they can trigger the sms from the iphone.

If you're serious about earning miles and depending on your spending habits you may want to keep some of the foreign issued credit cards.

Examples: an IRA account is in  group (a), a pension plan or social security account is in group (b).   
So, the issue if very simple: who holds the funds (is the custodian) for  a ""2nd pillar"" account, and can the beneficiary (your wife) change that  custodian, or change the investment of funds?  (""Yes"" to either = you  should file the FBAR; ""no"" to both = don't file.)   
The IRS has not issued a formal opinion on CH pensions, and pensions are  not explicitly addressed in the FBAR form instructions.  In practice,  that means the IRS is not about to prosecute folks on this matter.

			How to declare this situation in tax returns.   
I opted to receive x number of shares at a reduced rate instead of dividend, when that option was offered to me ...   
But the company who issued these shares, first credited the dividend money into my bank account (with 35% tax deducted - company in France) and then debited the remaining amount the same day and issued me in shares (like I wanted).   
Should I declare like I received dividend or shares?   
Thanks in advance once again.

3301	Financebankingtaxation	Trusts for children	nicnac	1888	12	Location: Zug	30.03.2010, 18:34	"    Birth in the UK is not a criterion, rather eligibility for child allowances. Once that eligibility ceases, typically because of removal from Britain (but otherwise because a parent becomes a diplomat, member of Visiting Forces, etc.) the trust fund eligibility remains. The further payment of £250 at 7 years of age is likewise based on the child allowance roster. As, for that matter, is the issuance of a national insurance number at age 16.   
One can argue about the politics of this, but like so much of modern Britain it seems to have been modelled in a sense after the American sec. 529 tax-free college savings plans. The UK Government has for some time been trying to make university more costly. While at the same time, unfortunately, diminishing its quality and its value.

			Forgive me for I'm rather new to all this. I've read       on the subject, but I may have a bit more of an opportunity to nip any problems in the bud.   
As it stands, I have a Bank of America account. I have just landed a UN consultancy in Geneva.    
One of my first questions to HR was whether or not I need to open a Swiss bank account, which I have come to understand can be quite a challenge for Americans. The response was ""If you already have a bank account elsewhere, it's ok, glad you mentioned it. Please bring your IBAN on your first day.""   
Of course, US banks do not have IBAN numbers (although I do have the required details).    
Also, international wire transfers will cost me USD$16 which I'd like to avoid.   
What option makes the most economic sense?    
1. Trying to open a bank account in Switzerland. 
2. Trying to transfer money to my BofA account. 
3. Trying to see if it is possible to deposit money into my girlfriend's Swiss bank account. 
4. ??????   
Any help greatly apprec'd!!     
EDIT: I am just remembering that I also have a Barclays account. Perhaps this will be my best option... 
EDIT: Never mind, my questions have been answered.

I'm working for a company which doesn't have an office/entity in Switzerland and I've been told by the tax office that I therefore need to sort out my own BVG cover. I've tried Googling for providers and have contacted half a dozen. All say they will not do this for an individual and that I either need to form a company here or go to the Stiftung Auffangeinrichtung (which apparently is not very good?). Does anyone know of an alternative provider to aeis which would provide this service? Also interesting would be to hear what is so unattractive about aeis.

			No they don't need the internal phone book.....It is simple to get hold of people's  extension numbers and target the main person of interest. You just need to have no life at the weekend or evenings.....it goes like this.   
Some poor sod needs to make appointments with some nice expats, so they stay behind at work after hours and call the main companies in the area knowing that no-one will be there to answer their calls. The calls then simply go through to voicemail, where the nice expat announces their name and asks them to leave a message, which they don't, they just make a note of the extension number they dialled and your name.  The poor soul will sit there for hours dialing in different combinations of the base phone number with different extension numbers fishing for the expats numbers. Simple and effective.

His friend on the other side of the road does qualify in Arlesheim. Your Gemeinde can give you a contact number to speak with the education dept or I agree the school will inform you if you are eligible, I guess something to think about when renting here especially if you have more than one child in the Private system.

			I believe that the reason your wifes pays this much taxes is because you and your wife are treated ""in terms of income"" as one entity.   
If your annual income (both together) exceeds 120,000 CHF per year, then the tax curve increases dramatically.

FWIW, in general, it's been shown that choosing a nice indexed fund often performs better than if you'd listened to 'financial advisors'. There are ways of doing 'socially responsible investing', but you really really need to do your research if you are going to be investing in that way. Otherwise, you might as well just head down to Italy with sacks of cash and start handing out money to random strangers. That way, you'll have more effect on the life of the average Italian than if you lost your money to the bankers. As an after thought: 6% yield over five years? I'm sorry, to me that sucks as a rate of return, especially for someone who seems to be non-risk-averse. .

			For those of us interested in having 3a pillar accounts, which help you save 2k max per year on tax if you are a normal employee, and you want to know how much cash you will have to pay on taking out money, go to       
It is the fisca 3a pillar calculator, you will need to enter where you live, as your tax depends on your kanton and gemeinde.   
It works quite neatly, and shows you for example how little you need to pay if you withdraw small amounts, i.e., it was 3.74% for 20k and 4.8 % for 60k for my kanton, in any case much less than the advertised 7 percent.

			You are liable to tax for income arising in the UK.   
In simple terms, how that is taxed depends on your total taxable income arising in the uk. The basic rate band until April 5 is up to 35k,  gains upto this amount, less the annual exemption of 10.6k are taxed at 18%  and 28% on anything over and above.   
However it depends how much money you are making, and whether your income falls into different rate bands as to how you want to allocate your exemption in terms of limiting the damage at 28%.   
You are not entitled to exemption if your non uk Domiciled though

There are private debt collecting agencies, and they have their black lists, maybe your credit card company can help you find one?

It depends on the country. I've done the same in Australia, France and Germany and its a bit different everytime. In Australia there is a little booth at the airport where you bring your receipts from the last 30days and then get your GST back in cash. In Germany you need to have a form form the shop, take it to the borderpost to have it stamped and then TAKE IT BACK to the orignial shop - which means you need to travel to the country at least twice.    
I'd suggest contacting the greek customs authority to see how the process works exactly.

			I think that Lob is referring to all tax and monthly deductions when he mentions 25%. I certainly never received a single tax bill that was anywhere near 25% of my salary. But if I were to count in the monthly deductions (AHV etc) then I could see it creeping up to around that point.   
My advice to you is not to worry until you've spoken to someone about your last tax return. I honestly don't think it will be as bad as you think.

			It sounds as though you are currently ""resident"" in Switzerland. In that case if you're bringing the bike in, you're actually importing it as opposed to a tourist bringing it in for a short period. 
That being said, when you first came to Switzerland you presumably made an inventory of goods that you submitted to customs when you arrived. You should be able to go back to the customs office where you submitted the inventory and have the bike added, particularly if you can prove that it was already yours when you orginally came into the country. 
It that's too much bother, you can try bringing it in as a tourist (could be tricky), or just declare it. You'll end up paying customs duties (based on the weight, but probably not very much) and VAT (8%) on its current value. You'll probably end up paying rather less than the airline charges you for the freight.

			If you do not have a LOT of coins, wouldn't it be better just to use them while doing you grocery shopping. Atleast I reduced my coin count this way. Just take same denomination coins and of a fixed amount and then give it at the counter after your shopping. If you do not mix denominations, it is easier for the cashier to count it as well as it is not very slow that the people behind you in line start groaning you   "	Posts: 8	Join Date: Nov 2009	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			You can transfer your money electronically back to your home country 
online.  After all the money is transferred just send a message via their 
web site asking them to close the account for you.   
They should tell you what to do.  You don't care about closing the account, 
you care about getting your money.  And that you can do online for sure.

			Incidentally, even if you do submit a tax declaration but earn under 120k, then the Gemeinde can refuse to process it (because you do not go over 120k).   
KPMG warned me about that for my Gemeinde; fingers crossed hoping to get a few thousand back.

			Small 1gramme bars of gold are a safe bet, they work out at about 60-63 each but I have bartered them for goods well worth over 100, people love shiny things especially when they are not near a computer to check rates or have no idea of the value, or in 99.99% cases would never imagine a gold swap. (keep them in the sleeves they come in with certification).    
They are also very easy to store, you can't chip bits of larger bars, if you do you will lose purchasing power either by giving too much away or by ruining the original...   
50K will get you around 800 bars...   
My faith in banks and money is almost non existent these days, portable barter-able wealth is king !

			Hello, 
unfortunate thing happened to me - I followed advices of our local shop about some ski-touring boots size for me, and ordered ones online in Germany. And, unfortunately, the shoe I ordered & arrived is too small for me. If I decide to do a switch with the shop via mail, how will the VAT & import be handled?  
I am going to pay it for whole package that came (handling bill from UPS did not come yet), but I really do not want to pay some crazy import to Germany and then again import to Switzerland.  
And one more question - is there any recommended way to send (UPS,..?) it or is Swiss post good enough? The Post has advantages of having branches all over the place.

I will probably call the quellensteuer to confirm, and I would recommend you do the same in Basel.

Say one has 5000 before, and another 5000 during, and the other 10000 before and 10000 during, they will end up with 5000+7500=12500 and 10000+7500=17500 respectively.

I'd be going to Australia, which means that not only would I have to pay a fee to send my money to the new account (which I don't want, as I'm tired of paying the rip off fees of paypal) AND I'd have to convert currency (paypal rates are you usually worse that real rates so I'd lose money). Added to that, I'll be in transit for two months before reaching Australia, and I need the money because I actually want to spend it before getting there.

			Hi All,   
For the past few years, Ive been dealing with a large accounting firm who primary goal seemed to be to simply fill in the forms and collect a hefty fee without providing any additional value added. Needless to say this is rather unsatisfying and they will no longer be getting my business.   
I am now looking for a very good tax advisor/planner/preparer who can cover expat taxation situations for US citizens. I want an individual/firm who is proactive and will provide sound advice. Any recommendation/suggestions you can provide are greatly appreciated !   
Thanks in advance.

			I have a B permit and have both the miles and more AMEX and MasterCard - and folks you're seriously not missing out.  Here's a list of the issues I've had with both cards.    
1. Both get blocked on a regular basis (every 2 months or so) for no reason.   
2. When I travel the cards are blocked every single time, even if I call ahead and tell them where I am going to be on which date.    
3. It took at least 6 months to sort the billing, and I was told not to pay as they would fix it yet I was being sent malnung after malnung.   
4. For 3 years my miles were going unrecorded because they were not linking up to my mileage account as my passport name was different than my credit card name. I finally figured it out after asking for months for my M&M pin number.   
5. My credit card number was stolen somehow and I was only notified almost 3 weeks after unauthorized transactions were made, adding thousands of francs to my bill. And now they are saying it takes 6-8 weeks to sort.   
It is literally the. worst. card. ever, but I still use it as I've finally built enough miles for a return ticket to north America.    
Honestly, you're not missing out on the CS card people.

3409	Financebankingtaxation	What do you do with Your MONEY?	EPMike	3270	41	Location: Albis area	01.12.2011, 14:41	" 
			
			People have mutliple approaches. People with loads of Money give it to some Swiss / International money managers.   
Smart people with relatively less money handle it themselves by investing it selectively into Stocks and commodities.   
There are people who don't bother or want to actively track and play the market so they keep them in deposits.   
I personally think in todays situation in Switzerland Deposits are ridiculous. Playing in stock is not advisable unless you think you are one of those smart people who can track and play it.   
If you have loads of money couple of millions or above then give it to banks so that they can manage to earn the service fee which keeps the larger part of professional community employed.   
I think selective long term buying in  Commodity (Oil) and Precious metal is good but then not a guarantee. There are good companies out there with reasonable dividend yields and returns but could fall prey to market fluctuations.

			Depending on what it is that you bring paying the 8% often means you are still ahead. I recently got a bike in germany which was easily over the limit paid the tax which was only 65CHF  but knowing the bike was close to 50% of the same bike in switzerland it meant I was happy.   
You mention buying electical items which is interesting although my comment is more specific to computing electronics. I find these are as cheap in CH as anywhere in europe even with the VAT removed. Other electicals are probably cheaper such as general household items and remember to add the cost of adding a converter plug to be able to plug the crazy UK plugs in which are one of the most impratical plugs known to mankind.

			before you go any further, are you sure:   
1) you want to be in debt? For 5 years ? 
2) your investment is going to work - what % return per year will you really get? It has to be at least double the interest you will pay to make it worth it. 
3) you can really afford to pay back the credit EVERY month?    
Maybe you have considered it at length, but if not...   
you can PM me if you want to be discrete....

3419	Financebankingtaxation	New here, advice appreciated!	CGJ7755	2602	20	Location: United States	25.11.2011, 18:02	"     
Thanks. Love you too...   
No, seriously, i have to say I really didnt quite understand the benefits of Swiss Bank accounts initially.    
Im not making any extravagant claims, and I'm not trying to cheat the tax system. I pay my taxes on time every single year, although I do look to take advantage of any tax write offs and credits.    
Im not a millionaire by any stretch... just trying to find a way to earn a good return on my money  have sitting in a checking account, that gets 2.5% interest right now. I figured if there was a swiss money market that paid 5%+ fixed It would be worth it to put 10 or 20 thousand USD in it, since I'm earning half as much over here.    
As the last week of research has shown me, I'm not thinking this is possible, and it is a waste of my time, but a good learning experience.   
Im going back into picking a few stocks, mutual funds, and series I savings bonds.

3423	Financebankingtaxation	VAT question for UK furniture purchases	Swisstobe	4160	9	Location: Basel	22.11.2011, 18:46	" 
			
			We have bought furniture in the EU as well (Germany, Holland, France).    
It's easiest if you let the seller arrange transport, for example with an international moving company who will handle all the paperwork at the border.    
Furniture shop then gives you a bill excl. VAT and incl. transport. Shipping company declares the goods at the border, customs will send you an invoice for 8% Swiss VAT + handling fee (less than 50 CHF).    
We have never paid any duties or other fees, and our deliveries were also 2000-3000 CHF worth of heavy, solid wood furniture.      
It's very straightforward, no hassle at all

3424	Financebankingtaxation	Best ebanking - accurate and on the spot ? (not PostFinance please)	mihai	4063	18	Location: Fribourg	23.10.2011, 15:34	" 
			
			Dear OP, as you're already with Postfinance they also have a debit card linked to your existing e-finance for 50 CHF a year. You can load it up to 5k and transfer it back to your CHF account too. For instant balances you can subscribe to their SMS service per payment, so it acts as an instant debit card (with mastercard).    
Regarding RON transactions I'd recommend getting a linked EUR account. This can also come with a cashcard. Transfers to your EUR/CHF account online have better spreadrates than at the ATM.   
You could then transfer as SEPA free in EUR to a Romanian EUR account and then transfer in ROL to your ROL account at home.   
In Postfinance transfers to/from your EUR account are instant. To SEPA normally within 3 days, sometimes 1.   
Finally try not to rely on your online account as an instant budgeting tool. Rather have a separate budgeting tool on your computer/phone. More boring I agree. UBS' account used to come with Quicken software, not sure if it still does.    
Personally I use MoneyBook, Saver and YNAB on my iPhone to track spend against budget categories   "	Posts: 22	Join Date: May 2011	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			If you are still in Paris then you have time if you are already back in Switzerland then too late.   
What you need to do is get the forms stamped at the Swiss border when leaving France then depending on the type of place you have purchased from you go to Global Refund offices (or post to them) to get the refund. In some cases the way to get the refund is you need to go back to the store you purchased from buit this really depends on the arrangement where you purchased.

			You will normally receive the tax return forms sometime in February. For someone who is employed normally, they are usually easy enough to fill in yourself. Things get a bit more complicated if you own property, i.e. the flat or house you live in, but it remains doable (the really confusing thing is the valeur locative / Eigenmietwert). 
If you are self-employed it becomes significantly more complicated and it is probably wise to have a professional do it with you, at least the first couple of times, on top of which, they should be able to advise on other issues related to taxation. The same is true if own other property, property in different cantons, have more complicated financial affairs, etc.

			Don't complicate your life, these things happen.    
I would suggest you send a letter addressed to the Accountant (his office) explaining that you are a client and you wish that the person(s) that are looking after his affairs contact you as soon as possible to decide on what would be the best way to proceed (i.e. get your file(s) back or meet with someone who is taking over his practice to do the necessary paperwork so they can represent you with the tax office).   
I suggest you start with this rather than running to the tax office which would be more complicated.

Once SNB established the minimum of 1,2 EURCHF there is no point about keep my CHF waiting for better exchange rate. 
So, I think in my investments in EUR.      Already asked, nobody knows.  
The way how taxes are charged on coupon is not the same as dividends? If so, filling the tax return makes it possible to avoid double taxing. Isn't it?        
If the Euro collapses it's better to hide in a bunker and worry about surviving, not about money.   
Swiss bonds have very low returns. I'm young, I can take more risk.

Contact me in private if you need some info - I relocated in ZRH from Italy last year and after a few months I have I'd say a quite good understanding of all the intricacies.

OK - Mr Macho - so if I said, I want the house price to be CHF5000 higher to buy it, is that better than saying ""If I can make this go away, neither of us pay anything?""

			In a similar situation as Chast - non-resident, coming in on a B licence, working for local company, subject to PAYE. Did anyone figure out how things work with social and pensions contributions? I don't have a place in Switzerland (staying in hotels) so technically I don't have a Swiss address. I figured I am only liable for taxes and nothing more. Am I right?

			I found out that the extra payment into pension fund is then blocked for the next three years. So pay attention if you plan to leave CH soon....I think an extra payment just for the sake of tax saving is not possible. Correct me if I am wrong.    
And one needs to do tax return too to claim back the tax. For witholding tax it is usually not necessary....   
Seems only 3a is the best option then to offset tax in CH....

			There is a new website/service that takes care of most of the issues regarding tax/social security/insurance etc.        
I haven't tried it out yet but it looks all right. They take a 8.4% commission, which doesn't seem too bad considering the hassle you would otherwise have to do it on your own.   
And the Website is even in English :-)   
P.S.: The service seems quite new so I'd be interested to hear of anyone who has actually used it.

Does anyone know whether you can tick the ""I am a UK taxpayer"" box for donations if you have paid UK tax during the fiscal year, but are now living, and paying taxes abroad.    
For (a very obvious...) example, I moved here in July and therefore paid UK tax for 4 months whilst I was employed in the UK.   
I have so many friends who are doing   and I'm planning to show support for all the hard work and training that they are putting in   I have made a few donations for other things since I moved here and always assumed that they wouldn't be Gift Aid-able, but thought that it was worth asking on the off-chance!

The duty for your object should be between CHF 41.- and CHF 54.- / 100 kg gross weight, but then you still might have expenses for the Phytosanitary check (if requested by customs, likely) VAT and the fees for your customs agent, unless you handle it on your own..

			Bank of America sux. I get paid in the US on my projects with US companies & they charged me US$12 for very transfer from within the US. These weren't even international transactions. It's not a direct deposit per say as it's not a regular salary but something I invoice. I would sometimes invoice US$150-200. So that's almost 10%.    
I moved to Charles Schwab who not only doesn't charge this stupid fee, they also don't charge any fees for ATM transactions in the US or internationally, plus they reverse charges made by other banks.

			For the future, you may want to consider banking with a bank that offers special cross-border programs. Not sure what they have in Basel but our bank is Credit Mutuel in France and we have separate accounts in euros and Swiss francs. No extra fees and we simply have our salaries deposited in separate percentages.   
I'd imagine Basel's got to have something similar. Anyone?

So maybe you can go to Basel Fremdenpolizei and ask them for the permit fairly soon. In the meantime fingers crossed nobody finds you working.

			Although I'm no expert, I think in theory you should be able to do it if you can provide a security here in Switzerland. E.g. you have a property here, which the bank can use as a collateral in case you miss payments or decide to skip the country. But this is only my personal opinion, you should talk to your bank or financial advisor.   
Good luck!

Apart from the fact that you can invest the money and in theory keep it growing, its nice to be able to keep it yourself.   
Its also strange that you need a letter. I don't have a letter from the tax office to my work to tell them its ok to pay me without taxing me

3497	Financebankingtaxation	Wife and dependent children under 25 in UK	bradley	2839	15	Location: geneva	20.10.2011, 18:19	"    It isn't against the treaty, the combined income is used to determine the tax rate as it would be if everything was earned in Switzerland, but the tax already paid in the UK is taken into account so you don't end up owing any more on income already taxed in the UK.    
I appreciate it's frustrating as I've been through it but I also see the Swiss perspective that you can't have the tax benefits of being married without the downsides.    
Btw I often see the double taxation agreements referred to in the context of not being 'taxed twice on the same income', but this description is slightly misleading to anyone who is new to the topic. Obviously the agreements differ between countries and the finer points often change, but mainly they only limit your liability to the amount of tax that would be due in the highest taxation country, so if you live on the lower tax country (eg Switzerland) and a higher tax country (eg UK) decides you are subject to it's tax laws too, you can in fact be taxed twice but your second bill will take into account what you gave already paid so you only owe the difference.

			What are major items that are tax deductible in Switzerland?  Are any of these tax deductible:     - all banking fees (e.g. brokerage or advisory fees if a bank charges a flat 1% fee)   - job hunting expenses (e.g. train travel for job interviews).  What if one did not keep all the receipts?     - alimony to one's ex-spouse     THanks  "	Posts: 109	Join Date: May 2008	Member	Groaned at 27 Times in 5 Posts	Thanked 3 Times in 3 Posts	slipped a little

3505	Financebankingtaxation	offshore banking	safe_deposits	3550	14	Location: Zurich	20.10.2008, 13:04	"    I believe that your personal allowance still counts in this case (GBP 6035 for 2008/2009 for most people  ) so if your savings account is earning 5% gross then you can have just over GBP 120K in your UK savings account before the interest will be over your personal allowance.   
One nice feature of the IOM Barclays accounts if you are paying Swiss tax is that you can elect when to be paid interest (so you could defer it for 10 years if you want  ) if you want to elect when to pay income tax on it. However, you'll still pay wealth tax and I think the IOM deposit protection scheme is 'insufficient' if something the size of Barclays goes under.

3509	Financebankingtaxation	Query on Steurerklärung - Putting down stocks	MrChilli	5272	24	Location: Zurich	11.10.2011, 23:49	"    The 2010 Private Tax software appears to do this, but it questions whether you're entering stocks, funds or several other types.    
Most of the things I want to put in are ETFs, but there's no ""ETF"" button. If I try putting in the FTSE 100 iShares Valoren number, it can't find it. You can get much more common than that. Is it classed as a stock of a fund?    
<sticks_one's_neck_out> Regardless, it seems easier to put the figures in manually and let the tax people decide if they can be bothered to ask you for more information, if they're probably not going to make much extra money from you. </sticks_one's_neck_out>

			Due to a recent experience, I became very aware of how difficult it is to open/change a Kantonalbank account as an American.  In fact, if you have an account here but are a US resident, it's almost impossible to change the account.   
It doesn't even help if you are ""per du"" or related to the bank manager.   
What are your experiences?

			The worst of it is that most of the people who pick up phones or e-mail and are supposed to help you can't, and to get anywhere useful you have to reach the stage of knowing more than they do and cite chapter and verse so that they finally admit they aren't in the picture and pass you on to a ""Technical Officer"" or similar who actually knows anything apart from the minimum required to answer everyday questions.   
It's taken weeks of doggedness to get this far - the words ""terrier"" and ""bulldog"" come to mind ;-)   
My bank (ZKB) got back to me - well sort of. The lady I had spoken to on the phone sent me two little factsheets explaining all the stuff I already knew and had told her, and completely ignored my question about how they handle things when someone buys a home in the UK... sigh

			I found the Post Finance offer to be the best for parking your Pension money. Normally your ex employer would keep it only for a certain period, say 6 months. If you dont decide what to do with by then, its gets transferred to a Pension fund of the ex employers choice, and, as others have said there are charges. Look around and decide for yourself.

			Don't know.  I've never stamped anything coming back from Paris by train.   
There is a customs point in SBB as part of the station is owned by France.  But I'm not sure if it still exists actually, or whether any trains use it!   
First time I went to Paris by train I went into the French part, looked at the timetable, saw that my TVG actually arrived at a ""normal"" platform, so in the Swiss part of the station, and then turned around and walked back out o the French part.  That involved me walking through two customs points, watched boredly by some French woman.   
It seemed so odd.  So, a year ago (when I did this) the French part of the station did exist, was manned, but wasn't used.  Seems so French!

			If the economy collapses totally, there will be no payroll.  No one will work.  So no police etc.  All you need is a gun or decent knife (I may go for a crossbow, they're cool) and thick gloves for smashing through the glass at Coop or Migros (or Denner if it really comes to that).   
Failing that, I will simply chase down and eat fat people.  They can't run away.  Then I will get fat, and someone will eat me.  Thanks for playing!

The other option would be to look at smaller banks. Would recommend Clientis-Zürcher Regional Bank - very friendly, helpful and no hang ups like the big ones have treating small individual customers.

			I find the banks here pretty good.  No worse than Canada at least.   
I bank with postfinance, and am happy.  Their e-finance offer seems to have fairly minimal charges, and if you are comfortable with the whole internet banking, their system can be used fully in English.  Makes it pretty easy.

Whether or not the Tax withheld by Australia count as a tx credit in Switzerland is a matter for the Swiss-Australian Double Taxation Treaty, if there is one (I'm too lazy to look it up now).

			Generally, the customers are insured up to some amount, for cash. For example, with interactive brokers, it is 100k $. If you have stock positions, you will be delivered the securities in paper form or they will be transferred to a broker of your liking.   
If you have cash above 100k $, you might be in trouble for the rest of it.

			I pay my income tax in the Quellensteuer system, but I received the Steuererklarung forms for 2010.  I was in Zurich only for the last 3 months of 2010, which seems to imply that I have an ""unterjährigen Steuerpflicht"" where the rate of my tax is based on an annualized income (i.e. 4x regular income + 1x irregular income).  Does anyone know how to properly report this in the tax forms?  Should I just copy the numbers from my Lohnausweis and the tax authorities will do all the calculations themselves?   
I was considering using Private Tax 2010 to fill out the forms, but found the following in the FAQ on the Steueramt's website:      It indeed does not seem to work correctly, as it generates a summary where the rate-determining and actual incomes are equal.  Does that mean that I need to fill the forms by hand, or that the forms just don't work in this case?

Can I claim this back?  
Is it 30% TAX also for Swiss companies?

10 years fix. great rates - in fact, we may never get such good rates again. you fix, leave it, can sleep well at night and know you got a good rate (albeit not the best possible rate).   
however, LIBOR is still 3x cheaper than the 10 year fixed right now.   
i was going to go with 50% libor and 50% 10 year fix. but then my job started to look a bit uncertain, so to stay on the safe side, i went with 1/3 LIBOR 2/3 10 year fix.   
but i made sure the LIBOR component was fully flexible so that if IRs did shoot up, i could simply just repay the LIBOR component and so i still have a way out if IRs spike up unexpectedly.

			Hello everyone,   
My child's Kita/creche is asking us to fill a new self declaration for 2010 so that our monthly fees can be reavaluated. My problem is that I don't know what to put on it as for as my income is concerned. I am working since May 2010 but don't get a fixed salary.. I get a hourly wage so my income varies every month.. Also, I have no idea how much I will earn till the end of the year, it depends of how many hours I will get to work , being sick or not and thus not being paid etc... I will only know for sure how much I've earned in 2010  when I get my annual income review at the end of the year. I even thought the declaration would be based on 2009 but no, they want this year.    
Any help on this particular issue welcomed, thanks

If you earn over 120'000 per year you must complete the tax return in February 2012 for the previous year 2011.    
You are taxed by your employer in the canton where the company has the office your husband is working from. So even after your move to Aargau your tax will probably remain the same, unless your husband works in a different cantonal office.

3591	Financebankingtaxation	German court rejects challenge to eurozone bailouts	Nyonais	808	0	Location: La Cote	07.09.2011, 13:23	" 
			
			German court rejects challenge to eurozone bailouts.       
The court was expected to rule that the German parliament must be given more say over future aid.   
Germany's highest court has rejected a challenge to the country bailing out other nations in the eurozone.   
The Constitutional Court was responding to a challenge brought by six prominent German Eurosceptics.   
But the court did say the government must seek the approval of the German parliament before providing future assistance.   
This could further hinder Europe's response to the debt crisis, already criticised as too slow.   
As Europe's largest and most robust economy, the German decision has implications for the whole region.   
The presiding judge, Andreas Vosskuhle, said German lawmakers should be more involved in future bailout decisions.   
""The government is obligated in the cases of large expenditures to get the approval of the parliamentary budgetary committee,"" Mr Vosskuhle said.   
Since last year, eurozone nations have agreed to support Greece, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland via the European Financial Stability Facility, the fund set up to help countries struggling to pay their debt obligations.   
There are fears that other countries will also need financial assistance.   
Meanwhile, in an interview with the Bild newspaper, one of the leaders of Germany's ruling coalition did not rule out Greece leaving the 17-member single currency.   
""I do not think that can be ruled out but I'm counting on the success of the path that has been taken with aid and consolidation efforts,"" said Horst Seehofer, chairman of the Christian Social Union and one of three parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.   
Those comments are in contrast to Mrs Merkel's, who has said there is ""no possibility of all"" of Greece leaving the euro.

Will it help if I can get an value of what it would be worth now. Mum just put the price she paid for it but the value of a 4mth old, 2nd hand camera will be a bit less I think.

Some average people can also have stocks (I don't have any, in case one think it's personal). 
I don't see any aggression or anything where the guy said ""it's good, who cares for the jobs""?     
Let's be clear: more jobs losses is terrible nowadays, especially if the decision are made by a group of profits idiots who don't care their will damage many life, many families.     
The guy asked: ""So is that a possible positive for the future of the stock price?"" He only talk about the ""future of the stock prices"", questioning if that terrible news will be actually worthy/efficient.   
Some of my colleagues have invested 30 000chf in our company's shares. Their shares have lost nearly all value (its like 7% of what they paid initially). 
Those have children, made a decision when they could afford to risk 30 000chf, now it's not the case anymore. 
I would not groan them if they would only question that action to suppress 30 000 jobs, especially that we can't change that decision the wankers made. I mean bankers (or invester whoever).

			Thanks to everyone for your replies. 
I realize that I've not been much precise with my request, so maybe I should clarify it.   
I do already have an ETHZ card, but it does not have the status of student (the big S on it) yet. 
I have applied for being a student, but I fear the application will take some time.   
Therefore, I think I have two possibilities:   Which one of the two possibilities do you think is the one, and in case it is the second one, since I cannot wait too much time to get an account, can you please point me to a convenient solution? 
I have seen that the account with the postfinance has good recommendations in other posts, is it still so?   
Thank you again!

It could be a potentially exempt transfer. Information available on hm revenue web site   
If your father was born in the uk it's possible that he is still liable to IHT on his death . The rules will probably change next year when uk tax issues get simplified.   
UK domicile is nothing to do with where you live, it's where you or your father was born, it can be lost but not easily.

3606	Financebankingtaxation	A slightly complicated tax situation?	TheScientist	739	0	Location: UK	02.09.2011, 14:51	" 
			
			Hello,   
I work for a UK employer who wants to send me on secondment to work in the Geneva area. From looking around on this forum and on google as far as I understand if I based there for a full tax year I am exempt from UK income tax - is this indeed correct?   
The slightly complicated issue is my employer wants to send me for 6 months, with a strong likelihood of this being a year, but will not commit to it being one year until 3 months after I am there. Would this essentially mean the above exemption, if correct, is not valid because my employer will not state I will be there one year? Would I then be able to claim the tax back if I did stay a year?   
Thanks,

Kapitalbereitstellungsgebühr Zölle - 5.00 
Datatax / NCTS / E-Dec-Gebühr - 22.65 
Nachnahmegebühr - 35.00 
Administrations costs - 6.80   
Out of these costs, Einfuhrsteuer gemäss Quittung - 47.55 and Einfuhrzoll gamäss Quittung - 12.00 are counted as ""Total nicht steuerpflichtig"" and the rest as ""Total MWSt-frei"".   
GRAND TOTAL - 204.00

			First - go to comparis.ch: Finances -> Tax comparison, and put your details in to see how much of the wealth tax you'd have to pay per canton.   
Then, if the sum is big enough -- try to find an advisor. Remember to find the one that specializes in American ""cases"" (as currently Swiss bankers / advisors go crazy when you mention that you're American -- you have to fill special forms when filing your tax returns etc).

Simple procedure:

I hope I can apply for VISA by next week.   
for those who want to know, my employer officially applied for my work permit on August 8 2011, so it took little over 2 weeks  for my work permit to get approved by Baselland canton.

I DO think is quite expensive (It's really annoing that if the stock you bought is doing +0.6~1.2% you are still not making money while the bank is) 
I am thinking switching to saxo too, do you have some feedbacks?   
I am also considering banks that are not based in CH that are really cheap (compared to swiss standards) 
like:     
but in these days I think swiss banks are more reliable 
did you find out if IB is swiss based?

			Strange question, but does anyone know of any banks that have special relations with one another in both Italy and Switzerland? I am planning to open a European bank account next week. I live in Italy but travel so often to CH that it would be convenient if the bank I used had a brother or sister type of bank so that withdrawals of money and such were either free or less expensive. Does anyone know of such a thing? I know with a lot of American banks they can waive fees for you at certain banks when you travel abroad and wanted to know if there was an equivalent within western Europe. I am a student in Italy and also interning with a company based in Switzerland if that helps at all, and was hoping to obtain a microchip/chip and pin card for credit card usage and for bancomat/ATM withdrawals.

3630	Financebankingtaxation	Selling PAMP 1 oz gold bullion	alanic	1162	0	Location: mo	22.08.2011, 12:43	" 
			
			Hi,    
I live in the US and I'll move to Europe sometime soon. I have a couple of gold bullions that I'd like to sell at some point in the future. Here are the kinds that I have:    
PAMP Suisse 1oz bar (with the blue package) 
Canadian Maple Leaf 1oz coin 
American Eagle 1oz coin    
So, I was wondering, if I try to sell them in Switzerland, would I get a fair price? I'm asking because I think over there gold bars are usually in grams and these may be strange to the shops there. I'm especially hopeful with the PAMP bar because it's made there  Can anybody tell me the buy price of one of these babies and for which gold ounce price it is?

3632	Financebankingtaxation	Tax liability after 90 days in Switzerland?	ernest	1009	0	Location: Bellmund, Bern	21.08.2011, 22:59	" 
			
			I am a Swiss citizen but I live in the US where I have a green card and pay taxes.  In the US one is liable to pay taxes when one stays there for more than 180 days.  However, in Switzerland, it appears that one becomes liable if one stays for over 90 days, even if one does not earn income here. We are on vacation in Switzerland and have to stay longer since one of our daughters is sick.  In order to avoid exceeding 90 days, are there any good options aside from staying across the border in France, Germany, or Austria?  With many thanks for any advice.

			I sent 5 boxes, slightly heavier than yours with a cargo company - air frieght to Basel, with me picking up from the airport. I paid about 35chf for getting everything out of the airport customs/ freight area.  It did take me about 90 minutes, including mime tie, but everyone tried to be helpful. I had to got get bits of paper staped in about 3 different places around the complex before getting the release. ..... at which point you do need a vehicle to take the boxes back into town. ( taxi or friend?)

3636	Financebankingtaxation	GOLD - Int'l recognition of swiss gold coins?	Uncle GroOve	6193	19	Location: Mendrisio	28.07.2008, 17:52	"    From what we've seen, prices are practically similar. Raiffeisen seem to be, if anything, a bit more flexible when you want to sell.   
I would agree that the bars are somewhat more efficient spread-wise. I also enquired in the vreneli market, and the main issue is the gold tenor of 0.9 vs. 0.9999.   
Then again - ""value"" is only where we agree it is... cow dung-pies, or certain sea-shells, or iris bulbs, or gorgonzola cheese rounds are all basically the same as far as I'm concerned    
(I'm kidding of course - just trying to defuse the  ...)

			Ok, 
Not quite the same but true. The bank does total the amount of money an ATM gives out each day and makes sure it agrees with the cash inside. If by some fluke it has given away too much money, then they write a letter to all the customers who draw out money that day telling them they took it.   
Cause the customers who did not take it will ignore the letter, or maybe complain. The guy that did get the free money will think they caught him and will give it back. That's the theory anyway.   "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			I am planning on ordering a MacBook Pro from a website in the US, being shipped to my friend that lives in the US.  I have tried various searches and am unclear on what sort of fees him shipping this to me will incur.  I will gladly declare it, provide an invoice, and so on, but would like an idea of what this will cost.  This item is $1799 USD.  Will VAT be calculated on the USD price of this, or the CHF price of the equivelent product.  Also what other import fees am I looking at besides VAT?   
Thanks in advance.

			Have you asked HR if they are deducting tax on behalf of Geneva or Vaud?   
They should be able to refer you to a table which shows the percentage deductions from salary depending on your salary level.   
When I first arrived, HR somehow neglected to deduct any tax from salary for the first couple of months; so it was a bit of a shock when it all got taken out in one go at the end of the year (i.e. when they trued-up in December).

I have a trickier question: 
Cider and perry are both listed in foodstuffs, with a separate limit of 3L.        
Are they not considered alcoholic beverages?

			Debt collection agencies are effectively powerless without  a court order if you keep the doors and windows locked and refuse entry so they are unable to ""touch"" your possessions. With a court order you can engage a court bailiff who has greater powers. If the case is strong, engage a solicitor to start proceedings, costs to a fair degree can be recovered.

			I think your best bet in these volatile markets is not to use a deposit and apply for Swisscaution   ... you'll pay an annual fee (which is probably less than $500), they'll pay your deposit and you can hold on to your dollars and invest them in something else to make up for the fee! You can do that once you get here, my understanding is that they are OK with lending to foreigners with limited history as well.

			On the bad side of the coin, Geneva and Zurich may end up on top of the list of the most expensive cities in 2012:  
On the brighter side of the coin, Switzerland may end up to top the list of average salary of 2012:    
It feels so strange. As a European, I used to consider that the only very opulent country in Europe was Norway, because of its oil. Now, it feels as if Switzerland is as opulent, because it has the Swiss Franc. Well, I don't think it can last very long, but I hope that it will be at least a few years.

3678	Financebankingtaxation	US Taxes: Come Clean or Jump Ship?	mikegray	2616	21	Location: Meilen, ZH	07.08.2011, 16:52	"    In certain, ahem, Nordic countries, the tax thing really isn't an issue and not much of a hassle overall in terms of value of being able to work wherever they want to or go to university there if they want to. I think of it as a gift that she can appreciate or reject at her leisure if she wishes since it's a lot harder to get into the US than many other places. I'm an American, born of two Europeans, who understands the value of keeping the doors open and, at least until recently, the US has always been the land of opportunity and dreams, especially for the well educated and well connected which does describe 99% of  most expats.    
Being an expat helps you define both what made you leave the US and why you might want to return. I love the US even though I may not return for many years...and I'm glad to have given my child at least a few years of experience there. Where else can you go where the neighbors show up within days of your moving in around xmas time with a plate of cookies and a 'welcome to our neighborhood' artwork made by their 3 year-old who is stoked to have a new kid on the block? I miss the US, I miss the US I grew up in and, though it will never be the same again, it is the country, the landscape, by which all others are judged in my heart. I may live in other countries and love living in them, but my home will always be the US and to give that gift to my daughter is, in my mind, the greatest gift I will give to her as it is her birthright. I may cringe at the state the US is in now, but I still hope for the future and hope that things will get better....

(I hope that is obvious, but if not please reply).   
AFTER you became a US resident:  Most foreign (non-U.S.) pensions have not bothered to qualify as tax-exempt with the IRS, so ""yes"" the earnings are taxable by the IRS if (and /only/ if) you have the right to withdraw the funds.  However, if you cannot withdraw the funds (for example, ""not until age xxx""), then ""no"" since it the account is not under your control.   
P.S.  As a practical matter, the IRS has no possible way of finding your Swiss pension account.

3690	Financebankingtaxation	Rolling over of capital gains tax on sale of principal residence to BUILD new house	Flower	1305	0	Location: Zurich	04.08.2011, 14:16	   There is a big discrepancy between the building cost and purchase prices per square meter in Switzerland. Hypothetically, if one bought a house (principal place of residence) for CH0.5M ( CHF0.2 equity &amp; CHF0.3M mortgage) and were to sell this principal place of residence for CHF1M and use the proceeds to BUILD another bigger house (and keep it as one’s principal place of residence), in order to minimise the capital gains tax and maximise the rolling over of capital gains tax, does one need to build a new house:     1.  that costs CHF1M to build and can possibly be estimated to be worth a CHF1.5M by local tax authorities? There can be a big gap between the cost of built and final estimated value by tax authorities. Does anybody know how big that gap is in a % range?     2.  that is estimated by tax authorities to be worth CHF1M after it is built (e.g. one could use CHF0.7M to built a new house which final estimated value by tax authorities to be CHF1M).      3.  using the same amount of equity that one has in the current house, i.e. sale price of CHF1M minus CHF0.3M mortgage, i.e. CHF0.7M to built if one does not want to take on any mortgage?     4.  using the original amount of equity that one put to buy the current house CHF0.2M and if one does not want to take on a mortgage?

			We can blame Zurich!    
Everyone I know who were on tax agreements in Zurich have left for Zug, Lucerne, and Schwyz. They made it illegal for rich people to live in Zuerich on tax agreements after that Russian guy bulldozed a entire block of houses to build a horrible doomsday bunker of a house....    
In essence though that means that the average tax income for the local governments has gone up while expenses have stayed roughly the same.    
With all of these rich people living there the other people in the kanton will see their tax burdens decrease. While in Zurich over the next 3 to 5 years the taxs will increase....

			I thought the OP was also asking if he/she could get a bill later, and it does depend on the delivery service. For example, I order stuff from sierra trading post, and they use UPS. I've had three orders this summer. The first two just required a signature, the last one required a cash or credit card payment. I just got two separate bills fro the first two orders in the last week. Same with things delivered by DHL... sometimes you pay at delivery, sometimes you get a bill, sometimes you don't pay at all.    
I think the don't pay at all shipments are things that I ordered from iherb.com, vitamins, taxed at the lower rate.

			Hi,   
Possibly moving to Switzerland for 1 year maybe October from the US.  I have no concerns for most of the items I will be bringing with a few exceptions.     
If they decide to declare an item as ""new"" what will the charges be?  What will the value be based on?  I have items I bought on sale 9 months ago that have not yet been used.  Yes, I know take off the tags, run it through the wash, scuff it up, etc.  Let's say that doesn't work.   
For items I recently purchased, under six months, same questions.  Will it be based on what I paid as documented on my bill of sale and will the tax I paid on it be factored in?   
I also believe in the course of my reading that you have, I think, up to six months to bring your items in, yes?  It would be nice to bring our winter clothing back and bring summer clothing over rather than bringing it all at once.   
On a related note, I was thinking of bringing in some beer making kits, specifically these   which are canned.  Any tax/duty/etc on those?   
One more thing, I believe I read somewhere that if you are charged duties on items I bring in, as long as I leave with them I get the duty back.  Is this true?  How does one go about getting that money back?   
Thanks in advance!

			You're unlikely to find a Swiss bank offering decent interest rates on Euros. Its a general rule that banks do not offer decent interest rates for currencies other than their local one.   
Assuming you are from a Euro country, then go back there and open an account. You should be able to get 2.5% or more right now.

			Limits are there for financial protection.    
In case your card gets stolen, or someone you lend it to tries to abuse it.   
There are default limits, if these are not sufficient speak to your bank, they will be adjusted to your required levels.   
In the land of the super rich, with account holders having 5-10 cards per set of accounts, and cards being dished out to girlfriends, wives, domestics etc, it is a way stop stop abuse.

I agree on option B. Had to do the very same process last year.   
Be aware that the offices dealing with normal taxes and tax at source sometimes do not talk to each other. In my case they forgot to take into account the Quellensteuer already paid and they send me a bill for several thousands of Swiss francs (including almost 1K for interests) which made me faint! It took almost three months an several phone calls but I finally got it right. I even received a refund and it took 1 week to get into the bank. I love the Swiss way. I am still waiting a refund for 2008 from the tax office of my own country

We have recently moved from Zurich to NY - bye everybody! - and, I am receiving Swiss bills. I really don't know how to pay them from here. I am a Credit Suisse customer, who can only log onto my account through my, natch, Swiss cell phone.   
I called Credit Suisse in NY and they have told me that, of course, they are an entirely separate entity from Credit Suisse in Switzerland.   
What a pain. There is always the ""send them to a friend and wire them money"" or something tricky route, but I would prefer to handle this all myself.... if possible.

			No they only deliver, by normal post in an envelope marked ""Swiss Bankers"" - I am not kidding! I have complained, especially as I asked for it to be held ""Post Restante""    
I have read that the Coop Bank has the best rates. You can also use the SBB Change, on large stations at reasonable rates.

3722	Financebankingtaxation	Good debt consolidation company in Vaud / credit union?	annastorm	2771	4	Location: geneva	24.05.2011, 23:14	" 
			
			Are you currently being pursued by collections agents?  If not, then why not just do as MarieZug suggested and pay off the debts in order of interest rate, highest to lowest?  It will require more time and effort on your part compared to just turning the whole lot over to a consolidation company, but you will save the fees that consolidation companies charge.   
While I don't know if clearing old debts works the same here in Switzerland as in the states, I do know that according to Dave Ramsey, all a consolidation company does is act on your behalf to negotiate settlements with creditors whilst charging you a hefty fee to do so.  Why not save your extra income for a period of time then attempt to negotiate the settlements yourself?   
Good luck!

3723	Financebankingtaxation	3rd pillar not deducted, now leaving country....pls help	Ozzyk	1213	1	Location: Lausanne	21.07.2011, 11:14	" 
			
			I am not sure I know all the facts well enough but my understanding is that if you are employed (as opposed to self employed) and earn less than CHF 120k you are not required to do a tax return.  Your tax is deducted from your monthly salary by your employer.   
This deduction at source is calculated based on the average tax rate for the canton.  So depending upon where you live in the canton you might be slightly worse or better off depending upon whether where you actually live has a higher or lower tax rate (and may wish to do a proper tax return).   
If you have paid into a 3rd pillar account and earn less than CHF 120k there is a form that you need to complete and submit (I think by 31 March) for every tax year to get the tax back in respect of your 3rd pillar contribution.   
If you earn more than CHF 120k you will be doing a tax return anyway and claim the deduction in that.   
It seems like you will end up paying tax twice on the amount unless someone who knows more than me knows of a way around this.  Sorry....

1-2 months salary is normal, you can download the software from your canton & do a tax return & see what the calculation is.

3726	Financebankingtaxation	Bank, account, card...	The Rock	1377	2	Location: France	19.07.2011, 14:41	" 
			
			I'm with Raiffeisen, which is otherwise fine, but if you use your Swiss card abroad in other currencies, they will charge an exchange fee, as do the other Swiss banks I know of.  
To avoid this, you can open and EUR account with them and get a VISA Gold in EUR, comes with insurance.  
However, while the payments would not have additional fees here, you would still pay when taking money out, which is what was of interest to you.    
Therefore ,alternatively, why not a French card when you're in France anyway, as your profile states? If you get paid in CHF in Switzerland, you can still open an EUR account in your Swiss bank, transfer money from your CHF account to your EUR one with just a click (for free and with a  good exchange rate) and then do a SEPA transfer to your French account. It's fast and costs 0,76 eur per transfer if I remember correctly.    
Then take Visa Premier from for example BNP Paribas, comes with insurance and withdrawals are free from partner banks (Bank of America, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and others) all over the world

3728	Financebankingtaxation	Taxation - Lived in Germany now moving to Switzerland	iwork2travel	1022	0	Location: Wollerau	19.07.2011, 21:23	" 
			
			Hi All, 
I am German Citizen and I have worked as a contractor in Germany from Jan to April this year. Also paid the Tax and MwSt to the German Tax office.  
After that I don't have any income in Germany. I am still registered in Germany...but will do a Deregistration before I start working in Switzerland.    
I will start working and living in Zurich from August and will also pay my taxes here.  
I know that there is a Double Taxation Treaty but have some doubts:   
1. Do I have to inform the German Tax office that I am moving to Switzerland?    
2 Do I have to inform the Swiss Tax office that I had some income in Germany this year (For which I have already paid taxes in Germany)?   
Has anyone gone through the same Situation? 
Thanks for your help...

3729	Financebankingtaxation	Tax rates on land ownership	timothyboon	840	2	Location: Zurich region	19.07.2011, 19:56	"    Yes, there is an equivalent. I think if you own forest land there is some equivalent income from that and that you pay whether you use the forest commercially or not.   
With other types of land I'm not sure.    
But as always, don't take tax advice from the EF. Talk to your local tax office. In my experience they have always been friendly and advised me in the best possible way. They have in the past even shown me ways of paying less tax in a situation where I was pretty sure there was no way of paying less. So these guys are 100% on your side and are not going to try and catch you out or make you pay more.

3731	Financebankingtaxation	Aussie / kiwi Tbills...?	Uncle GroOve	823	1	Location: Mendrisio	18.07.2011, 13:12	"    In Oz? Nope, not since December when the last tranch expired. There has to be something close though, such as buying off the run 1yrs that expire in 3 months etc....    
To be honest with you I would suggest going further out on the curve. 2 Yrs seem a better buy right now with the AUD looking to collapse. I would say if youre going to stick with the AUD go further out to lock in a yield. The RBA will start cutting by the end of the year. Yield curve is close to flat so it doesnt matter if you buy 2 yrs or 5 yrs, they yield about the same.   
There are Kiwi Tbills, but they yield 2.4%.... You can buy AUD 1yr notes that yield +4%... I think thats a better bet if you HAVE to own AUD or Kiwis....    
But up to you mate.... Dont buy any of these Aussie swap fund (bank issued t-bills) as they will really take it on the chin in the next 9 months. Stick with the Government bonds for now I would say.   
Aussie bond futures are also a very good bet if you have access to that kind of investment? Thats because it takes out the currency risk.

You have no choice. It's simply reported to treasury. If you have a lot of big transfers, you may raise a red flag, but that's simply what happens. WHen we sold our house in the US, the proceeds (more than 10K, but not that big since we only had the house for a few years) were transferred to Switzerland, but it was no big deal. It's more to watch out for money laundering and of course, funding terrorists.

It's a risky strategy, I know, but I don't intend to live in the US again.    
I file my Fbar on time, and for the rest, don't really care. I always write a note of explanation on the taxes. And so far, I've not owed anything... but we'll see what happens next.

			Thank you for the reply.   
I do not doubt Canada as an investment opportunity and hold roughly 3% of my portfolio in Canadian equities.  
The issue is the currency. I do not think Canada is diversified enough from the USD in order to move from USD to CAD. I was hoping for a EUR option where I could invest in EUR denominated exchanges and avoid the higher tax witholding in these markets. Is there a market that does not withhold tax - like the US. 
My home country taxes at 15% so anything over is basically a loss. And the reason I am concerned about home country is I consider CH a temporary situation.

In order to pay 6% you must have a gross of around 125k and be insured on the minimal portion which is ca. 50k ish (so 15% of 50k which is what the law   says). But then again that would only apply to your particular case and by no way can be considered as market practice or indeed a percentage that can be applied universally...   
A CH pension is not only CD's but between 25% and 40% stocks depending on whether it follows the LPP25 or the LPP40 benchmark. Also the minimum return is set every two years by the Federal Council (and no, it isn't the CD rate). Suggest more reading is in order.

3756	Financebankingtaxation	Postfinance guarantee	guest	2116	2	null	null	"    thanks. so in summary, there is no guarantee, just an assumption that the swiss state will step in if the SHTF.   
also don't worry, because they have capital equivalent to 5% of deposits, so if they lose only 5% then depositors will be ok. just hope they don't lose more than that.   
lastly, they are 'conservative' so don't expect to make losses. which makes me wonder how they manage to offer a full 1% on e-deposito accounts. surely they must lend to someone, which implies credit risk and therefore some chance of loss.

3757	Financebankingtaxation	Reclaiming VAT - Various	Rob_Z	1643	1	Location: appenzell	11.07.2011, 14:25	" 
			
			1. You go to the tax office in the city you are leaving in Germany. Then I suppose you come to declare on the closest tax office near your home in Switzerland.   
In train border france/switzerland there's possibility to do everything in the station. it's probably the same in basel!   
2. The tax thing is ""European"" Vs outside of europe. The rule is to stamp it at the last country of departure of the european zone. Ie in Austria in your example. Although you can still stamp it in germany in any office.   
3. Maybe. As explained in your example. But the online seller have to specifically say they would remove VAT- Usually they don't or charge you more. Usually they base on your delivery address: you buy in germany, you get german vat. you buy in Switerzland you get swiss price (usually more or same ,despite tax difference). It's also usually not worthy to fight that and bother with customer service for that.

3761	Financebankingtaxation	Transferring money from/to UK	AbFab	1933	3	Location: Zürich	10.07.2011, 22:05	" 
			
			I used OANDA recently to send some money back and it worked well. Got a decent exchange rate (they tell you the rate before yougo ahead).   
Basically, it works like this:   
1. Register with Oanda 
2. Nominate a currency (CHF) and source account (my bank here in CH) 
3. Nominate a target account (my bank in the UK) 
4. Fund Oanda from the source 
5. Exchange the currency and pay to the target in one step   
I was happy once I got from (4) to (5) as I'd never used them before    They do apear to be FSA (UK) registered.   
I like that fact you can sit at step 5, clicking ""exchange"" and seeing the exact rate and only going ahead minutes/hours/days later when you're happy. Of course, until you transfer the money out it sits at Oanda doing nothing (for you).   
Points to note:   
1. Registering is complex as it appears to require two accounts - one for the funding and setting up accounts and one for the foreign exchange/transfer, although it kind of merges them.   
2. Postfinance charged me 2 CHF to perform the SWIFT transfer to Oanda (in CHF, bank in London).  Bargain!  But the amount credited turned out to be 7 CHF less than I sent, so I assume Oanda's bank took that.   
3. Oanda charge for the transfer. It's very transparent and I believe my charge came to around 20 CHF.   
4. Once it told me the amount in GBP and I clicked ""send"", I got exactly that amount in my UK account (a day later). I was happy.  It matched or beat (I forget) the XE.com rate I usually use to check.

3763	Financebankingtaxation	Taxes / charges for frontaliers	Village Idiot	8055	9	Location: Basel	12.07.2010, 17:54	"    Too true, but best of all, it'll mean big tax reductions for those of us who live a long way from work.    
Under the new rules, I just claimed 500km per week at 0.86CHF (I think) per kilometer. The new deal is that some Geneva frontaliers can make a swiss tax claim, including all the goodies that swiss residents can deduct from their tax bill.   
As I understand it, the conditions are that you must either be: unmarried, have a non-working spouse or have a spouse who works in Geneva. Also some large fraction of your total income must come from Geneva salaries (90%?). I've got a rotten memory, so check the exact figures before getting too excited...   
However, you do have to be careful, as sending in the claim is irrevocable. If it turns out that you are worse off by claiming, instead of putting up with the normal frontalier deal, you have to pay anyway.

3764	Financebankingtaxation	Post finance bank Vs Kantonal banks - opinions	Info	9584	30	Location: Switzerland	07.02.2008, 19:08	" 
			
			When you open account consider also how your situation may look in next 5 years.  
Postfinance will be very strict when calculating your credit score - would not do much out of what they offer.   
Credit-Suisse or UBS would provide you different solutions and options for your needs.   
When I arrived here only one bank (Credit S.) offered to open up account without permanent address - as I was staying in hotel for 2 months looking for flat to rent.    
Some time later I got personal assistant - that I can call and he does all things for me - whatever I need my bank to do it's one call away - no paper work , queues or anything . Taking (super-jambo) mortgage was just as easy as negotiations can go - two competetive offers and I got what I wanted - nothing signed with a blood - agreement was good enough to get into my house .   
When my Maestro card did not work anymore in Italy - I got new one 24h later delivered by DHL !   
 When I need double my credit card spending limit - it's one call to bank - no more 'you need gold/platinum/super card to have that limit' - card is card - doesn't matter what it looks like at the end of the day ;-)   
However to get that service you must be long time with a bank - so they are sure you stay as customer.   
PostFinance or Kantonal banks usually have lower costs for accounts while higher costs for other stuff (USD account,investment account,other). Services are limited or at additional charge.     
good luck

			The usual conduit bank out of the US is citibank for wires...though, with all the banks melting down this may have changed. How much the bank charges has little to do with what bank it goes through though.   
And JFC on a pogo-stick, the fees are the least of your worries as back in 2002 I needed to wire some money to FI, well after the Euro was introduced, and I had the head of wire transfers (at BofA in Boston) ask me, ""What currency do they use?"". I'm like, seriously? In spite of that, BofA is probably one of the better banks to do wires with.   
I could rant for hours on the difficulty of the US, the banks and their archaic inability to get with the digital in terms of moving money back and forth across the atlantic. This also hasn't been helped by Osama and Co. since 2001.    
I'd rather send money by carrier pigeon if I could....

At some point they may decide to investigate your affairs, if they believe you are still resident they will issue a tax assesment with fines & interest. 
By not filling in the form, it's reasonably clear that you did not intend to leave permanantly or indeffinately. You have to actively show you have 'left'. 
If your earnings only make you a UK basic rate tax payer I doubt they would ever be interested, however there is a large budget shortfall in the UK, ExPats who have not bothered to 'leave' permantly or indeffinately are easy targets.

I tested with the Private Tax software using different values here, and I confirmed that even going all the way up to very high values (like a quarter million francs), it only increases the overall tax by less than CHF 100.

3776	Financebankingtaxation	EU Savings Tax Directive	magyir	1746	0	Location: Wallisellen	02.07.2011, 14:06	" 
			
			Just a reminder of this directive meaning that the tax rate being applied to your savings interest as of yesterday is 35%, 75% of which goes to Brussels/EU States for EU nationals. Switzerland gets to keep a quarter of the tax.   
In 2005 the rate was 15%, and in 2008 was 20%.   
Some call it the banking secrecy compromise.    
I doubt it'll get much media coverage.   
Bear in mind Switzerland generally takes 35% of interest earnings on certain savings products in any case, it's kinda funny for me that 75% of this now goes to Dublin under this Directive even though I haven't lived there for over half my life....

If you cash in whilst resident you are taxed according to your Canton of registration (ie where you pay income tax).  There is also a small federal tax, but the amount is pretty negligible.  Also note, you can open the account with any bank/location, and transfer to a low tax area before (possibly also after?) you leave switzerland.  Also, be a little careful - it is not where the branch is, or the bank head office, but the location that the Stiftung (ie trust) is registered in that matters, so I understand.

			Titan,  This may depend where in Switzerland you end up living.  For me my partner is still in the UK with our children (we are still together just living in different countries), When I tried to change my tax to someone with children I was told it was not possible as they do not live here, however, the tax office proposed a solution to this that any money I sent back to the UK to cover bills etc should be sent back under a bank transfer with a heading of maintenance.  They then said just claim this amount back in the annual tax return.  They have not asked for any formal documentation etc so as previously stated it may depend on where you end up but if I were you I would just give the tax office a ring and explain your situation as see what they say.

			Hi Thread,  
it isn't so difficult to understand this kind of things here    
it is very simple indeed, in Schaffhausen you pay higher taxes, but the rents are much lower as in Zürich.....so , don't worry too much about    
btw, Schaffhausen is very special and has a lots of pitoresk places to see, the people there are close to country people and if they like you , you'll feel like at home ....I guess you will like this little place....and if not, then feel free to ask for a little helping hand     
have a nice start into the new week

			Sorry, to clarify, what I mean is that on the annual salary+tax report that one's work gives to its employees, are the cantonal and municipal taxes reported in the same number as with the Federal taxes? For example (I am completely making these numbers up, just as an example), if I made 10.000 CHF, federal tax was 12%, cantonal tax was 4%, and municipal tax was 4%, would the tax breakdown on an annual report look like A or B?   
A) 
Income: 10.000 CHF 
Federal Tax: 1.200 CHF 
Cantonal Tax: 400 CHF 
Municipal Tax: 400 CHF   
B) 
Income: 10.000 CHF 
Tax: 2.000 CHF

If the Zahlungsbefehl / payment summons was withdrawn, the entry is deleted anyway. If you did the Rechtsvorschlag and the company that says you owe them money doesn't sue you in court over the amount, the entry will remain in the registry for up to 20 years. There's nothing you can do about that, other than trying to persuade the initiator of the payment summons to withdraw it.

3802	Financebankingtaxation	Payments in Switzerland	Superfast	1215	2	Location: Zurich	08.06.2011, 10:37	"    I understand the system now. 
I hope this may be helpful.   
When you are doing a payment (red slip) in UBS e-banking, if the account is not recognized you need to have a lot of details.   
So, the best is to have an account that the system recognizes.   
I asked another accounts from Orange and when UBS recognizes it, it is very straightforward.   
One more detail: i only had the account.

			We take our visa card and our maestro. We take money out of the wall at ATM's with the maestro - maybe $300 at a time or more, pay for things with cash when we can, and use the visa otherwise for big purchases. But cash is risky to carry around in big chunks.    
There are places where you can use the maestro to pay, sometimes. Also check at hotels and such as another poster said - you might be able to pay in CHF.  Traveler's checks are a pain in the butt, IMHO.    
Have fun.

3806	Financebankingtaxation	UK National Insurance refund?	lusonomad	1081	3	Location: Geneva	17.06.2011, 12:53	   My husband is in a similar situation, as he is not working.      There could be something you can do via HMRC in UK and then Switzerland, we are going through the process at the moment, which is getting the right documentation from HMRC for Switzerland and have been told this could take up to 4 months and then whatever needs to happen in Switzerland so not a quick process. It is not a refund, just be the same as she would be entitled to if living in the UK.      My husband is non resident in the UK, your girlfriend might have to be the same, I would recommend she calls this number +44 191 203 7010, explain situation, in Switzerland, not working, worked in UK blahblah, they could ask her to complete a formto request a statement of national insurance contrubitions, please note they ask for 3 - 5 years of P45, P11ds and final payslips in March for the last 3-5 years, luckily I had all this!!! Then HMRC sends the statement to you, this is the part which takes around 4 months and then you have to do something in Switzerland but we have not got that far yet so unsure if it is the RAV or somewhere else.     On another note, my husband has recently registered with RAV, although we are not entitled to anything as he has not worked in Swizterland he has a consultant which is good, better than no help if not working.

			As 10:30 says above, an SBB ticket machine was rigged - a few people I know got done by that one.   
If they get your PIN then they'll make virtually simultaneous withdrawals in a few cities around the world, to break the daily limit (they create multiple copies of your card and work as a team).  If they don't get your PIN they make a fake card just with your strip data and use it in a backwards country (usually the US) where no PIN is used, and so they just use the signature and fake ID to match the name they put on the copied card.   
In both cases your card stays with you, and the first you know about it is when you get your statement or the bank blocks your card.

TBH, try to calculate the real cost of the meat, poultry including taxes and see if it's worth it, and/or change up your menus to reduce the amount of meat/poultry you bring. You can check prices on online shopping sites for CH like coop.ch and leshop.ch

re the domicile part, most countries operate a 6 month rule - if you live in that country more than 6 months you pay most of your tax there, but you would still tax in Ireland for the first partial tax year.

			Ok, about skiing you convinced me that I'm not that old    
My conclusion about the time to move is that basically anytime should be fine from a tax perspective (for a permanent move, and not considering relocation bonuses received at the wrong time). 
By moving early in the UK tax year you could spare yourself from all/most of the UK income tax for some months - but this would actually be a false economy since by moving those few months earlier the extra Swiss pay would overwhelm the saved UK tax (especially with the falling pound now at 1.37  ). 
So, the best time to move would then mostly depend on the job opportunities, and the weather...   
Thanks everybody!

			Hello,   
I want to order vodka from Germany (a brand which is not sold in Switzerland). 
I've read many posts about the import duties, but few discuss about alcohol.   
Can someone check my calculations ? Thanks.   
-  the bottle (3l) costs 175 chf (without the germany 19% tax) 
-  the shipping is 25 chf 
-  there is no duty tax since it's sent from the EU 
-  the monopol tax is 29 chf per liter of 100% alcohol, so i pay (40 % * 3 liters) * 29 = 35 chf 
-  the vat is 8% so i pay (175 + 25 + 35) * 8% = 19 chf   
+ handling fees from DHL ?     
Thanks.

You think that the money could be somewhere in some sort of electronic limbo still?

			Hi all,   
A couple of questions about how AHV works for a small sole proprietorship. My understanding is that it's about 10% of pre-tax profit (since the person and the business are one and the same). Now, I'd read it's up to a max of 3k/month for married couples, with ""normal"" jobs. Does this max apply to a sole proprietorship? If the business were to become a GmbH or AG, how would the AHV work?     
Many thanks for the help.

The service with AMEX might be good but you bloody well pay for it!   
To the OP, I think one of the supermarket credit cards (Migros or Coop) have pretty good deals on fees.  Haven't got time to dig up the info but check out their websites.

3842	Financebankingtaxation	Unfair Betreibung from my wife	Dillinger_85	2265	13	Location: Zürich	23.05.2011, 21:56	" 
			
			Hi to every, body. Thanks to all of You for the replyes. Yes I would reject it definietly just like st2lemans said but I must first speak to my lawyer (I couldnt reach him today) and I must oppose it, those are definietly not my debts...   
To Upthehatters2008: It was nothing said for repayment, it was just decided that everything in our apartment belongs to her and I didnt contest, it was decide that my little doughter should live together with my wife, that I have to pay child support, that I already left the appartment and my wife would use it, and that from now on we would live ""getrent"" (not ""geschiden"") for unlimited period of time... 
It was pretty much all...   
I got a letter from our landlord that our appartment months salary was not payed for a long period of time after I left the appartment and it was like 14.000 and he was asking half of them 7.000, although I was giving money every month to my wife to take carre for it because she was ""arbeitslos"". My lawyer refused it and wrote back that i didnt have enough resources to pay it...This amount I am ready to pay but definietly not 28.000!!!

			Thanks for the info about the investment company. I'll look into that, although it sounds as though the sums involved would need to be quite substantial to make it worthwhile the extra costs?      You'd be right if the share price remained constant. However share prices always adjust (though not perfectly) to take account of the dividend - the share price the day after the dividend is paid, is lower by the amount of the dividend. If this was not the case, there would be some pretty cool arbitraging to be done... But I've never heard of people doing the sell/re-buy thing though here in CH, so either my understanding of the taxation of dividends is wrong, or there is another trick here I'm not aware of...??   
I don't think the same applies for funds, as the notional interest payment is only notional (for tax declarations) - it doesn't lead to a fall in fund price. But by avoiding owning the fund on the date of the notional interest payment, you have nothing to declare. (my understanding is that the notional interest is only calculated/reported once a year, so you just avoid that day).

3845	Financebankingtaxation	Tax return - where to declare revenue not yet received?	Sorensen	1770	2	Location: Portugal	23.05.2011, 13:02	" 
			
			It's not revenue, but an asset or wealth for Swiss tax purposes. (Capital gains most likely does not apply.) It's normally a matter of hours, or even minutes, between selling shares and being credited for the sale of shares.   
However, if this was no the case, you could show the final amount you did eventually receive. If your total wealth is below the taxable level (about CHF250,000 of the top of my head) it's not going top be taxed anyway...

Now you can only get hold of the total ""taxable amount and assets"". Not as bad as in the older times

Much easier would be to take out a number of mortgages, one fixed at a certain rate for a certain number of years, through to one variable at a percentage point above LIBOR.   
At present, the chances of Swiss interest rates rising are still very low since the CHF is already too high, and an increase would send its value skywards.

Anyway, we must pay bills - most of them telephone, accountant etc automatically debit our bank account with a form we signed. Now I have the condo manager telling me that our quarterly payment is not being paid by the bank. Is there a special form I can give or get from the bank to authorize them to pay the managment company? 
Thanks

3855	Financebankingtaxation	Doing consultancy in switzerland.	schwartzberg	2762	2	Location: hamburg	19.05.2011, 09:24	" 
			
			When I was going to take up a consultancy job in Switzerland a few years ago, I have asked about the process. (This was what I was told then)   
I will need a work permit and the only way I can get one is to be employed by a Swiss Company. Since I am freelancing with my own company, I cannot get a work permit using my UK company. I was pointed to a specialist company (I forgot the term for it) and they have presence in Switzerland and can employ me as their consultant. This way they can pay my fee after tax etc and apply for work permit for me. I think at the time, it works out under and around 20%. Since I am working in non-EU and not resident in UK during that period, I do not have to pay UK tax and the income is paid to me personally as swiss tax-paid; I would be extremely foolish to bring such income back into UK.   
If you need to know the company name, PM me and I can search in my email. They do this for people all around the world.

3857	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on Travel Between UK and Switzerland	MarmiteVsVegemite	1690	13	Location: UK	12.05.2011, 17:19	" 
			
			I have been an IT contractor in the UK for a very long time and is currently in the middle of move to Switzerland. I might be able to help with this expense thing as I lived out of a suitcase for a long time.   
First of all, where is your salary is being paid? in the UK or in Switzerland? If it is UK, then you have nothing to worry about tax as it is all PAYE. (my understanding is that you are an employee)   
Secondly, there is something call P11D per year that you need to fill in if you claim expenses. That is expenses paid out of your pocket and even if you claim in full, you still have to pay for it. The thing HMRC is going to get you on most is private car use (i.e. mileage allowance). So to avoid this paperwork, get a company credit card and use taxi/public transport for ALL your expenses, then you do not have to fill this in. Besides having a company credit card, it is down to your company to sort out the bills; just remember to keep all receipts.    
Thirdly, try not to do this shuttling too much. A week split into two places are going to get to you very quickly. I can cope with one location once a week, even with that I tends to do like ""commuting"" every fortnight. It is not about the cost but your time as well. Traveling is dead time. You have to get to airport early, hang around, delay, waiting for luggage etc. I could write a book about airport and airlines, especially BA! The novelty will wear off very quickly. Besides if you only in Switzerland 3 days a week with no weekend, you got your workload to finish, so early start - late finish; when are you going to experience the Swiss life?   
Just my 2p worth.   (still can't work out the equalvant in CHF)

			It is not only the banks that will ask.   
Where are you declaring your taxes and have all these small accounts been fully declared previously?   
CH taxes are on  . Although in itself the additional tax you may pay may not be that great, you do run the risk of being fined, on top of a request for back taxes, if the authorities think you are trying to pull a fast one.   
Clearly donations/inheritance falls outside of funny business, however, it still needs to be declared.   
It really does depend how much you are talking about. That said, I've transfered amounts up to 10,000 CHF without any queries.   
Indeed I transfered money from the UK to a value of 50,000 CHF without questions asked by the bank. But these have been from UK mainlaind (vs. off-shore accounts) to CH accounts, and I was a customer for several years prior to this.      In my experience, it is a legit question posed by the OP.

			Check with your employer. They should be able to tell you what scale your are being taxed on. In fact, it's the employer that fills in a form and gets the notification of the correct tax scale to use, so it might be that they haven't changed your status.   
Your employer can contact the tax office and get it clarified.   
The other option is to spend a few hundred francs and ask a tax agent to look at it for you.

3878	Financebankingtaxation	CHF foreign exchange highs and lows	Shove	46844	553	Location: Zürich	24.10.2008, 12:59	"    From an investment point of view, an increased rate is of course better and would increase the net present value of anyone swapping GBP for CHF.  Great Britain had admitted it's in recession and it's not alone.  The swiss franc is historically viewed as being a ""safe"" currency and therefore it always strengthens when times are hard in the financial markets.  I imagine the GBP will fall further against the CHF over the next few weeks in spite of it gains in the last few days.

			you have to complete customs form 18.44 for any household goods you are bringing in and be sure to tell them that you are still moving and that this is not the last shipment.  You have to have owned these things for (I think) 6 months for them to be tax free.

Why would a Swiss bank take risk in a US market, over which they have little impact and no means of control should it all go pear-shaped. Furthermore, do you think a Swiss bank would want to get involved in personal debts (aka mortgages) in the home - pardon the pun - of the whole subprime crisis?

As far as I'm aware, each Kanton has it's own SRO, you can't pick and choose, and for Kanton Zürich it's Polyreg.  Happy to stand corrected on this point, though.

My advice would be to deal only by letter, registered, and preferably through a lawyer.   
I used to work for a company in the UK who used them for bad debt collections. We dumped them after their highly aggressive and legally dubious methods started impacting our brand. I can't imagine their Swiss arm is any better.

			You need not to worry. At the end of the year, the rate that is taken in account is the annual rate. So, your company will look your annual salary and the annual rate and do all the adjustment.   
It's normal that you pay more as tax in the month where bonuses are paid. Just keep a watch on dec pay slip.

If you come from a war-torn country then you have my full support since money is a secondary issue (for those with a chip on the shoulder, many would say I come from one of those).   
With 60k for two people you are on the poverty line. Not because I only buy vegetable at globus (where was that sarcasm emoticon?) but because the statistics say so:      
As extensively discussed in other threads, it doesn't mean you won't live well and be happy. But it all depends on what you currently have in London and what your expectations are.

			I got married to my Swiss wife in Spring 2009. I got nice letter soon after from the Gemeinde asking me to fill in a small provisional tax return for that year, so they could work out roughly what I earned/owed. Plus they wrote to my employer telling them not to take off the tax at source any more.   
I then got a bill (provisional) for the whole year. At the year's end, I had to fill in a proper tax return (just for me) and my wife had to fill in her return alone as she had always done.   
We've just filled in the return for 2010. This is the first year we've done it together. Someone may be able to explain this better than me, but yes, basically they add together your incomes and tax it all at the same rate.   
That was in Kanton Zürich, not sure if the rules would be different in Berne.

			Hi, can any forum member advise on whether the three year restriction from date of deposit on use of funds in Swiss 2eme or 3eme for purchase of primary residence applies equally to transferred funds from a UK pension that have been in the UK pension for many years?   
I would like to use UK pension funds immediately as part of the primary property purchase, and have them 'franked' by one of my 2 or 3 eme schemes as their funds ultimately.   
Any views would be appreciated.

if you want to have the money = VAT back fom EU country declare it at the customs and in this case pay the Swiss VAT in Switzerland by arriving. You get the EU VAT back with the global blue. With global blue you pay handling fee.

There are so few rentals available in the community I want to live in, so we are considering buying a house. 
We have never paid taxes in the States - I have been a stay-at-home mom or worked part-time. My husband is the breadwinner. 
So can anyone give me advice of where to go to get pre-approved for a mortgage loan in the States? It would have to be based on my husband's credit rating. 
We can totally afford this, it's just our foreign-ness... 
Thanks for any advice or direction!

But everyone can write a letter with signature stating that informations are to be kept with the tax department only.

I have installed the Clubmaker finance system and first things first. I have prepared an excel file, or should I say a CSV file.

3927	Financebankingtaxation	No capital gains tax on real estate - REINVESTMENT	Flower	7605	20	Location: Zurich	04.04.2011, 12:39	" 
			
			If one lives in a different canton in my case Zurich but owns a holiday property in Valais where is the capital gains tax due to be paid, i assume rates differ from canton to canton for this?    
I have also heard that I can offset improvements and fees ( including estate agent fees) against this exeptionally high CGT is that true? Anybody know?   
Also anybody know a good English speaking accountant on the French side that would be happy to help me with these 'offsets'?    
Just one more question  the estate agents are giving me commision rates to see of 4 or 5%. I am finding this outrageous especially since it appears they just want to sit on their arses and do sweet .... for that very tidy huge sum ! What is the normal rate on the French side or any side for that matter? I am going round and round in circles at the moment trying to get the CORRECT info.    
thanks

3928	Financebankingtaxation	Do I need to pay duty on bike imported from UK	sarvesh.saxena	2319	2	Location: Basel	08.04.2011, 02:02	" 
			
			If you have the option of taking a bike over as removal goods, then go for it. And even if you do not, it would still be worth while if you are going across and can bring it back yourself.   
I brought my mike from the UK when moving here, and looking at the bike prices here in CH, I'm glad i did. I payd £450 for my hard tail mountain bike in the UK. Granted this was a very good campaign offer at Evans Cycles which saved me a few hundred pounds when i bought it, but looking at equivalent bikes from Scott or Gary Fisher here in CH the prices range from CHF 1600 to 2100, so there is still a significant difference in prices even whe adding the 8% VAT.   
No idea what the prices in FR are like, but DE is more in line with the UK and worth a look if removal goods is not an option.

3935	Financebankingtaxation	Offshore companies and Swiss companies	ducky	2148	3	Location: Zürich region	05.04.2011, 21:44	"    I was certain i would be getting answers like this. I'll answer this: 
- As you probably don't know, in switzerland entrepreneurs pay taxes on the corporate level AND the individual level. I pay for sure more taxes than most swiss, and certainly more than you. According to your logic, since I pay more taxes, I am therefore more responsible (obviously this is stupid reasoning). 
- Like I said, i'm not trying to avoid taxes all together (again, I already pay a lot of taxes since I am taxed twice). I'm just trying to find a LEGAL solution to pay a bit less. I believe offshore accounting is legal to some extend because most multi-national corporations do it (google, procter&gamble, microsoft, ect.). why wouldn't I be allowed to do it? I don't mind paying taxes (like you say, we need schools, etc.) but I don't want to pay more than I have to.   
Back to my question, how can one legally bring a portion of the Swiss profits offshore? Please only answer if you actually help.

			The key point is were you and when taxed under withholding tax or direct tax regime. The former would basically be if you have a permit B, do not own Swiss property and are not married to a Swiss, and this even if you filled out a tax return etc.  Your data doesnt quite make this clear enough.   
Under the withholding tax regime you are taxed on your earnings in the cantons you lived in when you earned the money.  This is different from the direct tax regime where you are taxed in full for that year in the canton of residence at 31.12.   
This is complicated enough, but you have split tax regime and split year, and all in December.  So for example I think the switch to direct tax comes in the month after your change... but Im not sure.   
Calling the tax office is a great idea, and if they dont give you a clear and unambiguous answer you will need to get a bit of knowledgeable advice.  In ZG go to Bruno Bosshardt (no connection but did help me with a similar problem a few years ago).    
What however is pretty sure is you can choose to pay less than the tax bill from ZG if you genuinely believe your final tax bill in ZG will be nil.

3943	Financebankingtaxation	B Permit holder - odd comment from tax adviser?	TheConways	2641	13	Location: Geneva	31.03.2011, 18:32	"    What I mean is simply that the effort to do the tax return and put in all required documents when you do not need to do a return depends on what you earn and whether you have enough investments/scope for getting back the taxes paid.   
Maybe I forgot to mention that once you do a tax return, you HAVE to do it every year without fail. Otherwise it might lead to *irregularities* as maybe was your case.       Doing or not doing a tax return depends on your earnings, and not on whether you are on QS or not. It is always safe to inquire from the tax office (local/cantonal) about whether you   to do it or not...when you have done it once and are not   to do it the second time.      Again, as I said, if you think it is justified to do a return even when you do not have to, you are free to do it.

			Banks hate receiving funds from Russia. You should keep Source of Funds proof in the back of your mind whenever you transfer money. Any bank can request this on any transfer they like, and in Switzerland can apply in secret to the SRO to have the money frozen by FINMA and you investigated. If it's under 50k you will probably be OK though, however there's no guarantee.

			Hello, I am kindly asking a question relating to Swiss Code of Obligation:  
I am concluding the construction contract. The Employer is obliged to pay a contract price. If he delays the payment - what rate of interests should he pay to the contractor? Does article 104 of Swiss Code of Obligation apply (and he may not pay less than 5 %) or the parties are free to agree in a contract lawer rate? I was told that this article 104 applies only to the late payments which are not contractual payments (e.g. damages).  
If anyone can answer me I would be gratefeull.  
Best regards

			At worst you would be paying 8% MWSt on the lot. You would definitely need to be there when importing them. If you cross at a large border, the agent on the south side would help you complete the forms for about CHF 30. You need to make an inventory of each box and place a second hand value on every numbered box.    
There are plenty of border crossings near Basel, why not ask them for advice?

			Hi   
Not sure if you've managed to find a solution to this, but if you visit  , it could be possible to help you find your UK credit report.   
Whilst you'd still have to go through security checks, it sounds like there would still be a record of you in the UK, via the accounts that are still active.    
Information on your credit file generally lasts for 6 years, but it sounds like it should be easier for you to return as lenders here will already have a record of you.    
Hope this helps...

			I have had a bit of a surf of the Forum and have not quite found what I am looking for so apologies if this is repetative....   
I have been living in Switzerland for 17 years and loved it but I think its time to go... although I am a bit scared I am increasingly getting the feeling its time to return back to Australia where I was born and where my closest family all live. For whatever reason I am more homesick than I have ever been!   
Soooo I am looking for someone, or a company, that understands the tax laws in both countries as obviously I would like to avoid paying a massive tax bill on my hard earned pension fund and I am not sure in general how the whole process works.    
I am Aust/Swiss (my father was Swiss) and I have dual nationality/citizenship so am able to keep bank accounts and monies here but eventually I would like to buy property back home and don't want to wait until retirement to get my hands on it. I know I can take it with me but the tax is most likely going to take a sizable chunk? Thus my search for advice.   
Perhaps there is someone out there that has a smiliar question or has been through this themselves. I would be super grateful for anyone out there in the Forum that may have some contacts or advice they could share.... 
Very many thanks to all of you

			Did your UBS consultant tell you about the 3B accounts?  If you have a 3A account with them you can put twice the annual 3A limit into a 3B account and get the same interest rate as for 3A. It's to encourage long-term saving, but doesn't have the 3A tax benefits.

3969	Financebankingtaxation	Lump-Sum Expenses are to be declared as Salary income?	pinipon	1304	0	Location: Zürich	23.03.2011, 17:53	" 
			
			Hi all,    
I am preparing my Swiss Tax Return and have some doubts concerning how to declare the salary:   
a) Do I have to declare the Expenses Lump Sum my husband is granted as an executive? It is located in the Lohnausweis right under the withholding tax and is called ""Spesenvergütungen"". My doubt is whether it is considered a non-taxable Refund of expenses or part of the salary. I have read the ""instructions"" of the Steuererklärung and it states that the amount of salary income to be declared is the figure stated in the certificate as Nettolohn. The amount I am making reference to is underneath the Nettolohn, so I don't know how to deal with it.   
b) The same question regarding the amount the company paid last year to a tax advisor to prepare my tax form, which is part of the 2010 salary. Do I add it to the Gross salary income?   
Anyone has experience with these issues?   
Thanks in advance.

			You have to distinguish between Permit B holders - tax at source  and Permis C holders they make a tax declaration.   
For this people with tax declaration there is no need to send all the Lohnausweise. This is only for tax at source people when they want to deduct the piller 3A payments. In the percentage = bareme for the tax at source payments is already a deduction ( health insurance etc. ) included.  
Swiss people normally makes tax declaration.

			I've only worked for one Swiss employer (other than myself), but expenses were not an issue. (And never were for any UK employer for that matter, though I heard similar stories to the above - I guess I got lucky). You put the claim in, your boss gives it the once over, signs it, you get the money. OK, when I took my Parisian colleagues to the Buddha Bar (Kobe beef, rather than steak) for dinner one time, I did call him first to ok the extra expense. After all, any expenses come out of his budget - it's up to him to control it, not some HR drone or bean counter. I suppose other companies may have different set ups.   
I'd suspect HR are being blurry with the truth. For my part, working for my own company, I often expense meals. I don't know the details, but it does appear that only portion of the cost is tax deductable. The fact that tax can't be claimed back above a certain amount is irrelevant to whether it's an expense!

3974	Financebankingtaxation	Working 50% - paying tax like 100%???!!	Rossel	2667	16	Location: Yverdon	23.02.2011, 13:54	" 
			
			Sorry it took me so long, to get back to this thread with the answer   
Well, in short Mgosia was right!   
The authorities tax everyone as if they work 100%. BUT, your employer just need to fill out a declaration, that you're only at x-percent, and therefore just need to pay the corresponding taxrate. This can be done when you begin your work, and so the tax-office won't send you a bill.    
If, you already have payed to much, just go to the tax-office and explain the situation. Your employer will have to sign the declaration regarding your working percentage, and then you will get your money back - in the end of year I suspect... 
I don't know if it's only possible for the past year or how it works.    
In the end, we didn't have to pay anything because we're leaving CH and therefore the tax office would speed up the process and instead of giving us our money back in the end of 2011, we didn't have to pay now.    
SO, if you find that your monthly income doesn't match the list I have linked to before (not the same for each canton), then go to the tax-office. We had a very pleasant experience with the office in Lausanne - nice and helpfull people    
I can't help to think it's a bit weird, that they charge you 100% just to be sure. And they actually asked my girlfriend several times, if she's really only working 50% percent - like they suspect her for doing work on the side... But anyway it's sorted now   
Thanks to everyone for the help. If anyone need further explanation on this, then please don't hesitate to ask me!

I am in the process of filling the form to claim back Verrechnungssteuer on my interest gained in bank. I paid Withholding Tax (Quellensteuer) and do not need to fill in a Steuererklärung normally.   
Could anyone tell me what a Steuerwert is? I know I need to put in my total interest gained (as Bruttoertrag) but what should I fill in for Steuerwert and Bezeichnung der Vermögenswerte (name of bank or account?)

			How weird because I have been today been researching this topic!!   
I visited the Poste and the BCV (Vaud Bank) 
and they do not charge for for UK residents who own property here.   
To run the a/c was 3 or 5 CHFs a month. The UBS usually charge 7 CHfs a month and they told me that the 30CHfs charge is for every a/c so if you have 3 different ones it is 90CHFs a month plus I think the 7 on top!!!!   
I expect there is a Valaisian bank who will be more sympathetic or if not go to the Poste

Firstly, I've highlighted your first spelling mistake, you are missing an  A .       Considering your position, I'd invest some time and consult a tax expert in advance on how to optimize your tax return and maybe even how to structure your company ownership.   
You may want to check out the taxation thread (205):     
or here     
Wishing you all the best for the move.

yes, a CER is worth about EUR 15 right now, but they have traded for EUR 20 and even 30 before. The consensus is that they will trade lower going forward for the next few years at least.   
but no, its not like a stock. you cannot hold them in your trading / brokerage account.    
and most important, they do not trade on stock exchanges. indeed they do not trade on a normal exchange at all. they are traded between large companies, usually through 'brokers'. if you have 100 or even 1000, you are basically 'up sh1t creek without a paddle' cause most corporates are looking for trading them in lots of 10,000 or more.

			My employer directs my pay to accounts in UK, France and Switzerland.  (Don't ask, it's a long story).   
The money is always in all three accounts on payday, like clockwork.   
If I transfer money, it typically takes 1 day to Switzerlnad, 2 to France, and 2-3 to UK.

			I applied for it but i will not get it. It is not possible for me because of FamZV art. 7 abs. 1 that says that one cannot get in the case when there is no international agreement/treaty between two countries regarding this subject and there is no such an agreement with USA. So i got denial here. 
It seems that if your kids are in USA you cannot do anything with taxes.

4010	Financebankingtaxation	Owing money to UBS	structural	3209	3	Location: US	02.03.2011, 03:29	" 
			
			Hi and welcome to the forum.    
I would contact the bank and discuss how to go about repaying the monies to them.   
I am a little confused, however.   They transferred the monies twice but failed to chase you for the erroneous second payment?  Could it be that you actually had enough monies in your bank to cover the transaction twice?  If so, then you don't owe them a thing.   
As suggested already, best call them to sort everything out.

4012	Financebankingtaxation	English speaking financial lawyer in zurich??	transatlantic	1237	0	Location: Zurich	01.03.2011, 14:45	" 
			
			Hello there,    
I am looking for a english speaking Lawyer in Zurich/Glattbrugg that deals with financial issues. I looked up on here and the most I found was family/divorce lawyers. I also looked on the embassy website, however I am thinking those will be big name lawyers and firms so a bit more expensive. Especially having an office address on Banhofstrasse!!!   SO I was hoping to get someone on here who has had good experience with someone who they could recommend. Also, if you don't mind posting what I may be looking at in fees.   
Long story short, is my husband's old agency between him and his employer is insiting we pay a HUGE fee   when they were wrong in the first place in their calculations in which we informed them. Thanks for anything you can suggest!   "	Posts: 268	Join Date: Jul 2008	Senior Member	Groaned at 8 Times in 5 Posts	Thanked 137 Times in 63 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Viseca ( ) used to be quite liberal about their credit cards and issued credit cards to B permit holders. It is worth checking out. Other large banks often ask for a deposit equal to the limit of the credit line, which effectively makes the card a debit card instead of credit.   
P.S. I think CornerBank ( ) is similar to Viseca and offers credit cards.

4015	Financebankingtaxation	Taxes for part-time work - graduate student	RS13	1698	0	Location: Zurich, Switzerland	28.02.2011, 19:12	" 
			
			Hi All,   
Wondering if anyone could help      
I'm a masters student at ETH Zurich, and have been offered part-time employment (outside of the university) in an engineering consulting firm (I have a couple of years of work experience already before I started this degree). They are flexible enough and said they can formalise it into an internship if need be as it is closely related to my studies.    
Just received a draft contract and it says that I would be employed as a free-lance contractor, which means that I am responsible to pay not just  taxes, but also admin costs (invoicing for my time)/insurance - and so these are not covered in my hourly wage. Does anyone know what is the tax rate, and also insurance costs for part-time work/internship for university students? The are offering an hourly wage that is about the same as what the university is offering for teaching assistants (grad students) - about 25chf per hour. But I dont know whether those employed by universities are responsible to pay for these additional admin costs as well as taxes?    
I am wondering if it would be wise to ask for a bit more (or if that is even acceptable in Switzerland...) to cover for these costs? I've never worked on a 'free lance' basis before. In my previous workplaces my salary packages have always covered all the 'extras' (taxes/pension fund, etc), and also I have never had to deal these 'self-employment costs'.    
Thanks in advance!   
Cheers   
RS13

4018	Financebankingtaxation	2nd versus 3rd Pillar + some other questions	defcon3	1445	0	Location: Geneva	26.02.2011, 19:59	" 
			
			Hi there, folks,    
From what I understand the 2nd pillar pension cannot be inherited, whereas 3rd pillar accounts are as easy as other bank accounts.    
I am at a stage, where I am trying to optimize my savings and investments in the best possible way with an investment horizon of 5-10 years. At the same time, I have some years to buy back for 2eme pillar and I am considering if I should:   
a) buy back the 2nd pillar years, fully aware these go to the canton and are not transferable/inheritable by spouse 
b) screw 2nd pillar and invest all money in 3rd pillar, paying tax for surplus above tax-deductible threshold    
Honestly, I am hoping for a ""secret option number three"" where I can invest my savings, save on taxes and remain flexible/liquid without feeding the canton in case of disaster... but hey, can't have it all in one. Or can I?

			To all appt owners who belong to a PPE (Eigentumswohnung), do you receive a summary of the year's PPE charges from the PPE administrator for your tax return? If not, how did you justify it on the return? We didn't receive anything from ours and we have now sacked them and have a new admin., so they are unlikely to be forthcoming or helpful (partly why they were sacked in the 1st place). Did you use a bank statement, or just add in a copy of the payment slip and specify it is x12 (or whatever)?

			Spoke to the Zurich tax authorities today, the difference is due to the federal tax.  This although makes me worry a bit about how many (more) years I'm going to have to wait to see if the federal side will also try to send me a bill.  I filed 2007 taxes, and have never heard anything from the federal tax authorities, I'm leaving now in 2011, so it seems up to 2015 I may have to expect a follow up bill....

			If you are employed in Scotland you will pay taxes in Scotland. Then you will declare this taxes paid on your family tax declaration in Switzerland and your Swiss taxes will be reduced accordingly. Simply speaking...   
As others have said, easiest would be if the company you work for in Scotland has a branch in Switzerland and they pay your salary from there.

The tax authorities have to not believe that this is accurate and then they will scrub the amount and reassess. As long as you do not deliberately lie you are okay. The fact that you paid AHV and Tax implies this was a part of your income and therefore will be on your salary sumamry for the year. So dont worry claim the full amount.

4033	Financebankingtaxation	Paying more tax when you have an incomplete year of earning?	sambrightman	1234	9	Location: Zug	15.02.2011, 14:18	"    Generally you should expect to receive a small bill. The usual reason for this is that there has been an extra payment such as a 13th salary or a bonus that is then annualized. ie the average monthly salary is increased and this is then extrapolated to give your synthetic annualized salary. You might think that you pay per month the correct amount but this is all done according to an annualized table and not each month totally individually. If your salary pro rata was high enough you can then make some decent deductions which will produce your anticipated refund.

I just thought that it was strange that you have to have pending collateral seizures or defaults in order to be approved...or I guess it may be a glitch in the matrix :mamoru:

4038	Financebankingtaxation	Can UK employee working on contract in Switzerland have taxes deducted?	mr cricket	2654	1	Location: Basel	14.02.2011, 08:08	" 
			
			As far as I know, and I'm not an international tax or company lawyer...   
If you work in Switzerland, you have to pay Quellensteuer (= tax at source - think PAYE). When you were an employee of the agency, they should have made this deduction before paying you. Working via a UK ltd company is problematic. As a Swiss resident, you're obliged to pay Swiss taxes. Did your UK ltdco make and tax payments on your behalf? I'd guess not. And therein lies the problem. The Basel tax authorities want their cut. The agency have discovered they've screwed up royally.   
If you do owe tax, then the agency may be right in withholding it. You should demand a complete breakdown and explanation of deductions. Tell them that if they don't give you this breakdown then you will raise the issue with the Basel tax authorities. You should probably take some local legal advice.    
What was the type of work permit you had? L or B? Or something else?

Likewise I've had solo test-drives of Z4s (a customers car waiting for delivery no less), RS Meganes, 911 turbos etc. No one has ever asked to see a permit, only a driving licence and a UK one was fine. I also have a test drive in a Ferrari F430 lined up whenever I want to take it.

You may either leave your pillar 2 invested in your pension here with your employer, or cash it in at the time you are leaving. You can choose to invest these funds in a number of ways as an expatriate.   
Your pillar 1 must remain within your pension investment as this is the obligatory part of your pension.

			The processing fee is CHF 18 (regardless of value).   
Any customs fee is generally much less than the 8% VAT (if there is one).   
And, if you fail to declare something, the penalty is 2x VAT (plus the VAT itself).

I am still registered at the commune as I have the intention of returning and asked to keep my permit for a year - can you explain why/how you think a cash payment is possible?   
And as far as I know I can only use the money to buy a house if it is going to be my principal home - ie I live there - or for my family - and that applies for CH and UK - is that different to what you know?   
Dear Fudge,   
Sorry for this confusion,.....I should have written it more clearly... 
A cash payment is NOT possible as long as you have not been deregistered officially in Switzerland.    
The fact that you have asked to maintain your permit is a proof that you have not left Switzerland permanently....so once this is done, then you can ask for the cash payment.   
If you have settled down in a EU-country, then you cannot cash in the mandatory part...except you do it for buying a house....The condition is that you are living yourself in your property abroad...

4046	Financebankingtaxation	Dodge Church taxes	andreaa	2894	24	Location: Zurich (not yet)	07.02.2011, 22:24	" 
			
			I would write a letter to archbishop about possibility of mistake being made here stating clearly ""agnostic"" therefore not liable for church taxes in Switzerland. Wait, on the other hand, I would cut the middle man and I would address it directly to Vatican via papal fast delivery. Even better, send it via grey pigeons - Rome is down south afterall and let the birds have fun while enjoying a rewarding trip to somewhat warmer climate zone. Do you want link to site where they sell pigeons?   
Last year I did it, because I believed in strong roots of my Dutch reformed church and riding on the wave of glory, I wouldn't allow my taxes to be unevenly redistributed. I know it might take weeks or even months to get a reply and the whole matter to be settled but having some good contacts with my Swiss friends who know some of their family members and uncles in famous Swiss Guard, I eventually succeeded. Only Carabinerri (Italian police), you know, happened to be pain in the ass because the latter ones infringed Berlusconi's new imposed law and in result abused the diplomatic channels.   
But to cut the long story short I managed to reduce church tax from CHF55.99 per month to CHF5.99 plus I had to do weekly service of cleaning ecclesiastical edifice's backyard with broom and sometimes bring the milk from pastures to the fat priest. It's tough because I had to get up early in the morning and smell cowshit while listening to the cow bells. It still rings in my head this terrible sound. I tell ya..,   
I hope it will help a bit. Good luck and try to use similar way of solving your tax problems.   "	Posts: 22	Join Date: Nov 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 6 Times in 4 Posts	no particular reputation at present

For non-CH properties the declared value will come into play should you sell the place. If you then declare a value grossly in excess of your declared value expect a tax correction.   
Not an issue in some markets like UK and Ireland where properties are dropping in price right now though. I've had the same value since 1999 on my London place as currency variations have compensated for increased nominal GBPs.

But I guess you did save on the German VAT, right?   
Unless you are sending books? No tax for amounts below around Fr.200 in value (not sure exact amount)

			Hi,   
For those who have used Getax software to file their returns, might know this. What do we need to choose - Frais forfaitaire or frais effectif.   
By choosing frais forfaitaie, it grays out the ICC frais effectif field but you can still enter the IFD frais effectif field. Is it the way or is it just a simple bug?   
I mean the choice is between frais forfaitaire and frais effectif. It's either/or but not both. Thanks for your answers..

I've just had to pay Swiss taxes on all my global income and assets - the British Government is very generous in this respect, unlike the USA! HMRC have a special scheme for dealing with foreign domiciled landlords and it is pretty straightforward (especially as in my sad case where the rental income doesn't significantly exceed costs)

			Hi there - guess it's done by now but if not I just wanted to recommend that you try to phone a helpline as it isn't always quite as simple as being honest and it will all be alright - a lot of the reliefs you are entitled to are only applied if you tick the right boxes (they didn't give me my personal allowance one year because I forgot to tick the box saying I wanted it, even though I've always had it since I came here and am a UK citizen). 
If you are claiming split year treatment, the treatment may depend on whether the payment was made before or after the year was split - but do call for advice because there could be a DTA box or extra form somewhere where just an extra tick could save you money.  If there's no time now - write a comment in the box explicitly stating that whatever double taxation reliefs are available you would like them applied - it might help if you find out later that there was an extra box to tick somewhere and want to have an adjustment made.  Sorry that's not more helpful - I struggle to be sure I've found all the right boxes sometimes - and I am a qualified UK accountant!

You must file, regardless of whether you owe anything.  If you make less than $91,500 (as a previous poster said), and meet the requirements to classify as a US citizen living abroad, you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion (see link).       
If you don't (and perhaps even if you do just for peace of mind), I would recommend an accountant.

It's not relevant if things become the property of both of you AFTER the wedding. Gifts after all are given after the wedding.

			Looks like I might well be working in Basel for two years, on contract, for a German consultancy.   
I know Basel sits well on three EU states, giving one a choice of where to live, I'm just wondering what's best for our situation.   
Me - Brit born and bred.   
Partner - we are unmarried, she non-EU visa national lived together seven years now, all provable, she works in UK for a Swiss co based in, wait for it, Basel...   
My thoughts are France is more amenable to partner relationships ie PACS, Germany and CH not so, so it makes sense to live in the FR part of Basel Stadt, but I don't know where we stand tax wise, to be honest i'm not that bothered, just don't want to make a decision and regret it and move again.   
So we'd both be cross-border workers, or both be living and working in CH, which is best for tax and logistics given her non-visa status?   
We have two kids - both biologically mine and not hers, tho she is their guardian here in the PC UK..

			The Carnet ATA route is the safest but also requires a fair bit of admin and control from both sides. As these items are for testing purposes and are not for resale, I would be inclined to send them with an accompanying invoice for a nominal value stating they are ""demo / samples of no commercial value - for testing purposes only"". Do not however declare a value of only Fr. 1.-, customs do not like this and will flag the packet if it is pre-advised. A value of say Fr. 50.- would be more realistic.

			Thanks for your suggestion Jim, but this is not really an option for me. My company's HR didn't want to deal with this situation, so the only way for me to continue working remotely was for them to put me on a contract. This has its good sides as the money is better.    
Besides, isn't it better to pay taxes in Switzerland since they are lower comparing to UK?

some cantons will question the use of a car and why public transport is not being used. for example using a car daily within zone 10 of ZRH is difficult claim as an expense. you would get the public transport value (948CHF per annum) but mileage and  petrol is nearly impossible, i believe.

			Yep, as has been mentioned, you are likely to be getting a poor exchange rate instead of a fee.    
I used to use a particular airport currency exchange service as they boasted no fees. Then I noticed one day that they were giving me a rate of 1.01 euros to the UK pound, when the rate according to   was something like 1.16. An expensive lesson learned.

They did move my account from Paradeplatz to the office on Bahnhofstrasse early this year, but I never go there anyway, because I do most of my banking online. I like the fact that they have online banking in English, because I don't understand German.    
They did specify that as an American, I could only open up a basic checking, savings account, and Pillar 3a, and not invest any money (but I suppose that would be the same wherever you go in Switzerland).

			If your in Zurich here is the Quellensteuer rates for 2011, if your moving from the UK that is how you pay your income tax. National, Canton and Village averaged out and you pay that.   
This is the spreadsheet for joint earners (Type C)     
Each revenue band has 2 pages, rate with Church tax, rate without. Without church tax is ""Ohne Kirchensteuer"" The numbers C0, C1 etc are the number of kids you have.   
It might seem really low to you, but it is all about the deductions...its just figured out all for you. You'll still have to do a tax return at the end of the year though as you are over the 120k figure.   
This is for unmarried: (A)     
This is for married single earners: (B)     
I'm doing a 10% calculation for ""social"" type taxes in total..not sure if thats anywhere near accurate but thats what my potential employeer said.

We are importing our household items in a couple of weeks from Iceland. They are being shipped in a container. I have read up on form 18.44 and we have created a list of what the container contains.   
However we were told that we should get a customs broker to handle getting the container through customs at the border. Does anyone have experience with customs brokers in the Geneva/Nyon/Lausanne area that you could recommend.   
Best regards,

However, we live in the canton of Vaud where taxes are much cheaper. When we first moved here someone told us that at the end of the year we could file with the canton of Neuchatel to get reimbursed for the taxes we ""overpaid"" since we should only have to pay at the Vaud rate.    
Has anyone ever done this? If so, what was the process?

4093	Financebankingtaxation	Should I do something to say that I am not resident in UK?	jimdrake	1816	3	Location: VD	10.01.2011, 18:05	"    Perhaps I've misunderstood, but I thought that wasn't necessary if you're working, as the EU/EU-ish countries have reciprocal crediting arrangements - you'll be paying into the equivalent to NI here, and therefore receiving a 'stamp' for 2010 or whatever year when it comes to assessing payments at retirement.   
I'm not working, but reserving judgement on top-up payments.  Now that you only need a minimum of 30 years for a full pension, there's no point me overpaying at this stage; I already have 15 years of credits and am significantly more than 15 years from the payment date!

If I got something delivered to Germany (or even just went shopping there) and took a taxi to collect it (and return), would I be permitted to use the taxi driver to double my usual customs allowance?   
(Presuming I's be taking a taxi anyway - otherwise the taxi fare would be larger than any duty payments).

But each of our withholding tax rates was applied at the same % as if it were a full months salary.  It was questioned it at the time, but we did not push the subject much as they just said 'that's how it works'. We are now getting re-location costs allocated and hit with the tax increases so the subject has come up again on why it wasn't decreased.  We will be taking it up with HR, but any background info on if this is the norm, and/or who is making the decision i.e. the company or the relevant tax office. As I believe from other posts that the company is responsible for calculating the quellensteuer rate?

4107	Financebankingtaxation	Using Kanton Schwyz to reduce pension withholding tax	guest	2503	0	null	null	" 
			
			Hello,   
I'm leaving Switzerland in a few months and will be transferring my second pillar pension pot back home.  I'm in Zurich, what I've been told by some knowledgeable people is that if I first transfer the money to a blocked account in Kanton Schwyz, then transfer it to Canada I'll save a decent amount on the withholding tax that the Swiss will charge.   
If I go   it does confirm that the withholding tax is 8.3% in Zurich, and only 4.8% in Schwyz.  It also looks like Pensionkasse pro can set up such a short term account ( ).   
In general though I'm not sure if I want to wait an extra say 3 - 6 months to move the money out through Schwyz even to save the tax.  Does anyone have any first or second hand experience with this method?  Were there hiccups when moving the funds through two steps?  I can only assume that the Pensionskasse pro would want to charge a modest fee to make up for the taxes I'd be saving, is it still worth it then?   
Thanks for any feedback!

			How much money are you lending? 
With or without interest? 
Do you need any securities?   
All I guess need to be noted and signed, and if possible witnesses' signatures. 
You will also need to say how the money will be paid to your friend and how and over what period of time he will need to pay it back. If there are securities involved you will need to say when and on which conditions will they be liquidated...   
It all really depends on how much you are lending, what income your friend has, what he/she's going to do with the money and what influence do you have if he/she decides that the value of your friendship is less than that of the money lent...

If this is a case perhaps you can request them to never send such stuff.

			Hello all,   
Before I continue I must say this forum is a gold mine of information, it is greatly appreciated.   
So let me explain my situation and my goals.   
I move to work and live in Switzerland from the UK about 8 months ago and as a result it the first time I have had a disposable income. The situation is identical for my partner of almost 5 years. Currently we think we will return to the UK in the next 1.5 - 3 years and as a result want to start saving some money in GBP (or at least to be spent as GBP).   
We between us we could probably save between 20-30k CHF a year.   
So my question really is, if you were in my situation what would you do to make your money do as much work as possible for you?   
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I am currently just trying to get a picture of the options before I really explore them.   
Thank you in advance.   
Tim

4121	Financebankingtaxation	Foreclosure & Separation - does timing matter?	abosno	2425	20	Location: Frick	16.12.2010, 17:41	"    I doubt this very much. Look at the figures:   
Say you have assets ( ) of CHF1.5million made up of property, investments and cash in the bank in deposit account(s). This means in Canton Zurich the wealth tax ( ) liability on CHF1.5m will be CHF1,757.00 (taken from the 2009 tax year tables).   
So you have say, CHF250,000 in a deposit account and you withdraw all this on December 31 and reduce your wealth to CHF1.25 million. This reduces your wealth tax to CHF810.00 - saving CHF947.00.   
However: The tax on wealth even at the highest rate of 0.3% (CHF3 per 1000 held) is still lower than the current poor interest rate of 0.375%...

I would imagine you should be able to fund your trades using a specific currency sub account, and when you sell, you should be given the option to have it converted etc...   
I don't really see what the problem is, I don't think you got charged more than expected. GBP290 looks to me like 50% comission for execution of the trades, and the rest on FX charges everytime the currency is converted.   
Obviously when you look at it in the final currency CHF it would look like you only made 65% of the GBP gain....

Looking for confirmation on a rumour....   
I heard an unconfirmed rumour from a colleague that if my wife and kids were to live in Germany   from where I work and have a flat in Switzerland, I would pay all taxes, social security, health, etc. in Switzerland and nothing in Germany.    
Does anyone know if this is true?   
Thanks,

Check the tax assessment, it should show how much you have for cantonal, communal and federal tax. If the total is 13K, then you probably didn't get the credit of the Geneva tax at source. You should therefore call the number mentioned on your tax assessment and request the tax credit.

How can a B-permit holder (taxed at source) pay taxes on foreign income in Switzerland?  Is there any minimum amount of taxed income? What about the wealth tax -- does this have to be paid, even for very small amounts? 
Thanks!

			Hi all,   
have looked through forum and couldn't really see a suitable answer...   
so basically I rent  lots of cars in Switzerland and the normal excess damage waiver insurance costs about 25chf a pop per day on top of the car rental. 
I believe that there are some credit cards that provides this insurance if you pay with it, ie: swisscard.ch, which have an amex platinum which costs 720chf a year.. I guess it's a question of economics, ie: rent a car for 20 days, there goes 500chf.... but does anyone know of any other credit cards that provide this Loss damage waiver for rental cars ?   
thanks

			Yes and no. Your problem is that income taxes in germany are calculated over the whole year... which includes time spent in CH. Depending on how much money they ask from you I would consider consulting a Steuerberater - that could reduce the bill.

			Hi,    
I heard that it's possible to access the funds paid in a Swiss pension on leaving Switzerland for good, the amount depending on whether you go to an EU or non EU country. There's a very good FAQ available on the EF if you search for it.    
But the FAQ is datd 2008 and I heard from someone this evening that this process may have changed it and it is no longer possible to have this paid to you in CASH when you leave Switzerland?    
Does anyone know anything about this possible change? I'll be gutted if it's true....

I am looking for a sort of funny little xmas gift for my father-in-law. Now that he is retired, we are subtly trying to encourage him to consider moving to Switzerland to be able to spend more time with his grandson. He loves tax intricacies - specifically advantageous ones - and so we are looking for a booklet in English on this topic. I realize that there are the official government websites and such, and the fine print probably changes from time to time, but can anyone recommend something along these lines?   
If helpful, he is a British-Canadian dual citizen.   
Many thanks for any tips!

4136	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on selling a property in Switzerland ???	Cosmicgirl	2069	0	Location: English Riviera	15.12.2010, 11:58	" 
			
			Hi      Can anybody give me help on the following?   I have an apartment in Valais, which was purchased before moving to Switzerland.  I possibly may get my foreigners permit linked to this apartment this January, but maybe not ( ive been waiting 4 years)! I then have to hold the property for 5 years before I can sell it. I have since moved to Zuich so am also now an EU B permit holder.   My dilemma is I am not sure if I really want to hang onto the place for longer than 5+ years more on the time I have already owned it. So perhaps my best bet is to take my option and change it to a B permit to give me more flexibility should I wish to sell before.   Has anybody got any idea on tax implications on profit should I sell either as a B permit holder should I change the apartment to that status? Or the implications of holding it for 5 years (which will be the status foreigners permit I will have when I finally receive it) when I have left the country when?   I would be grateful for any advice or if somebody could point me in the right direction to get the correct advice.

So now that I have paid.... I have heard that you can claim it back for up to 3 years (from a book about living in der Switz that I can't remember the name of now)

4139	Financebankingtaxation	Having a tracker fund in switzerland	Alan_Zurich	1825	2	Location: Zurich	09.12.2010, 18:48	" 
			
			For a newbie a tracker fund is actually not a bad place to start. There is plenty on the internet for you to read, and I assume you settled on tracker funds as opposed to anything else based on some research you have already done. If you haven't please read up about it.   
Be wary of going to the bank to ask for advice. Banks earn very very little on tracker fund because of course they don't have to actively manage the funds. So they are more likely to push you into buying some other funds that pay them better commissions.    
Lately ETFs have become very popular. Some versions can be highly risky, so I would not recommend, but if you stick to the tracker ETFs, it provides an easy entry into tracker funds. Again, please do some research on it. I say easy entry because if you search the main banks, most have ETF tracker funds trading in Switzerland - eg., Credit Suisse ""xmtch"", and iShares (was barclays, now Blackrock).

			How to avoid  : 
any foreign bank let's call it ""bank A"" has a corresponding bank in switzerland (a bank where they have their own account) let's call it ""Bank B"". 
If you transfer from A to B you'll have no transaction fees. If you transfer from A to a different swiss bank C then some transfer costs will be charged to you (for the B to C transfert). 
The challenge is to find the corresponding bank. Thta's why if frequent transactions are involved it's worth having accounts in different banks.   
In your case for just 1 transfer it's better to have a USD account. I don't see what's wrong with what UBS did.

I am just starting to understand a little bit of the Swiss taxation particularities and I need some help with something I found out.   
According to something I read we can ask for a tax refund if we send money to our family members abroad.   
Does anyone know how does this work?   
Not only I must support some family members but I also have some legal obligations as well. 
I am sorry if this seems to vague but I really don't know what to put this ask this question properly.   
I am basically sending money every month to pay my mothers rent and I must support her financially as well.    
I have a B permit and I earn >100K / year.   
Thank you, Alex

He also told me that sometimes they might ask for additional information but in my case they did not.

4146	Financebankingtaxation	Re-importation of goods sent abroad for repair - VAT / RMA related query	guest	5807	6	null	null	" 
			
			Thanks so much!!! I'd been mostly thinking about anything that could be wrong on the Swiss side of things, but it turns out that you are correct in your guess that the problem is on the German side. The company I deal with is using a third-party broker to process the temporary importation into Germany, and it is this same broker who insists on doing the re-exportation as freight. TNT (who I normally ship with) was acting as a customs exportation broker in Switzerland but not as a customs imporation broker in Germany.   
It looks like I can arrange everything up-front by shipping it through FedEx and having them act as both the Swiss temporary exportation broker and the German temporary importation broker. (For €38 extra, of course.) They can then easily manage the re-exportation from Germany and re-importation from Switzerland because they'll have all the import/export documents in their possession already.   
You have made my day. (I only wish I knew this two weeks ago!) Green blobs coming your way shortly...

what more do you want? 'all possible taxes' depend very much on your personal circumstances e.g. compulsory health insurance: effectively a tax; some cantons have compulsory fire insurance: a tax; etc etc.   
if you earn more than 120kCHF then download the software from your canton and play with the numbers and deductions so see what the effects of the full tax system is. then plug that in to your personal finance management software and it will show you were your money is going.   
if you earn less than 120kCHF download the software anyway and see what you are missing. then invest in an accountant to arrange some claw back. then plug that into your personal finance software again to see where your money is going.   
your 'question' is so open ended its hard to offer more info.

4163	Financebankingtaxation	Working in Switzerland, living in Austria / Germany	neddie	5805	11	Location: St. Gallen	18.11.2010, 23:29	" 
			
			Here's a quick summary of what I've found out so far, thanks for your tips!   
Living in   - I'd have a 'G' permit, after applying to be a Grenzgänger, pay fix 4.5% Quellensteuer to the Swiss, and then fill in a tax return to the Germans to pay their tax too, apparently as a rule of thumb around 25% in 4 bills per year. The tax paid already to the Swiss gets deducted from the German tax bill.  Plus as you say I'd have the traffic through the Bregenz bottleneck.   
Living in   - I'd have a 'G' permit as Grenzgänger, pay around 9% Quellensteuer to the Swiss, then fill in a tax return to the Austrians to pay their tax on top, but this time it's up to 50%  , again in four bills per year.  Again the tax paid already to the Swiss is deducted, but still...   
Living in   - I'd have a 'B' permit and pay regular full Quellensteuer to the Swiss, and that's it.  So this would make the income tax a lot less than the other two options, but make the rent perhaps a bit more (but not as much more as I thought).   
There's also the health insurance question, apparently I'd be obliged to get Swiss health insurance in any case,   I can prove I've got health insurance already from the country where I live.  As a Grenzgänger you don't get anywhere near as much choice in the Swiss health insurance available, there are limited providers and special policies with fixed, low franchise (so I guess huge premiums).   
So now it's looking more and more like Switzerland.  Any other tips / corrections / etc would be welcome!

			Here is the short of it:   
I have had a salaried position in Switzerland (teacher) for almost 12 years. I was able to also open a summer-time business and achieve an independent status 5 years ago. This year I have decided to make the plunge and devote myself to my ""independent job"". I'd like to use my retirement account.   
Apparently, this is possible, so long as you take out the funds within the first year of your independent status.    
(Well, this is really a catch-22 because I wouldn't have been able to cash out as I was still working for the employer who was paying into my retirement).   
So, I have two accounts:  
1.the 2ieme pilier  
2. AVS for being independent.   
The thing that decides my fate (whether I have access to the funds) is the date on the paper issued by the my ""Caisse"" AVS. And it says I've been with them since 2005. So, my 2ieme cannot be ""cashed out"".    
A friend has the idea of going with a different AVS caisse and hoping that the dates appear differently. But I am a bit paranoid and also don't want to go through the work of changing it all, if it's not going to make any difference.   
Any ideas ? Does anyone know anyone who actually works at a Caisse ?

4171	Financebankingtaxation	Deductions from Quellensteuer	ekonshin	1652	2	Location: Wallisellen	22.11.2010, 11:45	"    Basically works like this:   
The value of non-swiss property is added to your total asset value to determine your swiss wealth tax rate. 
You then pay wealth tax on world-wide liquid assets (ie bank accounts), but not on non-swiss property. Only swiss property is subject to swiss wealth tax.   
The value of income derived from non-swiss property (eg: rental income) is added to world-wide income and affects the overall swiss income tax rate.   
Of course, you must fulfill any tax obligations in the property's home country (income tax, wealth tax, etc)   
To make things slightly complicated, the calculation of how much of the non-swiss property is used to add to your global wealth is not so straightforward. 
So a tax consultant may be required.    
As for evidence: provide any documentation you have stating the property value, and any income generated eg: council rates notice based on government assessed property value, etc. And of course don't forget to claim the associated property deductions, including any mortgage on the property.

My understanding of the US-CH bilateral agreement is that this is allowed for the first 5 tax years after switching your tax home. The problem is that it's written in very general terms. I am looking for something specific, preferably from a Swiss source, that ties American IRA or 401K contributions to the Swiss 3rd pillar. Thanks.

			Obviously, they are right for a certain income and tax bracket. Details depend on your situation and income. Especially if you move to Switzerland from another country, it might be best to get the first year's tax return filed with the help of a professional tax consultant. That money for the consultant is easily saved later.

4181	Financebankingtaxation	Better off with Quellensteuer?	kiwiguy08	4564	30	Location: Horgen	01.09.2010, 11:53	" 
			
			kiwiguy - the reason that filing a full tax form *might* be beneficial for you is that the Gemeinde tax rate in Horgen (which you would pay if you file) is much lower than ZH canton (the rate used for Quellensteuer). Also as you mentioned, the months you received bonus payments had higher QS deductions - if you file a tax return these amounts are effectively averaged over the year, rather than producing a couple of months of higher rate taxation (ie you paid 'too much' under QS).   
It may be worth your time downloading the tax filing software from   and filling in a dummy return.  If you have basic German knowledge, a 2009 Lohnausweis (you should have) and few other financial assets (investments, savings, property etc) then it should not take long and it will calculate your tax liability with all appropriate deductions accounted for.   
Having said all that, if your total tax liability under QS was 7900, the difference may not be that great (a few hundred sfr ?) - maybe just forget about it and save all the hassle.

4182	Financebankingtaxation	Help calculating real tax	ghost	1967	6	Location: Zurich	18.11.2010, 21:57	" 
			
			Quellensteuer is charged at the average 'gemeinde' (community) tax rate.  As a forigner newly in Switzerland you will have this deducted from you monthly salary.  It is not normalised over the year, so can vary considerably if you salary varies month by month, especially if you have a 13th salary payment or bonus.   
As your earnings exceed 120k, you will be required to additionally file a tax return.  The calculations for this are dependent on your 'gemeinde'.  If you live in a relatively high tax gemeinde e.g. Zurich city, you will find that this assessment yields a higher tax liability that you will have paid via quellensteuer.  You will eventually be invoiced for this difference (can take a long time, so you can accrue substantial liabilities).  It is therefore worth considering living in a lower tax gemeinde, although note that this often involves higher rental/property prices, less good travel connections or other disadvantages.

4183	Financebankingtaxation	2nd pillar, another doubt	Chetan	967	1	Location: Switzerland	19.11.2010, 12:26	" 
			
			From my understanding if you are over the required age, and have completed more than 3 months continuous employment (the contract renewal does not count as a break in employment) then yes, your company is obliged to enroll you in their pension scheme.  Note however, that they are only obliged to pay 50% of the contributions, the rest come from you.  If they did not do this, there is in theory a 'state-run' back-up scheme which it may be you can revert to, but I don't know any details.  I would look at the amount of money involved (based on salary, age and their 50% contribution) and consider whether it is worth the effort, or whether a small ex-gratia payment from the company would be appropriate.  You can always use that money to 'purchase' missed contributions in you new scheme, if you have a gap in contributions.

4184	Financebankingtaxation	2nd Pillar - move to UK	Dr Winston O'Boogie	2047	3	Location: Zurich	19.11.2010, 12:08	" 
			
			Your 2nd pillar is in two parts - the mandatory element and the extra-mandatory element.   
The mandatory element (sometimes referred to as 'in accordance with BVG') may no longer be paid out in cash to someone who leaves Switzerland for an EU/EFTA country which has mandatory occupational benefits for old age.  This mandatory element is the contributions you made at the mandatory age-related percentage against the 'coordinated' salary, that salary I believe is limited to approx. 85,000 sfr.   
Anything more you contribute (ie a higher percentage of salary, or a higher insured salary) becomes part of the extra-mandatory element.  This usually is less secure, less regulated and attracts a different (read lower, variable) return in the pension.  However, assuming your pension policy allows it (and some may impose their own restrictions), it is possible to make early withdrawal of this money when leaving Switzerland, even if moving to an EU/EFTA state.  If there are early withdrawal restrictions on your policy, you may be able to circumvent these by transferring the pension to a Freizügigskeit account which has no such restrictions when your employment is terminated.  This can be advantageous anyway, as you can choose a Freizügigskeit account whose 'Stiftung' (trust) is located in a lower tax Kanton.  The tax you will pay when cashing in the pension from abroad will be based on this location instead of your location of residence (as you are no longer Swiss resident).  You should plan for this tax - if your extra-mandatory element is large (100,000+) the taxes can start to become large also, and may not be paid out of the money withdrawn (ie you must pay the tax first, before you receive the pension money - at least that is the rule if withdrawing pension money for house purchase within Switzerland).

4185	Financebankingtaxation	2nd pillar guaranteed under mortgage - and when move to another country?	XIII	1402	3	Location: Zurich	19.11.2010, 11:57	" 
			
			Not been through it, but from my understanding:   
Firstly, if your 2nd pillar is with your current employer (if still employed) you are most likely required to transfer it to a Freizügigskeit (blocked) account when you leave the employment.  However, having a Pfand (pledge) on the account might prevent this, or make it more complicated.   
Secondly, if you are no longer using the property as your primary residence, the Pfand must be removed/bought out anyway, as you can legally only hold a pledge on your primary residence.  As far as I know, this has nothing to do with you leaving the country, but leaving the property.   
Thirdly, freeze your C permit for 4 years ?  Maybe it's Kanton specific, but I thought the normal was 6 months, up to maximum 2 years if arranged prior to leaving.   
If you cash in your pension, I expect the value guaranteed by the Pfand is paid out to the mortgage holder and you receive the remainder, but I don't know the process for this.

			I have bought tickets with the Lithuanian airline in mid September. Now it's going bancrupt and doesn't fly anymore. Today Lithuanian banks announced that they will give a refund no matter if a debit or credit card was used for purchase. Good news to Lithuanian bank clients      
So today I went to my local UBS branch to ask what is the procedure for a refund as I used their credit card. They explained there is nothing they can do simply because the airline is bancrupt. As the payment is made this month I asked if there is a way to contest the payment. Nothing can be done even here, I have to wait for my cc statement and then contest it.   
All of this makes me wonder what the point of a credit card. Or UBS credit card   I guess the next step is to call the cc center hoping that the consultant was incompetent. Any tips?

She gets the benefits, as defined in the pension contract, paid in SA - widow and orphan's pension. Not sure about 1st pillar benefits though.   
Our employer saw them right though. They made him an ex-gratia payment which bought his pension up to the maximum amount. He was only 33.

			Do you own the house outright? I don't think you will be able to get a new mortgage for the company. Or let's say it could be an issue.

4203	Financebankingtaxation	US tax libilities on CH Pension .Help wanted!	philg	2573	5	Location: louisiana usa	30.10.2010, 19:53	" 
			
			The US-CH tax treaty, Article 18, states ""pensions and other similar remuneration beneficially derived by a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State."" 
So, if you are a US resident, you are liable to for tax on any pension income, no matter the source.   
For US pensions and ""similar"" structures (IRA accounts), you are not taxed until you withdraw the income.  I believe the IRS applies the same principle to foreign pensions.  So, if you leave the funds in the account created, imvho you are liable for tax only on the income withdrawn.  (The same point for interest: if you did not withdraw it, it is not taxable.)  However, that is a question best put to a US tax accountant, and it should not be costly to obtain that advice.

4209	Financebankingtaxation	Taxe communale de séjour	Jamu	1235	0	Location: Lausanne	04.11.2010, 13:19	" 
			
			Hello all,   
I am from the uk, studying a masters in Lausanne. I recently submitted the documents for my permis de séjour (and paid 95CHF for the privilege!) and I have just received a letter saying that I must pay along the lines of 30CHF per month for each month that I live in Switzerland - by the time I have finished my masters, this will amount to hundreds of CHF! I have already paid the former, but I'm not sure why I have to pay both of these fees, or if this is what everyone has to do? Obviously I will pay it if necessary, but all these extra costs are slightly frustrating for a student - does anyone know if these costs are obligatory for students?   
Thanks for any advice!

4212	Financebankingtaxation	Einzelfirma with Sans Activite permit L	Schukin	849	0	Location: Geneve	02.11.2010, 07:55	" 
			
			Read through all relevant posts and still see no answer... Actually, lot of answers but not 100% relevant to my case    
I have short term, valid till next summer permit L - Sans Activite (without gainful activity). I understand, that I cursed can't be employed.   
From other side - I have several web-sites on which I plan to make direct sales of advertising and, therefore, want to have ability to issue invoices and receive payments to the bank. Customers are mostly abroad.   
So, questions:   
1) Am I allowed this type of activity in Switzerland (or should be absolutely lazy - only travel, night clubs and casinos are allowed   ) ? Should I apply for other permit type? 
2) Can I establish Einzelfirma / Entreprise individuelle and have it registered? 
3) Do I need to open separate bank account for the Einzelfirma or it is OK (and needed) to use personal one? 
4) I have some outsourced people abroad. Is it OK for Einzelfirma (invoices would be for services)? Could it be treated as hiring people?   
Thanks for answers.

4213	Financebankingtaxation	How to reduce the frais de notaires in France?	jammidge	1487	2	Location: zurich	30.10.2010, 23:58	"    There are legal limits on the amount of money that may be paid in cash for any given purchase.  If the notaire (who is technically an agent of the state, i.e. not /your/ agent) even suspects a cash deal, he has a legal obligation to report it (and he has a legal risk if he does not).      The fees are set by law, and are not negotiable ... unfortunately.      Yes, this is OK, with two caveats:   
1. The notaire (again) has an obligation to the state, and he may not process a sale if he believes the price is ""too high"" or ""too low"" (this is to avoid money laundering and tax evasion).   
2. The municipality has a ""right of pre-emption"" on /any/ property.  It is normally not excercised, of course, but you do have a real risk that if the price is really quite low, the town (ville) will buy the property at that price, and use it for the school, a library, or just to store the tractors.  (In fact, that /has/ happened here.)   
So, the good news:    
Yes, you do have /some/ ""wiggle room"" to allocate the purchase price between the property and the furniture.  And, no, the furniture is not subject to the notaire's fees (he is not involved in that deal).

4215	Financebankingtaxation	Taxation in simple terms	guest	1008	0	null	null	"   Suppose that once a week, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to £100.If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this.. 
The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.
The fifth would pay £1.
The sixth would pay £3.
The seventh would pay £7.
The eighth would pay £12.
The ninth would pay £18.
And the tenth man (the richest) would pay £59. 
So, that's what they decided to do.     The ten men drank in the bar every week and seemed quite happy with the arrangement until, one day, the owner caused them a little problem. ""Since you are all such good customers,"" he said, ""I'm going to reduce the cost of your weekly beer by £20. Drinks for the ten men would now cost just £80.     The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free but what about the other six men? The paying customers? How could they divide the £20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share? They realized that £20 divided by six is £3.33 but if they subtracted that from everybody's share then not only would the first four men still be drinking for free but the fifth  and sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer.     So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fairer to reduce each man's bill by a higher percentage. They decided to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay. 
And so, the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (a100% saving).
The sixth man now paid £2 instead of £3 (a 33% saving).
The seventh man now paid £5 instead of £7 (a 28% saving).
The eighth man now paid £9 instead of £12 (a 25% saving).
The ninth man now paid £14 instead of £18 (a 22% saving).
And the tenth man now paid £49 instead of £59 (a 16% saving). 
Each of the last six was better off than before with the first four continuing to drink for free.     But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings. ""I only got £1 out of the £20 saving,"" declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man, ""but he got £10!""   ""Yeah, that's right,"" exclaimed the fifth man. ""I only saved a £1 too. It's unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!""   ""That's true!"" shouted the seventh man. ""Why should he get £10 back, when I only got £2? The wealthy get all the breaks!""   ""Wait a minute,"" yelled the first four men in unison, ""we didn't get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!"" The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.     The next week the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important - they didn't have enough money between all of them to pay for even half of the bill!     And that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy and they just might not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.

4218	Financebankingtaxation	Getting that pension money	Mikey-o	1689	3	Location: Delémont	29.10.2010, 16:26	" 
			
			OK, that's clearer - the Freizügigkeitskonto is a 'resting place' for your 2nd pillar (BVG pension) when you're not employed here.   
The money in your BVG pension is potentially split into 2 parts - the first part is the mandatory element of 2nd pillar, based on earnings up to approx. 86K per year - this I believe you cannot touch if you reside in an EU country, due to agreements between Switzerland and EU.   
You may (depending on how much you paid in) have a non-mandatory amount in there (ie excess to the mandatory amount) - this I believe it is still possible to draw if you deregister from switzerland (even if moving to an EU country), but i'm not sure if there is a waiting period.  You would be required to pay some tax on this withdrawal, according to the rate applicable in the Kanton where your Freizügigkeitskonto stiftung is registered, I believe.   
However, I'm not sure where this leads to if you then return to Switzerland.  You may find that you must repay the withdrawn amount before further tax relief is given on pension contributions - there may be other rules to consider - sorry, this is out of my knowledge.   
In general, taking money from your 2nd pillar should be seen as a last resort anyway, especially if you plan to return and live out your life here.

4219	Financebankingtaxation	Good reasonable accountant / tax advisor for Swiss expats in the UK?	augusta	4815	5	Location: Basel	17.06.2009, 12:49	"    Only a year late, but I'd agree with that.   
In my case, I'm here with my family, permanent job, no UK house etc., so I declared myself to HMRC as non-resident and then tried to get a refund on my taxed savings interest, under the UK/Swiss double taxation agreement. Adding more difficulty was the fact that I wanted split year treatment for the part of the year when I moved here.   
When I moved over here, HMRC gave you the impression that they were there to help with any aspects of filling out UK tax returns etc. even for non-residents.    
In reality, it took countless letters, phone calls and anguish to get it sorted out because the helpline staff are just like any other call centre staff, they have the minimal knowledge of HMRC policy, you never get the same person twice and no-one owns your specific case.   
Even when you get past the help desk support to the 'managers' they don't know HMRC policy either. I was told that the guidelines and rules are there and it's your problem to sort through them and present your case to them, which they will consider and either agree to or reject.    
It seems that there are a handful of top HMRC tax people who write the rulebooks and return sheets, but that's your lot, the rest are box checkers.   
In my case, when I eventually submitted the right forms, after a couple of rejects with very little explanation, I got the result I wanted - my tax repaid.   
This year, I copied last years return and hopefully it'll not be a problem.

4220	Financebankingtaxation	Threshold for compulsory tax returns	gdaddy	2674	20	Location: ZH	15.09.2010, 14:36	" 
			
			I pay tax at source, and tried to hire an accountant to sort this out for me.   
The accountant I paid was around 120CHF for his work. Although my company recommended that I see another accountant who was going to cost me between 600-900CHF to sort out the tax form etc.   
What I was paying for was not for someone to fill out a 'tax form' for me, but rather to advise me of potential deductions.   
The cheap guy deducted hardly anything and made no further recommendations, however I also recognised that there would have to be a HELL of lot of things to deduct with the expensive guy. 
(Kinda get what you pay for really).   
I only had to pay something like 1,000CHF in tax so I didn't see the value in a more expensive accountant.       
Having received no real advice in the end, I may as well save an extra 120CHF and do it myself next year. Although, I really don't understand how the tax works here at all (...hence the thread really).   
What sort of 'normal' things are deductible by an expat? 
(obviously, this will differ by occupation etc.)   
Is there a website where you can find the 'tricks' to what you can claim on?   
Can anyone recommend the name of an accountant in Zurich?

So if you preorder (from the wedding registar of course!!) from here for export to Switzerland you should be tax free in NZ as well. I think you have a 3 month time period in which they must arrive. My dear old Dad (in the building trade) bought us bathroom fittings (about CHF9k), saved us a fortune compared to here, great wedding present!! There was some discussion with the tax authorities recognising an Australian wedding 5 months after the Swiss ceremony but it all worked out ok in the end.

			As I understand it was the outcome of Hans Rudolf Merz' visit to London yesterday with his UK tax counterpart (head of the Exchequer).  It is to help reign in the perceived tax evasion of UK citizens having accounts in swiss banks, thus they want to invoke a withholding scheme, but at the same time the Swiss seem to be happy as it still preserves swiss banking secrecy.  In my opinion it goes in the general direction of the Swiss trying to please some of the major players that have increased the pressure in recent times on tax evasion issues with various threats, including the buying of stolen bank data, etc.

			Although many of us here work for financial institutions and benefit from the banking secrecy law, it is not right for a person living in the UK 
or US or wherever to simply hide their money in a Swiss bank account.   
As far as companies, this is a bit more tricky.  Companies can legally 
move their headquarters to foreign shores.  There are many ""mailbox"" 
companies here in Switzerland.  These companies make most of 
their profits in UK, Germany, or US and pay little tax in Zug, Switzerland.

4232	Financebankingtaxation	cheaper to buy UK pounds here or from UK airport	mbaaspirant	3618	3	Location: Zurich	25.10.2010, 11:56	"    There is zero difference for similar types of places where you would buy it from.   
example:   
rate at airport in the UK will be more or less the same rate in an Airport in Switzerland! i.e both a rip off!! Never ever buy currency at airports! Airports charge the highest spread you can think of!   
From my experience without anything to back it up with, the spreads are ranked below from high (bad) to low (as good as you gonna get)   How do you work out the spread?   
Well when you go to buy the currency you're interested in ask for the bid/ask for the currency pair (they usually flip it at the airport, so the ask is displayed in front of the bid with titles like we sell (the bid) and we buy (the ask) which is confusing and somehow makes the customer think they're getting a better deal than they actually are:   
anyway here is an example   
GBP/CHF:MID1.5260 (source: swissquote 2010/10/25 13:22) This is the best price you can get at this given time. 
Airport price: [5% spread] so if you want to exchange GBP to CHF, The airport (agent)'s bid for your pounds is 2.5% the MID quoted above and in this case it is 1.5260 x (1- 0.025) = 1.48785, their ask for the GBP is gonna be 1.5260 x (1 + 0.025) = 1.56415.   
So for a GBP1000 you would get CHF1487.85. 
and if you want to buy GBP you would have to pay 1.56415 for every pound.   
in the Airport you will see it quoted as   
(UK FLAG)     We Sell (1.56415) We Buy (1.487.85) 
[ As you can see this is confusing as it seems to the customer that they're going to get 1.56 when in fact they are going to get 1.48 for every pound ]   
Let me know if you need more information, for small amounts I find it better to just exchange with friends who need the opposite currency.   
Cheers

			Hi,    
I gave birth on 03.10.2010 this year and my employer is saying that the reduced tax code for my husband can only be reduced to married with 1 child from the month following birth, i.e. November!     
Also, that when I return to work after my maternity, on a part time basis, that my code will remain as married, double earner and 0 children as the code will only apply to my husband!!     
Does anyone know if this is correct, and if so if they know of where I can find anything on either issue, in black and white on any official CH website as I can't seem to find it.   
Thanks in advance for any advice anyone may have on this.

			Hi,   
I am working in Switzerland (Vaud) as an IT contractor so i am now a Swiss tax resident. I have a barclays marketmaster account which is held in the UK.    
From what i can gather any shares that i held before i left the UK are subject to CGT if they are sold. (unless i stay out of the UK for 5 years)   
However, newly bought shares are not subject to CGT? Can i purchase new shares using my existing UK based barclays sharedealing account which will not be subject to CGT or do i need to open a separate share dealing account based in Switzerland?   
Cheers, 
Neil

			Not strictly true, I bought my Breitling in Zurich airport.  I got quotes from shops in UK and Switzerland and both major airports (Heathrow and Zurich).  Even without paying UK Vat and having to pay Switzerland Vat I still saved a couple of hundred pounds.  Sometime the exchange rate can also help, plus what currency you are getting paid in.  The watch shop in Zurich airport were very helpful and said they have a large turn around of watches, so you don't have to worry about your watch being stuck in the shop for years (and with the battery running out!).   
However that said a new watch strap was cheaper to order and have fitted in the UK than Switzerland   "	Posts: 75	Join Date: Jul 2010	Junior Member	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	Thanked 8 Times in 8 Posts	slipped a little

			Even if you have a zero balance, unless Swiss banks are vastly different to Australian banks they will still charge a monthly fee if you have an open account with them. It just means your balance will go negative, meaning you'll have to pay money to close the account.   
If it's an interest rate, such as on your mortgage account, then a zero (or very low) balance will cost them - my Dad had that situation with a mortgage, where they wanted to charge him a few hundred dollars to close his mortgage account early. He spoke to a manager, explained that if they didn't let him close the account he'd just leave a few cents owing and they could charge interest on that if they wanted (meanwhile paying to send out statements on the account for the next twelve years!) ... and the manager authorised the account closure with no ""early repayment"" fee.

			But on that basis, you'll walk out of a shop loaded with stuff you haven't paid for, if you can get away with it. ""Why pay unnecessarily more than you have to"". I guess it comes down to what you consider ""necessary"" and ""have to"". According to the law, you do ""have to"" declare.   
I always declare if I'm over. I know others that do too. I know others who treat it is a game, and yet others who consider it their moral duty to dodge as much taxation as they can, regardless of the law.   
As far as ""moral high ground"" is concerned - well, I tend to occupy the low ground. But it seems fairly obvious, even to me, that avoiding owed MWST is dishonest. I'll avoid tax whereever possible, but not evade.      I did that at Birmingham airport a few years ago. However, the magic pixies seem to have wandered off with my refund - I never received it.

			probably different, if you earn less than 120KCHF.   
if you earn more than 120kCHF then it will be identical to a C permit holder or a Swiss citizen, eventually.   
the reason for the difference is that if you earn more than 120kCHF you HAVE to make a tax return and with it you get access to all the tax deductibles. You can still make a tax return if you earn less than 120kCHF but it is unlikely to be looked at. the 'eventually' above refers to the fact that it takes quite a long time to have the tax returns processed. 18--24 months after the end of the year in question, is not unusual. and B permit holders still have tax deducted at source. C and CH citizens don't have tax deducted at source, they are assumed to be responsible enough to save for the tax bill they will eventually receive. but the treatment would be identical, B, C, CH citizen.   
things change with personal situation, if you have amounts of taxable assets in the world (property etc) you may fall into the tax return bracket. comments above refer to the simpler situation: salary considerations only.

			In the UK, you are only liable for money you make in the UK.   
In Switzerland, as in the US, you are liable for your worldwide income (including your ""wealth"" here in Switzerland).   
As there are tax agreements between the two countries, you won't have to pay double.   
However, you will be liable for any extra tax that you might have to pay here after it is taxed in the UK (or vice versa).  As your UK tax rate is more than likely higher than your Swiss tax rate, you will probably not have to pay extra Swiss tax.   
However, I highly recommend hiring someone to do your taxes for you!  Different things are exempt here and there, thus making your taxes nice and complicated.

Why did I do this, well being ill the year before I did not know if I would have to take some time out of the year. This way I could work out with the accountant what is left in profits in the company after expenses and pay myself the remainder in December.   
Now we are thinking of buying due to impending eviction order due to redevelopment of land where we live.   
My question is, will the way I have planned my salary make it difficult for a mortgage?

Swiss tax returns work on the following basis: 
You must declare global assets and global income 
You are charged tax on your Swiss assets only   
You can claim the actual tax paid on any overseas income (if it was taxed in the country it was earned in) to prevent any double taxation. Valid for all countries where a double taxation agreement exists.   
As for costs, you can claim either a fixed amount for work related expenses, or actuals (proof required) 
You get child benefits 
You get travel related expenses 
If you work out of home, you can claim part of your home as work-related expenses   
But always best to see a tax expert, especially if you have overseas property and overseas rental income.

			I haven't any experience of the working side of it but these days B & B in England at any rate often means a largish bedroom with en suite bathroom, pleasant breakfast room a access to another room in the evening.    
The 'owner' must be around during the evening and must be available until the last 'sleep-in' types have eaten their breakfast, packed and got out of the house the next morning. And then the cleaning, washing, ironing starts.   
As cmjohno says, you will almost certainly have times of year or days of the week when you have no-one coming and other days when you are turning folk down by the dozen.    
It seemed like a good idea at the time...

			I've been paying bills in CH for nearly eight years now. I've   in that time paid the bills at the bank or post office. Always online.   
So long as the correct reference information is entered, it shouldn't be a problem.   
There is a difference between the red/pink slips and the orange slips though. If you've set up a standing order for the orange slips, perhaps you're not using the correct reference number? It might actually change from month to month.   
I'd propose to your landlord, that if he wants you to spend time going to the bank to pay these bills, that you'll charge him for your time and inconvenience at 100CHF per hour or part thereof. And that you'll happily accept such payment online, or via the bank or post office as he chooses.

Uranium prices have been very depressed for a long time , miners have high mid-term costs keeping projects open , so lean flexible miners are what you're looking for - preferably with tons of capacity for expansion.   
Uranium has shot up on the spot market in recent weeks , increasing by $10 per pound - which to a miner is the difference between losses and profit , see Denison:   
Now remember that is only in recent WEEKS and these are half year results.    
China , India and now even Argentina have all announced literally enormous reactor projects.   
I'd be surprised if you don't see the spikes of summer 2007 exceeded within another 5 years tops.

4289	Financebankingtaxation	Minimizing FX & ATM charges when travelling	lukel21	2354	9	Location: Zurich	21.09.2010, 01:15	" 
			
			I have the following (and I am not sure if it's optimal, though, but has some savings):   
- bank account in EU   
- two bank accounts in UBS   The rule that I am applying is basically trying to minimize FX changes and fees from  banks.  Therefore, I am using: 
- Swiss Maestro card, when paying in CHF in Switzerland 
- never ever withdraw EUR in Switzerland (the rate used is 'banknote exchange rate'' which is much worse than normal bank rate) 
- withdraw EUR when in EU from local ATMs.  No fee at all (if you withdraw from account with EU bank.  If you withdraw using EUR account from UBS; there are fees)   
Transfer fees: 
- from CHF to EUR account at UBS: exchange rate applies, but much better rate than if you pay in EU with CHF card.  This means it is worthwhile having two accounts in Switzerland alone (EUR and CHF).  Pay with CHF bank card when in CH; and with EUR bank card when abroad.  
- payments abroad from UBS EUR account are having 1% additional fee; but it is still better than paying with card associated with CHF account     
Sounds somewhat complicated, but hidden fees from cards are extraordinary high if there is conversion applied; so I try to minimize it.    
Hope this helps!

4290	Financebankingtaxation	Bringing a bicycle into the country - do import taxes/duties apply?	rocksteady	4900	16	Location: N/A	14.08.2010, 01:43	"    I don't believe you can get out of paying the VAT unless you have the company you buy it from ship it to Switzerland (in which case, the shipping company will handle the Swiss sales tax and you will pay that upon delivery).   
It's certainly true that the customs office will tell you that you SHOULD pay Swiss sales tax if something is imported when less than 6 months old - which is what was stated before, and that is the law. However, it does not seem fair to do so if you've already paid sales tax on it in another country, which is why a lot of people hope to avoid this charge.   
As for how new the bike box is - who uses a cardboard bike box more than once? Whenever I fly with my bike, I just go to the local bike store and get a box that a bike was just delivered to them in and use that. I've sometimes then unpacked the box at the airport on the other end and the box hasn't even left the airport. Therefore, regardless of the age of the bike, the boxes I use are always virtually new (they tend not to survive more than a couple of trips anyway). There are lots of guides online as to how to pack your bike in a box with a decent amount of protection, or you can pay a local bike store to do it for you. By the way, when you pick up the bike box from the store then also ask for any leftover packing materials that they have - their garbage and recycling is likely to be half full of it.

			Hi everyone   
I've got two questions regarding secondary residences. I'm a full-time employee (with B-permit) in Zurich, but will also be having a secondary residence very soon near Biel/Bienne. Both are rented apartments.   
I had a look at the ""Quellensteuer"" rates for both canton ZH and BE. BE works out to be 7% more in Quellensteuer, which is more than half of what I pay monthly for my rent in Zurich. So my idea is to keep my primary residence in Zurich.   
- However, is there any way I can save taxes or reclaim anything for my secondary residence?    
- Is there any tax on secondary residences?   
- And does anyone know who I have to register the secondary residence with? In both locations, in Zurich and in Biel's registration office, or just in Zurich?

			Hi There   
Would like to know if Swissquote deducts a percentage as tax on ""French Share dividends"" (traded in EuroNext). May be some EF members use Swissquote for trading like me.  I called Swissquote, but the agent who answered me wasn't sure about this and last time, they didn't give me a correct answer either (see my earlier posts).    
At the moment, my French banks deduct 33% as tax on dividends and to get back this amount,  I have to go through a long procedure plus a wait for 1 year. With the german stocks that I traded in Swissquote, I got my dividends without any tax deduced.    
Would appreciate a response. Thanks

4298	Financebankingtaxation	Geneva married tax rate	EllanVannin	6021	8	Location: France	09.09.2010, 16:35	" 
			
			If you have a B permit, you are subject to taxation at source in Geneva, unless your gross income exceeds CHF 500'000 per year OR if you have taxable wealth in Geneva (which you probably have). If you are in one of those situations, you have to file an annual tax return, which will put you in exactly the same situation as C permit holders (which are no longer subject to tax at source).   
The rate is different as the tax at source rate already includes some lump-sum deductions and is calculated on your gross salary whereas the ordinary rate is computed on your net taxable salary, i.e. after all effective or lump-sum deductions. It is usual to say that after a salary of CHF 100'000, it is more advantageous to file a tax return, especially if you contribute to a 3rd pillar or make additional contribution to a second pillar (which will be taken in account only if you file a return). This is why in most of the canton the limit for the mandatory return for people being taxed at source is CHF 120'000. Whereas Geneva, as always, follows its own rules...   
Comparing tax rates won't help you any further (not computed on the same base), you need to compare the total of taxes for people exactly in the same situation (same salary, same transport costs, meal costs, etc.), which is likely not not exist...

Putting money on a pre-paid visa card = money is blocked in advance until spent, no possibility to contest charges.   
Having a normal VISA card = money is available until the bill arrives at the end of the month, and you can contest transactions if need be.   
A non swiss ATM or VISA has high charges and commissions.   
I don't see why I should pay just to not have a B or C permit, but still spend money in Switzerland ... It looks like the Swiss don't want my money?   
Are there any banks that would issue a VISA/ATM/Mastercard without a 20.000 CHF blocked deposit?

			A 25-year life insurance was what I was missold as supposed retirement provision by a so-called ""independent financial adviser"" working for an offshore ""IFA"" company which targets English-speaking expats. He claimed to search the ""whole market"", but instead selected one of a small number of expensive and high commission investments. It was supposed to be flexible, but was not and was laden with fees and penalties, and was supposed to grow well, but would have taken several years to show any growth at all. It would have made the broker a lot of money.   
The same broker is now working for his own company as a financial consultant, selling the same investments as before.   
You should be very careful if you decide to take advice from anyone. They can tell you black is white and make it sound believable.

			Hi all,   
Thanks a lot for your responses, much appreciated.   
Think i'll check out the Swiss post office and see what they have to say on the matter. Seems like a good place to start.   
Found this on the Swiss post website. This kind of helps a little bit. Still seems like a bit of a 'grey' area though       
Enjoy the weekend

			Good afternoon,   
Can anyone explain the process of getting financing in big electronics stores (such as MediaMarket).   
Do you get pre-approved?    
Do they require paystubs, bank statement, work/residence/legitimation card permit?   
I tried going through my bank since they already have issued me a credit card, but I was told I need to wait 3 paychecks in order to obtain consumer loan from them.   
Thank you

I have one question regading account for famillies in UBS. If we do not want joint account and open two separate accounts with maestro cards can we have add-on cards to one another? Anyone has experinece with this?   
So basicly one person will have two cards on its name but one will be main card and another will be suplementary card and vice versa. I had that option im my bank and home.

4312	Financebankingtaxation	Voluntary Tax to UK Government?	crazysniper	2041	27	Location: schaffhausen	16.05.2010, 20:55	" 
			
			I realise this is an old topic, but it’s been bothering me. There have been some good discussions on the future of the UK system, but could we look at the current situation for a moment for those retiring in the UK? I’m going to make some simple assumptions. First assumption: the cost of a qualifying year is roughly £625. Second assumption: one extra qualifying year gives you £169 a year extra on your State Pension (£3.25 a week).    
If you ‘live’ on State Pension alone, you have (maximum) roughly £5,070 a year. You soon discover that you can’t ‘live’ in the UK on this amount. You require extra (means tested) benefits just for a basic lifestyle.   
Therefore you save, or invest, and sacrifice whilst below pension age. Upon retirement, the result is a yearly income of £17,500, or a total income of £22,500 a year. Because you’re age 65, your personal allowance is roughly £9,500 and you’ll pay 20% tax on the remainder (£2,600 tax). You’re now only slightly worse off financially than the average UK worker. You probably won’t qualify for any means tested benefits.   
The trouble is you don’t really fancy a lifestyle “only slightly worse than the average UK worker”. You sacrifice more. The result is a yearly income of £24,000 a year, or a total of £29,000 a year including the State Pension. There is one problem though. Your personal allowance is now only £6,475 a year (standard personal allowance) even though you’re 65 or older. You’re now paying £4,505 a year in taxes, or almost 90% of your State Pension. The extra £6,500 of income has only netted £4,600 after taxes.   
But your spouse refuses to fly Ryanair on holiday. So, more sacrifice for a retirement income of £50,000 a year. It would be comprised of a £40,000 pension, £5,000 UK State Pension, and £5,000 in taxable interest on a fair amount of savings. You’ve now followed the Government(s) advice and provided adequately for your retirement, and have some savings as well. It’s also £9,330 a year in taxes, with the last £6,125 of income at the 40% rate (that’s 40% tax on all your taxable savings income, plus. At least your ISAs aren’t taxed for now).   
At these income levels, you’re not only paying yourself for your own State Pension but you’re also paying nearly a full State Pension (in benefits) for your next door neighbour who has by choice never worked a day in their life. You now understand some of the motives behind the Governments need for you to be able to provide for yourself in retirement. You’re struggling to understand how, simply as a self-sufficient pensioner, you are suddenly part of the large group that is a financial burden on society. It appears to be the other way around.   
I agree with Andy02, the UK Government will not want old age “benefits” of some description to disappear. The UK has too many people locked into a “benefits lifestyle”. I recently heard (Michael Portillo, I think, on the “This Week” programme) that 1/3 of all UK households depend on benefits for at least 50% of their income. Well, he was a Tory. He would point that out. As Andy02 said, the UK and US systems are skewed to benefit the low paid.   
To some extent, I agree with Cashboy. “Who is the mug?” There’s a lot of sacrificing going on in some of those scenarios, and not by your next door neighbour. (Let me quickly say that I support benefits for those who have found themselves in unfortunate circumstances. Many do deserve assistance.)   
And finally for the OP, crazysniper. Obviously, you will decide which of the above scenarios you want to live in. If it’s £5,000 a year only, then the extra £3 a week won’t matter. You’re “guaranteed” a basic amount if your total income and assets are low enough (pension credits). If you have one of the other scenarios in mind, it is a pretty “paltry” sum. Even so, every Pound counts. But it’s not automatically £3 a week, (and for simplicity) it can be only £1.80 a week, or less, thanks to tax. Once retired, and provided you’ve sacrificed (or should that be “planned wisely”), tax brackets and inflation will be your real concerns.   
Go for your 2055 equivalent of the £50,000 scenario. You won’t have to fly Ryanair or whoever it is then, and you can imagine that with your tax payments you’re actually helping to prevent a few fellow old age pensioners from starving. Realistically though, it’s tax revenues, and won’t be used to pay pensions. It will just barely cover the expense of some MPs fact finding mission to Greece to discover ways of stopping these damned old age pensioners from being such a drain on the system. Most depressing of all, in the future we’ll look back on this situation as the good ol’ days. Most worrying of all, I sound like some right wing Republican!   
I know there’s nothing new here, and I apologise. It just seems that looking at the actual figures clarifies the likely possible pain for anyone planning to provide for their own retirement. Once all your income (from pensions, savings, investments, etc.) reaches £28,930 a year (with the reduction starting at £22,900), you’re treated for income tax purposes equal to anyone else who is working. The Chancellor has no intention of rewarding you in any way for your valuable diligence, even if you are on a State Pension. Any tax proposal that increases the income tax for those workers affects you equally, such as a change in thresholds or an increase in tax rates. This is not meant to discourage those who are planning for a self-sufficient retirement. It’s simply a reality check.

			Hey, thanks for your comment. I actually read a thread of yours on a very similar subject in my research  .      That's quite correct. I was actually paid a little relocation bonus in  December too, so effectively it looks like I earnt double, in your  example 240,000 if prorated a year. Of course what I paid was based on  the monthly amount if I understand correctly, and that prorata amount of  240,000 would only apply if I did a tax return in figuring out my overall tax rate.      Interesting. I paid myself those few hundred pounds after coming to Switzerland, even though I earnt a large part of them before I came. So I guess I should have taken some money out before I moved...   
On the wealth tax issue, this is another source of confusion for me. I only have to do that if I do a tax return? Could I choose not to do a tax return until they decide to send me one? E.g. assuming that I am not ""required"" to do one for 2009?   
Thanks!

			Since you say you will not be working CH, consider the Pauschal lump sum tax.  Tax is based on your cost of living in CH.  Worldwide income outside of CH is not taxed.  Big help for persons who are double or triple taxed by other countries.  Tax returns are submitted to verify compliance.  CH based expert individual help is required.  Extensive information can be found on internet via Google, e.g. an Ernst and Young publication, all via direct access without hiring E&Y or others before you commit to CH tax.

			In the past, any offers for additional cards required the customer to fill in a form to request the additional card.   
I found it very strange (to say the least) that the latest UBS offer for an additional free card requires customers to fill in a form and return it to UBS if they DON'T want an additional card!   
Having received a number of similar offers in the past, I normally consign all such offers to the bin, without reading all the details.   
I find it very sneaky of UBS to reverse the procedure, especially when they are supposed to be trying to repair their image in terms of openness and transparency.     
I wonder how many customers have ended up with an unwanted credit card?

			If you are working above a certain minimum number of hours per month (sorry, don't have the figure) you are obliged to join the pension scheme operated by your employer.  Whether you transfer previously accrued vested benefits into this scheme, I believe is your choice.  If coming from outside Switzerland, you can certainly retain what you already have as is (ie don't have to transfer it).  If you are coming from another Swiss job, I believe you can opt to transfer into the new pension, or to a vested benefit account (Freizügigkeitskonto) - this is effectively an account which is blocked until retirement, just like a pension scheme.

			Hi there,   
I would really appreciate some help with the following question, or if it has been answered elsewhere (recently - I found some info dating from 2006) to be redirected to it.    
I work at a language school in Zurich, but have recently started giving private lessons to one student, and therefore want to know about how to get self-employed status so I can be ok for taxes. The money these lessons are getting me is minimal, so I'd like to know what, according to the law, is the minimum amount of earning to be 'self-employed'. I'd also like to know if forms connected to this are available in English, as in the past, my partner only managed to find the German version.   
Thanks!

			The ""Eigenmietwert"" (valeur locative) is the theoretical rental value the tax authorities computes to properties occupied by the owner or used by him. It does not apply to properties rented out (in that case only the rental income is added to the other income, not the rental value). If a second house is partly rented out and partly used by the owner (let's say 50/50), then the rental income for the 6 months will be added to the other income and the theoretical rental value for the other 6 months will be added also. The full rental value does not come in addition of the rental income, only the part that correspond to own use. The tax saving door quickly opens: how will the tax authority know how much days you have rented it out and how much days you occupied it for your own usage? It depends what you declare on the tax return. And I would clearly try to reduce as much as possible the part of own occupying... (if I had a second house indeed...)

In order qualify as non domiciled you need to cut all links to UK. Links mean things like property there so you couldn't keep a home in the UK - freehold or leasehold - so no boltholes. Also intending to retire there or be buried there when the times comes will qualify as a link so you can't do that. The Revenue would also look at the amount of time you spend there so visits should be kept to a strict minimum. Even educating your children there or maintaining banks accounts, investments or other assets there might constitute a link. There is no acid test - the courts would look at all the circumstances before deciding whether you were domiciled in the UK or not. The golden rule is the less you have to do with the UK the better. For many people, the downside of the family/social implications of cutting all links to the UK outweigh the upside tax advantages.

4336	Financebankingtaxation	Help understanding tax return: multiple cantons	Village Idiot	974	0	Location: Basel	05.09.2010, 14:21	" 
			
			I've just received a copy of my 2009 tax return from my tax preparer.  It's my first year in Switzerland, and I lived a few months in BS, then the rest of the year in BL.  My tax has been withheld as quellensteuer in both cantons as appropriate.   
I live in Arlesheim, which has one of the lowest tax rates in BL.  So I'm confused as to why I find myself owing an extra CHF 4K on my tax return.  If I lived in a high-tax area, I could understand how I could underpay on the quellensteuer method, but since I live in a low-tax locale I expected to get some money back (hence the shock at the rather unpleasant news).   
The tax advisor has included a spreadsheet showing the breakdown of taxes paid (quellensteuer) and owed in both BS and BL.  But I only have a tax return for BL, covering the entire year.  Is that right?  And if so, do I owe taxes for the entire year at the BL rates, or pro-rated across the BL and BS rates?

Completely different position, in fact.  It's not your family home and therefore you must declare the rental income less the costs which can also include maintenance etc as well as mortgage interest.

			Compare and compare some more. I can't see why a bank would ask for 40% based on the type of building, it should be irrelevant to them what you're using it for, it's either an acceptably priced building and location or not.   
Play the banks off against each other, ZKB, Raiffeisen and even Migros for example. With the interest rates currently so very low, I'm sure that you can get a great deal. If you're not clear on the building zone verbage, either get a local attorney or a local architect who not only knows the local lay of the land, but knows the right people in the village/town building committee because they're the ones that can impose seemingly ridiculous restrictions on your building plans. They did that to me when we rebuilt a barn more than 10 years ago.

4342	Financebankingtaxation	Your UK banking arrangements: advice and recommendations please	Gordon Comstock	782	0	Location: Geneva	01.09.2010, 17:47	" 
			
			I need to sort out my UK banking arrangements, and Id like to hear how other Brits here do it. I seem to have simply fallen into expat living over the years (now nearly 20 years), moving from place to place quite frequently  there was never one moment when I decided to leave  so Ive rather let things slide, as you will see.   
  At the moment, I have a current (Flexaccount) with the Nationwide in my name only. As far as they are concerned, I still live in my late mothers home, which is still in the family, so I get my statements ok.  From this account I pay by DD the mortgage and insurance for a house in the UK that my wife and I bought just a few years ago which we let out. The rental income also goes into this account. With interest rates so low, a tidy sum (~GBP 20k) has built up over the last year or so. I lost the cheque book years ago, but have never really needed to access the money.   
  I really need to fess up, make this a joint account and get access to our money (I will need to pay something to the Inland Revenue soon). Id also like a UK credit card. However, looking at the Nationwide website, I notice that our main residence should be in the UK, and pointing me to their international branch in the Isle of Man. The problem is that, if I recall correctly, the mortgage (with C&G) should be paid from a mainland UK bank.   
  We're going back for a short break in a week's time and I'd like to sort this all out.   
I intend at some stage to return permanently, so I quite like the idea of having some continuous high street banking history.    
  So where do other people go for their UK banking? Any recommendations?   
Any input gratefully received!

			The 800 per month tuition fee is obviously a finite payment, i.e. once the uni finishes, so does the payment. This means future savings will increase. I assume the uni fees are for your partner. if so she will be also freed up to commence work when uni finishes. if it is for you, then your university completion may mean a significant pay rise coming if you leverage this well.    
I think you are in a pretty good position, you have a car, childs needs are looked after, and you are building for your future with university tuition. Perhaps now is not hte time to make significant savings, but in 1 - 3 years time your savings capacity will increase markedly.

4347	Financebankingtaxation	Companies in DE that accept your packages	mena613	1834	15	Location: Zürich	06.06.2010, 23:49	"    Save? But you just lost the opportunity to reclaim 19% VAT (but pay 7.6% swiss tax instead).   
Ok, let me give you an example. You want to buy something in Germany that costs Fr.300. Maybe free delivery within Germany.   
Or you can get it delivered to Switzerland for Fr.20 For this they take away 19% German VAT, but you will get charged around Fr.50 by swiss post. Total cost in the end is around Fr.310. It will cost you Fr.10 more in the end, but no petrol cost for you nor ""dropbox"" cost in Germany. If the stuff you are buying is more expensive, this starts to make even more sense as the VAT portion gets bigger.   
I understand your point though that some smaller sellers do not take away VAT, but as I mentioned, so far I have been able to find one that does - they might be a bit more expensive, but if they take away the VAT, they can also be competitive.

Great Britain had admitted it's in recession and it's not alone.  The swiss franc is historically viewed as being a ""safe"" currency and therefore it always strengthens when times are hard in the financial markets.  I imagine the GBP will fall further against the CHF over the next few weeks in spite of it gains in the last few days.

			Just called Post Finance and checked that when having both CHF and EUR accounts is that you need to get two separate banking ""sets"". This means double monthly handling costs, 2x 3CHF, so it's not that bad   On the plus side is that you get an overview of your both sets in the same ""window"" in your online bank.

I have seen quite a lot of information here and there on the forum regarding the cost of the taxes and which bands apply but someone said to me the other day they thought Sterling Silver was in a class of its own with some kind of extra taxation! Can anyone clarify this or tell me that is not so. Thanks very much.

			If the source of the money is legitimate, you could have accounts in all the currencies you want in Germany itself, although the banks might charge you more to keep the account operational in a foreign currency, than the local one. The same would be true for Switzerland as well, apart from the effects of political repercussions lately.

4383	Financebankingtaxation	Validity of CA	Kewlswiss	2384	1	Location: Basel	11.08.2010, 01:16	"    With respect to public practice, only EU qualifications obtained by citizens of the EU are automatically recognized and then only after passing a conversion exam.  Interesting enough, EU qualifications obtained by non citizens are not recognized.   
As regards industry, I expect you would be considered for positions where a knowledge of the local laws would not be required.  However, having said that, work permits are hard to come by at present, so I would expect you will find it difficult.

4385	Financebankingtaxation	OASI certificate	gade	2238	0	Location: Zurich	10.08.2010, 17:34	" 
			
			Hi    
I left Switzerland in Jan 2010 and have not received my OASI certificate for the year 2009, as I had left switzerland by the time they posted it to me.   
Does anyone know if I can submit refund of OASI without the OASI certificate. I have worked in Switzerland for two years and an Indian national, so I am sure I am eligible for a refund of OASI.    
Tried calling the Geneva Swiss Compensation office, but did not get through.  
Am hoping someone in english forum knows about this    
Thanks 
Gayatri

			Quick couple of things for those coming to Switzerland and debating bringing their car.    
1. UBS (at least in Basel) do not do personal loans, mortgages only.  
2. Leasing finance companies will not touch you if you are on a probationary period for your job.   
So if you want to use a car and have a 3 month probationary period you can   
a. Bring your car with you 
b. Pay for the car outright 
c. Obtain the money before you come or from your existing bank.  
d. Do without a car. 
e. Public transport everywhere. 
f. Hire a car   
Worth knowing I think.

You have to choices:  
- Betreibungsauskunft (to check whether you are not the only one, running after your money) 
- Betreibungsbegehren (the first step in getting back your money)   
However, if the debtor really does not want to pay you likely cannot avoid going to court.

On a separate issue they already privatised parts of the post office in the late 90's when they let private businesses come in and take the commercially viable parts over like parcel force or the 'junk mail' you get in cities, the same companies which took over the junk mail were getting the royal mail to deliver it anyway and pocketing the difference...   
part privatisation is unfair aswell because the royal mail has what is known as a 'universal service obligation' which means that for your 26p you can send a letter next door or to the isle of mull, a obligation which the private sector is certainly not under.... 
privatisation is just a way of saying, many thanks for all the tax you payed to set up an infrastructure that would cost billions, heres a couple of million for it.... like the rail fiasco....

I'll always remember seeing this guy buying a car from my parents when I was a wee lil kid. Leather briefcase, a couple tools inside it to remove something from the car, and a fat stack of cash. Impressive, but the most tangible form of money if one doesn't take into account deflation    
Bankers draft and bank transfers are the only other good options.    
Anything like maestro transfers, western union(ah!), personal checks etc should be avoided.  
From the possibility of there being a financial issue somewhere along the line, to extra incurred fees(looking up relevant information wouldn't hurt if that's the route you intend on taking) cash is the most hassle free option.

			At first glance it looks like you'll continue to be tax resident in the UK until November, as you are living there more than half the time (fri-mon: 4 days a week).    
You'll probably have to pay Swiss income taxes first at source, then also UK income tax when you do your self assessment return (by January 2012) though you'd get credit for the Swiss income tax you already paid.    
From November onwards you should be nonresident for UK tax purposes and should only be taxed in Switzerland.

4421	Financebankingtaxation	Betreibung from UK debt?	poot	3009	4	Location: Zurich	15.07.2010, 18:06	"    In the case of a court judgment from another EU/EEA/Swiss country enforcement is easy: the judgment can be registered locally under the Lugano Convention (parallel to the old EU Brussels Conventions on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments, now the ""Brussels Regulation""). There is no right to defend except under extremely limited circumstances (such as you happen to share the same name with the debtor and furthermore were never served with the writ).    
The problem in many of these cases is that credit card and other debts are sold off by financial institutions to speculators and collection agencies for pennies, and then the buyer proceeds aggressively. I've seen this happen even when the debtor had been discharged in bankruptcy, although normally that's a perfect defence. Claim of payment is also a defence, unless that was raised, or could have been raised, in the foreign proceeding.    
There is a principle called "" "", included in the Convention, that encourages a race to the courthouse in the most favourable jurisdiction because once an action (such as libel or divorce, although family law cases aren't covered by the Convention) has been started in one signatory state an action in another, except for enforcement or attachment, is precluded. That's why the English small claims courts can be useful.   (Indeed the French small claims system ( ) is also helpful when they have jurisdiction, and there's is the additional advantage that they are free and gratis, unlike the English ones.)   
Often the cheapest way to address unfair pursuit for debt is through the English administrative bodies responsible for unfair trading. For example, some claims are for fees charged by for-profit vocational schools that immediately sell off the instalment agreement and then either go into receivership or fail to teach anything useful, their sales pitches having been totally fraudulent. In some places (New York City comes to mind) it is possible to pursue the claimant in criminal court for a misdemeanor if the facts support such a private prosecution. That works well against unscrupulous landlords. (There is also a landlord & tenant court (Housing Court) in NYC but a tenant can be whipsawed there by lawyers acting for the landlord.)

4423	Financebankingtaxation	What constitutes tax resident?	andy02	5665	17	Location: Deleted	21.04.2010, 15:59	"    The OP posited (I think) not being resident, ordinarily resident or domiciled in Britain, and not visiting there except for brief meetings.   
There is virtually no situation where a person becomes taxable in another jurisdiction without having a permanent establishment or spending ""substantial"" time there -- artistes and sportsmen aside. It is true that active selling (advertising, trade show attendance...) can be equated to permanent establishment. But this is most often the case with respect to sales tax in the USA, not income tax. And for the USA there is also the principle of taxation based on nationality.   
The Huckaby principle (a telecommuter subjected to income tax by the State of New York based on 25% of his working time spent there)   might be kept in mind, but has limited relevance in the UK-Swiss context.   
The tax treaty provides reassurance but really changes nothing.    
The VAT issue is something else. New rules came into force on 1 January. For commercial endusers, UK VAT applies; for private endusers the supplier's VAT does. But Switzerland is outside the EU and double taxation is conceivable although in practice few encounter it.    
Personal services companies have been under tax attack in the UK for some years now. Google ""IR35"". This won't affect you if you have no permanent establishment there.   
Finally, if you do not have, and are unlikely to get, 30 years' state pension contributions, you might consider Class III voluntary contributions. Unlike Switzerland, the UK allows voluntary contributions even if you are resident in the EU/EEA/Switzerland. While state pension benefits are stingy, the cost to acquire rights to a basic pension is reasonable. And given the likelihood of inflation in coming years it is worth considering.

4429	Financebankingtaxation	Need Help for SWX Trader Exam - Preparation	RivellaFan	2997	7	Location: Zurich	20.06.2007, 11:57	" 
			
			Hi,   
I'm new to the forum but have already sapped much useful information from several threads - so thanks to everyone.   
As many of you living in Zurich I work in banking. I am looking to do the SWX Trader Exam sometime this year.    
Having contacted SWX I was told that they won't be running any more preparation seminars until further notice. 
I have only seen a few sample questions on the website and would also like to get some help with preparation. 
Does anyone perhaps have any old or sample papers and the binders/files from a preparatory course? 
I would also appreciate any other preparation material you can recommend - other than the documents I have downloaded from the website.   
I'm a bit old-fashioned in my study approach and prefer paper :-)   
Thanks!

			From a tax point of view it doesn't make much difference. The tax authorities have a fix CHF/km that they calculate with. So it all depends on how much you need the car for your work and how well you can prove that. Anything on top of that is taxed. The higher the allowance, the bigger the risk they will want to see how much you drive.    
The advantage of the allowance is that you can choose yourself what car you want to drive.

Hmm. A mixture of totally off topic and absolute rubbish. It's funny how everyone who think they know what they're doing in the markets say ""I never gamble"". Like they have a crystal ball. If the OP believes country X is going to do better or worse why would he want to invest through a mutual fund with a ""history"". Surely that's paying to employ a fund manager with his or her own ideas?    
@Pashosh: you want an index tracking ETF like those done by iShares. Look at the expense ratio - you want it to be as low as possible.     
Bonds and Currency investments are easily manipulated and oftentimes terrible reflections of the broad health of a country or company.

4448	Financebankingtaxation	UK to CH & Inland Revenue	baldrick	1753	12	Location: Basel	12.05.2010, 22:33	"    Agreed...        Wrong. Inland Revenue Guidance Notes are not legislation. Read the first sentence again:          Wrong. The Inland Revenue doesn't make or interpret tax laws. Parliament makes the rules and the courts interpret them. Application of the laws may be the domain of the Inland Revenue but it's not subject to their whims. Nothing could be further from the truth.      Wrong. See above. HMRC interpretation of rules in individual cases is often successfully challenged in the courts on appeal.      Just to be clear, deemed domicile is very relevant to non UK resident, UK nationals seeking to lose their UK domicile. You can lose your UK domicile but still be deemed domiciled for tax purposes for a period of time.      Correct.     
Guys....the road to losing your UK domicile for Inheritance tax purposes is well trodden and the rules haven't changed. It's simple ...if you do the right things... and avoid doing the wrong things. It has everything to do with cutting all links to the UK ...permanently...but it has nothing to do with learning local languages or embracing local cultures. This stuff has been covered in previous threads so no need to go into detail here.

I am non-eu with student B permit, and I just recently started my first lucrative activity in CH, that is  payable internship for 6 month. I suppose my salary (if you can call it so) is a subject to taxation. Could smb please give me clue what taxes (pension funds, cantonal and communal taxes etc.) and in what amount I should be paying. Are they deducted from my salary or I should I pay the bills myself?   I am single, female, no children, earn 4000 ch a month, registered in the canton Vaud, the company I am doing my internship at is in canton of Neuchatel. I guess the taxes are paid to the canton of residence (Vaud), right?  I am considering moving to Neuchatel, will this mean the decrease or increase in taxes? Different cities of residence also mean different tax rate?   I tried some tax calculators I found on this forum but they show different results and confuse me even more. I would highly appreciate guidelines from your side. Thanks so much in advance!

			If you mark as a gift, I believe that you won't have to pay VAT.  
However, if it is not a gift, then you shouldn't do that because it would be illegal and it's probably not worth risking.    
If you are purchasing a new or used laptop, then you would have to pay VAT.  
The VAT is not determined by Customs, it is determined by Switzerland. 
I am from the US and it is like the equivalent of sales tax.    
I believe someone else in the thread posted the exact percentage which I am not sure of, but as an answer to the main question, yes you will most likely have to pay the VAT.

			If you are getting the manufacturer/shop to ship it to you, they should be able to deduct the VAT before sending it. Then you will be liable to the Swiss VAT (7.6%) plus some customs administrative fee which on a large item like furniture shouldn't make a significant difference to the overall price. (I have never worked out exactly how it is calculated, and on some small items you can find the admin charge is more than the value of the item!)   
If you are importing them yourself I am not sure how it works - RTN's advice seems roughly in-line with other comments I've seen on here though.

4464	Financebankingtaxation	urgent: Tax forms manual entry	TradeTicker	946	1	Location: Zurich	30.06.2010, 02:26	"    Your tax consultant may have a different working method from mine.   
Mine fills in the the original form, makes copies of my original supporting documentation, then sends the original form and the copies of my supporting documentation, and a copy of the original form and my original documentation. And then I send the original form with the copies of the documents to the tax authorities, having signed precisely where my tax consultant (actually, my accountant), has indicated with little pieces of paper. With all of this, he includes a letter indicating precisely and clearly what I need to do.   
I'd guess, but couldn't be certain, that you need to fill the coloured one in with the figures from the b/w one. If by ""tomorrow morning"", you mean Wednesday, then phone your tax consultant early and ask him. If you mean Thursday, then you've all day to call him.   
Anyway, once it's sorted, sack your tax consultant, and find one that gives you clear and accourate instructions.

4468	Financebankingtaxation	Tax At Source 18.09%	New Swiss	2634	23	Location: Geneva	25.06.2010, 15:13	" 
			
			Hi, just to add, I would thoroughly recommend an English speaking accountant to do your tax return when you are taxed at source - they know stuff we dont like making deductions for house insurance premiums, house maintenance, work clothing, travel, lunches etc etc and it all adds up - also explaining how you can ""invest"" in a 3rd Pillar account and get a good percentage of the premiums back via your return. I have been here 5 years now and each year have received a sizeable rebate which makes what I pay the accountant very worthwhile indeed. Will gladly pass on his details if you'd like and he is convenient to you - in Nyon VD. Rebates though, can take a whiler - I just last week got mine from the 2008 return, but normally it seems to coincide with the issuing of the return, so when you receive your 2010 return roughly around the same time you should get your 2009 rebate - or at least thats how it has worked for me so far - but I am sure it differs town to town, canton to canton...

4469	Financebankingtaxation	U.S. Taxes - Married Filing Separate?	Mountainhugger	6293	10	Location: Schaffhausen	09.04.2010, 21:55	" 
			
			What about a situation where an American who has multiple sources of income from 2 jobs and a business interest, from US, Switzerland and England, spends about 3 months per year in Switzerland, 3 months per year in the US and 6 months on business travel, marries a Swiss citizen who has plenty of her own income from various sources as well, and has no interest in ever doing anything in America, never wants to a green card, passport, citizenship, and certainly never wants to pay taxes to the US.  She actually hates the US (in a good way) and only grudgingly will go there to visit the in-laws.  I suppose I would file married filing separately and just write N.R.A. for her on the tax forms.  Is that right?  Then, we're expecting a child.  Can I or should I claim him/her on my tax forms as some sort of head of household and get a deduction for that child, assuming he is born in Switzerland but I register him as an American with the embassy and get him a SSN and all that.

4470	Financebankingtaxation	good timing to transfer CHF to EUR?	MariV	1741	2	Location: Zurich	24.06.2010, 12:15	" 
			
			MariVI'm also planning to do the same what you said. My understanding: 
There are 2 trends at the moment: 
1. The Frank is getting stronger after the National Bank stopped its interventions and nervous investors around the world change their cash to Frank as an ""escape"". 
2. The Euro is getting weaker due to government debt fears across EU.   
These two trends are partially independent and make the Frank stronger against all other currencies and make the Euro weaker agains all other currencies. Both of these push the CHF/EUR rate to the same direction. 
The easy answer is that the best time to exchange your money is when these trends are close to end. If you want to catch the best exchange rate I suggest to wait and keep an eye on the news. Once you start hearing good news about financial markets around the world, probably that will be the best time to transfer your money to Euro.   
I recommend to do it in multiple steps and not in one go to to avoid risk. Once you are in Euro and the Euro continues to weaken that's not gonna be good for your personal wealth.   
P.S. This is all speculation and my private opinion. Follow only if you agree.

			First, apologies to all if this has been in answered in the forums; yes, I did search but the information seemed to be in too many places...    
Just need to understand, in layman terms, how taxes work here for expats:   
1. When employed, are taxes automatically deducted from my paycheck? If so, how is it calculated based on which canton I live in and which I work in? 
2. Are there any exceptions for expats? Or do you pretty much pay same rates as Swiss nationals? 
3. Assume there is an annual tax filing around March/April, and similar processes as other countries; file w/ service online or through accountant, might receive a refund etc.   
Just trying to get a general idea of how it works here... Thanks for any help!

4474	Financebankingtaxation	making a will in Switzerland	lankylewis	4408	23	Location: vaud	01.06.2010, 18:11	"    There is no ""American"" law, any more than there is a ""United Kingdom"" law of inheritance. There are state and territory laws (and there are English, Scottish, N.I., Jersey, etc. laws).   
In the USA a spouse can ""take against the Will"", which means that s/he can elect to take (say) 1/2 or 1/3 of the Estate, depending on whether there are offspring.   
In US jurisdictions the existence of a spouse and/or children excludes any right of a more distant relative to inherit in intestacy (absence of a Will).   
In some US jurisdictions, notably California, the high expense of probate leads to a prevalence of inter-vivos trusts (revocable living trusts); in others (New York, Florida), probate is cheap.   
In England (but apparently not Scotland   ), unlike US states (spousal rights, above), there is almost total freedom of testation and one can disinherit any relative and leave one's estate outside the family. But see Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 which prevents a testator from leaving his dependents in poverty. In Louisiana, alone among US states, one must provide for dependent (minors under 23 and disabled) offspring, but since 1989 forced heirship has been eliminated as a right for adult offspring.   
The rules are different in Community Property States (borrowing from Wikipedia: ""Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. Puerto Rico allows property to be owned as community property also as do several Indian jurisdictions. Alaska is an opt-in community property state; property is separate property unless both parties agree to make it community property through a community property agreement or a community property trust."") Actually Wisconsin is a Uniform Marital Property Act state, slightly different from CP.   
As for Swiss law ""forcing"" inheritance upon ascendants and siblings: there are ways around that, notably an ""accord successoral"" or a repudiation of inheritance by the ""forced heir"". And clever use of foreign entities and trusts (See Lambert, Ian, ""Using Cayman Islands Trusts to Overcome the Forced Heirship Problem "", 4 Trust L. & Practice, 1990, pp. 20-24 -- although the Caron v. Odell case in France that I cited earlier suggests that any property left in Switzerland (or France, etc.) could be reallocated by the courts to make up for the succession assets ""lost"" by the strategy.) New York State law specifically allows a non-domiciliary, including a foreigner, to elect by Will to have New York law apply: Spudis, Barbara C., ""Avoiding Civil Law Forced Heirship By Stipulating That New York Law Governs "", 20 Va. J. Int'l L., 1980, pp. 887-911; New York Estates, Powers and Trusts Law, §3-5.1(h).

			The evidence of differences in exchange rates tends to be anectodal. I recommend looking at different options just before you're doing your transfer (or when you think the rate is in your favour) and see which option is the best.    
I need to transfer 18000 sek to CHF soon:   
xe.com: 2507,63 CHF 
Exchange rate from my Swedish bank (SEPA): 2552.1 CHF 
Wechselstube: 2561.85 CHF 
Cash in a Swedish exchange place: 2506,7   
Not a huge sum and not a huge difference but 50 CHF is still enough for me to spend 5 minutes looking at it :-)   
I think the worst option is to withdraw cash but i don't really have anything to back that up with.

Americans May Have Mere Hours to Disclose UBS Accounts to IRS 
2010-06-17 22:26:34.861 GMT     
By Ryan J. Donmoyer 
     June 18 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. citizens and residents with 
UBS AG accounts are racing the clock to disclose their secret 
holdings to the Internal Revenue Service after the Swiss 
Parliament ratified an agreement to surrender the names of 
4,450 bank clients, tax lawyers said. 
     Swiss lawmakers yesterday ended a standoff and approved 
the banks settlement with the U.S., allowing the names to be 
transmitted to tax authorities as early as this week. Lawyers 
said Americans who ignored an IRS offer last year to reduce 
penalties in exchange for voluntary disclosures are now 
flooding their offices with calls seeking advice on how to 
avoid possible sanctions, which could include prison sentences. 
     For UBS account holders, they have mere hours to run to 
the IRS and hope they can disclose the account before the Swiss 
hand the data over, said Asher Rubinstein, a partner at 
Rubinstein & Rubinstein LLP in New York who said hes been 
getting panicked calls all week. 
     The Parliaments vote ends Switzerlands long tradition of 
bank secrecy and is a victory for the IRS and U.S. Department 
of Justice, which fought a two-year battle to gain access to 
the accounts. It also removes the threat of further civil 
litigation against Zurich-based UBS and additional fallout 
under criminal law.   
                        Move Quickly   
     IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman said yesterday he expects 
the Swiss government to move quickly to transmit the 
information. 
     We will immediately follow up on the information we 
receive from the Swiss and we will vigorously enforce the laws 
against those who have attempted to evade their tax 
responsibilities by hiding their assets offshore, he said. 
     IRS spokesman Dean Patterson said even though the 
special provisions of the voluntary disclosure program are no 
longer available, its always a good idea for taxpayers to come 
forward on their own and disclose tax issues before we find 
them. 
     A UBS spokeswoman in New York, Karina Byrne, said the bank 
previously told the 4,450 clients their account data would be 
given to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, which would then 
determine if it should be disclosed to the IRS. 
     The SFTA said yesterday in a statement that it had already 
reviewed 3,000 accounts to determine if they met the criteria 
for transfer to the U.S. under the accord. It said it had 
already disclosed the names of 500 consenting account-holders.   
                            IRS Offer   
     About 15,000 Americans voluntarily reported secret 
offshore bank accounts to the IRS last year, after the tax 
agency offered to reduce certain penalties and not seek 
criminal charges. The program ran from March to October. 
     Robert Fink, a tax lawyer with Kostelanetz & Fink LLP in 
New York, said many of the 4,450 UBS account holders may 
already have come forward after being warned of possible 
disclosure by the bank and the Swiss government. 
     The number of new names that the IRS will get will be 
far, far less than 4,450, he said. 
     Americans who didnt take the IRSs leniency offer last 
year now face possible criminal charges, prison time and the 
loss of all the money in their Swiss accounts, plus 
substantially more, said Barbara Kaplan, a tax lawyer at 
the New York firm Greenberg Traurig LLP. Those who come forward 
before the IRS learns their identity by other means may still 
avoid prison, she said.   
                     Worst-Case Scenario   
     I think people are starting to realize that their 
opportunity to avoid disclosure has run out, she said. The 
worst-case scenario, including criminal prosecution, could 
ensue. Its worth taking the chance on the civil side to 
mitigate the chance on the criminal side. 
     UBS, Switzerlands biggest bank, avoided U.S. prosecution 
in February 2009 by paying $780 million, admitting it helped 
wealthy Americans evade U.S. taxes from 2000 to 2007, and 
handing over account data on more than 250 U.S. clients. The 
day after the settlement, the U.S. sued the bank, seeking data 
on 52,000 Swiss accounts. 
     UBS settled that case in August, agreeing to hand over as 
many as 4,450 names to the Swiss government to review before 
passing them on to the IRS. 
     Parliamentary approval became necessary after a Swiss 
court ruled in January that the agreement couldnt be enforced 
as it then stood. Swiss lawmakers ratified the deal yesterday 
after the lower house agreed to drop demands for a public 
referendum that would have caused a deadline for disclosure of 
the information to be missed.   
                        Undeclared Assets   
     Under terms of the settlement between the two countries 
last year, Switzerland will turn over details of UBS accounts 
of U.S. residents that held more than 1 million Swiss francs in 
undeclared assets at any time between 2001 and 2008. Other 
benchmarks include U.S. citizens who were beneficiaries of 
offshore company accounts. 
     In both cases, there has to be a suspicion of tax fraud 
and the like, according to a statement distributed last year 
by the Swiss Justice Ministry in Bern. 
     The steepest penalty allows the IRS to seize the higher of 
$100,000 or 50 percent of an offshore accounts value when the 
holder deliberately didnt disclose it to the Treasury 
Department. That penalty can apply to multiple years. 
     Scott Michel, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale in Washington, 
said he had received two calls yesterday from clients 
considering a voluntary disclosure after the Parliaments vote.   
                    Leniency for Volunteers   
     Michel said he and other tax lawyers hope the IRS will 
continue to show leniency to people who come forward, even 
without explicit offers to reduce penalties such as those last 
year. 
     If they start hammering people with 100 percent or more 
penalties, people are going to stop making voluntary 
disclosures, Michel said. 
     At least 16 UBS clients have been charged with tax crimes 
in the case. Two UBS bankers and three other alleged enablers 
of tax crimes also have been charged. At least 150 other 
Americans are under criminal investigation, the Justice 
Department said last year.

			Assuming you are talking about pillar 1, ie. AVS, yes then it is possible.  I don't thing you can continue with pillar 2 without gainful employment.   
I note you mentioned 'partner' but not 'spouse'.  Generally all must pay into AVS, and there is an exception for spouse if the working spouse pays 2x the minimum AVS contribution.  If person is not spouse, it is my understanding they are not exempt and are obligated to pay based on assets or other formula.

			you seem to have an L or B-permit. 
In that case your taxes are deducted from every month salary. 
At the end of the year you can claim taxes back. 
Unfortunately you are too late for the claim of 2009. 
Deadline is end of March.  
You find the form downloadable from the homepage of your city. 
I.e.  
I contact the office by email every year to request for the link (find the contact info on the above link). As well the form is called different in every canton. So even that I am native German speaking, the form was hard to find for me and in different cantons you can add more or less figures. 
It is simple though, only a two paper sheet to hand in.

4488	Financebankingtaxation	US tax 1040 form: use Brutto or Netto income?	Karl	4223	1	Location: Here	14.06.2010, 10:45	"    I believe that you use Brutto or Gross Income.  Then you deduct taxes paid to foreign governments having mutual taxation pacts with the US government.  Switzerland is one such country.  Are you an ex pat or permanently living here as there are different rules for that as well.   
Basically, I have been told that I won't pay taxes beyond the greater amount paid in either country.  Since federal taxes in CH are less than those in the USA, that means the US return will be the final arbiter of how high your tax bill will be.  I believe the way it works is that you get a tax credit for the CH taxes paid.  Of course, this means that you have to know what taxes you paid in CH.  I don't know about you but my 2008 and 2009 US taxes aren't done and my 2009 CH taxes aren't done either.

			I think it might depend on how much you're getting paid. You might not have to pay anything. 
If I'm not mistake, US citizens in CH who are paid by US companies are tax free until 96k. They just pay social security.   
Perhaps someone can correct me if I'm wrong.

4500	Financebankingtaxation	Bit of an odd tax question - advice needed	JustNotCricket	1526	12	Location: UK	02.06.2010, 02:37	"    Ideally your employer would offer a tax equalisation scheme so that you pay the same tax that you would have paid had you remained at home, your employer picking up the difference (or, often, collecting and keeping any savings). Normally this would be accompanied by an employer-paid accountant to prepare the real and the fictive tax returns.   
Assuming that you don't benefit from such a scheme, how you proceed will depend on your spouse's situation and your combined offshore assets. As has been said previously these will not be taxed directly, but their existence will put you into a higher tax bracket.   
Unless you undertake some gymnastics (separation, ring-fencing assets with an entity or trust) -- and if not bona fide these put you at risk for penalties -- you face the common problem of cross-border incompatibility of tax systems and inadequate protection by tax treaties. With the changes in non-dom and non-resident taxation of a couple of years ago, and the counting of days of travel and the 90-days rule, being dual resident (UK & Switzerland) is a real risk. You will get a credit for tax paid to the ""other"" country, but you will always pay the highest rate and (often) lose exemptions (think of ISAs, etc.; and perhaps Third Pillar savings and even Children's Trust Funds).   
One area of incompatibility is that in the UK there is separate taxation and in Switzerland there is taxation of the family unit, modified as stated above where the income and assets are attributable to a foreign-based spouse, or consist of foreign real estate.   
There is advice available in Switzerland from UK-qualified advisors; I'm sure there are references in the Forum archives.

This happened to my father in-law, he took early retirement intending to live of his savings until his pension kicked in at 65 only to discover that he still had to pay AHV until he reached 65, the calculation being based on his assets as neither of them were working....

			You could also search the forum, I posted some info on getting good rates on exchanges like this, and it is easy, free and safe too. Basically you can sell the chf for euros using a Swiss bank, and use a free sepa payment within Europe to transfer the money.  I will look for the post.. 
Here they are, posts on   (I am not affiliated!)       
PS. As long as the Greece/Spain/Portugal situation is affecting the Euro, fears in the market (and therefore also the carry trade unwind) mean the CHF might get even stronger. That said, I personally do not think we will go much further, i.e., 1.30 would already be very pessimistic in my view. But all bets are off if the markets truly crash, or the Euro gets into another proper plunge against the dollar...

4508	Financebankingtaxation	Flexible mortgages	Phil_MCR	1415	8	Location: Basel	26.05.2010, 18:05	" 
			
			I would suggest thinking very carefully about paying down the capital, like another poster said, the situation here is very different from other countries, and you are basically penalised for paying off your house.  Tax, wealth, and other things all work to your disadvantage doing this.  Suggest doing some some scenerios and talking to fiduciary/tax expert perhaps.   
To get around to your original question though, the solution could be to divy up the tranches so that you have a part coming due every year or every other year, as per your liking, ie. staggering such that you have 3 parts of say 3 years each.  Thus, one comes due for renewal or payoff each year.

4509	Financebankingtaxation	Postdoc at Bern needs advice on tax deduction	Flute_Fondue	2527	10	Location: Canada_Bern	22.05.2010, 08:36	" 
			
			Without having seen the contract, I can't say how they've detailed the breakdown of the salary (or thedeductions). However, most likely the 19% is in fact the ""employee's contribution"" and not the ""employer's contribution"".    
Your chances of negotiating any post-doc salary (unless you are a very highly sought after individual with your choice of pick of several top flight universities) are non existant. University of Berne is public entity and it has a fixed pay schedule (fixed deductions, etc.). Depending on what pay grade you post doc position falls into you will get the amount x.    
However, by all means ask for clarification if something is unclear. I would not find it rude after all it is a different country and a different system, and you will need to know how much disposable income you will have in the end and what ancilliary costs you will be facing (average rent, health insurance, length of military service to be done...)   
I'm kidding about the last one :-)

ALV 1% -75 
AHV 5.05% -379 
Source tax 9.17% -690 (this is single wo kid wo church tax. if you have kids or u are married this could be different) see rates here:  
A= single 
B= married u work only 
C= married both working 
0,1,2,...= number of children 
Pension: this could be different in every company. depends on pension plan, your insured salary, and your age. Use an apprx. 4%: -300.   
So this will give you appr. 6056 CHF net per month. 
Dont forget that u have to pay your own health insurance from your net, that could be a few hundreds more. check comparis.ch

At this point it falls under a special tax regime which applies to all savings for old age ie similar in art to pensions.

You really need to wait for a Definative Rechnung to come back from the tax office. This will arrive with a payment slip, filled in with an amount to pay if you owe them something or filled in with an amount of '********' if they owe you. Any overpayment will go into the bank account given on the tax declaration.

			One option would be to declare your Swiss address as your permie address - and then your UK one as your 2nd home.   
You can then claim a lot of expenses back against tax - including rent. It is basically what the MPs were doing - and it is technically legal.   
I used Parasol when I was in the UK and they took care of the paperwork (for a fee) - but it did mean my net UK tax exposure was similar to Swiss income tax.    
However, it can only be done for 2 years - which is why the MPs moved residences!!

Many years ago an acquaintance became engaged to a girl who was a spendthrift, with debts to all the New York department stores. I told him not to give her an engagement ring until and unless she discharged those debts in bankruptcy. Which she did.   
The acquaintance was my client, not the department stores. It wasn't and isn't my task to pass moral judgment, just to explain what the law is.   
One nice thing about New York law (bearing in mind I haven't lived in NY since 1972) is that one can file a criminal misdemeanor complaint against a harasser. I did that in fact against a landlord once after she refused to allow me to retrieve my belongings. Either out of spite (she was a spiteful person) or to extort extra money.

...therefore if he transfers Euros from Italy to Switzerland into a Euro account without and need for foreign exchange, he has no currency risk (if you understand what the term actually means - he would have currency risk if he had to move into CHF, the danger being if the Euro subsequently strengthened against CHF).   
If you are talking about the the intrinsic value of Euros falling then that is a risk for all and every asset and currency, and deciding which currencies or asset classes would be  best to hold would be the subject of a whole new thread.

I actually used it like a debit card in the UK, and it wasn't at any point declined there, so i guess it does work internationally, just maybe not online, where they have a rigid - the number must be this long in this format - type system.  No bother, I have got a friend to do the transaction for me, as the site would also not accept my Amex Blue, haha!

4535	Financebankingtaxation	Importing wedding gifts	benjers	1153	2	Location: Zurich	07.04.2010, 10:43	"    The page you cite may reflect the law, but not entirely the practice. For example, shipment of household effects from abroad to set up a second (holiday) home is free of tax for goods owned for six months (but Customs rarely makes an issue of that). A couple of years ago my removals firm got me a VAT zero-rating (that's better than an ""exemption"") on brand-new goods and their customs broker got those goods entered into Switzerland VAT-free. What's more, the UK VAT zero-rating was outside the strict rules too: it was an ""indirect export""   because I selected and paid for the transporter, and hence in principle unavailable to a UK resident. (See ¶3.4) But the same mover has just assured me he does this all the time, with full disclosure and no objection from HMRC.    
So: you won't know for sure how Swiss Customs will react until you try, and there is room for discretion in the wording of the page you cited. I've re-read it in Swiss languages because unofficial translations often leave something out; this one omits the time-shift issue in every version:   If you are using a single shipper for all the goods, ask them. And think about the VAT issue if you are shipping, say, from the UK. In that case the department store (John Lewis, for example; we have used them) should ship directly to the transporter. It's still and ""indirect export"" but as I said, it works.    
Tourist VAT refunds are not so attractive as zero-rated exports since the service company takes 5-6% out of the 17-1/2% VAT refund.

4536	Financebankingtaxation	UK employee, but living in Switzerland working from home. How does that work??	Quest	5408	9	Location: Zurich	23.08.2009, 02:31	"    Sorry, I was too quick to copy the link. Yes, the rule is the standard OECD one, and the UK-Switzerland provision is here:    
Before the generalisation of totalisation treaties for social security (national insurance, state pension) contributions there could be double liability for certain payroll taxes, but almost never for income tax (for which there would be a credit anyway).    
It may still be to your advantage to pay Voluntary Class III NICs (it almost always is beneficial, up until the point where you have 30 years' credits because the UK (and US for that matter, but not Switzerland so much) skews benefits in favour of the low-paid).    
Switzerland interprets (or applies) its EU totalisation treaties to no longer allow voluntary AVS contributions for EU residents. But unlike the UK there is no minimum number of years you have to contribute (11 in the UK) to get partial benefits.

4540	Financebankingtaxation	How is foreign income taxed in Switzerland?	Pascale266	1377	1	Location: Zug	08.05.2010, 17:40	" 
			
			In general, you are taxed in Switzerland on your worldwide income, so yes.   
However, the tax treaties with some countries exclude some things (such as income from real estate) as long as they are taxed in those countries: but they may affect the rate at which you pay tax in Switzerland.   
In your position I'd think it is worth finding a French-Swiss accountant, if only to avoid paying more tax then claiming it back later.

4542	Financebankingtaxation	US Stockmarket plunges, Dow Jones down 9%...	guest	911	4	null	null	"     Well I just heard about 4 hours of traders talking about it. I don't think anyone really knows exactly. The common thread is that trading is done too fast, and the computer doesn't check if something is right, only people do. But it's the reprcussion thing happening. If I put in a stop loss order on my shares, at say 20 dollars lower then where it normally trades, because I think it's the absolute lowest I am going to go, and because some one dumps 20 billion shares, and it makes the market dump, then, for a moment, the computer will run over my stop loss at 20 lower, and sell it off, thus bringing down everyone else even further.  
However, if I am putting in a buy at that price, in the event this kind of thing happens, and I can re-call this exact same thing happening in the last time over 30 different times on different stocks that I have been following...Dendreon, Unicredit, and Volkswagen for example, then there is still demand, and the stop won't ""exactly"" crash. But you can't let a computer or brokers do all your work. I am down today, but not nearly as much as others. I am actually up on some of my stocks. 
I think tommorrow there could be a big dump as well unless the jobs numbers are sensational. But in time, the market is recovering, and Greece, even if other european banks and invested there isn't meanigingfully attached to what are economy does in growth.  
People will panic though, but there are and will be some great buying opportunities.

			It's hard to say, other then it happens a every day, I think normally on smaller scales directed this way and that. But, I am pretty convinced there is a problem when everyone is trading electronicly, and if there is a dump, you might be selling a position that at the beginning and the end of the day they are about the same, but if you owned Boston Beers, amongst others, it traded at .01 at one point today. 
The NYSE chairman has said, in the past, and today as well, if you were a buyer at .01, then they reverse the trade back, and you don't get it at that purchase price. However, if you bought it at .01 and sold it on the way up, before the end of the session, the seller is out his position. 
So for day traders there could have been some instant million/billionaires made today.

You may be better advised investing in the Channel Islands. Most major UK banks have subsidiaries there. You would not in any case benefit from tax-sparing UK vehicles (with the possible exception of a Child's Trust Fund, but that can only be opened on the basis of an initial credit with the £250 voucher given to all children when first put on the child allowance roster).   
Here's a search for 'building society' in St Helier, Jersey (many of the hits are actually banks):    
You might want to look for e-savings accounts. Nationwide (which doesn't have a Channel Islands presence AFAIK) pays its best rate on e-savings with a limited number of allowed withdrawals annually.

Many ""secondos"" are German since birth and took a dual-citizenship fromTurkey. Germany does not have a concept of dual citizenship, so you either are German or something else, never both. There have been cases were the people were forced to choose one citizenship or others were they were stripped off their German passport (For example if you served in the other countries army, which is a no-no according to the German constitution...). If you lived long enough in Germany to change your Nationality from US to D (you obviously do have to give up your US nationality), there is no way they can revoke it afterwards as they cannot make you stateless, even if you comit crimes or terrorist acts.

Many Swiss banks conspicuously kicked out their American clients last year after U.S. authorities discovered employees at UBS were helping Americans avoid the tax man.

			Swiss Panel Advises Against UBS-U.S. Deal   
The Wall Street Journal 
April 24, 2010   
By GORAN MIJUK   
ZURICH—A Swiss parliamentary commission recommended that lawmakers vote against a government plan under which UBS AG could hand client data to U.S. authorities.   
The foreign affairs commission of the Lower House voted, 15-9, against the plan, which would have UBS by June hand over data from 4,450 accounts of alleged tax dodgers and cheats to U.S. authorities. The commission said the deal undermines Swiss law.   
The vote reflects resistance against the plan that risks crippling Swiss banking secrecy, and analysts said it may be a sign that the Swiss Parliament may vote against the proposal at its scheduled vote in June. UBS declined to comment on the commission's recommendation.

4566	Financebankingtaxation	Grocery shopping in France/Germany	doesbaddel	2780	1	Location: Zurich	20.04.2010, 16:53	"    Nobody seems to be replying, so here's a brief note: In principle you can have tax-refund documents (one for each retailer) stamped by ANY EU customs official when leaving the EU. How much detail is needed on the document is up to each retailer's VAT expert to say. The description has to be sufficient so the EU customs officer can identify the goods.   
We've been importing stuff from France to Switzerland and even in the days when I had a diplomatic ""carte de légitimation"" and was exempt from Swiss customs control I never sought a VAT refund for hypermarket stuff. Sometimes for furniture and so on brought from England: but even there the risk of having to make a formal customs entry in Switzerland argues against it unless there's a lot of money involved. I'm just glad not to be paying Swiss prices.    
Compare for example what I just paid for a Liebherr wine fridge: 
Swiss price around CHF 2,000 (list price 3,290), UK Internet price around £1,000 (CHF 1,646). And aren't they made in Switzerland?

			Hi,   
I am a new foreigner working in Vaud, Switzerland and on a B-permit.   
I am told by my employers that my entire gross earnings, inclusive of deductions for AVS, Publica (2nd Pillar), Accident Insurance, Unemployment Insurance, is taxable at the rate 13% or so. This is somewhat surprising to me. Are there no permissible deductions? To give an example, if my gross salary is CHF 1000, the deductions are:   
Gross monthly: CHF 1000 
AC: CHF 20.20 
AVS: CHF 50.50 
Pension / Publica: CHF 62 
SUVA: CHF 28.30 
Impots a la Source: CHF 130   
So effectively, I get 1000-20.2-50.5-62-28.3-130 = CHF 709.   
Is that the way taxes are calculated? 
Is there any scope for claiming expenses or any other sundry deductions at the time of year-end tax filing? My annual income is less than CHF 120000.   
In some posts, I read that you can voluntarily contribute to the third pillar that exempts some of the salary for taxation purposes. 
Is that true? 
How does it work? 
Is it useful for somebody who plans to leave Switzerland after a fixed tenure of say 2 years? I mean does it become too difficult to extract that money out when leaving the country.   
Thanks. Regards, 
Prem

4570	Financebankingtaxation	Claiming 3A separately for married couple	wildboar	777	0	Location: Geneva	19.04.2010, 11:46	" 
			
			Hi there,   
Is it possible that I can claim the contribution done in third pillar separately without asking rectification with my wife's combined salary, if we both are taxed at source?

			that's for sure that you both would be taxed like singles by your respective employers. 
Afterwards, you can claim for tax revision and here I m not sure how exactly it's done.

4572	Financebankingtaxation	Is Foreign Income directly taxed in Switzerland	anu_d	4865	6	Location: Kreuzlingen	16.04.2010, 20:57	"    You are subject to worldwide taxation in Switzerland. I understand Dubai has little or no taxation, so there is no tax to deduct from the Swiss tax.   
There are workarounds/loopholes but I understand the main one does not help you in Switzerland: it is the use of a ""hybrid entity"" such as an American state Limited Liability Company (LLC) taxed in the USA as a partnership and in most other countries (but not, I am told, Switzerland) as a corporation. Thus if funds are not paid out they may not be taxed (although in Britain the IR35 rules can cause grief for service companies).   
Years ago I encountered this situation where I was paid by a Canadian company or as self-employed in various countries, and I contrived to contribute to voluntary AVS, to the UK NI, to Canadian QPP and to FICA/SET in the USA enough so that I now get a small pension from each. Income taxation was complicated then too.   
You would, of course, like to keep your Dubai income free of tax. It may be possible to keep the funds in the company and invest it free of tax until such time as you withdraw and/or remit it. Sometimes you can divert a large portion into a pension scheme, but this depends on mutual recognition of the pension-fund status of the investment (not a problem with Dubai but a common problem with the US and UK).    
By and large European countries treat income earned from a foreign firm not registered and not doing business in the country of taxation similarly to (but not exactly the same as) self-employment income. The UK actually forgives the employer portion of NICs, the US does not.    
The Swiss fiscal authorities reserve the right to pierce the corporate veil if they think you are acting solely to avoid tax and not for a valid business reason.   
You should assume, until and unless you have had specialised advice or at least reported what you are doing to the Swiss tax authorities that everything you earn in every country is taxable in Switzerland, subject to credit for any tax paid to the country where the work was performed. And you could be liable for double Tier 1 (AVS or NI type) pension contributions in the absence of a Totalization Agreement. (I assume Dubai has no such pension scheme, but what do I know. In the 1970s the US Government forced foreign countries to sign such agreements by imposing FICA (social security tax) on multinational companies for even the slightest business presence of their employees in the USA, even if they were also paying such tax to Britain (and other countries).   
Hope that helps.

4575	Financebankingtaxation	US Tax Form 2555 Help, please	holycow	2356	3	Location: Geneve	14.04.2010, 12:21	" 
			
			I'll disagree with Andy02 & Kevlegs a bit - I don't find anything in the Instructions that force you to choose between the ""resident"" or ""physical presence"" test to claim the exclusion.  The advantage of claiming both is that, if the IRS wishes to challenge your claim, they must challenge both tests.   
However, from your description (and I'm   going by what you wrote) it is not clear you qualify for either.     
The ""bona fide resident"" test ""involves your intention...about your stay.""  Do you intend to stay in CH for an indefinite period, or were you sent there by your employer for a specified (or for a limited) period?  If the latter, you don't qualify.   
The ""physical presence"" test requires that you are outside of the US for 330 full days in the tax year.  (You need to be able to document that).  If you can, you're clear, but the burden of record-keeping is on you.   
Last, but not least, if you are on a salary, then of course you were earning an income while on vacation.  (You would have received a paycheck for that period of time.)   
None of the above is meant to be discouraging, but only to emphasize you should read the form's instructions very carefully.

4576	Financebankingtaxation	Moving a Roth IRA to Switzerland.	Stuber G	3571	5	Location: Schwarzenbach S.G.	12.04.2010, 09:21	"    I had thought that whereas foreign tax-free quasi-retirement accounts can often (as in the UK case) be moved to the US, the reverse was not possible. A quick look on Google suggests this is incorrect, at least insofar as Canada (RRSPs) is concerned:    
I agree there is usually little point in transferring such accounts unless they are too small to bother managing. You have answered this sort of question before:   I know from   and from my own practice that -- except where specifically acknowledged otherwise by tax treaty -- foreign fund management (SICAVs, unit trusts...) can easily fall foul of US tax law and incur annual tax on accretions and possible double taxation later. There is a simplified Form 3520 system for Canadian RRSPs; whether that works for Third Pillar I can't say. I do know that in many or most cases expats ignore the rules and generally manage to stay beneath the radar because of ignorance on the part of provincial IRS auditors. What will happen now with draconian $10,000 level penalties I can't say.    
But this is not unique to the USA. In Britain draconian penalties in the thousands of pounds are being levied for innocent timing and characterisation errors:        
and lots more easily found on Google.   
Since tax authorities talk to each other and learn from each others' experience, can Switzerland be far behind? Limited only by the proportionality rules of the ECHR, something the IRS is immune to.

4582	Financebankingtaxation	Filing a US tax return	JustRose	3968	24	Location: Basel	05.02.2010, 16:03	"    Right, if you don't care about the foreign income exclusion (FIE), then there's no need to satisfy the 330 day rule.     
You are also correct to say that amounts excluded under the FIE don't qualify for the foreign tax credit.   
If your Swiss taxes are higher than your US taxes, then you won't have to pay the US anything because your credit will be larger than your US tax burden (but from what I understand US taxes are almost always higher than Swiss taxes).  You have excess credits in this situation and I believe you can actually carry these credits back or forward to other years in which you may have paid (or will pay) more US taxes than Swiss taxes.   
I'm not too sure about what exactly is considered a Swiss tax, but I'll go with what holliday just said.

There is a monthly service charge and mine is higher b/c I have credit cards through them as well.  I think it is around 10 CHF/month (without the credit cards), but I am not 100% sure.

			Yep, I am in agreement with crfesi...  Although it *might* be possible to have a flat for more than you are paying now, everything else will be loads cheaper.  Easily, it will be 1/2 to 1/3 the cost for food, entertainment, bars, social life, etc...  As far as taxing, yes, federal tax is the highest.  And they will tax you more than here in total, but not by much, and it does depend on your visa (although I have no experience there b/c I am from the US).  As a US citizen working here, I am taxed ~25% total.  There, it would be ~30% total.    
Good luck with the move and enjoy it!  :]

The rate that you see online is the average, or the mid-point of the bid and ask price. that is not the price at which the dealer is buying or selling.

You should as a rule do a standard tax return anyway as you might be paying too much (or for that matter too little).

4605	Financebankingtaxation	IBAN Question USA	alfons	33684	14	Location: Graubunden	10.03.2010, 17:53	"    Depending on your bank you may be able to finesse the issue as I did, in the reverse. We bank with HSBC in London. They gave me an ABA code and a SWIFT code to use for their New York clearing office; this code has to be accompanied by the codes for our London account (SWIFT code, sort code, account number, name of recipient). The transfer then becomes a domestic US transfer, cheaper for me. They charge little or nothing for the transatlantic move from their New York clearing office to my London branch.   
Occasionally transfers are refused (typically with no refund of fees) because of an anomaly in the codes. The way around that is to present a fax from the destination bank, on their letterhead, giving the proper information. It's then impossible for the foreign bank to say it's wrong.   
Another solution I've used in the past is to get hold of the country desk officer (in this case the person responsible for US business) at the bank's main office and explain the problem. He or she will normally sort it out very fast. This happened to me years ago when a branch manager of Citibank refused to open a letter of credit in favour of a Korean supplier.

			Does anyone here know if there are any tax efficient investment vehicles for UK nationals who are Swiss residents, i.e. equivalent to US's 401K?  Swiss pension plans?  Can one decide what investments go into these pension plans (e.g. equity or bond funds) and what is the maximum that one can put into these vehicles?  can a self employed person have a Swiss pension plan?  THanks

If he is a Swiss resident, then ZH and many other Swiss cantons consider gifts from parents to progeny as tax-free.    
Gifts are not income. Nevertheless, both giver and recipient must declare the amount (page 4 of the ZH tax return).

I mean California is not cheap at all but this is a whole different ballgame! Luckily we are not big meat eaters. We might look into planting some of our own food such as herbs, salad, tomatoes, berries and whatever the climate allows for. Are there any organic fruit/veggie box delivery services?

			--- Thanks, everybody. Just to report back. I Checked with 
the credit swiss calculator. Nice web page. If I split the 
household income into two equal parts and pretending  
to be two singles, the total tax decreases to 5%.    
  Conclusion: in the UK a married couple with middle 
range highish income, can pay lower tax in percentage than the  
equivalent amount taxed n Switzerland, especially 
so, if the equivalent amount is in terms of purchasing power.   
-- Point taken, low tax/high income are not the main points 
for living in Switzerland.  I am really put off by NHS and public 
transport but love the country and the sense of humour  
(and my neighbours)!  Switzerland offers good med, public  
service and all is worth to pay tax for.

Although you have to allow for currency exchange variations when you price your products, the prognosis from all the banks was that the dip would level off above 1.45. They were wrong then as they have been wrong about the USD before. When someone can explain in simple terms why foreign currencies fluctuate as they do based on rumors, speculation and foreign debt, please spend a minute and write it down so that I can begin to understand the mechanisms at work please.

			As far as I know, if you earn less than 100,000 CHF (or was that 120,000 CHF?) per year, you don't have to file a tax return form by default.  If, on the other hand, the tax department sends you a tax form, you can't ignore and either have to send back a reply explaining your circumstances and why you shouldn't have to file a tax return (being below the limit), or otherwise submit the completed form.

			Hi Terry   
you're right about the customer - though also bear in mind that the cc companies get paid considerably more when applying a chargeback because they usually levy a hefty fee to the merchant for the privelege of being defrauded.   
When you step back and look at the big picture of the CC/banks you see that no matter what happens either the customer or the merchant loses, the banks never lost. Which I find particularly unethical since both customer and merchant are paying for a secure and safe method of transferring funds, and the system is manifestly flawed.   
3D secure sorted that out to some extent with the banks taking responsibility (though the concensus view is that by pushing people to enter their PIN online it is one more element of data that can be stolen by fraudsters and used to the detriment of the customer). However I invisage a fat amount of chargeback-fine money that is no longer going in the pockets of whoever. What troubles me is whether SEPA is the answer to these missing funds.

4641	Financebankingtaxation	ACA says US foreign earned income exclusion under attack	MrMert	3173	6	Location: Vaud	18.03.2010, 11:48	"    Swiss Banks with US exposure are rejecting US customers who reside i the USA and cancelling mortgage offers. 2 buyers at the National de Montreux may lose their deposits b/c finance offers withdrawn by BCV (with no US presence). For UBS/Crédit Suisse one issue is having IRS seize assets out of US branch, while foreign law requires non-US branch to repay depositor:    
Foreign residents who are US persons can still get banking (after all UBS has a branch in the US Mission to the UN for American staff, and provides lease guarantee accounts for them). But such business is centralised in a few branches, notably Geneva for UBS.   
""Accidental Americans"" whose ""functional nationality"" is Swiss are treated like any other Swiss. On the other hand knowledgeable bankers would keep them abreast of the W-9 and QI pitfalls. While not sophisticated enough to address the ineligibility for mutual-fund status of local pension and investment vehicles. The new tax protocol should end the tax anomaly of Third Pillar -- but not relieve savers of form 3520 reporting (or perhaps a special form like simplified 8891, used for Canadian plans).    
What I am anxious to see is how the IRS deals with innocent, naive, lower-middle-class earners who cannot possibly fullfil the foreign asset reporting forms properly and can't afford professional help. I've given volunteer assistance for years but as the reporting rules become more onerous and the penalties more draconian, I'm seeing refusals to comply and a psychic withdrawal from everything American.    
My normal counsel had been to qualify for Medicare and minimal Social Security by contriving subject earnings for ten years. Some, today, just want to stay below the radar and ""wait for the xenophobic penalty system to implode"".    
There is, after all, a difference to a US-resident with no real foreign connection who opens a sham business in Liechtenstein or the Caymans and spends untaxed trading profits and investment gains via a foreign-basede debit card (these transactions are all monitored trend-wise now; and all MasterCard and VISA transactions are converted to dollars en route to a third currency; SWIFT transactions are likewise accessible to Treasury.) The difference is to ""accidental Americans"" and permanent expatriates who have no US dollar assets.   
Counseling such persons involves analysing whether they are genuinely free of actual or potential US assets and rights, and whether they are in the line of inheritance from or to a US person. Careless planning means that Stiftung or Anstalten assets can be 100% consumed by tax very easily.   
I say this because the occasional (ignorant) demands for repeating the Carter elimination of the foreign earned income exclusion guarantees hardship, hostility, loss of allegiance, and unintended criminality.   
One should look at why the Philippines abandoned the worldwide income taxation scheme imposed on its citizens (then US protégés) by the Income Tax Act of 1913. Following gross devaluation of the peso and the imposition of the highest rate of tax on simple domestic workers abroad, the tax on Filipino expats was abolished in 1999. It made no sense to keep a tax where everybody was (out of financial necessity) cheating.

4646	Financebankingtaxation	Best Credit Card to take overseas?	claraaus	3032	13	Location: Basel	09.03.2010, 16:32	"    If he qualifies and if he has assets in Sterling to pay the bills, the best credit card is a Nationwide Building Society VISA card   or else their Debit card based on a Flexaccount. They charge zero loading (commission and fees) on use within Europe and 1% elsewhere.   
If you want to use a Swiss (or any other) card, make sure you are not paying a high loading (Amex charges 2.7% -- I remember when it was 0.5% -- on foreign transactions. As both MasterCard and VISA add 1% to foreign transactions (regardless of currency) the Nationwide deal is particularly good. I know of no US or other non-US financial institution that charges 0%. Many US credit unions, and USAA Federal Savings Bank, charge 1%. (Many other US and foreign banks charge 3%, which is extortionate. At least with Amex you get some free insurance, car rental CDW, travel accident, theft & breakage of new purchases, etc.)   
All VISA and MasterCard currency conversions go via the US dollar. Whether that means anything in terms of cost I've never been able to figure out. But it does seem to mean that the USG can spy on you if they want to.

I am now a member of a church that is  supported by Swiss church tax, so see no reason to support everyone else's churches when I should be supporting my own.   
To be honest, I find the notion of government support for 'approved' churches to be somewhat disagreeable - and that's speaking as a member of the Established church in my home country.   
I'll pay as my conscience dictates, not as some politician tells me.   
To suggest that non-church-goers should give up hard earned cash to support charities without any say as to which charities they support is a bit cheeky, and misses the whole point of charity anyway.

My wife is starting a post-doc in ETHZ and my permit will be dependent on hers. I don't know how to deal with taxes (US and Swiss) and whether or not I actually can have an income on that basis with my presumably temporary B permit.

4660	Financebankingtaxation	contract taxes	juice99	995	17	Location: Zurich	02.03.2010, 11:15	"    Yeah. Who wants to work more than 6 hours a day?      Why would a contractor want to be part of the company? With one of my clients, I've been offered a permie role twice, and turned it down. Sometimes I'm invited to dept parties. Sometimes not. I'm always grateful when I am, but certainly don't expect to be. I'm NOT part and parcel of the organisation. If I wanted to be, I'd take the permie job.    
And why expect to be invested in? You are supposed to be adding value to the company - not the other way round. As a contractor you take charge of your own career, decide how you'll invest your own training budget, and take advantage of any opportunities.   
I've never been looked down on. Quite the opposite. I'm appreciated for what I can do. And the fact that if there isn't any work to do, I go elsewhere, without charge! I've had the occasional numpty who shows jealousy of my lifestyle - but if they're that bothered, they should contract themselves - if they're good enough.   
Tip for any contractors. Always buy the first round when you go for a drink.

			Only a week ago there was a long discussion on getting pensions while living here in Switzerland. Your Gemeinde or Commune have a person reponsible for answering the AHV / AVS questions.    
The problem is not easy to answer as there are many variables. Basically you contact the last pension fund you used when working here and they start a search in all of Europe. Your different pensions are then calculated and paid individually every month into your Swiss bank / Post account.

Because even if you are in tax a la source you can still ask and fill a complete tax declaration. The opposite can also apply? If they want you to fill a tax return (and send you the papers) you have to fill it?

			We-ve used it several years running, in Vaud and now Zug assuming you have a reasonably straight forward return the principle advantage is that it prompts you through the forms in effect.   
You could try the online software downloadable from the vaud site too which is free; told that Dr Tax is better cause it prefills the maximum allowance for a few fields; whereas the download from the tax office does not..   
Did use the downloadable software one year some years ago; in Vaud.

			I spoke to a tax advisor and was told that the agency could deduct the CHF 1500 a month from gross salary and pay it as a tax-free allowance if the covenants are met to receive it (which they are). There is no need yet to write to the authorities to claim.   
The agency, who appear to be experts overnight (considering that they didn't know about this until I mentioned it to them yesterday), are adamant that I need to write to the authorities giving the reasons/justification, which will take weeks/months. I imagine it's just their way of avoiding more hassle /work.      
Wish I could wash my hands of them, but I suppose they have you over a barrel. Won't be making the same mistake twice.

What does everyone else do about non-Swiss shares?  I hold some shares back in the UK in an online sharedealing service, so for the tax return I went into the service on 31 Dec after the markets were closed, printed out the current portfolio valuation (which is date/time stamped), then printed a list of all dividends received during the year.   
I've only just sent in the tax return for 2008 (don't ask...), so hopefully this system will work for the tax office.  We had a large accounting firm to prepare the return as a first year relocation bung, and they didn't bat an eyelid, so fingers crossed.

The ""value"" of your property is denoted to be 70% of the purchase price. It is not normal or expected to report market value.   This would count as personal wealth.  The amount of any mortgage on the property is deducted from that.         
So does this mean that if I only have 25% equity in my house then my property wont constitute ""personal wealth"" for tax form purposes? Is it only when I have more than 30%  equity that this will start to contribute towards weatlh tax?   
The Treuhand that I use asks me to provide the value of my house and the amount of mortgage which there is on it.

On that basis, I respectfully I disagree with Scrambled (and invite his/her reply).   
Per Article 15 of the US-CH tax treaty (""Dependent Personal Services""), the income is taxed according to where the services are performed:       
Per the original post, the work will be performed in the USA, thus the wages would not  be taxable in CH.  If some of the work is done in CH, then   may be taxable in CH (and in the US).    
For clarity (to minimize the number of tax returns), it is best to have a written agreement with the employer specifying that the work is   in the US, and visits to CH are   for training.

4698	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss loan to cover US student loan & TAX accountant	magicpau75	1366	0	Location: geneva	12.02.2010, 15:59	" 
			
			Hello,   
I would like to know if it is possible to have a loan here in Switzerland in CHF to cover a US student loan in dollars to pay it off completely and get rid of the exchange rate risk (furthremore, now the dollar is preatty low....).   
What are the institutions that do it? any experience? 
What would be the expected interest rate? fixed or variable?   
I contacted UBS, but they usually do mainly loans for house and real estates (this is what I have been told by the guy at the bank).   
Concerning taxes, I understand that it is difficult to find good accountants who understands SWISS-US tax laws. 
What should I look for, exactly (certifications or titles) to be sure the accountant is good so that there's no risk of penalties?   
What is the exact income limit for no taxation (taking into account II pilier, as far as I understood)?   
Thanks

4702	Financebankingtaxation	CGT for Non-Swiss Resident?	snowgoat	1039	0	Location: UK	11.02.2010, 19:15	   Afternoon Folks     I'd greatly appreciate any views anyone can offer on this subject.     For a UK resident and domiciled individual, owning a second property in Switzerland, what is the situation re Capital Gains Tax on selling the swiss property in canton Vaud?      The UK CGT on second homes is currently 18% I believe, but I understand the Swiss CGT on such may be 28%, reduced by 1% for each year owned. Is this the case?     Does anyone know how UK domiciled and resident individuals are treated for CGT on a Swiss home sale?  is it just the UK 18%, or the full Swiss CGT less any deductions for years owned, or some other hybrid / bi-lateral agreement where HMRC would be paid 18% and the Swiss authorities any balance up to their local law % levels?     Finally, I know the HMRC calculates CGT as the sale price, less the original purchase price, less allowances such as stamp duty (or eqv) and sale, marketing, tax advice and conveyancing fees etc. But does anyone know if these are all calculated in the original Swiss francs cost at the time of each transaction, then the bottom line converted to sterling for any gross profit CGT calculation? - or are all Swiss costs converted into £ first and then calculated?  I would have thought the former, as forex variances over a long period of time could make a big difference, but you never know with HMRC!     If anyone is able to recommend a good (English speaking) Swiss CGT specialist that would be much appreciated.     Many thanks for any views and tips      Regards     SG  	Posts: 3	Join Date: Feb 2010	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

I am a non-EU, worked at Lichtenstein for about 8 months (May'08 - Dec'08) staying at Switzerland. Left Switzerland without claiming pension fund to a non-EU country. Returned back to EU (Italy) and working since last one year. Is it possible to make a transfer of old pension fund to the new employer ? If so,  any inputs on the procedure appreciated.

4710	Financebankingtaxation	Are Swiss tax laws going to put a stop to my marriage plans?	sarasvatiemma	3543	7	Location: England	07.02.2010, 12:59	"    I think with 'security' I also meant rights. The security of being the next of kin. The security of knowing that if Mr L were taken seriously ill, I would be allowed to visit him in Intensive Care without fighting to do so. The security of knowing that if one of us died, there would be no question of the other having to leave the home or having someone turning up and claiming their right to its contents. The banks sometimes freeze the account when one of the partners in a joint account dies, but according to my information, the bank would allow monies to be taken out by the other account holder to be used for everyday expenses.    
This may all sound a bit morbid, but I've known too many folk who were horrified to realise that they had practically no rights at all when their partner died.    
Quite apart from that possible scenario, living away from, and thus 'losing' my own family, it was definitely a plus to be able to join my husband's family by getting married.

			Hi all   
Cash is king.  Today, Euros are 1.4725 CHf (x-rates.com). On that Travel Cash Card (in an earlier ""reply"", Post Finance issued), you will get an exchange rate of 1.49 + a 1% commission today, so 1.54 CH to add a Euro to it(plus a charge per use).  I got some Euros out of my Post Account today at an ATM in Zurich and got a 1.5013 exchange rate.  If you charged a Euro purchase today you would get an exchange rate of 1.492 + a processing fee of .9%...so you get back to a bit over 1.55.  Take the money, leave your card at home!

PF has no bank license. PF outsources mortgages and 3a to UBS. Mutual Funds are outsourced, too, from Banks. Outsourced services are not state guaranteed.   
PF does not offer company founding accounts. May not offer company and project financing. Possibly not well networked internationally.   
PF is weak on investment advice.   
For basic services, PF is very good. Low fees. High interest rates on deposits.    
Hence, I suggest the combo PF + KB.

Good point about the US citzenship issues.  Considering I am not really planning on going back, it might not be important to get him a US passport until he wants one.   
The sums we are talking about are small.  I wish it was otherwise, but wishing does not make the money appear    
I like DRIPs but I think they might take withholding taxes out for non-US citizens thus he would lose 25% or so of the dividends just for not being a citizen.  This is something I will have to clarify with the DRIPs I have already.   
Also the EUIL is a US product and he would not be eligible if he does not have a Social Security number.  I understand the UK also tried to launch EUIL but it did not gain market acceptance.  So instead they have other Unit Linked life insurance products.

After reading your thread about pension funds i have to admit i'm still slightly confused. Basically i'm 24, working 100%, and on just over 40k a year. What pension funds should i be paying? As i am 24 does that mean i qualify for the ""risiko plan""...but not entirely sure what that is. although i have a year contract it is looking likely that i will only stay 6 months....can i take whatever money i put into the fund with me when i leave? what is the difference between a ""normal -Plan"" and the ""BVG plan-versicherter lohn""   
you also may have guessed from the post that my german is limited!

4740	Financebankingtaxation	Applying for Credit Cards in uk while in CH	OBone	773	1	Location: Aeugst Am Albis	22.01.2010, 18:14	"    A lot depends on a. your status of residence (at lot if not all UK credit cards require you to be UK resident) , b. how much you are worth to the credit card provider (if you earn mega bucks I think anything is possible but then you probably wouldn't have a few K on a credit card unless you're stoozing) and c. whether you are prepared to lie on application forms especially in respect of a and b above. I'd try and move the money before you leave the UK.    
I'm sure others will have achieved it from here but as an honest and totally paranoid individual (who worries about who knows what about me in UK and thinks the lots of people share data and I would be caught out) I wouldn't do it. I was lucky that when I left the UK I was given a lump sum redundancy so was able to clear debts and I appreciate that not everyone is that lucky.

4742	Financebankingtaxation	Ex-expat in urgent need of [Swiss] tax help	UncleSam	1262	2	Location: Zurich	20.01.2010, 08:44	"    This is where the big mistake occurred.   
You knew you had no income. 
But the authorities did not, as you never told them via the proper channels (tax return). So the authorities made the assumption everything carried on unchanged - why should they assume otherwise?   
And when you didn't file on time, the processes kicked in and the system started working. End result: tax department chasing you.      IMMEDIATELY, if not sooner, send the tax authorities a letter stating what the situation was.   
Enclose PROOF of your termination of employment at the end of 2008. 
Enclose PROOF of your wealth (for the wealth tax) as at 31.12.2008 and as at 31.1.2009. Here on EF we have no idea if you are a pauper or a multi-millionaire, so wealth tax may or may not be inconsequential 
Enclose PROOF that you left the country and were de-registered.   
You must accept that you will have to pay tax for January 2009, because you were here. At the very least: 1/12 of the wealth tax for your wealth.   
When I arrived in Switzerland in December one year, I was in the country for 13 days before the 31st December turned around. 
I had no income and few assets. 
I was still, correctly, issued a tax return, which I promptly filed. 
It had lots of 0's in it :-) 
I received a lovely letter from the tax dept, properly calculating my portion of federal and wealth tax, and apportioning it for the 13 days I was here. 
But the tax office generously let me of the CHF 1.80 tax bill :-)     
So anyway, TALK to the tax office straight away (or via email / letter). Explain you did not understand, and fill in a tax form for them 
That will be likely to be very simple with no income (unless you have a complex wealth structure across many countries...)   
Good luck!

4743	Financebankingtaxation	Tax relief for UK private school education	Paul M	1065	0	Location: England	21.01.2010, 19:20	" 
			
			Does anyone know whether you can offset UK private school costs against Swiss tax?   
There are 2 scenarios I'm hoping to clarify:   
1. I am working in Zurich on a long term contract (less than 5 years) 
2. I am working in Zurich on a permanent basis.   
The justification for leaving my son at a UK private school is that he is at a critical stage of his education GCSE/A Level and I don't want to move him until he's completed his exams.   
Can I offset the cost of his education against my overall tax liability?

			The one you get if you do not have a working permit is only valid to withdraw money from Postfinance ATM.    
When you get the permit you can ask to have the one that allows you to pay in shops.   
For online purchase you need a normal credit card which you can get only with B permit.

4751	Financebankingtaxation	Corporation Tax	guest	1086	10	null	null	"    ""astronomical fees""? Do you want to set up a trust on the moon?    
I often read that on this forum and I am a bit surprised... you are the client, so if you instruct clearly what you want and define a budget, no reason for paying ""astronomical"" fees... If you go to an advisor and ask him: ""tell me what I can do with that"", he will probably spend hours and hours on it as there are hundreds of possibilities to structure a business. But in your case, it seems that you know pretty much what you want, therefore your questions are very clear and on specific details you want to know. Therefore how could fees be ""astronomical""? Except if you go to a Big 4 office or to a ""flashy star tax attorney"" (as there are some in CH, not at all at the level they pretend to be...), I don't see how you could end up with significant fees.    
You know better than any one else how you want to run your business and how you want to manage your risks, but if I had a Russian client basically lending me CHF 1 Mio, I would prefer covering my a** with a written external advice and put this forward to my client rather than telling him ""Trust me it works"" and have him knocking at my door with 5 friends late at night once everything went wrong  Dont' take me wrong, I'm joking, but sometime it's better to spend some CHF in external advice, nobody can sort out everything by himself, especially over the internet.

You say seconded: will he be paid by a UK company or by his employer here in VD? if paid by the UK company then you will have to convince HMRC that your taxes should be paid in CH and nothing should be deducted in UK. If paid by the CH company and you all live less that 183 days in 12 months in UK, HRMC need never know! you might even be able to claim some of the travel expenses to and from the UK in your VD tax return too.

			Dear all,     I am PhD student from India, living in Bern since mid of 2008. I started PhD last 6 months ago.  My salary is according to SNF,  Approximately 3045 CHF per month before tax and holding B permit. My contract is until mid of 2012. I require a  personal loan to solve a very urgent financial commitment.    So initially I contacted Credit now, they  immediately refused to give a loan and also the reason. Since then I went to their office, then they told the reason that i must live in Switzerland at least 3 years to get a personal loan according to their bank rules.   Any one knows, is there other banks provide me a personal loan according my situation ? or any non European PhD student got a personal loan?.  Please suggest the right place to approach.

			For undergraduate, first year you really need to sort out your living expenses on your own. From second and on, if your grade is good, usually CH uni will give the scholarships, not much, around 700 CHF at that time ( when i was student). Still good for a student i think.   
And for 2nd and 3rd year, you can also find TA positions at Uni.   
As for Masters, usually the program is quite compact, not sure that you will have time to work as partimer. but if you have to, then you can always find jobs. Its not hard to get student jobs in CH, comparing to US or Canada, at least that's how i felt years ago. Note that as student, you have the permission to work 15 hours/week ( or 20h, depends on the canton). Becausae it is legal, you wont be underpaid in general.

4764	Financebankingtaxation	Pre Paid Master Card/Credit Card - Opinion Please	guest	2868	1	null	null	" 
			
			Well, I am now having the same issue as well, trying to decide between Prepaid or normal credit card. As I said in my other threads here, the only thing that I don't like about Prepaid is one has to upload cash first then only can pay using them (am I correct?...that's what Prepaid is for...). And each upload costs a certain percent commision. And I need to have the money in the card first only can buy. It means I have to prepare, let's say, 500 CHF in the card, just in case I need to but a flight suddenly to use them immediately. I don't intend to take credit, I would pay instantly the next day, but I reckon it's still not the way a Prepaid works right?   
Else for Prepaid I reckon the choices are either Migros Master Card or SBB Visa. Maybe there are others as well like Cornercard, but as I am not sure whether I would like to stuck my cash in a card (and I don't know how much it would charge if I need to cancel the card and withdraw it one day - SBB charges 20 CHF I think...), I think I will try to get a normal credit card, albeit it may be hard and I need to wait long and pray...   
Well, it may not answer what you asked actually. Sofar I realised only Ryanair (I may wrong) that requires Mastercard Prepaid for free payment, other airlines like Easyjet and Airlingus require Visa Electron for free payment which is too bad not available in CH; so it doesn't really matter much for me whether Prepaid or not as I don't fly Ryanair so often.   
Hope to hear what other think though...Thanks.

			Hi, 
I would like to setup an open ended collective investment company domiciled in CH. 
The idea is to provide an investment vehicle for shareholders. The company will be completely passive, investment company only and all activities will be outside of CH. 
Main activities will be property investments via local (foreign) subsidiaries. 
I am trying to figure out the most appropriate entity. I am not sure GmbH or AG fits but not sure what the options are.  
I am not looking to setup a fund and all the supervisory/regulatory overheads that goes with it. Something less complicated, a SICAV perhaps? 
Any advice would be appreciated before forking out CHF 300/hr on a lawyer

4774	Financebankingtaxation	buying and renting out apartment in France	poz222	1617	1	Location: Geneve	03.01.2010, 17:20	" 
			
			Hi Poz 
Although I cannot really give you decent answers, a few items can be explained though.   
Your apartment will be taxed for Tax Fonciere and also the Tax d'habitation. Depending on where the apartment lives, the taxes will vary. The Tax d'habitation will also include the television tax included.   
My rental apartment is taxed under the French system called Micro Bic. This requires for me to list the amount of net earnings from the apartment and the tax form will take about 50% removed and then tax on the balance of the 50%. This first 50% considers this paying for your mortgages, taxes, costs, etc.. This system is used within the French Impot Declaration. In your case you will be taxed differently. I can almost say it will be more dear.   
If you plan on renting the apartment all furnished, it's somewhat better. You can get people out of the apartment, if things go pearshaped. If the apartment is empty, your bail will be normally for three years, six years, or longer. It's tough to get the rentors out too easily.   
I use an agency for my apartment rental during the high season periods. This is costly but it sure is better. You have them taking all of the big part of rental apartments. My agent costs me 33% of the gross amount. Cheaper agencies will cost less but they do less too.   
I hope that this gives you a bit of information. For second property in France, this will take about 15 years before you sell the place without paying capital gains. For the first five years, it's taxed on all capital gains. From the six to the fifteenth year it reduces each year at 10% of the cap.gains. You can still make money with the apartment, if you don't turn this off in the first fifteen years.   
Good luck

			Talking about pension, I have another question. As far as I know, when a ""retired"" withdraws his/her pension fund in US as lumpsum payment, US state will withhold automatically 20% for tax for any US citizens. Then since  this ""retired person"" has no more income in US, neither anywhere else in the world, how can he/she get back (some) of this 20% tax back ? Any idea here?   
Thanks

4779	Financebankingtaxation	Importing Silver: Obliged to declare? taxes?	guest	5712	28	null	null	"    For this, I think you have to be a Registered business, also has to be specific warehouses or storage locations or Entrepot licence. Different countries have different regulations regarding that.   
Also not sure about CH, but some countries have time limits regarding how long the goods/commodities can be stored under duty suspension.   
It does not need to be re-exported, you can pay the relevant custom charges and get them ""custom cleared"" and bring them into the country for whatever purpose.

4782	Financebankingtaxation	Do I need a tax declaration ? (B permit holder)	mottamotta	2587	15	Location: basel	24.12.2009, 07:32	" 
			
			I have a couple of questions now after reading this thread...  
1).  I just moved here and started work 1 nov. 09.  I am a US citiyen on a B permit.  I am earning over the 120K mark.     
Do I have to file before the end of December this year ?  Or is it before the end of next year (2010)?   
2).  How do I actually file the taxes ?  Are there forms available ? I saw an application on the BS website.  Is that what I can use ?  It looks like it will not be available until Feb. 2010.   
3).  Do I file all taxes together (State, Local, etc.)   
It is very confusing and I am more concerned about how I file here, and how it related to my US taxes ?    
Thank You.

As long as they have said you clearly in writing that such and such is their last offer and you must pay or they will take further steps... you should be okay.

			That probably is about right.  You've got decent deductions for kids and pension fund contributions, so your tax bill is probably around 15% of taxable income -- does that look about right, according to the calculator?

I'm not really looking for specific advice on where to invest and how to make scads of cash. Rather I'm looking for ""background educational info"", if that makes sense. Things like what is a 3rd pillar and how can I pay for my first home. I guess I'm looking for something similar to a newspaper regular feature on all things finance and investing - particularly but not exclusively in a Swiss context - that is directed to people who do not have tons of experience in the matter but who want to slowly but surely build their knowledge base. But perhaps such a thing doesn't exist here. I've tried to google sites in English, French and my not so good German but to no avail.

4797	Financebankingtaxation	Techie question regarding location and retained earnings	topolino	977	1	Location: NY/Milan	11.12.2009, 01:55	" 
			
			Hi,   
The tax rate variation is sensitive for the income tax rate. Though as you describe the business, the company seems to be eligible for a special tax status, like mix or domiciled company (difference may be significant due to potential amendment of the pure domicile company with the third corporate tax reform). Thus, with this status (to be submitted in written to the tax authority), the effective tax rate will be reduced to approx. 9% in Zug (even 8% with a pure domicile company, but as said...). This effective tax rate won't be much different in other cantons, even in the high tax cantons, as for instance it will be around 11-13% in VD/GE.    
Thus, this answers your first question: if you domicile a company at a location, it's better to have the company being effectively managed from this location, as in CH, a company is taxable where its effective place of management is located and not where it's registered. Therefore if you intend to have employee in CH in another canton (which first means that it won't be a pure domicile company...), you should better have the company registered in that canton.   
Second, the non distributed profits (=retained earnings) and share capital plus any legal reserves will be subject to the equity tax (capital tax) at the end of the year. The rate may vary from one canton to the other, but domiciled/mixed company are taxed at a lower rate and that shouldn't be significant apart if you have hundreds of millions of retained earnings... In VD for instance, the capital tax rate for a mixed company is at 0.02%...   
Edit: do you want to open a branch or a subsidiary? A branch may not be eligible for a special tax status, this have to be discussed with the tax authority. Furthermore, if it is a subsidiary of a US entity, you should pay severe attention to the US rules, in particular to the ""check the box"" rules to make sure you use the tax planning appropriately. You should also seriously consider the questions around repatriation of cash through dividends, what's the final tax at source on dividends, do you have credit on that, etc. Depending what the home country is, pay also attention to potential CFC rules...

4798	Financebankingtaxation	Vaud net income calculation	dabutiman	13543	5	Location: Vaud, Switzerland	19.08.2007, 19:18	" 
			
			Hi   
My family and I are I'm moving to Vaud some time in 08.  I'm currently in the process of trying to negotiate the relocation/remueratino package with my HR department.  I'd like to compare my total UK net income with my proposed future total Swiss net income.   
Are there any easy links to sites or downloadable software packages where I might be able to do this?  Maybe someone has already set up their own spreadsheet doing this.   
I've seen the links to the taxation sites but they already assume that your know how to calculate taxable income.  I need something that assumes no prior knowledge and goes through the detail.  Should I download the Vaudtax software?   
Many thanks for your help!

If the conversion is to take place say in India the rates would be again different.   
The conversion would take place if you send Sfrs to India in Mumbai. If you send INRS then the conversion would take place in Zurich.  
CS has Nostro accounts for SFrs for some Indian banks. Other Indian banks have Noistro account with UBS.  
I assume you could get better rate if one sends SFr, thus conversion is done in the entry gate at Mumbai .  
If you send INRS your conversion would take place at the counter in Zurich.

			If you previously worked in Ireland (or another EU country) then any payments you made to unemployment insurance there will count towards your entitlement to Swiss unemployment benefits. So if you have worked in Ireland prior to moving to Switzerland this should count towards the 1 year, although you will need to get the Swiss authorities to complete a form E301 for you.

4820	Financebankingtaxation	Will	MotorsportsNorton	1033	5	Location: On the move	27.11.2009, 12:36	"    A British citizen can opt to write a will based on British inheritance law.  Thus the Swiss law on minimum inheritance shares for relations can be  circumvented.   
However a British citizen resident in Switzerland is nevertheless liable to Swiss taxes. These include taxes on gifts/donations (prior to death). Also each beneficiary of the inheritance is liable to Swiss taxes, which depends on the relationship between deceased and inheritor.

			Having done some research, both in the UK high-street and on the web I suspect GBN is correct in stating that no banks have retail activities both in CH and UK. Not even Citibank who even promote themselves as an international retail Bank.  My conclusion is that it's not in any Bank's interest to be truely international because they are probably making nice profits from charging us international/currency transation charges.    
That said I'd love someone to prove me wrong. I'm working in CH but still have my home in UK. So I'm looking for a retail bank that offers me current account facilities in both countries and free online transfers between accounts in both countries.  Or am I just dreaming?

			Hello all,   
I would be grateful if someone could help me.    
I am looking for a knowledgeable tax accountant in Zurich who is proficient in dealing with expats in the Swiss tax system. It seems there may be some rebates that I was not previously aware of to which I am entitled and I need to talk this through with an expert.    
Have any of you used anyone that you can recommend? Apologies if this has already been answered in another thread - there were so many on this site to read through!

4832	Financebankingtaxation	Help Understanding Swiss Tax	confusedxx	2512	0	Location: zURICH	17.11.2009, 10:38	" 
			
			I have a been in Switzerland for a few years now and I have a C permit, but Swiss Tax just seems to baffle me still.   
I understand that Switzerland offers great tax advantages, but the taxes still seem to be quite high.           
Living in Kanton Schwyz (supposedly very low in taxes - 285% communal taxes) and selecting single person, no children, no church tax and earning 150,000 a year with deductions for 7500 in pension and 6300 for 3rd pillar, you would still pay 20,780 in federal and communal taxes. Typically the pension, AHV and other deductions are about 11- 12% of Gross salary.  So in this example we have   
150000/12 = 12500 
12500 - 12% = 11,000 
Monthly tax bill  = 20780/12 = 1732 
1732 / 11,000 =    
Now assume a 20% bonus which would be 30,000. 
The pension deduction does not go up because bonus is not included in pensions, but suddently your tax bill is 28,200 which is 15.5% of GROSS (180k) income.  This is a tax increase of 8,200 for an income gain of 30,000.  On this marginal increase you are paying 27.3% tax.     
In this example of 150,000 the income is a moderate income.  It is not a very high expat or executive income. If you double the income and double the pension contribution then the taxes are nearly 20% of Gross income.   
Do I understand this correctly?  Are taxes really so high in Switzerland and also in the cheapest of the kantons like SZ and Zug?    
My goal is to invest and save.  How can you manage to save 20% - 25% of your income in Switzerland where things cost so much and taxes are so high?

			Ok, so now with figures:   
Case 1:  
assumptions: Swiss assets CHF 500'000; foreign (movable/non fixed) assets CHF 700'000; resident of Switzerland in ZH.   
Taxation: you are fully subject to taxes on your worldwide income and wealth. Taxable on CHF 1'200'000 at the rate of 0.10% (as computed by kiwi).   
Case 2: 
Assumptions: Swiss assets CHF 500'000; foreign fixed assets (such as property) CHF 700'000; resident of CH in ZH.   
Taxation: you are fully subject to taxes on your worldwide income and wealth, but fixed assets located abroad are exempted from Swiss taxation, but not for the tax rate. Therefore, taxable in CH are CHF 500'000 at the rate of 0.10% (applicable rate for CHF 1'200'000).   
Case 3: 
Assumptions: Swiss fixed assets CHF 500'000 (property); foreign assets CHF 700'000; resident abroad.   
Taxation: you are subject to limited taxation in CH for the property only. Taxable on CHF 500'000 at the rate of 0.10% (applicable rate for CHF 1'200'000). Nevertheless, in some cantons, you don't have to disclose your worldwide wealth to determine the applicable rate (such as Vaud) and in most of the cantons the rate is determined by estimation. The law says that your are taxable in CH at the rate that is applicable to - at least - your Swiss income/wealth.     
nb: final remark for Case 1 & 2, there are some limited jurisdictions that levy a wealth tax on national non fixed assets held (such as shares in a corporation) which could lead to a potential double taxation except if a double tax treaty is applicable.

			Assuming I understand correctly the little information I have, your partner is resident in Switzerland but is taxed at source in NO for a work (employment contract or qualified as such by NO tax authority) performed in NO. Therefore this income is taxable in NO only. As she is Swiss resident, she will have to submit each year a tax return to the CH tax authority, declaring her income in NO. This income will be exempted from CH taxation based on double tax treaty between CH and NO, but when determining the applicable tax rate to the CH taxable income of your partner, Swiss tax authority will consider the NO income as if it would be taxable in CH.

			My wife and I are UK retirees living in Vaud. Up to now bilateral agreements give us as pensioners free health insurance (i.e. claims are paid through Institution commune LaMal).   
My wife had paid 18 months contributions to AVS and has started receiving a Swiss Pension of the magnificent sum of 1,200 francs per annum.   
She has now been informed that as a 'pensioner' resident here she no longer qualifies under the bilateral arrangement and must start paying for Swiss Health Insurance.   
She will now incur an additional cost of at least 2,000 francs per annum!   
Simple idea - can she give up receiving the Swiss AVS Pension for ever?

4857	Financebankingtaxation	Financial Secrecy Index	Kristofolo	1084	2	Location: Rolle	02.11.2009, 21:16	"    So easy to believe any garbage published on the Internet, if it suits your prejudices, isn't it?  You could make up your own list, and have as much credibility as these people.   
Is the subject ""financial secrecy"", as claimed, or ""tax rates""?   
The website links to   in which the author claims (numbers added):  
""   
[1] Quite false, and quite irrelevant.  Even a village idiot could spend two minutes on a Google search and learn that DE's standard corporate tax rate is 8.7%.  (The exceptions are, not coincidentally, quite similar to Switzerland's.)  However:  ?  ""Financial secrecy"" and ""tax rates"" are scarcely the same subject   
[2] As written, the statement is false (it would depend on where the company's management is located.)  However, leaving aside the obvious fact that the author cannot comprehend US tax law, what he described is true in most countries (US, CH, UK, etc): a ""non-domiciled"" company  (""domiciliary"" or ""holding' in CH) receives tax exemptions or tax reductions.  So, once again: what is the relevance to the subject of ""financial secrecy""???   
[3] Completely false; the author seems unable to comprehend that what is not published in the pubic registry is not private to the US gov't.  If it were, then the crooks at UBS would have used Delaware companies, instead of Hong Kong companies, to help clients' tax fraud.  Again, compare the US and CH: what is published for the public about an S.A. or a DE corp is not what is available to the government upon demand.   
There is simply no ""financial secrecy"" in Delaware from the US gov't, and via tax treaties from the UK, CH, etc gov'ts.  This ""authority"" presents no evidence at all, just a claim. If   believe what they claimed, then please post a statue, court case, or article by a US attorney in support.   
Kristofolo, do you believe anything you read on the Internet?  If not,   tell us why this group has   credibility with you?

			No, absolutely do not want to tackle this on my own.  I didn't realize it was so involved so I will leave it to my US Tax Accountant - I am sure he will know what to do.    
I just like to have knowledge of what he is doing

4861	Financebankingtaxation	Complicated Tax	LocalYokel	727	0	Location: ZURICH	28.10.2009, 12:30	" 
			
			Hi there,   
I've been employed in Switzerland since January and have commuted there from another country (an EU country) on a 4 days per week basis - spending usually the 5th day (Fridays) and weekends in my home country.   
I've been taxed at source with Swiss Withholding tax on 100% of my income.   
I am terminating my employment at the start of December of November (e.g. been working here for 11.5 months).   
I maintained a house and family in my home country all during the year   
It looks like my home country wants to tax me on a pro ratia basis (e.g. tax me on the 20-30% of my income that I earned while I was located in my home country on Fridays).   
Few questions:   
A. I assume I can get a refund of the swiss taxes on the 20-30% of my time that I spend in my home country and that my home country wants to tax me on?  (There is a tax agreement)   
B. In actuality, I spent a number of days in some third countries (e.g. France, Germany, Italy). Could I also get a refund on Swiss Taxes for my time spent there?   
C. There should be no issue taking my AHV contributions with me? I don't mind keeping them in a retirement account.   
D. Any clever ideas on things I should do to minimize Swiss Taxes in the time I have remaining? (e.g. I've heard of an ""ex-pat allowance"")    
FYI - I've read a bunch of useful threads already

I can't tell you how many peole gave me ""that look"" when I was preparing to move over. The ""how dare you want to leave this perfect country! Traitor!"" look.    
I've always felt they (the government) wanted to punish us for leaving, hence the taxes and other assorted nonsense.    
Actually, so many people cannot fathom why you'd even want to leave...

Swiss car insurers were talking about charging drivers from the former Yugoslavia with higher premiums because of their nationality, based on the fact that statistically speaking they were dangerous drivers. That did not seem to cause any legal issue.   
And while I was looking for an appartment to rent, I came across ads with ""Nur CH"" in them. This would be clearly illegal in France.   
In a article a few months ago (in the magazine Bilan I think), the question was clearly asked : can swiss banks turn away US clients just because they are american. The conclusion was definitely yes.

			Sorry for the late reply but have been busy with moving, settling in etc.  Basically the only solution is to buy your car outright in CH or refinance it in France.  Both those options are the only one acceptable by the French.  Let me know if you have any further questions as we have just finished the process of bringing our car over.  Selling it was not an option as it was pretty much brand new and we would have lost a fortune on it.

			Hi,   
I just got married to a Swiss guy (I'm English) a week ago and we're going to see if we can open a joint post account or if I can just be added to his. 
I'm going to take my British passport (which has my old surname on it) and our marriage certificate. Do you think this will be enough? We haven't been to the council yet to update our details and I don't have a Swiss ID card or visa yet. I'm still on a tourist visa. Will this be a problem?   
Thanks

If you are directly employed by an Australian employer and are not an overseas company you will pay Oz tax. If you have set up your own Swiss company you can invoice your Oz imployer through your Swiss business. I would also assume that after you set up your business here you will have more than one client. The ex Oz employer becomes an overseas client.     
Always consult with local and Oz accountants.

			Hi there,   
For the past two years, I have gone to the Migration Advisory Office (Fachstelle Migration) in Zug, where they will complete simple tax returns for 70 CHF (you need to pay an annual 'membership' fee of 10 CHF first). They're very friendly and have some English-speaking staff. I've never had any problems with the tax returns they have filled in for me.   
All their details are here:  .   
You can just walk in during opening hours and they'll have a chat with you and give you a checklist of everything you need to bring, which depends on your circumstances (statements, wage slips, etc). You can then go back another day and drop all of this off. Once it's done, they will then post your completed tax return to you (along with all your documents), in order for you to check and sign it and send it off to the tax office yourself.   
Best of luck!

The problem is that the yuan is effectively pegged to the US dollar, but China is going gangbusters (relatively) and actually raised interest rates recently, so its currency should have appreciated against the USD.   
It's all about your attitude to risk -- as always.   
But you'd be better off switching to RMB than RNB  .

4903	Financebankingtaxation	Invoicing VAT to Swiss company from France	Big Arsenal Fan	3803	3	Location: Aix Les Bains, FR	28.09.2009, 18:30	" 
			
			It is a leap      
Every country has its own VAT rules and even within the EU the rules are far from harmonised (although the EU bureacrats would like you to believe differently )   
In case you sell goods (not services) your statement is correct as it is an export at the 0% rate. For services however, the case maybe different as other rules apply.   
To the OP, most probably you are exempt, but please check this with a French advisor also in terms of invoicing requirements.       "	Posts: 1	Join Date: Sep 2009	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Ms Wallace,  In reply to your comments:      Then why won't you provide support for your statements?  Let's start with the example I cited above:  You wrote in your article: ""If you are a US citizen with a foreign company or partnership you have to file not just individual but corporate taxes and the penalty for failing to do so is $10,000 per year.""    
There's no imprecision in what you wrote.  It's just not correct.     
You do not file ""corporate taxes"" in either instance you stated. Further, the penalty cited is not for non-filing of tax returns, but for non-filing of certain information returns.  (If you disagree, please cite the IRC to support your claim.)      I assume you meant to be insulting, though since you can't spell ""disingenuous"", I'm not sure.  In any event, I didn't ""say"" that, I quoted you (accurately  ).  There would be no reason to quote the second statement (""the size of the group""), since the   is irrelevant to your (unsupported) claim  that ""the  is non-compliant.""  Please don't change the subject!       You are changing the subject, again, from my comments about your articles.  I never wrote that IRS enforcement has not changed.         
 ""The Rules Have Changed for Citizens"" [headline] 
""The Rules Have Changed for Americans"".   
""the IRS (US tax authority) has imposed new rules"" 
""US citizens...living outside the US should be aware of new tax rules"" 
""News of changes to US tax filing requirements""   
Those statements are precise, clear, quoted in context ....  .      tell us which ""  and  "" "" are ""new"" or ""have changed"".  You didn't cite a single new rule in your articles, nor in your post here.    (by IRC or CFR section)?  I don't think you can do so...and I think you know it.   
As I pointed out, the filing requirements (tax and FBAR) have not changed for many years; the form TD-90 is at least 15 years old, and the requirement for a US citizen to file tax returns is many decades old.   
So, rather than a constructive article to help the few Americans who might be innocently unaware of the filing (FBAR) or tax requirements, your articles clearly set out to stir up fear and uncertainty.       
Journalism...at its worst.

4905	Financebankingtaxation	weekly cross border worker	jackd	1200	0	Location: Wollishofen	02.10.2009, 00:11	" 
			
			hi all,   
i will be relocated to zurich early next year but do not necessarily want to become a permanent resident as my partner will stay in vienna. An option is to become a 'weekly cross border worker'. does anybody have any experience here viz a viz the tax authorities?   
Can someone give me any advice on how this works? Do i need to leave every weekend? do the tax authorities ask to see the proof? how does it work with the tax authorities in the home country?   
i am told that i will be taxed at source but need to apply for a tarif reduction. is this a formality and how long does it take? what deductions are possible?   
any advise or tips would be helpful!   
cheers   
jackd

			Exactly, apart from the paying tax bit - I was a Chartered Accountant in my first career    
I am yet to do my first tax decalaration in CH, thanks for the heads up on the wealth tax bit (shares held), I will look into that although we don't receive dividends and we keep company values low by moving invoices around to our other companies (subsidiaries and especially associates).  There shouldn't be a tax implication in CH or the UK if it is avoided correctly unless there is an actualy money transfer from the UK company to our private CH account - we declare that.

			ok, for the first point, I am with you. If I can get a better return than what I'm saving by reduxing my mortgage, then I'm obviously better off.   
And I understand your 2nd point, which is why I am assuming a marginal rate of 25%. So,   that I'm better off paying off my mortgage if the first point doesn't apply.

			In my opinion it just says that when a  (profits distribution from shares) is paid to a pension fund or similar pension plans, it is not subject to withholding tax in the source state. Art. 10 refers to withholding tax on dividends, not on withholding tax on pensions capital or rent paid out to a beneficiary. This is another article of the tax treaty, which usually says that the pension paid out is fully taxable in the country of the beneficiary.   
Remember: tax treaties just allocate the right to tax between 2 countries. Whether it will be effectively taxed in the respective countries, is a matter of internal tax laws of the countries.

			I live in Geneva, but working in Zurich with Ci permit, so I have a week stay apartment in Zurich, and I pay tax in Zurich now (gross income as basis), of course the tax is lower in Zurich.    
This year the company removed my dependent allowance and tax deduction due to a new law which I have no idea, is this really the case?   
I probably will buy a apartment in Geneva soon, but still I need to rent this apartment in Zurich, does this have impact on my tax location? like I have to pay in Geneva (net)?   
Many thanks in advance for your advices.

			Since I come from a country that does not have a social security agreement with Switzerland, I understand I can get my AHV contributions back when I leave Switzerland for good. 5.05% of my salary for all these years? GREAT!   
But ..   
I've discovered this clause:     Amount reimbursed is LIMITED to the present value of the pension that the employee would have accrued during the same period if he/she would be a swiss citizen. With this limitation, the amount paid is very often much lower than the contributions.      How do I calculate the present value of the pension that I would have accrued? Should I just divide the amount I had in mind by 5 or something?    "	Posts: 1	Join Date: Nov 2007	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

Most probably you do not have a super-obligatory part. Check the annual year-end statement from the pension fund for ""überobligatorisch"" or similar.

			Glad to see most people here don't get fooled .    
I have also never been caught by these guys .      However some people have, just see the complaints from victims on various forums and blogs .    
As these ""advisors"" keep calling me regularly, instead of hanging up I have found some amusement in listening to what they offer in order to report to authorities (Commission Fédérale des Banques, Chambre de Commerce...) and to warn people against them in as many blogs and forums I have found relevant. In most cases it has turned out these ""companies"" are purely fictive, nobody knows where these guys call from in reality, no commerce registry registration where they pretend to be located. Addresses either purely fictive or they are just ""hosted"" by some telephone answering / transfer service and P.O box service shop.   
Just one trick when they call : ask for their VAT registration number. If they are unable to provide, it means their ""company"" is just non-existing .    
And by the way most of the time they call from ""hidden numbers"" (your telephone mentions ""unknown caller"" instead of showing the number of the one calling you, if your phone has this feature).

			Hi, I've searched through the threads and have a question on use of pension for a primary home mortgage.  From what I can gather, as a new arrival to Switzerland, one is allowed to additionally fund their Pension Pillar 2 up to 20% of their annual income for the first 5 years and fund a Pillar 3 up to 6700 CHF / year all tax deductible.     
In purchasing a primary home, one can withdrawal from the Pension (pillar 2 or 3) at a reduced tax rate (10% I believe).  I'm looking at buying a home in 1-2 years and was thinking of maxing out payments to the pension until then to get the tax break, and then subsequentally withdraw for part of the required 15-20% down payment.  Has anyone done this or any pitfalls involved?  Or perhaps a recommendation to a good financial advisor...   
Thanks!

They are the buyers of tax shelters and trusts and estate plans, migrants from one tax jurisdiction to another, readers of this forum, etc.   
Within a single country, notably the USA and Switzerland, people do make choices based on tax comparisons; and there is a ""flight to the bottom"" in the sense of certain states and cantons competing with each other to attract tax exiles. Here is just one of many for the USA:   and here is one for Switzerland:

And, for Switzerland, what index captures the economies of living close enough to a frontier to do one's shopping in a neighbouring country? I've mentioned elsewhere the symbolism of St-Gingolph where all but a couple of the shops are on the French side, and even the café on the Swiss side gets its pastries from the boulangerie in France.

4958	Financebankingtaxation	Withdrawing CHF from an ATM from a US bank Account?	UserNamesAllTaken	4673	4	Location: Geneva	02.09.2009, 06:08	"    You can withdraw funds from any foreign account up to the day limit of your account and of the particular ATM, whichever is smaller (although multiple withdrawals get 'round the latter limit).    
However, almost all banks impose a loading charge on use of cards abroad, even if the withdrawal is in dollars. Except where the ATM is treated as 'domestic' (some, not all, ATMs on US military bases). The loading charge is at least 1% (the amount imposed by VISA and MasterCard after some litigation over excessive exchange commissions). But most banks charge more: for debit cards up to 3%. USAA Savings Bank and many credit unions charge only the 1%. American Express charges 2.7% on all foreign currency transactions, plus a fee on withdrawals from your account. You have to sign up for the service; the only advantage these days is that their card is sometimes honored where a bank's own card is not.   
Cash withdrawals for credit card accounts involve different layers of fees plus interest.   
UK debit cards from the major banks tend to impose a fixed fee plus a percentage load. But Nationwide Building Society has no fee within the EU/EEA/Switzerland (there is 1% load elsewhere -- check their Web site).    
ATMs are all over the place in Switzerland. With a foreign card you can use most all of them; with a domestic card usually only the one issued by your bank or one with a special arrangement.

			Thanks Syt. That may be it.   
We were doing split residence in 2005/2006 (we have a complicated history in CH), and at that time she got all the allowances, but the rates she was taxed at took my income into consideration. Back then she also got some allowances for having two households plus some for travel. I have a feeling the latter ones won't fly this time, it may have been discretionary.   
She is taxed at source, but earns so much she (I) have to submit tax declaration. They have typically returned 3-4000 CHF for each year.

4961	Financebankingtaxation	free debit card ?	juice99	3767	22	Location: Zurich	25.08.2009, 10:56	"    There are few banks that offer debit and/or credit cards that are fee-free. For one thing, the VISA and MasterCard systems charge a 1% fee for most (not all, read on) currency exchanges, so even banks that offer ""free"" cards pass on that 1%: thus, most credit unions in the USA and USAA Federal Savings Bank (and USAA refunds any ATM charges for withdrawals made outside their system).   
Nationwide Building Society, a UK mutual savings bank, offers fee- and commission-free debit cards (Flex Account) and credit cards. They do not impose the 1% charge on use of the cards within the EU/EEA/Switzerland.   
I know of no Swiss cards that are effectively fee- and commission-free abroad (that doesn't mean there aren't any, but only that I haven't found any. Other than children's accounts.). A friend has an account with a Czech bank denominated in multiple currencies with a separate card for each, and he says he pays no fees when he uses them in their respective countries.

Would it be appropriate to ask Tax office?

			Use your UK address.    
British Customs officers only need to read the customs declaration label and if a charge is due they usually base it on the declared value.   
Swiss Customs officers open the package and send you a bill for doing so. Any taxes due are usually based on what the item is valued at in Switzerland and not the value stated on the declaration.

			Hi  
Addressed to all who work in Switzerland and live in France. If you are paying Swiss insurances (health, pension, unemployment, injury/sickness etc.) deducted   by your Swiss company, but are paying income tax in France, do you also get charged for  ? If so, what percentage do you pay?; and what is this percentage calculated on (income after tax or before - or some other more complicated calculation)? Finally, do you get an annual bill in November (presumably based on your income tax return) - that's what I think I've read elsewhere on the net. 
Many thanks in advance - did try to search for this query on existing threads as it must be a common question, but with no success.

what about contributions my employer makes to the second pillar? are these taxable in the US when they are made? i would presume not since i don't directly see the funds. is this right?   
i guess at pension time one has to separate the two ... seems complicated.

4975	Financebankingtaxation	UK/Swiss Company (LTD to GmbH) Help Needed	The Scotsman	1798	3	Location: Zurich	16.08.2009, 15:19	" 
			
			Thanks for all the helpful tips - it is much appreciated.   
The reason for my initial question is that I have been convinced by everyone I have spoken to so far that, including your advice, that I have to convert to becoming an employee on a Swiss GMBH after working 90 days in Switzerland using your UK Ltd Company.    
The bit that I was not totally sure about was if my assigment was based around deliverables (which it could easily be) and not just Consultancy day rate recharging, would that make a difference?   
I also have employees of my UK Consultancy operation that will be joining me in the coming few months and will be working here for about a year, or longer. They are likely to be commuting so that they can go back to the UK at weekends. So I have the hassle of taking them out of my UK Payroll arrangements and putting them into a Swiss GMBH.   
I take it there is no other way around this challenge of having to transfer to a Swiss GMBH after 90 days? Does anyone know how big Consultancies like Deloitte or KMPG deal with this? I can't imagine that if they have a London based employee who is getting sent to Zurich for 6 months to do some audit for a Multinational that they end up taking them out of their UK Payroll after 90 days and put them into a Swiss GMBH for couple of months and then transfer them back to the UK Payroll. It all sounds a bit clumsy, not least from a tax return perspective - however this might actually be what happens!!!   
To make things more confusing, I was at a Barbeque last night and spoke to a Contractor for a big Finance House who said he was been working out of his UK Ltd Company as a traditional contractor for the past 4 years without issue and the Swiss authorities are also happy with this (he just fills in his Swiss Tax return with Zeros)!!!!!   
Any thoughts or insights on the above gratefully received!   
Also, anyone know of a good accountant that I can use for exploring more complex issues like this, as I am sure the above situation is going to through up other peculiarities like offsetting travel costs against Swiss tax etc?

The text is identical to that in the US-Switzerland Tax Treaty, Art. 6:   
""Art. 6 Income from Real Property 
""1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from real property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   
In principle, all revenue, domestic or foreign, is included in taxable income:    
In the absence of the word ""only"" the State of residence can also tax the income, giving credit for tax paid to the State where the property is located. Compare the provisions in the US treaty for pensions:   
Art. 18(1) ""Subject to the provisions of Article 19 (Government Service and Social Security), pensions and other similar remuneration beneficially derived by a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State.

			As others have remarked your obligation to file a US tax return arises because you hold a US passport. The same is true for Green Card holders and certain non resident aliens if they spend a sufficient time in the US or earn income when in the USA.  
The IRS explains this quite extensively at:     
You should also be aware that you need to report any bank accounts held abroad where you have signing authority and the amount in the account exceeds $10,000. This might not result in you being liable for tax but is essentially there because US banks have the obligation to report to the IRS transfers in and out of accounts for more than $10K.   
If you file through a tax advisor (and you have until June 15 to file though you may be assessed penalties if you owe them money), it is wise to check if the advisor can e file. This saves time and therefore costs.

			Read the Wall Street Journal (or any newspaper, for that matter) about the settlement announced this week between the IRS and UBS.    The Swiss banks have a ""safe haven"" from the IRS if and only if their only contact with Americans is on their home ground (i.e., in Switzerland).  Once you become a US resident, you will find it increasingly difficult to keep a Swiss bank account.  My suggestion is open an account with the Swiss post office, or a regional bank with no ""external"" (ex-Swiss) branches, but tell them in advance of your future residence address (US).

			Thanks HollidayG.    
Thanks, that is correct, 175K is a more precise figure than almost 200K!    
However, in addition to the amount you mentioned, you may also deduct housing, some health and education expenses. Housing is usually 13K but it was considerably more for Geneva, when you put it all together it adds up. I do think the IRS helpline is a good resource for those questions!   
Cheers,

			From experience of trying to open a Natwest account recently, they were asking for proof of ID, so a passport works fine; but then they wanted proof that you were living at a UK address. This needed to be a recent utility bill in your name, or your council tax bill. So even once you move over it could be a couple of months until you can get that sorted out.

			UBS must contact the seller's bank to determine whether the amount was transferred from the credit card issuer to the seller. Then the seller's bank will ask the seller to explain circumstances. If the seller is solvent and admits not dispatching, then the transaction can be reversed. If the seller is not solvent, then an insurance pool may partially compensate the buyer.

			A standard is 80% of the purchase price.   
The other 20% is handled dependent on Banking policies.   
Fixes last from 2-10 years.   
For the remaining 20% a combination of the following can lead to a ""in all but name"" 100% loan (personally I achieved 97% exactly 2 years ago with 3% cash from the ZKB).   
Therefore the other 20% can be a combination of:   
1. cash 
2. pillar 2 pledging or cashout 
3. pillar 3 pledging or cashout 
4. other securities/assets in Switzerland   
Some banks have a policy of the 20% being cash or a minimum of 50k in cash.   
The pros and cons of all these options have been debated on another thread. Search for details.

4985	Financebankingtaxation	getting your belongings out of Switzerland without paying 'zoll'?	adrian76	1337	8	Location: Zurich	10.08.2009, 12:01	"    In that case try the German Zoll information line on +49 (0)351/44834530. You will be required to use an agent on the border and complete a T1 or T2 form (your removal company should do this for you). You would still be required to follow this procedure if moving to the UK or any other EU country.   
As for moving your belongings back to Switzerland, all you ought to have to do is complete a form 18.44 along with a complete list of items and proof of residence etc. Good luck

Bankruptcy in the UK is just treated like ""Oh Well"".   
It is incredible the number of people filing for bankruptcy in the UK. 
They had 125% mortgages on their houses and theit house is only worth 80% of the original price. 
They have huge debts on their credit cards trying to keep up with the neighbours whom are also indebt trying to keep up with them. 
Unemployment beckons them now or in the future.   
Easy way out Bankruptcy; clean sheet in a years time. 
Gets out of paying maintenance to Ex-Partner etc etc.   
I see a load more personal bankrupts in the near future especially when unemployment in the UK really kicks in.

That is wrong. If everybody adopted your attitude and sadly there are too many people that do, the world indeed would be a much poorer place. Paying one's income tax is a moral as well as a legal obligation. Reducing one's tax liability is perfectly acceptable, but to state that you contribute enough by paying indirect taxes, is unscrupulous to say the least.

All residents in Switzerland must pay Swiss taxes on all their worldwide income and worldwide assets. Job location, company location, nationality of resident, etc. are all irrelevant. When you reside here you are taxed on all of it. No ifs and buts.   
Couples must file a joint Swiss tax return. Hence, income of husband and wife are aggregated. This can catapult you into the highest tax slab.   
I am ignorant about US taxation. Presumably you are US citizens and are liable to US taxes too.   
Ask your employer to recommend an expert on CH and US taxation.

			In fact, my accountant told me that whether you send money back is irrelevant as all overseas earnings are taxable in the UK, daft though that may sound. So your sending money back to the UK isn't the issue - it's your tax status back in the UK that's the problem.   
I would guess if you haven't been submitting self assesment tax returns then it isn't going to matter anywaz as you aren't on HMRC's radar.

5025	Financebankingtaxation	bank charges	juliam	1470	12	Location: sierre	08.07.2009, 11:38	"    That doesn't really help anyone, because it means the bank is making so much $$$ investing the 10K that it can afford to cover the maintenance expenses and then some. You're better off buying a CD for that amount and keep a near-zero balance on your account. Also don't get a checking account but get a ""private"" account instead (many financial institutions have this distinction). You can often trade and pay bills out of a savings account too.

			making tax rate comparison with or within Switzerland is very dangerous, because you first have to ensure that you compare the same thing! When comparing Swiss corporate tax rate to other countries, are you sure you compare the effective tax rate? Because the tax rate you find in the tax law are the tax rate after tax (income and capital tax are tax deductible expenses in Switzerland!). For instance, a holding company is subject only to federal tax (8.5%), but that rate is after tax. Therefore, if you compare the effective tax rate, it will be 7.83% (8.5/108.5). Same can be said to the applicable tax regime. You also need sometimes to make a distinction between the kind of income. For a holding, participation income will not be taxed at all, whereas other passive income (and some commercial foreign income) will be taxed at only 7.83%....    
You know, a joke in this world is to say that Switzerland is not a tax heaven, but a tax   heaven...

			Do you also have an L Permit? If so, it is not necessary to make a tax return and you may not even be able to submit one. --> ask your local tax office   
You paid tax at source under rate B0? Standard deductions are already taken into account in the tax at source rate. Getting this changed to the rate with 2 kids would have been good while you were still getting a salary. The tax office will need to sort out the difference.   
Myth: Not everyone gets a refund when they submit a tax return. You are taxed on worldwide income and assets too.

I bring up the subject for two reasons, essentially.  One, to hopefully learn from others experiences, and two, to hear if there are any horror stories on EF regarding California harassing expats who've ""de-domiciled"" yet later returned to the state.   
As it stands, I have no idea if I would ever live in California again.  I really don't want to pay many thousands in state income tax for no reason.

			You will need to complete the Residence supplement of the UK tax form.  . There are help sheets for this on the IR website. You will need to claim split year tax treatment so that you are not liable for UK tax on earnings for duties carried out outside the UK after your date of departure. They have changed this form recently and it is much more complicated to complete but the IR is usually helpful if you get stuck in my personal experience.

			I'm an employee of the Swiss Agency. However, the standard way of working as an IT contractor is for the agency to act strictly as pimp. They agree the hourly rate with the client company and bill for the hours worked. They then take their percentage cut off the top and then the contractor pays all deductions thereafter, ie the contractor pays the employers and the employees deductions from the remainder. So any way of reducing the deductions is beneficial. It's the standard way of getting paid throughout Europe. The only thing you have to worry about is what percentage the pimp takes off the top. The first agency that approached me for the contract agreed 170CHF per hour with me, but the client was a bit unhappy with the 210CHF that the pimp was trying to charge them. I must admit that I was unhappy with the prospect of him taking 40CHF per hour for doing not alot. The client has now agreed to a lower total rate and I'm paying a different pimp an amount from that to handle the deductions, but it will still be me paying the employee's and employer's, even though it will seem that the pimp pays the employers'

			Agree with what everybody else has said. It's unlikely any bank will open a new account for a new customer and credit the funds before the cheque clears. And clearing the cheque will take some time. The best thing is to phone the Irish bank on Monday, play merry hell and tell them to pull their finger out and TT the funds asap. Otherwise you can ask your Irish Bank if they have a correspondent bank in Lausanne where they (the Irish Bank) can arrange for you to cash the cheque immediately over the counter.    
Einalem's suggestion to contact the rental agency is good advice. The only other thing I can suggest is that you might offer to get your Irish bank to transfer the rent direct into the agency's account to save some time. Just shows some goodwill on your part but you will need to get their Swiss franc IBAN number.

			Hi all,   
I am looking for a little general advice, as what I've uncovered seems contradictory and less than clear.   
Mama G moved here in March last year, works here on a B permit and pays tax at source. We still have a house in France and 2 gites which run as a holiday business and all are jointly owned, but the business is in my name. I float between here and France sending roughly winter here an summer in France, with trips back and forth during spring/autumn  every 6 weeks or so for between between 1&2 weeks. I declare and pay my taxes in France.   
My question is would I be better to apply for residency here and declare my taxes here, or, as the house and gites are on the market, wait until they sell then apply for residency as my centre of life will now be here.   
Thanks for any guidence on this, and feel free to PM me if you would need a little more info'   
Cheers   
Papa G

			Now that I understand it, loaded up my card with 20CHF, very handy indeed, know more chancing the ticket inspectors because I don't have the change for the machine!   
We also had a cashless system at a firm I once worked at, they made the gizmos that read bank notes and counted coins in vending machines.  As there were large ammounts of cash from every country in the world (for testing), you weren't allowed to bring any of your own money in.

5075	Financebankingtaxation	Where am I taxed ?	northwoods	1310	11	Location: Thalwil	23.05.2009, 22:20	"    Not always. If you are considered as belonging to the higher management of the company and are responsible for a significant number of employees (may start at 50 or less in some cantons) and live from Mo-Fr where you work, then you are (for that activity and half of your whealth) fully taxable in that canton.   
Furthermore, ""family"" is not the only criteria for assessing where the individual is taxable. It is more generally the place where the invidual is living  . It usually matches with the center of interests of living (and family and friends can be very important in that regards), but not always.

5077	Financebankingtaxation	Living costs in Zug	neil15	4291	4	Location: Baar, Zug	27.05.2009, 21:34	" 
			
			Neil,   
I fear almost all of the figures you have here are too low. Rent is perhaps the most variable, with rates related to the area size and age. So for example a new large place in the center of Zug will cost you alot more. Look at   for a idea.   
Health insurance can also vary a good deal, rates linked to company, age, franchaise and cover. A figure for kids, 100 CHF each. A figure for adults, 250 CHF each. Try   to get some ideas.   
Food will depend on what you eat and where you shop, coop I think is one of the more expensive places to shop, migros less so, denner even less. A figure of 600 is in my opinion too low, we spend three times that amount. Like the UK bio foods cost far more then supermarket alternatives. Noticed today Kellogs Cornflakes in Coop was less then Coop Cornflakes dont bank on anything here. Migros has an online shop, do some virtual shopping.  .  Use 6300 as the postcode (Zug).      
Phone will be split into multiple bills, fixed, mobile and internet. The comparis site is a good place to start. Phone cards are a far cheaper option if calling home or indeed skype. Depending on where you live you may have the option to get phone and internet thru cable. Whatever you do, a more realistic figure is 100-200 CHF a month.   
Not sure what you mean by TV, but if you mean UK channels like BBC1 and ITV then you get them either thru cable or satelite. You may not have the option of satelite with some places. You may not have the option of cable in the villages outside of Zug. Satelite will cost you for the dish and the decoder + installation, all in all a few hundred CHF, but free from there in. Cable cost depends on the type of box you rent from WWZ, see here  . Course you also have the option to use somebody like   too. I use the later... unsure of the cost but 50 CHF should cover cable.    
Cavat: In Switzerland they like you to take out contracts promising to buy a service for X months, normally minimum 12. Most of the contracts also ask you to give the supplier of the service lots of notice if you want to change/cancel (typically 3 months) and require you to do so once a year. In a nutshell once your signed up, dont count on changing in any hurry. Some services are also linked, so you cannot get internet from sunrise and bluewin(swisscom) TV for example...   
Car lease look at   who have a very large selection of principally VW cars. Of course other garages around and about.

it depends on your salary. if you earn less than 120kCHF a single person usually does not make an actual tax return. but as a minimum you can get a rebate IF you opted to use your 3a pillar pension allowance. if you have special circumstances, own property (CH or abroad) live in one canton work in another and want to claim travel as a deduction then you will have to ask the tax office to consider your situation.   
if you earn more than 120kCHf single you WILL be asked to make a return, you can use the forms they send you and calculate everything yourself percentages etc or download the software and let it take the pain out of the actual calculations. you just have to input the initial details.   
i believe if you are married/cohabitation/legal partnership the trigger for HAVING to do a return is 240kCHF. if you earn less than this you can always get the 3a pillar pension rebate and try to convince them about the other stuff if you have any.   
start with the threads in   for a lot of info.

			Hi there,    
Just seen this post and wanted to ask for further info, as I have a seemingly similar situation. I am a British national, living in London with my Swiss girlfriend. We want to relocate to Zurich, so that she can continue her career as a teacher. My intention is to retain my London-based job (for a UK company), but work partly from home, so that I can divide my time between London and Zurich.    
Is this possible? Any idea what kind of permit I would need to try and get, and what kind of issues I need to navigate with this from a tax/visa perspective?    
Any advice hugely appreciated!  
Thanks, 
James

If you can at all avoid trying to open an account remotely, just wait till you get here. From within CH, it is way easy. Can also be opened with just CHF20 or whatever. I tried to opent the same, normal checking account that I opened when I got here for CHF20 with UBS from America. They said, Oh, yes you can open a checking account with UBS from San Francisco..........for ONE MILLION DOLLARS!!!   
Yes that's right, the minimum deposit for a normal UBS checking acount from San Francisco, or anywhere in the U.S. is one million USD....minimum. Good Luck!

			The one big recommendation: Use the search function    
There are tons of discussions on which bank to choose already available, for example:    
I have seen another tread on coop bank and so on: Migros and Coop both have banks with very competitive rates. I personally am not a customer there as they only have a really small branch with two hours opening times a day in a supermarket nearby where I can always see a long line of grandmas waiting. Does not work for me.   
Generally: Opening times in Switzerland are one big problem, so choose the bank you actually manage to visit when you need them. I had for several years my bank account not where I lived but close to my office...

My High German is not great, but every official thing I have read so far refers to the difference between the initial assessment and the final determination.  The only other think I can find is that if you pay your current taxes early you get a discount on the current assessment, but that is it.   
Before you go heaping money in there, I suggest it is best to get something official on it - at the end of the day none of us are experts on the subject.   
Best Regards,

5092	Financebankingtaxation	Consulting jobs - cultural differences between UK/Australia and Europe	that	3405	2	Location: Sydney, Australia	15.05.2009, 16:04	"     
In my experience (2 of the former big-5 firms and one of the big-3 strategy firms, total around 10 years of consulting), the hours in continental Europe are much worse than either UK or US or Australia. At McK/Bain/BCG you can expect to work something like 55-65 hours a week in London, but more like 80-90 in most of continental Europe. Germany, Spain, and Italy are typically the worst countries, CH is a close follower. NL and Scandinavia are better.   
In case your offer is with a small firm it's of course difficult to say - there it will be more driven by firm culture than anything else.

The gross income will be the same for both. Then each Canton has its own permissible deductions. Thus the net taxable income is invariably different for Fed and canton. The Fed does not tax wealth. The Cantons do.   
Moreover, depending on advanced tax paid or withheld, the balance due will be different for Fed and Canton.

5100	Financebankingtaxation	Savings account interest rate variation	Swine	2456	11	Location: wipkingen	05.05.2009, 20:48	"    Lets call it the low risk option, as there is no such thing as risk free!  There are also different types of risk, for instance placing a 100K on a bank is low risk in relation to the return of your capital, but given the low rate of interest it may not keep pace with the rest of the economy and as a result your wealth will decline in real terms - that is another type of risk.   
The first thing you should do is set out what your saving/investing objectives are, save for early retirement, buy a new car or what ever.  And also consider what is called your risk profile = how much risk are you willing to take in order to achieve your objectives.  Based on this you can then determine what are the best options for you.   
Good luck,

5101	Financebankingtaxation	Delayed declaration of assets	Sorensen	1443	3	Location: Portugal	30.04.2009, 00:44	" 
			
			There is basically 3 levels of ""evasion"" in Switzerland.   
The first is named in French ""evasion fiscale"", which should be translated as ""tax evasion"" in English, but there is a difference to the ""real"" tax evasion (= soustraction fiscale in French) that leads into the fact of hiding or not something to the tax authority.   
In the lower level of tax evasion, you declare everything to the tax authority but they are of the opinion that your tax planning is too agressive and abusive against law. It therefore qualifies the planning into what it should have been according to economics standards and law and you have to pay your taxes on that basis. Example: you are active in Switzerland and set up an offshore partnership and say that most of your earnings has been realized by the partnership (unilateral exemption of those earnings by Switzerland if the partnership is seen as a fix place of business (PE)). In reality, you never go there and manage all your activity out of Switzerland. In your tax return you declare the partnership and its earnings. The tax authority will simply ignore the partnership and tax all the earnings of the partnership in Switzerland. There is no penalty. Some interest for late payment could be due if this is the case.   
In the upper level of tax evasion, you hide that you have a partnership abroad and you declare only the little portion of your Swiss income. After enquiries, the tax authority finds out the tax scheme and will consider this as being a ""real"" tax evasion. On top of the additional tax you have to pay, you will be subject to a fine which is in an ordinary case of the same amount as the taxes you avoided. If you inform the tax authority of your evasion before it finds it out, the fine is reduced up to 1/5 of the ordinary amount. Otherwise, depending on the severity of your fault, the fine may vary between 1/3 and 3 times the ordinary amount.   
The last case is what we call a ""tax fraud"". This is a tax evasion (you hide something to the tax authority) but you did it in such an ingenious manner (usually by faking official or important documents such as accounting, salary certificate, etc.) that it has to be qualified as a tax fraud. In addition to the fine for tax evasion, there is either an additional fine (up to CHF 30'000 for federal and usually the same for cantonal taxes) or even imprisonment depending on the severity of the tax fraud...

5103	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss Tax Rate on Dividends earnt abroad	NJT	8212	12	Location: ZUG	04.05.2009, 16:33	"    Not exactly. The restriction applies to any gainful activity exercised  . If your are employed or self-employed, you can't apply for the lump-sum as long as you do (any part of) your work  . For example, if the manages his company from home in Switzerland, it goes against the lump-sum. If he is not paid at all for the management of the company (except through dividends) then that's something different. But as long as you are paid or receive any income for an activity you do while present in Switzerland, you can't apply for the lump-sum.   
Another example: assuming you are taxed at lump-sum and you work outside of Switzerland, there is no issue for the lump-sum. But let's assume you accept to be a member of the Board of a Swiss company and the Board's meeting are held in Switzerland and you receive some income for that work: that goes against the lump-sum regime because you work in Switzerland...   
This is theory and in practice I have had clients who were taxed at lump-sum regime and had a self-employed activity at home in Switzerland (not declared...). The fact is that if the tax authority discovers it, it will be the end of the lump-sum and a change to the ordinary taxation system. As long as your income has not been much higher than the lump-sum, there is not too much issues there, but the social security is also due on self- employment gains and is usually much higher than the forfait you pay while at lump-sum.

			I've been working in Bern for four months now and am returning to New Zealand at the end of May. As I have a B permit I have been paying Quellensteuer.    
I know that in the UK you can get a tax refund if you've worked only part of the year. How does this work in Switzerland?

5106	Financebankingtaxation	Global stock market, in which point are we?	Macchiato	973	1	Location: Zurich	29.04.2009, 22:11	" 
			
			I can't see any reason to go back into stock markets except to trade short term movements. Markets are being propped up by unprecedented government intervention, global growth/demand are slowing and the worldwide economy is still in the worst recession we've seen in six decades, despite efforts by politicians to talk up signs of recession easing. With no bullets left on the interest rate front and having chucked billions of bail out and quantitative easing dollars at the problem, politicians have no option but to put on a brave face and talk up confidence.    
After 18 months of nothing but awful news, some kind of bounce was all but inevitable but the better than expected earnings which triggered the rally were better only because expectations were at rock bottom, not because things have turned around. Take the banks as an example - improvement in earnings was down to securities trading and accounting smoke and mirrors, not a fundamental improvement in the underlying business.    
We're still 10% below where we were at the beginning of the year so I guess there could still be some wind in their sails yet but personally, after a 25% move up, I don't see stock markets breaking out from here and the risk is to the downside. The announcement of the results of the banks' stress testing on May 4th is an key event for market confidence.   
Bear in mind this was a cautious rally in the sense that the put to call ratio and levels of implied volatility indicated there was a lot of hedging of risk going on. And from what I see, very few folks are taking out and out naked bets in any size.   
I've no idea where the markets bottom. I can buy the argument we are in the bottoming process but that could go on for a long time and leave plenty of scope to get badly burned if you time your entry and exits wrong. I think this is a market for professionals or at least the market savvy with a certain risk appetite right now.

I checked online that it had debited my RBS account today then looked in UBS just for something to do and it's showing on there already!   It says a 'booking date' of the 28th, Tuesday, so I guess it's not yet cleared funds.  Doesn't matter.

Also, the interest/dividend on this asset is taxable here as income. Depending on the tax agreement (between Switzerland and your investment country) you may get some tax relief for taxes paid elsewher.

The double tax agreement means you can offset the tax already paid in the UK upto the amount you would have paid on the relevant Swiss income. (ie in effect you end up net paying the higher of the two possible amounts)   
I dont know how the arrive at the latter amount, there are a variety of possibilities since in CH you pay tax as a family unit unlike the UK.

I needed certified passport copies, certified bank statements and certified utility bills. Some banks wanted salary information, so I avoided them. UBS were happy to certify the documents for me. You may also need proof of where the funds came from ie inheritance, house sale, savings from earnings to prove that the funds weren't generated illegally.

most of those are based on the monthly top line!

			Hi, sorry to ask a question which probably has been asked many times before!   
I have been working in Zurich on and off since last August on an L permit onsite for a Swiss company while being employed by a UK company.    
Starting this April I have moved to Zurich for at least a year (a contractual arrangement between the two companies) . I am currently still employed by the company in the UK and paid in GBP but will be living in Switzerland full time. As i will be out of the UK for at least the full tax year, I have applied for non-residency from the inland revenue in the belief I should be able to pay Swiss tax for the year instead.    
Now I am here, I am finding it quite hard to find information on how I should proceed as my situation isn't entirely normal. I do intend to see a tax advisor, though of course I am unsure which one to see! Any advice?

			You should also register with the Non-Resident Landlord Scheme to have rent paid by your tenants/agency without tax deducted.   
I would also recommend not using an agency for rent collections.  Too many friends have had the agency pay them months late, leaving them needing to transfer money back and chase the agency. I prefer direct debits from the tenant's bank account.   
Also, if you don't hold a UK passport, selling while non-resident and living abroad for 7 years means no capital gains tax is due.

Complex returns are sent to specialists at the Canton. They have backlogs. Once the specialist decides, you get an assessment. Subsequent years are processed based on the decision of the prior year, if the situation is unchanged.

			Maybe there is also a cultural element to this, being of (Anglo-)Indian decent I can maybe try to fill some gaps here.   
1. I still have some family back in the motherland, and I know the servant family they keep earn around 1200 INR (circa 25 USD) per month as a family (3 people working). The house (including water, gas and electricity, plus schooling for the children) the servant family lives in is paid by my family and the servant family house on the same grounds as my family's house. I know already that what they are given and the salary is actually above what a ""low income family"" would get.   
2. Gold and Indian. Poor Indians don't really use banks, they lock their wealth up in wearable gold, usually worn by the women in the family or by the males as necklaces.   
3. Basmathi (rice) price increase; with global economic downturn and also weather conditions in India over the past few years, prices of rice have gone up. India has in some cases limited export of rice, fx. the best brand of Indian rice is Tilda, which is now in shortage outside India and the price of it has almost trippled over the past 2 years. If this is so outside of India, think of the situation in India itself.   
In times of need, Indian families will start slowly to sell the gold which they have in order to survive.

			Ok, just posting a follow up. I called the tax office and asked if they could explain the rules a bit more.   
Basically, once you have someone who sublets a room, like me, in the house with someone else (the landlord), the house is considered a wohngemeinschaft, regardless of how you divide costs, live, etc.   
So I have no chance really protesting this. What was interesting is that they said my landlord will lose the deduction as well, if they find out that is. So for anyone renting out a room, officially you are no longer considered to be 'alone' for tax purposes....

I can also mention that if you live in France then you are allowed to pay for your medical insurance out of pre-tax earnings. In addition, you don't pay towards the French health system since it is compulsory to either take out private medical insurance (which most people do) or join the Swiss healthcare system when working in Switzerland.

			Inheritance tax is a complex area and depending on the size of the amount it may be worth getting professional advice over here before proceeding.   
In general the norm is that for movable property you pay that taxes in the country where you reside and on other property you pay in the country where the property is located.  But in the case of Switzerland and the UK, this guideline may not apply as it depends on what has been agreed in the double taxation agreements.   
Bottom line, if the amount is large get some local advice before proceeding.

			There is a totalization agreement.   
Once you are paying Swiss social taxes, you can stop paying US Social Security.  That does not mean, assuming you have payed in enough quarters to qualify for US social security, that you will collect two full pensions upon retirement. If you receive benefits from a second country's pension system, the amount you receive from US SS will be reduced.    
Medicare does not cover US citizens living abroad, by the way.

			If you end up paying a top up to the quellensteuer you will end up paying your tax quicker under direct tax, but eventually the same amount since you are filing a return.   
No one will suggest anything once you get the C permit.  You will just get a letter saying you moved to direct tax and depending on the canton start getting the various tax payment invoices based your prior year taxable income.

			I live in Ticino on B permit and I will have to do my first tax declaration this year because I have some investments (stocks and bonds)   
And here it comes my question. I have read through the forum, but I could not find the answer.   
I have a Postfinance E-trading account and over the year I have bought several US stocks and I have received dividends on these stocks.   
Looking at the statement I receive from Postfinance it shows a 15% tax witholding (I assume this is the US witholding tax) and another 15% tax imputation.   
I could not figure what this tax imputation is. Does it go to swiss tax authorities or to US IRS? Can I deduct this tax from my swiss tax declaration?   
Could anybody help and/or point to some relevant tax document.   
Thanks for your help

5146	Financebankingtaxation	Freelancer: new computer not tax deductible?	MountBerg	2347	7	Location: Zürich	15.03.2009, 15:01	" 
			
			For a freelancer working through an agency we needed a letter from the employer stating that a computer was needed at home for work and they were not covering the cost. The Zug tax office then said 30% of it was was for personal use, but we could claim 70% in the year of purchase. We didn't bother challenging this since they charge   for challenging it.    
We also claimed one room from our rent (when renting) and now 1 room as an office from our Eigenmietwert/deemed rental value. In Zug we need to work 3 days per week from home to claim this.

			Let's complicate the matter: we are living in CH but my wife works in Germany. She pays tax in Germany and I pay quellensteuer (as a foreigner not earning 120k CHF and not being here for more than 3 years), but the question is: I pay quellensteuer as single income household or double income hosehold? 
Thanks for any hints!

you will effectively have to 'adopt' your own child to become the recognised father of it. a lot of paper work I believe (someone I know in VD had a nightmare!) and getting married might be an 'easier' option. I suggest you look into the finer details pretty sharpish!

People can make a turn or two when the trend's their friend and it's easy then to put it down to the chart. But I never met anybody who made a decent living in terms of return on capital out of technical trading. I know some very good professional momentum traders who do make money. And they look at charts and other technical data for reference. But none of them base their entries and exits on what the charts tell them. When they make money it's down to their judgement, experience, market instinct and above all discipline. It's certainly not from following the herd. The margins in that are at best thin to say the least and if you're not nimble it could end up costing you.

			What I did was send the money as AUD, and not let the Australian bank do the conversion, but a Swiss institution.   or .com 
(do a search on the forum, or check their faq if you are interested).   
Reason was simple, their rates are much better, as the spread is very low (0.75% one way). From memory, there is no fee for receiving the money, so you need to pay the fee from the Australian bank.   
My credit union charged more for this, as they do not like sending AUD overseas, as they don't gain anything. It was 35$. But perhaps Westpac or Commonwelath allow you to do an online transaction overseas in AUD? Westpac used to charge 10 AUD but that was ages ago. 
Anyway, using the above method, you would only pay charges at the Australian end (the sending part).   
I am not affiliated with those guys, I just like their setup.

			london_girl   
questions like this have been answered so many times here!   
take a look through the   threads. Richard has some great advice.   
what you received is not your tax forms. what you have is equivalent to your P60 in the UK/IRL. It will be needed to help fill in the tax forms you WILL receive in March or May depending if this is your first year in the system.   
Your salary is >120kCHF means you WILL eventually get a set of forms in the mail.   
I think you will have to submit your tax return in ZRH. I think they take where you live on the 31st Dec as your tax location. ZRH & ZUG will then fight amoung themselves to see who gets the tax you have already paid at source.   
Play with this software:    
in preperation for completing the forms. It is a great help in generating teh tax forms and also how much you should expect back, because of all the deductions you can make. Your travel expenses from ZUG to ZRH should al be tax deductable.

For the latter dont arrive looking like Imelda Marcos after a shopping spree..   
Re the 10% back, you would ""only"" get 13% back from a full refund (15/115), and for the minimal effort involved I would do it every time.  If you buy your stuff from a department store that will price match eg John Lewis you can process everything on one refund form and minimise the admin fee.

			There is no logic behind most fluctuations in any market.  Every time a war breaks out in far-off-istan the market plunges.  Hmmm, can't remember a war, even a big one, where corporations didn't make out like bandits.  How then is a war, in a place where most do no business, possibly justification for this?  Of course it isn't.  Most of the ""analysts"" involved couldn't put their own country on a map, let alone understand the worldwide implications of Hutu killing Tutsi, or even an Israeli move into Gaza.   
Currency markets are even less logical.  I lost track of the number of times in the 80's and early 90's that the ""experts"" felt such and such a country had a stronger economic outlook than the US and yet the currencies were inverted in their trends with each other.  Total crap.   
Take the CAD and USD recently.  The CAD was at parity with the USD for the first time in 30 yrs.  People were talking about how this could go on indefinately.  Financial crisis hits, and the CAD is down around 0.8 USD where it has spent the vast majority of the last 30 yrs on average (the average is perhaps just slightly lower than this).  Why?  Canada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio of the G8.  Despite promises of massive deficit spending in the next two years, this position will not change.  The ""experts"" all say, and have been saying since the crisis, that Canada has the strongest economy in the G8.  What then is the source of this plunge?  Of course it isn't rational.  Some will say well...USD is a ""reserve"" currency.  Hmmm, lets see...sky..falling...depression coming...worst..financial crisis..since 1929..death..destruction..OOOOHH the humanity!, caused by US, US has weakest economy...no I'm sorry, if it were really that bad then gold, silver, platinum would be the ""reserve"" currency of choice, Canadian precious metals would be worth more and the CAD would be worth USD$1.50 right now.  No, what has caused the USD to climb, or at least hold its own, is everyone BETTING...that's right folks...SPECULATING that everyone else will flee there as well.   
It would be pretty funny to watch if the prospects of when this stupidity finally breaks down weren't so appalling.  The relative strengths of currencies are ""supposed"" to be based on relative strength of the economy underlying them.  They VERY CLEARLY ARE NOT in most cases.  If you try and use logic to place your bets on where relative exchange values will go, well, you do so at your own peril.   
What does this mean for the CHF?  It means if the majority of the clowns with more money than brains think the rest of the clowns with more money than brains are going to buy them, then the SNB could sell every CHF they have, and print enough CHF1000 notes to fill the Zurichsee and it wouldn't matter, the CHF is going to go where it will go.  I for one wouldn't wager one Zimbabwean dollar (which I hear is on the rise...anyone want in on this?) on the SNB being able to affect the exchange in any more than the tiniest of ways for the briefest of moments.

			okay i can answer that by myself now, just came back from the tax office. The answer. Basically when you have a salary less than 120k the WHT tax rate is the same no matter where you lives in the Canton; So soon as you hit the 120k and are asked to file a tax correction you are subject the the commune tax.

			The closer you get to 120,000 CHF p/a the better: you will have to make a tax return, and ALL these costs of the second apartment, travel, lunch, dinner etc. will be tax deductable.   
Even if you are not close to 120,000 CHF I would expect that the Zug tax authorities will accept a tax return based on this situation and forms probably exist to allow you to do this.   
If your main residence is in Zug you will be taxed there, if you pay tax at source make sure your employer in GVA is using the ZUG rates. I'm pretty sure all these costs will be deductable.

			Although I am in Zug where the taxes are lower, I believe the living expenses are fairly consistent with Zurich Horgen. I think your estimates are good, but it does get a bit tight with 10K per month.    
My 3.5 yr old attends a Swiss Montessorey school twice a week (halfdays) and it is reasonable, but not cheap. I would estimate about 2200CHF for the year. If you are going with an English speaking school you can double or triple that amount.   
We just bought a car in the second year of our stay here. The car was reasonable (9K), but there are about 2500CHF in additional fees and insurance costs. But considering gas is 70CHF per tank (150CHF per month). And the average oil change is 120CHF. Also, a drivers license is about 100CHF if you are from Europe.   
Now that you are in Europe, you can plan to take vacations. This is also not cheap with kids... So, we budget 1000CHF per month for vacation travel. And it works out okay. But we do not fly anywhere, only trains and now with the car.    
One thing I do recommend is that be realistic about the car thing. We got along okay for the first year with no car, but spent a lot on trains for vacation trip - and flexibility with two kids is not so good. If you are hear for more than a year, you may want to buy a car now and get it over with. This way you can enjoy more flexible and last minute trips to the mountains.   
Hope this helps.

We paid all years the AHV (direct from our salaries).   
Does anybody have any experience with getting back the AHV money contributed? Can my wife also receive it or it must stay in the AHV account?

			Same day transfers are possible but a bit more expensive about 5 CHF by UBS and whatever from the receiving bank.   
Much cheaper at .30 CHF all in are transfers in the currency of the receiving country it might be there the next day, but might take 3.   
BIC etc is outmoded and you should get the IBAN of your receiving account.

			The whole thing's a joke. At Novartis you are encouraged to buy preferential shares with your  bonus and keep them in a 'protected' account which you don't touch for 3 years. Which is generally a good thing. But if you do this on a B permit, then you end up with one or more pay slips of 0Chfs !!!    
(Simply because, on the month you get a 'big' salary, you immediately pay tax on the whole thing at 25% which is a larger amount than your normal monthly net pay)

			On UK Rental income, you only need to declare to UK Authorities if you consider that you are making a taxable gain (they need to approve this approach). You need to make over £5k profit ish - don't know what the allowance is exactly. Of course, you can deduct the interest from your mortgage, wear and tear, agency fees, renovation costs etc to reduce liability. You can also carry forward any losses over subsequent years.   
Whenever I think I'll make a profit, I invest in the housing assets (windows, roofing etc.) in that year.   
Keep your life simple....

			Hi, I am looking for some advice on how the taxation in Geneva works.   
My husband was only employed for 80% of the time in 2007 and i paid tax at source with tax rate A for the whole year. My husband did not pay any tax as his employer pays him a different amount each month and told him it would be easier to add it up at year end.   
So we sent in a letter to have my tax modified (knowing i paid tax rate A for the whole year but he wasn't working) and to tell us how much tax my husband owed. Now they have sent us a bill for 7000 francs saying he needs to pay almost 24% of his salary of only 38K! (they gave me a small refund of 1500 francs).    
So how does this work? it seems as though they have added both of our salaries together and charged us a tax rate as though we earn over 200K! it doesn't make sense as i paid an extra 500 francs a month just because he was working and now they also tax him at one of the highest rates?

5210	Financebankingtaxation	Life/Death Insurance	guest	2188	5	null	null	" 
			
			Hi again... I tried to find out some more information for you.  !   
1) From the AHV your wife would get in case of your death max. 1824.-sfr per month, and 912.-sfr per child per month. There is a possibility to apply for extra ""pension"" at the ""Gemeindeamt"" which could be max. 684.-sfr per month. For this extra money you have to prove that you can't live with the obligatory money. You can see this in the table I'll send you before on page 2.   
2) While you'll work here you will get a letter from your 'Pensionskasse' (BVG) where you'll see what your wife would get in case of your death. But this is normaly not that much... every sector of business have another Ausgeichskasse = Penionskasse and so it's different from job to job ( from Pensionskasse to Pensionskasse). I would predict from your given salary, that this could be someting like max 1500.-sfr per month. I think you can be glad that you also having a life insurance in the US!   
I don't know if my scribble gonna help you in some sort of way and if it is understandable or not. I'm sorry for all mistakes I but down here. I'm, as you can see not a native speaker, and on top of that I'm dyslexic.  "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			Thank you for the notes. I read all related documents through and spoke to an adviser from the Compensation Office in Geneva this morning. I was told that I won't be able to reimburse or take my contributions away from Switzerland to anywhere else unless I pay it for the full one year. The adviser told me that my contributions will be sitting here in Switzerland until I come back with a job. If I work here for another 4 months, I am entitled to reimburse it. I asked the adviser if I come back in 70 years later with a job, what happens to my contributions. She said it will be here for me. I couldn't stop laughing at this story when I heard this.     
Hope my experience helps some other people.

			there is a good discussion here:       
3rd pillar can/should be applied every for every year.     
No unlimited amount of money can be paid into Pillar 3a. The maximum amounts are  usually defined newly every two years by the Swiss Federal Council and depend on the  rise of old age pension in Pillar 1 (AHV) which depend on the inflation. At present,  the following maximum amounts apply:  You have to decide if the effort in getting it back out weighs the financial benefit. The link above show what is needed i think. I have no personal experience of this. I'm still here thankfully.

			You haven't broken any law by not filling out a P85. It's just a good idea because it creates a paper trail with HMRC showing you are no longer tax resident and as others have rightly pointed out, it's necessary to get any refund but they can't treat you as UK tax resident if you aren't, simply because you didn't fill out a P85 before you left. I've always done it because it can save on paperwork later.

5221	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss National Bank halves interest rate to 0.5%	guest	1989	14	null	null	"    It's okay to have an opinion as long as it's an informed opinion. Yes these are risk investments but the SNB receives 12.5% interest on it's 6 billion preferred stock investment. It's also due interest of 250 basis points over libor on it's 54 billion investment in the bad asset fund. This loan and the interest due will be paid back from any sales from the fund and is in fact secured over the assets of the fund. Over and above this, the SNB participates in upside profits should there be any. All this falls somewhat short of theft in my book.   
Regarding the rest of your comments, if you want to believe that in the event Switzerland's biggest bank failed then confidence in Switzerland's banking system wouldn't be materially impacted, the rest of the banking system would continue to operate as if nothing had happened and the contagion wouldn't spread into the broader economy, currency and labour markets, then that's up to you I guess.

			Hot tip:   
Get your husband's employer to divide the 13th month pay into 12 installments across the year. Most employers seem pretty happy to do this. Otherwise your tax on your December salary will be that of someone earning a lot more than twice what you do (income tax increases non-linearly when the monthly amounts get large). 
The Swiss need this extra to help them with their tax bills, you don't.   
Cheers

5226	Financebankingtaxation	What pensions become	GVAbound	2408	6	Location: Geneva	15.05.2008, 19:27	"    Contributions to the pension plan are generally deductible from taxable income. However, there is some tax on redemption.    
Before you invest into a company plan, verify whether the pension plan is fully funded. Many pension plans have deficits because of the recent sharp drop in equities and bonds.

If you are single, then GE may consider your supposed ZH residence as being too clever. However, if you have a family in ZH, then it becomes more plausible to claim ZH tax residence.

			Residents in Switzerland are taxable here on their worldwide income and worldwide assets. Totally irrelevant are your nationality, your employers location and where your bank accounts are.    
You may be eligible for avoiding double taxation. That depends on the pertinent treaties between Switzerland and the other countries.   
Taxes are definitely higher in Germany. You can determine your Swiss tax liability using an internet tax calculator.

5231	Financebankingtaxation	1-2 pillars question...	Gaggiol0	1424	16	Location: Basel	26.01.2008, 21:14	"    You cannot normally voluntarily contribute to your pension plan. The exception is when you are under-funded. That may well be the case, if you only recently came to Switzerland or recently got a pay rise. Ask your HR department to determine whether your pension is under-funded.    
Before you top-up, determine the solvency of the pension plan. You may not want to put money into a deficient pension fund.

Leaving Switzerland to go back to the UK and been advised my 6 months pension contributions will be transferred in to a ""pending vested benefits account"".    
Is this better than transferring back into my Uk pension   Also anything else I need to know about leaving Switzerland (been contracting for 6  months as an employee of an agency).

5241	Financebankingtaxation	How it all started	guest	8055	132	null	null	"    With all due respect, if you really believe that 'the problem started with housing' then you   understand what a mess we're in.  The roots of the crisis extend far beyond housing and bad mortgage debt alone, into the very essence of the monetary system and central banking structure of the US government.   
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the several articles cited   will go a long way towards explaining the breadth of the problem, including why advocates of the   of economic theory have been rightly predicting this present outcome for many decades.   
And no, the government really can't do anything to fix this — the government played a large role in bringing it about. The 'bailout' being pushed on the public via Congress is not a 'fix' but a perpetuation of the same policies that caused the mess in the first place: covering massive debt by creating more debt to give the appearance of somehow paying it off.   
Government doesn't create value or wealth, it only takes it. The illusion of creating wealth by 'creating' money is really nothing more than legalized counterfeiting, in which credit is created out of thin air as the 'backing' of a new batch of freshly printed notes, which are promptly circulated into the economy, invariably devaluing all existing currency.  This is no less true of the proposed 'bailout' in which an eventual sum of well over the suggested $700 billion would materialize in exactly the way I just described, leading to inflation as not seen in the US since the 1930s.  The ones who 'pay' for the debt thus created are invariably the public, unless and until they refuse to let their government continue such practices.   
The only reality-based 'fix' is to face the music, brace for the hardship, and let the market — not the government — sort out the details.  There is no 'magic bullet' that will enable us to avoid hard times, and while the 'bailout' may postpone them, it will only make them harder when they do come.

			There is a sell rate and a buy rate (the difference is the Bank's commission) each for credit card transactions, cash dispensers, inter-bank transfers, etc. To complicate matters, there may be a flat-fee on top. So if you anticipate frequent conversions, you should calculate the most favorable method for the amounts you intend converting.

			Check out   or.ch. They are Swiss and charge about 0.75% one way (so total spread back and forth is 1.5%). Over 10k, it is free I think if your bank is modern (uses IBAN Nrs for SEPA payments). Check the faq.   
The rates are live until 11pm at night so you can pick your transfer. You can compare rates by going to Postfinance or UBS web sites, and look for the currency rates. I find both UBS and PF always to have more expensive rates than the site above. I am not affiliated with them, but like the transparancy and the rates, and most of all, with present exchange rate fluctations, that you can pick the time, and are not tied to rates set by banks.

Amounts of up to 10000 ZAR appear to attract no attention. However, earlier this year i made a largish transfer in excess of 10K. The transaction was flagged and the person who has power of attorney over my affairs whilst i am here was contacted by the bank and questioned about my status.   
Apparently you are required by law to register (with your bank and SARS) when you are working abroad and transferring forex back home.    
I suspect your transaction has been flagged and frozen (a normal wire transfer via ZKB takes no more than 3 working days to reflect back home, whilst a priority transfer takes 24 hours) whilst they try to contact you.   
My solution (although you lose a minimal amount on the exchange) is to purchase cash here in Zürich. There are no forex restrictions and you can purchase huge sums over the counter. Technically one should declare all monies brought into SA but realistically i have never been checked by customs w.r.t. the amount of cash i have in hand.

5262	Financebankingtaxation	Swiss Mortgages for foreigners	brickroad	4494	18	Location: Zurich	13.10.2008, 20:30	"    Not true. IF you can find a Bank WILLING to do it they will make you a loan in Swiss Francs and give you Swiss Franc interest rates. We have a Swiss Franc mortgage in Poland with a Polish Bank and we pay Swiss interest rates. Purposely done to protect us from currency rate fluctuations. But, it was difficult to get done at the time, a bereaucratic nightmare. Our Swiss mortgage was a walk in the park comparatively. But, see below....        Completely true. I think in today's climate it would be next to impossible for us, as non-residents of Poland, to get that mortgage in Poland. But, for the OP: As you are resident in Sweden go talk to your Bank. I'm sure they can advise you better than a bunch of us down here in Switzerland, but you will not find a Swiss Bank located in Switzerland willing to loan to you.

			No-one can tell you any bank will be safe. You need to look at the balance sheet and make a determination for yourself.   
However according to reports Monday, Raffeisen are currently receiving 100 Mio a month in new accounts as capital flies out from UBS and CS. 
Apparently they can't open accounts fast enough if you can believe that.   
For example you could say UBS are ""safer"" as they've received 6 Bio at 12.5% preference share terms which values every franc at 87.5c. That might be worth more than the 10 Bio of toxic assets in the ""Bad Bank"" right now.

			Any idea how too obtain credit history for a swiss credit card? My wife will be temporarily moving to the USA and needs a decent credit history for almost everything necessary, from renting a house of buying a car.  UBS, where she has a credit card from, does not seem to issue any official credit history. Where else can she get it.

5269	Financebankingtaxation	Detailed tax calculator : help needed on customisation	potom	1060	0	Location: ZH	08.10.2008, 22:15	" 
			
			I found this online tax calculator :     
My difficulty is when I try to customise the calculation by clicking on ""individuell"". I'd appreciate some help in examples of what should be put there : 
übriges = any other / extra revenue ? 
Abzug ahv / ai / eo = deductions for health insurance, etc. -> is there any reason why it should be different from the 'standard' 4.9% AVS-AI + 0.15% APG + 1% AC = 6.05% ? 
Abzug pensionskasse = deductions for pension -> does this depend on the rate chosen as an employee for pension ? is it fully deductible ? 
Abzug Saüle 3a = 3rd pillar -> so I believe should be entered the maximum deduction for the 3rd pillar, in the 5800 CHF range or so ? 
Sonstige Abzüge = other deductions -> can I deduct the full travel cost to go to work (if living in ZG, or ZH or SZ) ? 
Vermögen = total assets, that one is clear !   
Thanks a lot for your help !

5274	Financebankingtaxation	Consequences of banking debacle?	Boy Wonder	1107	4	Location: Zürich	01.10.2008, 21:45	" 
			
			The extension of credit allowed us to live somewhat untethered from reality. I think we've recently lived through a period of fantasy and glamour where cash is king.  The problem with cash is that no one is really sure how much its worth anymore.  These days are winding down, and a new zeitgeist will start to form.  So a lot of the aesthetic values we see in culture and fashion will lose their applicability.  We are likely see a cultural shift very shortly.     
Not to scare anybody, but disruptions in the flow of goods and services can occur.  There could be social upheavals.  It could get nasty.  Martial law may be instated in some places.  There are   for this.   
We'll see a new sensibility across the whole spectrum of culture.  I suspect a conscious effort towards more realism, followed by a strand of extreme escapism.  Guns and religion may come into vogue.     Or pick your favorite dystopia movie.  Sound optimistic?  So far, I'm glad I'm in Switzerland.

Because it's fun! They are riskier, but also carry more potential for gain (and bankruptcy) than the larger market. They need the intermediary (MMs) because they aren't traded enough to ensure enough are available to buy and sell otherwise. At least, that's my understanding.

5280	Financebankingtaxation	GBP cash to CHF (Zurich)	lokami	3324	7	Location: zurich	24.09.2008, 14:47	" 
			
			Hi Lokami,   
You can get a very low commissions if you open a proper trading account with an online broker. I opened one recently with ""Interactive Broker"" (Google to find them). Commissions for < 10000 USD are about 0.01% (compared with 2-3% at a high-street bank).   
It's usually pretty easy to transfer money into the account (by wire) in GBP and then to withdraw the same amount (again by wire) into your Swiss bank account in CHF. Although this isn't the intended purpose for such an account, you can use it to for this.   
You will need to take a little while to setup the account (all online) and to scan passport and other docs for the opening. But once you've done that, it's really easy.   
As for the ""rate"", well that's anyone's guess!    
Alex.

We'll be submitting our first tax return after the end of the year, but fortunately we get a helpful tax company to do it for for us this first year, which means afterwards I can just copy theirs and change the amounts accordingly.

If you live in a commune having a high tax rate (e.g. cities of Zurich and Winterthur) then your tax liability is higher than the cantonal average used for PAYE.

I remember one guy from CSAM selling CDOs in the golden 2003-2005 era. 
Met him a total of 5-6 times over that period. He told us CS was issuing the stuff in tranches of hundreds of millions and the issues were generally oversubscribed before any external selling took place. 
(so forget our clients subscribing 10mm - if they were lucky maybe we would be allocated for 1mm)   
Wonder where that stuff is nowadays, pricewise... LOL! 
Oh yeah - remember the ""accounting mistake"" in valuing certain high risk trading positions?...   
So much for CS... I really don't see any virgins in this game - except maybe Raiffeisen and other ""boring"" banks like Oekobank and WIR...

			Hi there. 
    Unfortunately, you have to pay taxes in the US.  The 
good news is that you can do one of two things:   
You can either:   
1.  Exclude 84700 from your income 
Or 
2.  Take taxes here as credits on your US return

			Hi Mac,   
My company sent me a Mercer comparison hen I transferred and indicated it was approx 13% more for the shopping basket they had chosen.   
The Big Mac index reckons Switzerland is twice as expensive as Switzerland:     
I reckon the reality is probably somewhere in between.   
I notice the cost of meat / fish, taxis, eating as being the biggest difference - maybe twice as expensive here. General groceries also seem significantly more expensive. Clothes, electronics, white goods seem similar. Luxury European cars like Audi and BMW are much cheaper here although Ford / Opel and Japanese cars probably similar price. Petrol and diesel are more expensive (20% more?) here. Didn't use many trains or buses in Oz but trains in Switzerland are excellent and cheap with the half price card.   
Not sure about renting (guess Geneva is expensive?) but the one thing that seems much cheaper is a mortgage - around 3% vs 7% in Oz but you need to put down a 20% deposit.   
Any maintenance - plumber, sparky, rennovations etc cost the earth here.   
But like in Sydney the great outdoors is beautiful and comes for free and Lake Geneva with the mountains in the background is a match for Sydney harbour (in my opinion...). And you get the skiing which is great value for the world class resorts you have access to.   
Health Insurance is really expensive here although my few experiences with doctors/hospitals have been very good.   
Although people say taxes are lower, once all the deductions are taken off (AVS, pension etc) there doesn't seem to be much difference in the final percentage deducted from my salary slip!   
Basically if you want a nice place in central Geneva, buy fresh food, eat and drink out regularly and get cabs you might spend 50% more than you would in Oz or more.    
If you live somewhere less central, buy a second hand car or use the train, spend your leisure time outdoors you can probably get by for 10-20% more.    
Switzerland is a great country though. I loved Sydney and was hesitant to leave but haven't regretted it.

5303	Financebankingtaxation	QROPS - Hope this helps...	kev330520	2139	0	Location: Zurich	26.08.2008, 18:03	" 
			
			Hi Everyone   
There seem to be alot of queries regarding QROPS on this fantastic forum so I hope that my knowledge of this will help.  I am an Offshore Financial Adviser, dealt with UK pensions when an IFA in UK and deal with the QROPS schemes all the time here in Switzerland so let me try and clear a few things up.   
QROPS refers to the process of transferring your frozen UK pension(s) out of the UK and into an approved scheme.     
They have had some bad press recently with the shut down of some schemes in Singapore and Hong Kong.  This is due to some firms 'Pension Busting'.  When you transfer a frozen UK pension, there is a 5 year window in which you must reports any realisations to HMRC.  After 5 years and 1 day you can cash the pension in.  What some people have been doing is cashing the pension in within the 5 years and not reported it, this has led to the closure of some schemes, this is known as Pension Busting.     
With that in mind, any QROPS scheme MUST stay for at least 5 years and is not designed to get your hands on your pension fund immediatley to buy a house etc....the few who do it might end up ruining it for the rest of us!!!  Another thing to bear in mind is the fact that this is designed for people who are not intending to return to the UK.   
The scheme that I recommend is set up as a trust with an offshore investment bond wrapper.  The charges for the scheme are flat rate which is why you really need to have a sizable frozen pension pot for it to work for you.   
The benefits of a QROPS scheme is really the flexibility.  It means you can put all your frozen pensions into one place and have total access after 5 years.  You do not need to buy an annuity, take 'x' amount as an upfront lump sum, it is up to you what you do with it after the 5 years.   
The QROPS scheme is only an option and you should check with your Swiss company with what they offer you aswell and compare them to see which will be the best option for you.   
If anyone wants more information, feel free to PM or email me...   
I hope that this helps some way to explaining things.   
Kevin

It would appear on your salary certificate. However, you can claim a standard deduction, which is usually less than the premium.   
Tax rate: Independent of permit type. All residents filing a tax return are treated equally.   
Apparently high anticipated tax: That is calculated from an extrapolated annual income. Your new monthly salary is multiplied by 12 to estimate your advanced tax. Not to worry. You get interest benefits on advance tax and any excess is refunded after filing return and assessment.

5306	Financebankingtaxation	Income tax deductions steuererklarung	NicktheGreek	4300	6	Location: Zurich	01.07.2008, 17:06	"    Right and wrong.   
Quellensteuer already includes these deductions (""average"" or ""typical"" amounts).   
If you earn more then CHF 120k per year, then you fill in a tax return and you  
can then claim all deductions specifically. 
Your paid Quellensteuer is then offset against your final tax bill for a refund or another bill.   
If you earn less than 120k, then you can fill in a ""source tax refund"" (can't be bothered to find out German name) to claim optional deductions like pillar 3a (don't ask: search) and have your source tax for that year adjusted.   
I'd also suggest getting a new Treuhand...

			Thanks for all the positive contributions. In the end my bank (Bank Linth, Flums) advised and assisted for me (50CHF). It was relativly simple to complete for me and they talked me through the calculation process and the allowable deductions.    
Interesting that I was told if I left the ""income"" box blank as a foreigner I would be ""assumed"" to earn 100,000CHF per annum and if I put an amount less than this in the box then I may well be asked to show a copy of my UK tax return to prove it. Anyone else heard of this and does it actually make any difference to tax payable given that it appears to be (in my case) almost entirely based on my Eigenmietwert, any bank interest then less a (very few, for me I'm a UK resident) allowances.  I only thought of this after I'd left the bank and I'm curious to know for 2008. My 2007 return is only for one month as I only completed a property purchase in Dec 07

5318	Financebankingtaxation	International Tax Laws		1548	2	Location: Zürich	12.08.2008, 18:29	"    Swiss residents must declare all global income and all global assets. The value of your Australian property is taxed for wealth here. And the net rental income is added to taxable income.   
There may be a DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) between Switzerland and the other countries, where you are also liable for taxation. Each DTAA is different and must be carefully studied to determine what relief is available.   
Switzerland has a progressive tax rate. Therefore, income and assets elsewhere, would bump you up into a higher tax slab for your Swiss income/wealth, even if the actual foreign income/wealth is not taxed here.

5319	Financebankingtaxation	HSBC to Buy UBS?	Nickj	4932	41	Location: Fribourg	25.06.2008, 13:37	"    What sort of guidance are you after? A league table will only be of limited help because those managers who have created the best returns in a bull market are not necessarily the people you want to give your money to in a bear market.  
I think the soundest piece of advice is do EVERYTHING you can to minimise your tax liability first and for most 'normally wealthy' people this is pretty straight forward and can be researched by picking up a couple of the weekly/monthly financial journals when you see they are running a tax special.  
Caveat to the above, don't invest in something that will put a significant amount of capital at risk just to gain a tax advantage.  
I know more about the German system, and need to get to know the Swiss, but in Germany I managed to find out about ~100% tax write off media (film) funds and the tax advantages of owning property from Focus Money and talking to colleagues (admittedly working with other traders meant the financial advice was probably a little more detailed than if I worked in telcos).  
Unless you have really silly money to invest I feel the best return is offered by doing your own homework, finding out the relevant structures or funds, calling the institutes that offer them direct and explain you will invest but you want the 'initial charges/brokerage returned. You can ask wealth managers / brokers to return initial charges. You would be surprised how many will agree. This I feel will have a far bigger effect on your net financial position than the few basis points difference between your money to a good manager and an exceptional manager.

5321	Financebankingtaxation	Opening a Swiss Bank Account	hd_geezer	26525	58	Location: UK	12.03.2007, 18:00	"    Switzerland has been bullied into compliance of all those regulations. Swiss people understand how important is bank secrecy as part of their personal liberty and economic future, and they have accepted those laws reluctantly and under coercion.   
They know that less liberty does NOT bring more security, as US-UK nazis want us to believe.   
Obviously you think that financial privacy is somthing inmoral and only for criminals. Well you're wrong.   
Financial privacy and bank secrecy are crucial requirements for enforcing property rights in a free market society.   
I will skip any further discussion as this will quickly degenerate into a Libertarian vs Socialist/Statist/Big brother political fight.

			Do a normal Swift transfer...probably the cheapest way to do it.   
If you are going to earn in Switzerland (and expect to get paid in the next couple of weeks), just use your UK bank card to take a large sum of cash (that will keep you going for a couple of weeks until you get paid in Switzerland). This way you will not end up converting your GBP to CHF at the same time (we have seen better exchange rates).   
I would worry more about the exchange rate that the charge for the transfer.

But I still haven't been able to find info on allowable business expenses, beyond the ""cantons decide this"" explanation. Without some concrete info I'm afraid of spending on the basis of wrong assumptions, and then getting stung when the tax bill comes.

5327	Financebankingtaxation	Contract for opening bank account	thomasss	3251	4	Location: EU	08.08.2008, 00:12	"    Such clauses could (but not must) appear in the contract. You should decide what investments you want done. Depending on that you authorize the Bank to perform those investments.    
Suggest you discuss your investment needs with your Relationship Manager and let him/her explain these clauses with you. You can then get a contract that suits your needs.   
A good guideline is to only invest in products and services you understand. If the contract is incomprehensible to you, then you should not sign it.

5328	Financebankingtaxation	Offer Letter - help with taxes and deductions!	moore_family	1067	15	Location: Lausanne	07.08.2008, 14:54	" 
			
			I was born and spent childhood in Italy, I have gone to lots of other European countries and if I was to compare Switzerland (or at least around Lausanne) with the rest of Europe I would say it's amazingly pretty, breathtaking even but extremely dull.  
As soon as the amazement wears off there is not much to do here in terms of entertainment beside the mountains and ski season. 
I don't know what it is but somehow it has no real vibe and Lausanne seems to shut at 10pm. Everything is so ordered and controlled with rules that spontaneity it's not easy to find.  I am sure you went thru the complaint corner to find lots of them at that was also my breaking point, if I can't click with the place and complain, why stay if life is better at home. 
I have to say, the money is a good appeal here but that somehow doesn't buy happiness. Sure, you can fly everywhere, jump on a train and be in Paris or Milan, drive to France or Germany but if all I am doing is escaping Switzerland on the free time I have no much purpose living here.   
But I am also sure if you ask most Swiss they don't feel much European themselves, there must be a reason why even bilateral agreement with EU were not put in place till recently... it is a small country surrounded by Europe.   
I also find attitude here also very selfish (my opinion) compared with Australia. I notice that everyday, whether it's people just bumping into you while walking or people just stopping without thinking someone is behind them.  
I guess I am used to Sydney being more fast paced... and sometimes I just want to go to the supermarket and be in and out in 5 minutes without having to wait and wait because it takes them hours to put two items in a shopping bag    
also, I have found people very insular here, we have the basic conversation but I found bonding pretty hard with no expats.  
Again, I am spoiled with Sydney where I can walk to most locals on my own, grab a beer and start a conversation with a stranger. I have tried the same trick here and unless they are foreigners doesn't work and I speak French fluently too.   
I don't know if Zurich is more open being a bigger city, but Lausanne at the end has just over 120.000 people...   
hope it helps...

5329	Financebankingtaxation	Cash Barclay's France cheque check but no local bank account!	DBW	1353	0	Location: Geneva	07.08.2008, 12:10	" 
			
			Small SOS.  We recently closed out a short-term Barclay's consumer account in France and they've sent us a bank check in Euro's with the remainder of the funds.   
We have no local bank in Geneva since we're only here through the end of the year and have had no problems using cash (ATM's to debit US bank account) or credit cards.   
Anyone have an idea about how I might cash out the Barclay's Euro check?   
I'm expecting to pay some fee but not even sure whom to turn to.  I pay bills through the Post Office (i.e. DVD rentals) but don't have an account there and prior threads seem to talk about problems cashing checks when one does have an account.     
(Barclay's doesn't have a consumer presence in Geneva, so that's not even an option.  They may have something in a neighboring French community but suddenly it becomes a much larger process than I'm hoping is necessary.  Or perhaps a field trip on a summer day!)   
Any ideas?   
Thanks.

			First check prices to make sure that it is worthwhile doing this.    
Then if you buy a bike ask for tax refund. There is a form that needs to be filled out and stamped in the shop. They will also calculate the amount that will be reimbursed and explain how the reimbursement will work (cash or payment to your credit card account).   
Then, when crossing the border back to Switzerland, you stop at the French side to stamp the form again by the French customs officer. There they will probably ask you to show the merchandise, so have the bike with you. You can also immediately put the stamped form into post for reimbursement or go back to the shop at some point later.   
The last thing you do is stop at the Swiss side to show them the bike and the invoice and there, depending on the amount you paid, they will tell you how much in taxes and customs duties you need to pay to import the bike.    
That's it!

XE also gives you the option of sending you a paper cheque for no charge, but the clearing bank is UBS.  Credit Suisse charged me 7 Sfr. to deposit it into my account.  Also, you must have a mailing address in CH, though I suppose you could send it to yourself in US before your trip.   
With regards to international money orders, my Wal-Mart money order had a Western Union logo on it so I figured my landlord might be able to cash it.  He took it to the WU main office at the Zurich Hauptbanhof and they wouldn't cash it -- I ended up paying him cash.

This thread inspired me to call into my bank today & they're happy to send statements (I only get one a year, cos I use online banking)  to an overseas address. Their attitude was 'when you give us a change of address, we just go ahead and use it'.  I guess credit card companies should be of a similar mind.

5344	Financebankingtaxation	Trading and taxation in switzerland...	Gaggiol0	3634	22	Location: Basel	15.03.2008, 17:16	"    The strict rules on trading taxation are here:   
(I had posted a wrong link earlier, sorry)   
See page 3. Rule #1 states that the investment period must be minimum 1 year. There are 5 more rules. All 6 criteria must be ""cumulatively"" fulfilled to be certain of not paying capital gains tax.    
If one or more criteria are not fulfilled, then the assessing officer can decide whether the capital gains should be taxed.   
I am completely ignorant about UK tax shelters and cannot comment on the tax impact. This much is clear: You are a Swiss resident. You must declare your global income, assets and capital-gains. The tax is assessed based on Swiss tax law. The tax exemptions in another jurisdiction are irrelevant.    
You can however attempt explaining to the tax commissioner why you should be exempt. My impression is that the Swiss tax officers are approachable, fair, intelligent and of high integrity. You can also ask for and get a binding tax ruling before you invest or before you submit the tax return.

			Until I bought an iMac last year, I had only owned Dells and have been generally happy with them.  I was looking for a bit of a change and went for the Mac.  So far, I'm happy with that for a home machine.  However, I've been looking for a notebook for travel and the XPS M1330 (LED of course) seems to be a good machine for that.

5347	Financebankingtaxation	Altersheim's cost and Inheritance law	Vanee	1626	1	Location: Thun, Berne	21.07.2008, 15:32	" 
			
			We looked into various Altersheime when deciding whether to bring our elderly parents to CH, but in the end decided it was not a good solution for them.    
(Our situation was different, as the in-laws are neither Swiss nor long term residents, and therefore any care had to be privately financed.)   
In determining eligibility for full or partial public financing as I understand it (bearing in mind I'm no expert, and I could well be wrong   ), first the patients assets are considered, then those of the family. We found lots of differing plans - you should contact your Gemeinde to discuss what kind of care, both public and private, is available in your area. Much depends on your parents' individual needs and financial situation.    
Also, try the organization Pro Senectute - they are very helpful. In the Bern Oberland region:           
Also, take a look at the discussion re: financing here:       
Hope all works out with your and your parents - I know how difficult finding appropriate eldercare can be, and how stressful this is for all concerned.

			I am currently registered as an independent translator in the Czech Republic, but will shortly be moving to Geneva where my wife is posted.    
Can anyone tell me very approximately what proportion of gross earnings one would expect to retain after taxes and other compulsory deductions in Geneva?    
For example, if one invoices the equivalent of 4,000 Swiss Francs per month, how much of this would one pay in taxes, ""social security"", etc.?   
Please excuse me if this question is overly simplistic (or has perhaps already been asked). I am just looking for a rough estimate, assuming that one takes whatever standard deductions might be available, without itemizing one's expenses.   
(I am assuming that one has to declare oneself in Geneva if one lives there for more than 6 months of the year or does this rule perhaps only apply to EEC countries?)   
Many thanks.

If you were deduted at source............you probably are able to claim from

Quicksilver	2055	5	Location: London, UK	16.07.2008, 21:03	"    Your Swiss ""customer"" employer cannot be expected to understand the intricacies of the E101 form and other EU legislation. They will just deduct the social-security contributions and pass it on to the Swiss government. You would then have to slug it out with the Swiss bureaucrats and convince them to refund.   
That is the same procedure for the income tax. It is deducted at source. Subsequently, you can file a tax return and request partial or complete refund of taxes withheld.

			There is something else however behind this..   
UBS and CS may be bigger than Switzerland, but only at a federal level.  Don't forget the Cantons.     
Also, just because CS and UBS have all that money, they don't actually own Switzerland.  You can buy a bank, get its investments (stocks, shares, buildings, desks, resources, IP, football pitches etc) but you cannot buy Switzerland for 1/7th of what you can buy UBS and CS for.  They are only worth, to Switzerland, the value of their taxable income.   
Hardly newsworthy methinks.   
That UK bank - Northern Rock - has 'cost' 40bn.  But its not actually cost 40bn in real terms, something I had a hard time explaining to my taxi driver last week.

But what gets me is just how greed overrode prudence and commonsense.  By all accounts the entire finance sector was making deals it   were stupid and short-sighted.  Yet greed on both an individual and corporate level drove the whole thing on.   
You would expect a conservative Swiss bank like UBS to be smart enough to know better......yet it was gorging itself on toxic debt because the deals being made were making the individuals in the bank rich and looking good in the short term on the bottom line.

5365	Financebankingtaxation	Banks In Zurich	frankb	2949	11	Location: HOUSTON,TEXAS	04.07.2008, 17:51	"    I thought that was a bit dodgy as well. I've heard of this setup in CH -- there are definitely two payments involved. One to the Swiss govt. for withholding, though I'm not sure if they use a rate of 28% (which is what the IRS uses if you are subject to backup withholding on a US bank account) or if they try to ""divine"" your top marginal rate (currently 31% federal in the US). I will ask around.   
As to the second payment, it is either to the SBA or the EBK and I believe it is a trivial amount (i.e., 1%).   
I want to correct the earlier comment above about finding a bank with no US presence -- this is not enough. You must ensure that they have not signed a QI agreement with the US, and AFAIK all members of the SBA and LBA have signed this. I know for a fact that LGT asks all US clients to complete a W-9, regardless of whether they live in the US, CH, or wherever, and regardless of whether the account is opened in ZH or in Vaduz.    
The problem with Singapore is that there is a govt. regulation that you must have $2M SGD to invest (approx. $1.6M USD). Failing that you can go to one of the more dodgy tax havens such as Panama.   
One thing you might try is to open a ""salary account"" with one of the cantonal banks, because I have heard that some of the smaller banks do not require a residence permit and they will certainly not ask you for a W-9 as the purpose of the account is not for investment. I suppose one could open an account for 5-10K CHF, and there's nothing stopping you from making further deposits except that you'll only be getting 1% interest!   
Now for the soapbox -- the $1.6M USD requirement for Singapore means that upper middle class Americans are unfortunately priced out of the market for private banking. Swiss secrecy is dead for Americans, and don't let anyone tell you different. It's a shame, because in my opinion undeclared assets and banking secrecy are the only ways to keep world governments honest. As we say in the US, ""the higher taxes are, the fewer people pay them"". If voting at the ballot box doesn't work, you can always vote with your feet (move abroad) or vote with your dollars (secrete money abroad to get out of the clutches of the IRS).     
As US taxes are scheduled to rise quickly in 2010 (and beyond that who knows given the impending collapse of Social Security), it's no surprise that the US gov't is getting tough with the Swiss despite the presence of a Republican administration.  If you think it's bad now, wait until Obama is in office!

			There must be an administrator (notary? Bank?) who is processing your aunt's estate. That person would determine the brutto and netto shares of inheritance.    
Does the administrator know that you are a claimant? Swiss laws restrict who gets how much.   
Most Swiss cantons exempt direct dependents, i.e. sons/daughters and grandchildren. All others are taxable.

They all tend to make their money with the spread on the currency exchange, so there are no other fees.  The rates are way better than the tourist rates, but you should also compare.   
For HiFX, it's easiest to register with them using your UK address (I'm assuming you have a permenant residence in the UK).

			Thanks for all your replies.   
Actually there are 5 speakers, so it would be possible to split into 2 sets, but apparently they're wise to this and it wouldn't be worth it if I aimed to claim the French VAT anyway.  I was hoping to claim the French VAT that side and then breeze through the Swiss side without paying the Swiss, though it doesn't seem as though this works.   
Richard, I don't quite get what you mean by ""Swiss VAT is lower than French ... If the speakers were made in the EU or a designated developing nation they are not liable for VAT.""   
Do you mean ""they are not liable for French VAT"", but are liable for Swiss VAT?  The speakers are Jamo, which are supposed to be Danish, but maybe they're manufactured in China under Danish design etc.

5377	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on Maintainence Money	TJ45	684	4	Location: Basel	19.06.2008, 17:39	"    On reading this you must be the recipient of the money. If that is the case and your ex-spouse is paying from within Switzerland your local tax authority will come to you. If the money is from outside Switzerland then you are better keeping it outside Switzerland and saying nothing. If you want to bring the money into Switzerland then you either make a voluntary declaration or you do not. If you do not then as long as the amount is paid semi regularly in tranches that do not exceed 10K then the bank has no obligation to report them and you need to live with a guilty conscience.    
If you are the payer of the money then no tax is due on it and you can claim back any tax you have paid on this amount at the end of the year although often tax authorities make you a non PAYE tax payer as this easier to handle.

5379	Financebankingtaxation	UK/CH Pensions/Tax/Inheritance Expert	dannyt986	2838	4	Location: Wollerau, Schwyz	02.02.2007, 15:12	   For your state pension in the UK you can continue to make a voluntary contribution which will keep it going. You should contact :     The Pension Service   International Pension Center   Tyneview Park   Whitley Rd   Benton   Newcastle Upon Tyne   NE98 1BA     There is a service that LloydsTSB offer via its offshore bank and they have an adviser who visits Switzerland. I’ve never used this service so I can’t tell you what its like but they do seem to offer advice on the areas you mentioned. Have a look at the website of any UK bank and you will probably find a similar service.

			Hey Andrew, so you never found out why the rejected you huh? I am coming from Canada as well and have yet applied for a credit card. Was it like pulling teeth going through Migros? (by the way, is there anything that migros ISN'T involved in?????)  We have credit cards here in Canada but have read that really you have no credit once you hit Switzerland as nothing is connected. So having no credit here in Canada means no credit cards..... was that your experience ( I have searched credit on this forum till I am blue in the face and the 1st thread that always comes up is FREE BEER!)

Of course I understand that the exchange rate might be a bit different, but I wonder if it will make up for the extra $10 - not a lot, but an extra $10 a month is another bottle of wine!

			My take on this (and I am sure that others will be quick to correct me if I am wrong), that you should have had your original document explained to you by a german speaker before you signed it. Verbal agreements (such as what the agent may have told you) are often explicitly excluded from agreements because you end up in a ""I said - he said"" scenario such as the one you are in now.   
Early repayment of leasing agreements often incur extra charges and, as such, the fact that you are being charged is not necessarily unusual. The original amount sounded a bit steep, the revised amount is starting to look sensible.

I'm considering taking a job with a fully expensed company car. I live in BL and have found the relevant tax declaration form and done my best to translate it... ( ). But I'm still confused. In the example they quote, are they saying you have to add 4.8K to your salary  (acceptable !) before tax or are they saying you have to pay an additional 4.8K in tax for the car (ridiculous) ?????

			Apart from paying off the individual debts I can't really see any other options other than consolidation through a personal loan, unless a lottery win is on the cards or low cost loan e.g. from family members is an option.   
Creditors are often willing to discuss loans that can not be paid and assist in working out a payment plan that ends up in them getting at least some of their cash back but this is inevitably going to affect future credit.

If I work less than 183 days in Hungary (this will be my case weheheh)  I still have to file a return on the hungarian income, I still have to state teh money earned in Switzerland, but do not have to pay tax difference on it.

Basically, if you have a fixed contract with a foreign firm, you register with the tax authorities as an ""arbeitnehmer mit Auslandischer arbeitgeber"", the honus is then on you as an individual to pay taxes & obligatory insurances.   
If you have more than one contract (they like to see 3 or 4) you can go down the route of ""einzelfirma"", which has its many attractions & you employ yourself.   
This is based on have you the right to be here - Residency status etc, did you enter the country on a waxing or waning moon & has a black cat strayed across your path more than once in the last 5 calendar months.   
Your best bet is to contact your local gemeinde / kreiseburo / commune & ask to speak with an advisor, its free & you'll get the best advice for your case.   
I would also stongly advise you to read this most excellent thread by one of our resident experts, Richard :

			To be honest, if customs are busy they may not even notice as long as the paperwork is in order. Let's face it, they are not all vets (or even animals lovers....).   
When we came through with our three dogs and cockatoo they all stayed in their cages while we were coming through customs. Nobody really examined them in detail. Also, the border vet should have been called for the cockatoo but nobody thought to do it..... OK, it was a bit of a zoo, but still things can get quite busy and, as I said, if you look like a regular pet owner, I am not sure there will be that much of a production.   
Anyway, as I said, good luck and do let us know how you get on!

If you work in any of the other cantons (VD, VS, BE, SO, BL, BS, NE and JU) you should not be.

			Hi,   
I'm new to this forum...Anyway, this summer I am moving to Geneva for a year to work in an engineering company as a marketing placement student.   
I will be paid in the order of 32000CHF. Can anyone help me as to how much tax I might be paying during that year on that salary?   
I don't have to pay for housing because the company provides accomodation so I just really want to know how much spare cash I will have.   
Best wishes   
Nick

			You cannot currently cash in your AHV as an EU citizen but you can transfer it to your country scheme - highly recommended especially for Germans, French, Italians... Being more serious as I believe Scotland was a part of the EU back then you have cashed in your BVG aka LPP aka 2nd Pillar aka company pension scheme (trying to keep Mark happy).  When you rejoin the Swiss scheme they will, or better said should give you back your old AHV number and the bill to repay the BVG amount that you cashed in.

First, this site is fantastic resource, so much information. I have looked through sticky topics but sorry if I missed this subject being covered already.   
I'm a Europe citizen, working in Geneva canton fulltime at big company. I live in Geneva and have a B (CE/AELE) permit. I pay tax at source on my main salary.   
I've lately made a website in my spare time, which makes some money from adverts.   
How should I declare this income? What impact will it have? Am I doing anything wrong with my work permit?   
Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

What the HR department did was the calculations of the compulsory part of the pension fund according to the law, and then the variance to what I'd actually been deducted.

Sounds complicated, but that is fair and the only logical way, because the tax rate is neither flat nor linear. Otherwise, no tax would be due, because the actual 3 month income is so low.

			Though it may depend on what you are using Paypal to pay for, Paypal is a prime tool for scammers. You order, you pay, no delivery. You complain to Paypal, the scammer's account is empty and you get nothing. This happens at least once a week on a forum site I moderate. We have taken the only practical measures we can against scam sellers with 150 minimum post count and one year a member, iTrade rating, but in the end only advice we can give is either know your seller or use your credit card where you may get some protection if you report the incident quickly enough.   
Any payment you make over the Internet you need to regard with the same care as you would to where you would leave your wallet laying around. Internet fraud runs in the billions according to something I saw recently.

Or you could pay cash. 
Bullion works nicely....completely untraceable, and if they hang onto it, it will appreciate faster than bank interest.

If your planning on coming back again, I wouldn't close the account but leave it open with the at the least the minium amount needed in it, and then only close it when you are fairly certain you don't intend on returning again (though in my case I closed it thought I wouldn't come back and now am here again anyways) It would of saved me so much time if I hadn't closed it last time.

5459	Financebankingtaxation	First pay cheque <eeeek>	Castro	1679	8	Location: Basel-Land of Smiles	25.03.2008, 22:36	" 
			
			In my experience with variance in income between months, your tax will be adjusted in future months based on the assumption that you will continue to earn what you have earned on average so far. In addition, if you've already paid more than you needed based on the new calculation, then you won't have to pay so much next month. This is hard to explain, but hopefully it will become clear once you see your next pay-cheque.    
I got a big amount paid in February, and paid loads of tax on it. This month (March) I got paid my usual amount, and so I paid much less tax on it than normal because the system realized that I won't continue to earn what I did in February every month this year, and so I've therefore basically already paid my tax for March and April. I'm still waiting to see whether it works out entirely as I believe it should, but so far so good (and based on pay slips that I have from previous years and the fluctuations of income on those, it looks like it should). Hopefully it'll work the same way for you, and you won't be paying much tax for the next little while. If it doesn't, then as others have said, you'll just have to figure it all out at the end of the year.

There is the tax law which is quite extensive and then there are the guidelines to interpretation. Anything that is not described in the guidelines can be interpreted whichever way and needs to then be referenced to law on appeal. If you are saying that your employer offered to pay your actual relocation expenses then this is not a benefit in kind and should not be taxed by the Swiss authorities. If it has been then this can be reclaimed as an error but your employer can make a correction to the salary statement he made removing it and returning the tax which is the preferred way. That reminds me, I need to pay myself...

If you are UK resident unless you have a ISAs your interest is taxable and is paid net of wht.   
If you are not uk resident you dont need to declare your uk interest in your uk tax return (which you might have to complete for other reasons eg directorships or property income) and can have it paid gross. Of course you have to declare it in Switzerland.

5466	Financebankingtaxation	What are the rates for Taxation at Source	HunterEu	1432	4	Location: Baselland	25.03.2008, 21:42	"    One company I worked for (the one with the big blueish bull logo) also had these ""plans"". After throwing lots of money through the window - sorry, many a consultation with ""tax experts"" (one of the Big 4) they found out the only thing that mattered was the opinion of the tax authorities, which actually happened to differ from this tax deferral neat planning...    
At any rate, once domiciled abroad, Swiss tax authorities have no jurisdiction over your income. And if you've never been taxed at source, then quellensteuer certainly isn't something that applies to you.

5470	Financebankingtaxation	difference between source and income tax ?	Nessuno	2082	18	Location: Zurich	05.12.2007, 09:41	" 
			
			I many times wondered myself what the answer would be.  In reality what you are really asking is how much tax you have to pay on your income?   
Taxation at source means that you will have an estimated amount deducted from your pay.  If too much is deducted, then you get a refund after you file a return/tax declaration.  Otherwise you will pay the difference between what you and what was deducted at source (from your pay).   
For people that do not get taxed at source (income tax is not deducted from each pay), they have to pay the entire tax due at tax return/declaration time.  However, such people have to usually pay provisional taxes (called estimated taxes based on previous year income) and then pay the difference at tax return/declaration time.  Provisional taxes can be very annoying if your income varies greatly from Year to Year.   
Typically taxation at source (deductions from your pay) do not take into account your full situation, such as allowable deductions, and thus more than likely deduct too much.   
Best regards,

5471	Financebankingtaxation	Are rental payments tax deductible?	dabutiman	6454	16	Location: Vaud, Switzerland	23.03.2008, 18:18	"    You've got to distinguish the concept of ownership and mortgage. If you buy the house you're the outright owner whether you have a mortgage or not. If you have a mortgage you can keep the house provided you keep up with repayments. As others have pointed out if you have an interest only mortgage you only have to pay interest. If you want to discharge the mortgage then yes you have to find the capital which is usually achieved by selling the house.

In case anyone was wondering I found the answer here:

2b. Alien employees with a ""C-permit"" or with a gross income exceeding CHF 120'000, and also employees of non-resident enterprises (without permanent establishment in CH) are subject to  . They must file a personal tax return and pay their taxes by themselves (no taxation at source). This tax is calculated on the net income and certain additional deductions apply.

5476	Financebankingtaxation	Tax declaration, documentation needed	guest	2222	2	null	null	"    I guess you asked the question at the wrong time.   
As far as documentation is concerned you need the tax statements your bank has sent you plus you need the statement of earnings. Then there is documentary evidence for any other expense you might be claiming or income you might have received.    
For foreign property the tax office are rather flexible. The point being here that they cannot know for sure the values and go primarily on the information you provide. So if you say for example the property is worth CHF 250 and the mortgage on this property is CHF 200, they would accept this. There cannot be an eigenmietwert as this is set by the local authorities so here they look at actual rental income. If there is none then there is nothing on the income side.    
All other points as per goldtop.

Yes you pay taxes twice. But not double taxation really as you get credit for your Swiss taxes, plus you can get a pretty large exemption as long as you don't spend too much time in the US in a tax year.   
Regarding Swiss, won't the employer withhold (don't know his salary level) and he might not have to file in CH?

No, it is not illegal by the way. Not unless you deliberately gave a false number knowing that you had no right to give it and that you would benefit by giving this number.

			hi magyir,  
1st: doing your repayment with a 3rd pillar (I guess we are talking about the 2nd mortgage) is the best way of saving taxes 
2nd: if there is nothing else written in your mortgage contracte you can switch to another bank... but probably one year later the old bank pays more interests...  
3rd: THE BIG QUESTION IS (AS WELL TO THE BANK): WHY THE HELL A THREE PILLAR ACCOUNT? COULD YOU PAY IT IF YOU WOULD BE DISABLED? WHICH SECURITY HAS YOUR WIFE (OR FAMILY) IN CASE OF DISABILITY OR DEATH? WHY THE HELL DID THE BANK SELL YOU THIS ACCOUNT? 
4th: Did you know that you will get more security (for your bank and your family) and after all much more % with a life insurance in your case? Did anybody inform you about that?

Effectively money invested for old age is free of tax on the capital and the interest. This is a potentially a large saving and is risk free. Any investment that you are making that has a compounded return of 8-9% or more on capital invested is not free of risk and involves securities. So on one side of the equation is your capital free of tax and with tax free interest around the 2.5%-4% and on the other is your tax liable investments on which taxable interest of say 10% is achievable with a risk factor x that could result in a loss of y%.    
In other words how risk averse are you?

5506	Financebankingtaxation	Property Tax	Bobby.Buchi	8707	15	Location: Menzingen	29.01.2008, 12:49	" 
			
			Wealth tax: Estimated value of property, minus the mortgage, is effectively wealth. It is added to other assets (bank accounts, investments, shares, car, etc,) to determine wealth. Wealth is taxed when it exceeds a threshold (different in each Canton!) but about 50k threshold for single persons, higher for married persons.   
Income tax: As already described, the deemed rental value is taxable. But is offset against the deductible mortgage payments.

I don't remember how much I had in the account, but it was less than 1000 CHF. When I came back I just announced them that I had a new address.

Unless your husband has income in the UK or other 'things' the tax man might be interested in, there's not much point for anybody in completing a tax form. But the Inland Revenue will be the one that decide if he is 'ordinarily non-resident' and stop sending the forms. The UK ones are much easier than the Swiss forms...

I have found some threads about working for EU employers but living in switzerland, but i think my situation is a bit different so i decided to make a new thread   
i was just offered a translation job from a greek publisher. it is for 1000 page book, so it will take a while   . i will be taxed 20% of my earnings in greece and i'm trying to figure out if i also need to pay any tax here?    
i will get paid by page, so not sure how long it will take.    
any input will be greatly appreciated   
thanks!

			Hi  
First post on the forum so I apologise if this has already been discussed in previous threads.    
We are hoping to escape the UK at some point this year and relocate to Switzerland for all the reasons that im sure everyone else on this forum considered when they moved to switzerland    
Im hoping to make use of the forfeit fiscal lump sum taxation facilty as I willl not need to work in Switzerland and will return to the UK 2 or 3 days a month to oversee my business.    
Can anyone on the forum who has been in a similiar situation reccomend a Swiss tax advisor or company who negotiated their lump sum taxation and sorted our residence permits etc.    
On our short list at the moment are Lugano, Luzern/Zug and Berne. I have had contact with one advisor in Bern Mr Peter Geiger who seems very knoweldgeable but it would be usefull to have more than one option.    
We will be spending 10 days doing some more research in Switzerland as of the 8th Feb    
Many Thanks  
Steve  
from not so nice  Birmingham in the UK ...hopefully not too much longer !!

			Ok, I had a look, it seems like just a rebranding of existing products. So in effect it is a normal personal account. I can confirm that with these, you will not pay for ATM fees and internet banking payment fees etc. if over 10k. I have the impression if the account reaches 10k during a month, this suffices. In other words, it does not look like the average balance has to be >10k across the whole month. But check if this is important.   
Also, the balance of other accounts under the same 'tree' counts towards this, so for example a savings account, custody account if you rent an apartment and have to deposit a bond, pillar 3a account if you want to save on tax etc. If you need more info on those, the forum has lots of threads.

			If your company opts for the MWSt flat rate 6% rate instead of 7.6% actuals, it appears from the form that you are paying 6% of the (sale price inc 7.6%) instead of 6% of the (sale price).   
Is this correct ? It means the effective rate of taxation for the flat rate is actually 0.06*(1.076)= 6.45% approx.    
It seems a bit odd thats all....

			At the outset, it has to be stated that your question cannot be finally answered based on your information.   
As a principle, the bonus is subject to taxation in Switzerland, irrespectively you are at the time of the payment of the bonus already tax resident in the UK, as the bonus relates to your employment in Switzerland,    
However, there may be a risk that the bonus is taxed in the UK as well according to UK tax law (which I don't know).   
However, according to the Double Taxation Treaty concluded between Switzerland and the UK, the bonus should only be subject to taxation in Switzerland.

5527	Financebankingtaxation	EU expat contract + religious tax	guest	2417	4	null	null	"    Well, the situation is a bit circumvoluted, as his employer is Swiss, but was recently bought up by the company he transferred from. So technically he's still employed by the Danes, ie they are paying his social contributions to the Danish government, pension and social security. But he is on the payroll of the Swiss one and paying income tax here.    
Length of entitlement benefits... hum... well, switching to the Swiss social laws took care of most (8 weeks holidays, paternity leave, free healthcare, don't you love the Scandinavian social system!). But you're right, he should probably do some research on that one.         Maybe he would get some sort of expat unemployment benefits from the Danish government??

			Yes you pay tax on it, albeit much lower than income tax.  This is because the swiss would be taxed on the amount at retirement.   
I believe the wisdom is you are best off moving the money in two steps, first to a ""freizugikeitskonto"" in Schwyz canton which has the lowest rate of such tax, and then withdrawing it.  I have seen this firm mentioned who seem to assist (no link to me, no implicit recommendation) site is in english

Well, to everybody I know...   
You can reclaim it via a tax return, or via the ""lighter"" tax adjustment form. 
There are other threads with that info.   
However, the rate of source tax is designed to match what you'd pay via a tax return anyway...

			Have just been given a pay rise that puts me above the 120'000 threshold...but only just!   
1. Is it worth speaking to my employer to remain on the 120'000 threshold with maybe an increased bonus option? 
2. Or does it make no odds as ALL income is taxable so whatever I do will be over 120'000?   
Think I know the answer but worth checking.....   
3. Does the tax return just turn up in the post one day? 
4. I have around 65K GBP in a UK Pension Fund. From reading the other posts it sounds like I should leave it there but does anything change if you start filling out tax returns over here?   
Thx

			This has happened in the EU too for many such non-cash employee benefits even those that are for company business. In many cases the employer increases the expense payment, so the real value to the employee remains the same   tax.

That is one of the reasons why I think the tax appeals commission have opened a real can of worms with their ""thought through"" reasoning. If you actually follow what they have said and published on the Zurich tax website they are quoting old laws to show precedents therefore questioning the validity of the new law. And on top of that selectively using articles in substantive law that while on one side supports their claims, contain further paragraphs or interpretations which shoot their argument into flames. Dumb I must say...

			Hi Camilla   
There's no english version of any taxation forms in Geneva.  In fact, as far as I can tell they are all exclusively in french.   
Your employer's HR department should be able to take care of this for you -  they did mine when I first arrived and was on tax at source.  Tax at source is much simpler than ""normal taxation"" - now I have to do a full tax return its way more complicated.  Just give your HR department the form and ask them to deal with it for you.

5550	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on foreign house	MrMert	1241	1	Location: Vaud	23.12.2007, 16:39	" 
			
			As a principle, you can declare a hypothetical rent of approx. 3.5% of the value of the house. This calculation is usually accepted by the the tax authority. Futhermore, the tax authority does not ask for any supporting documents. You can just declare the value and the tax authority usually accept your estimation.    
The estimation does not have to be adjusted to the changes in the exchange rate.   
Foreign taxes may not be credited against the Swiss taxes. However, please note that your foreign house is only taken into account in your tax declaration for the determination of the tax rate. You do, therefore, not pay any Swiss taxes on your foreign house.

Thus, you you have to deduct from your gross salary the source tax and the social security contributions (approx. 5% plus pension plan contributions) to get to the net salary.

5552	Financebankingtaxation	Debt collection agency?	ddejay	5618	17	Location: USA	29.10.2007, 15:12	"    Just a little side note here:   
Usually, you have a limited number of days to make a written complaint after the invoice date has been set.  This allows you time to review the invoice and make your claim back to the service provider.  Since you ""were considering legal action"", then you should have communicated this with the company you owe.   
Secondly, as a business owner, I am also human.  If a customer has troubles paying, then they can contact me and work out a payment plan.  If your cash flow was limited at that time it would have been only fair to the both parties involved to initiate communications and solve the payment situation before it rises to the bill collectors and legal matters and more unnecessary costs.     
I, too, have a Swiss bill collection agency that works for me.  When I receive an order, one of the first things I do is to check this person's credit rating.  If the company replies (automatically online) with a lower score, the product or services are delivered with prepayment or COD.  A good score deserves delivery per *payment slip.   
*=up to a certain value.   
What I am trying to say here, is that once you get your name on the black-list or have a bad credit score in Switzerland (private or business) then you have screwed yourself into years of: 
1. No credit, anywhere. 
2. Tax system aware of your status (they want their money too) 
3. Delivery of goods and services only per prepayment 
4. Possible court ordered debt collection direct from your paycheck   
It is not fun, I have personally ensured that three people in Switzerland have gone from a green-light score to red-light score (not district).  Due to fault, none other than their own.  I have plenty of documentation to support my decision to go this route.  Main reason is to collect on goods delivered on the basis of trust... which has been damaged (see Paypal=Fraud thread from earlier in 2007).   
My suggestion; pay your bills.  If you cannot pay, do not order.  Private or business.  Of course, businesses operate a little different than private, this is clear  ... plan accordingly.   
Just my 2cents!

			I don't see a big advantage of keeping the money in a vested account (what are the investment options in these accounts?, if it anything like a regular pension plan you might earn 2%?), I think you could do better than that on your own, even investing in a money market, extremely low risk account in the US.

5555	Financebankingtaxation	Business Gifts ?	DaveA	2457	1	Location: Appenzell	17.12.2007, 15:50	" 
			
			I would suggest you check the company policy beforehand. In some cases, the companies do not allow their employes to receive gifts from any supplier, or they stipulate a value for it. That also can depend on the type of business (eg for pharma there are very strict regulations about it).    
This time of the year is one of this rare occasions when i miss managing suppliers - even though the company i worked with only allowed me to take home presents with an estimated value of less than 50CHF  
Hope this helps,

5557	Financebankingtaxation	Work-from-home UK job but living in Switzerland?	RolandRB	1979	4	Location: ex Basel	10.12.2007, 12:10	"    I am not an expert, but have gone through a few hurdles with a few companies. A sole trader has  to have more than three customers, ie a window cleaner.  If this is not the case then you have to go the route of a GmbH or AG. The problem with this is that as an employer and employee you have to pay the Insurance contributions AHV twice, which on 10K a month is roughly  2K (1K + 1K), so your income has just dropped 20% not taking into consideration tax.  There is a loophole and its that you work purely for an overseas company and the overseas company subcontracts work to you. I do believe you can set up as sole trader in this way and pay only one contribution.

			NOt sure what your particular situation is, but I can't live in Switzerland without a Euro account. I travel quite often to Germany, France and Italy, so would rather have an interest bearing Euro account to draw from when needed. Credit Suisse keeps CHF/Euros/Dollars for me. Many of the ATMs also dispense Euros here. I am sure a private banker could take care of you, if the amounts are high enough.

			When I moved here initially they taxed me based on my marriage status as they assumed he would be here with me.  Once I explained to them that he was not living here and his income was for our mortgage and UK bills they taxed me as a ""single"" income.  I'm not sure if this is normal as we began divorce proceedings shortly after my move here which may well have influenced things further so it is worth getting some financial advice from a professional (there are a few on the forum which may help).

5566	Financebankingtaxation	Taxation on property abroad	SWISSMISS143	5417	10	Location: geneve	20.08.2007, 03:14	"    Unless you are printing the money to buy the property or using previously undeclared funds, you will not be increasing your wealth. A mortgage is not an asset.      If you mean  , only if you declare it and only if you do not pay tax on the income in eastern Europe.       Generally Swiss tax authorities expect a revaluation every 5 years. The value will be what you tell them it is. If you tell them at all      It's a mute point. You can try. It really depends if you expect to bring the capital into Switzerland at some point in the future. If so, then it's a good idea to show where the money is now and avoid any surprises down the line. What you can't do is claim the mortgage interest twice - here and there...

			Usual practice is for the company and employee to split the cost of the pension (BVG minimum and above). However, the rules specifically define the benefit you will receive and the contributions required by the employee and the company. The employee can usually make voluntary contributions above this into the plan to buy additional benefits (subject to limits) but a company would not match these voluntary contributions.

			You will be paying roughly 7-8% of social deductions (that doesn't include your pension fund).   
Since you will use your Swiss salary to pay your mortgage in Finland, you may be able to deduct the interest from your Taxable Income but maybe better to check with the Tax Office in Lausanne.

			Having spoken to Dilbert, he seems to agree that PEP's and ISA's are part of overall wealth; however he wondered - will you still be entitled to ISA if (insert assumption disclamer here) you will not be a UK tax resident?   
Dim memory cells seem to indicate that eligible for ISA's are/were only UK tax residents or special overseas serving types?   
Aha. Further stimulation of said cells with full octane caffeine seem to indicate that if you cease being UK tax resident you can keep existing ISA's but not contribute anymore. Which sort of defeats the purpose of the ISA if you declare it as wealth in Switzerland.   
Anyhoo, since the full scope of your planning is unknown to me, i'll say this much - there is no tax on capital gain in Switzerland. I am quite sure about non-taxation of equity dividends received from EU based companies - as far as EU residents are concerned, fixed income and cash revenue is currently taxed at source along a scale set to increase to about a third in the near future (but can be circumvented by setting up a foundation or company (of which the Panameans are the cheapest - ah, i knew that seminar would come to good use someday)). Said company also allows you to circumvent wealth tax to some extent.   
You could then in theory replicate your ISA scheme here, with the added benefit that there are no limits in yearly contributions.   
Back to comics now.

5574	Financebankingtaxation	US vs Swiss Vaud taxes	Marvin	5969	7	Location: USA	19.11.2007, 15:21	"    It's really more like ""sorta kinda maybe no double taxation, with the following exceptions:""      
Whether you end up paying somewhat more, roughly the same, or somewhat less is very much dependant on your individual situation - both in Switzerland and the US.   
Broadly speaking, and very much simplified, first you pay your Swiss taxes. Then you figure out what the IRS thinks you owe them - from your income, if you meet the overseas residence qualifications, you may deduct the USD 82,000-ish allowance. (Or portion thereof, blah blah blah...) Then you can take credit for most, but not necessarily all, of the taxes you paid to CH. Typically, if your Swiss payments are lower than your US tax liability, you will still owe Uncle Sam some dosh. If your Swiss payments were higher than your US tax liability, you can carry the credits forward (I think for 5 years?) against future US taxes.   
There are umpteen billion pages of IRS rules, regulations and formulas to wade through to figure all this out. Do consider getting professional advise.   
(Are you here on assignment from a US company? If so, many offer tax advise, and some offer tax equalization programs as part of a relocation package...)    
Bear in mind that the two systems think about income and deductions differently, making tax/investment planning a bit trickier. Oh, and taking the allowance and foreign tax credits pushes many expats into the AMT who might not otherwise be affected if resident in the US...   
As to why the difference in taxes across cantons and towns in Switzerland:       
Essentially, each canton and community decides how much revenue it needs to keep things running another year;  the tax rate is roughly based on what it will take to generate that sum, given the population and wealth of the community/canton. The cool thing about Switzerland is that citizens get to vote to approve or reject the proposed rate.

I am technically not allowed to work in CH  as I am  ohne  Erwerbstaetigkeit, (Not able to work here) and all of my work activities will be outside of CH.  
However I am resident here and a taxpayer. Is there anyway that I can contribute on a voluntary basis into the social system here! If not do they have such things as independent pension schemes.   
I have looked at the possibility of taking over a defunkt AG company or forming a GmbH, but the running and set up costs I feel are prohibitive  I am earning CHF >120K and have no pension provision at the moment.    
Any input welcome.

			As an armchair economist, I don't presume to be capable of predicting anything other than what is staring me in the face.   
As many here acknowledge, the USD is continuing on its downward trend because their debts are so high and they are getting hammered by China.  The UK doesn't make the news quite as much, but their problems are not smaller in proportion. Switzerland is one of the countries with the best balance of payments positions.       
Things don't look good for the countries at the bottom of that list.  I guess the UK will eventually follow the US government dollar policy (Sarkozy thinks it is a policy) and gently start to let the pound slide.

5582	Financebankingtaxation	Car Leasing: Nominal vs Effective rates	bozothedeathmachine	1236	0	Location: Arni, AG	14.11.2007, 11:55	" 
			
			Ok, so I know there are 2 meanings to the word ""leasing"" here, and I'm not sure I understand them completely.   
Backstory: We're new here (<3 years) and we need to get car. Everyone here talks about leasing, which to me (Yank) is nothing more than glorified rental. I'd like to own a car that I could drive well after the leasing period ends. I know I can reduce the residual value as low as I can and that's pretty much the same as buying.    
I've checked several sites on getting a loan and buying a car outright. The rates are pretty high for those, 11 - 12%.   
I was just checking GE Money Bank. For a lease of 33k with a 10k downpayment and 1k residual value (lowest GE allows) it shows a nominal rate of 5.95% and an effective rate of 12.23%. What the hell kind of math is that? I've never seen such a disparity between nominal and effective rates. Even if they compounded continuously it will still be around 6%.    
If I can secure a private loan for 11% why would leasing be an option at all? I'm really confused by this, but considering I'm so new here no one wants to give me cash so leasing may be the only way to go.   
Thanks.

5584	Financebankingtaxation	Americans shut out of CH investment opitons b/c of W.?	bnc	2134	23	Location: Basel	07.11.2007, 21:05	"    Depending on your budget, I would recommend getting ""proper advice"" on this, such as an accounting firm will offer. If you are willing to do your own research, go to their websites, you will often find that they publish brochures and studies about various current topics, if you're lucky you will find something that points you in the right direction. I work in a tax team myself (we don't deal with individuals though) and we tend to publish stuff every six months or so, the most recent being a study about cantonal banks mysteriously being tax exempt. Mostly the stuff is written in a way that makes it easy to grasp for the majority of readers.   
Even if it's not exactly what you are asking about, an example of the stuff available online and that explains the Swiss-US Tax Treaty a bit is    
The other option is reading up on circulars and legislation, which I realise is not a fun thing to do for the average person (I should know, I'm often involved in translating the stuff) but having a professional tell you what you can find out on your own is a bit pointless for the average private investor. Various texts referring to investment funds can be found  .

			Hi, Richard,   
Thanks for your reply. 
Could you please see the picture which I found, and tell me if our swiss customer import this kind of goods from China, which kinds of taxes will be charged? I need more detailed information. Thanks a lot.      I don't know how to upload a picture. The picture shows:   
Tariff number is 7412.2020 and the text is copper alloys of tube or pipe fittings (for example, couplings, elbows, sleeves) with surface-treat.

5591	Financebankingtaxation	Tax Rental Value of empty flat	Cashboy	1929	9	Location: Ticino & London	25.10.2007, 15:55	"    That is exactly what I told the Revenue Officer.  
I said that as my uncle is not paying me any rent, but paying all the expenses and utility bills.   
The Rent Received = The Expenses Paid => Not Net Income for me => No Tax on it.   
The Revenue Officer said the tax payable is on the market rentable value of the property, not what I received.   
I am a puzzled as we own a building with four appartments in Ticino using a company (SA); two of which are furnished and empty at the moment. I only declare the rental income received in the company accounts, not rental value and therefore do not pay tax on the empty flats in effect. 
Surely I would be better off putting the Zermatt flat into the company as well?

5593	Financebankingtaxation	UK Student loans	guest	1495	10	null	null	" 
			
			I moved out here straight after uni, and started student loan repayments as soon as they were due, at the normal rate (at around £150 per month for me).   
I never told them that I left the UK, but remained registered at my parents address as far as they knew.  I know all the literature said to tell them if you did leave the UK, but I assumed that was just to make sure they could still make arrangements to take the payments from you... have never heard about different interest rates?!     But as I still had UK bank accounts, the direct debit worked as normal, so I left it as is.     
Shudder to think the bank charges I accrued, transferring money back home from time to time... but all in all no hassles, no questions, now debt free.   
NB: just to point out, these were the older style student loans of approx £2K per year - just before they became the humongous size they are now with tuition fees.  Maybe the rules are different now?

Also remember that once you have done this your info will be with the tax authorities and you will have to declare it as wealth.. To be taxed in Switzerland...

But... personally, unless you're paying really high taxes every year and you plan on staying here for over 10 years, I don't think it's worth it.   
With a ""3rd pillar"" when you take out a 3a, you can deduct the amount from your taxes each year but when you withdraw everything at the end, you pay tax on it.   
With a 3b, you can't deduct it each year. However, after 10 years, it is tax free.   
The amount you save each year with a 3a is just not worth it when you look at how much you wouldn't pay with a 3b.   
3b's tend to have a much higher rate of interest too       "	Posts: 12	Join Date: Feb 2007	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Check out   they are a Northern Irish based online bike shop. They also do snowboard stuff. I have bought a lot of bike stuff off them and if you order on monday you will have it before the weekend. They have free shipping on items over £100 in value, they offer CHF prices on their website, and they deduct the VAT automatically when you put your address in as Switzerland. I have had good experiences with them on the biking front, I can't see any reason why they would be different for snowboarding gear.   
Also another tip for snowboarding gear if you are around Zurich at the moment. There is a shop in Wallisellen that gives a 20% discount on all this years (2008) snow sports stock for the first 2 weeks in October. Could be worth getting down there this week! The shops name is Sport Plausch Wider. If you google them you will find their website.

5614	Financebankingtaxation	UBS take a 4bn CHF hit from sub-prime	Gav	1465	6	Location: Ireland	01.10.2007, 13:40	"       Gold is viewed as a good hedge against inflation.   
   The problem is that the money supply has been inflated massively in the last five or six years.  Combined with low, low interest rates this has lead to a massive loosening in credit criteria.  Up until very recently, anyone who could fog a glass could raise huge amounts of credit.   
   Anyway, all that newly created 'cash' had to go somewhere.  With interest rates being so low, no-one was putting it in a savings account or buying regular government bonds (apart from the Chinese)  .   
  So we've seen massive inflation of house prices, an inflated stock market, and trading in risky assets which offer high rates of return.   
   Now it's all about to come crashing down and it looks like the US certainly will try to use inflation to engineer a soft landing.  Maybe the UK too.  So people are buying assets that are known to hold their value in an inflationary environment - like gold and precious metals.

			Getting a bank issued credit card (VISA, AMEX) was no problem for us in the first months here with a B permit.  However, we were declined for Manor & Globus cards - even with proof of employment and salary.  We waited a couple of years to apply again and were then approved with only submitting a photocopy of the B Permit.     
So it seems store issued cards are more difficult to get without at least a couple years of residence in CH.

			Hi All, 
I have the following query. My income is less than 120000 and so I do not have to file a tax return. But in case I feel I should get some tax refund then do the tax authorities entertain cases where the income is less than 120000 ?   
Also, suppose I am registered in Zurich in June this year and my family gets registered in November though the spouse letter is issed before June, then  do I get any benefit for  the  period  June to Nov ?  In Germany  I had  a similar experience and there as filing tax return is compulsory so on filing the tax returns i got back all the benefits.   
Can anyone help me on these queries ?

			The problem was that the internet banking service for my bank (Basler Kantonalbank) does not have an internal transfer button or anything like that. So I just went to the BKB and found out what to do:   When transferring cash out of the Swiss EUR account to a foreign EUR account, foreign transfer fees (4 Fr.) are still charged. With the Kantonalbank, you also get charged if you take out Euros at an ATM - but since I still have one foot in Germany, this is something I don't really need to worry about.

A percentage of the car's new value is added to your salary and then taxed accordingly. For a 630i Bimmer (new value about 100k) that works out to about CHF 800 a month.   
The downside is that the addition is based on the car's new value and does not decrease in time.

5630	Financebankingtaxation	Importing a used Jukebox - Import Tax	taylor_rich	1242	1	Location: Zug	12.09.2007, 01:13	" 
			
			Hi,   
I'm a powerseller based in France. I deal with quite a lot of imports.   
When I import items from Japan say, I pay the VAT based on the insured value of the shipment (19.6%) and then duties on top based on the weight and the items. Each individual item will have it's own code (HS code) to allow the duane to calculate the duties accordingly.   
I've been doing my research too...as we're looking into moving to CH quite soon. You would obviously have to pay 7% VAT based on the value...of course if the seller provides you/freight company with an import receipt you can show that. Of course this is open to abuse as people can say they paid little for it and thus declare a low value...naughty naughty.   
When i was looking into duties they quoted 15% of net weight...still getting my head around that!   
Hope that helps...

			As a principle, your wife's expenses are not tax deductible. In Switzerland only further education costs (""Weiterbildung"") but nod education costs (""Ausbildung"") are tax deductible. Furthermore, as long as you earn less than CHF 120'000 per year, you don't have to file a annual tax return but are finally taxed at source.    
If you have to file a tax return, bank interest are tax deductible. Please note that leasing interest for a car are not tax deductible.

The difference between the taxes is explained by their name, i.e. federal to the confederation, cantonal to the canton, communal to the commune. 
You'll be only deducted a lump sum anyhow so don't bother.

As a sidenote, whatever is being withheld from your salary isn't national - within the Swiss tax at source system all taxes (federal, cantonal, communal and church if applicable) are bulked together.   
Frankly, if you on one hand see withholdings on your salary slip and on the other still pay taxes by means of the pink payslips, there's something dodgy going on.

5648	Financebankingtaxation	"What are ""Withholding Tax"" and ""Wealth Tax""?"	guest	4333	1	null	null	"    It's not taxing that adds value - it's the enterprise that adds value to an intrant before selling it onwards.      The State withholds 35% of any interest contribution being paid out (or lottery winnings). That amount appears on your account statement, and once you declare your total income for the year (Salary+whatever extra income) the state will decide whether they should repay you anything of the 35% based on the overall income level.      Yep - the final balance of your movable and immovable assets will be taxed according to the wealth tax schedule. No doubt Richard will extensively correct me, but that's the gist of it.

Given the numbers that you've mentioned, 11.5%-~28% would be all of my salary that would have to be paid?  If so, that's definitely lower than I thought.  I would clear 80,000/year minimum?  Not bad.

			Hi everyone   
Quite a while I'm not coming in... very busy at work, at home, looking for nursery, being in the queue, searching for jobs for my husband, having little fun and too much stress... This is the summary of my first three months at Basel... Apart from that, the difficulty of not understanding the mail, the bills, the contract... and the worse not knowing what's all about the money taken in my pay slip...   
Could someone let me know what's the meaning of the following? ... I'm afraid they're not taken the taxes monthly and then in one year time having to pay what I won't have...   
UI, PF, AHV contribution 
Withholding tax 22.8% ... does it mean I'm paying already the taxes? is it normal the %?   
Basel is a very nice place to live, expensive but nice. The weather is being ok but not too much time to enjoy life at the minute... I'm desperate for finding an au pair and cooker... Anyone knowing somewhere to go and ask for?    
Thanks a lot and good luck

Furthermore if you understand the way things work in Switzerland you will realise that there are two types of company you can use. One works for international companies that want to open a branch here example   They will be charging ~7-10% and then the so called agencies that will charge you a fortune.    
And then to add to this you have the location where you are wanting to business. According to this your ""payroll"" company may or may not be the best bet. If you have specific requirements and wishes and want to have things cleared up then you can pm me.

You borrow cheap yen then gamble against a drop/rise in another currency. Banks make hell of a lot of money out of this 3m a day sterling average in the bank I worked in.    
I'd say leave it in Euros for 3 months then look at it again. Dollar is still weakening against Sterling + Euro, but it won't drop much lower I reckon. Then change it quickly before the dollar rises again.    
Saying that sub prime lending is really affecting the US markets hence no confidence in the US Dollar. So i reckon this might go on for a year or so. Depends if the US housing market drops out. If it does keep the money in Euros.

			If you are in the UK for less than approx 130 days a year, and resident abroad then you don't have any liability for tax there.  If you have already paid tax, you can claim it back on a form available from the office in Bootle.   
Therefore, the fact that you haven't been resident doesn't create a liability for you.  The worst case scenario here (I think) is that you may be deducted tax through PAYE, but once you get the form through you should be able to reclaim this.

Ultimately if this goes belly up then they will be liable for the social security contributions in Switzerland and potentially the UK!    
You need to understand a bit about the Swiss Tax system though to answer if Basel is okay at 37%(I would say no). And you need to state what your objectives are. Is it to flit over to Switzerland do the contract and return to base?    
You do have several options and you do need a bit of advice to get the best deal. Things that are additionally relevant are age, and family situation, where the place of work will be and what kind of accomodation you will be seeking and where. PM me or post your objectives and I will provide you the answers.

5669	Financebankingtaxation	best rate to transfer CHF to USA(Citi Bank)?	suddenyy	2903	10	Location: geneva	09.07.2007, 07:09	"     When you close your acct, they will take the w/h tax on the Swiss side. Wrt taxes, it gets a little complicated. The w/h tax has always been 35% for us on any interest earned, assuming your tax bracket is less/more than that, it will be part of w/h paid and you may/may not be eligible for the difference dependent on how much w/h or not that you've had. So you should always declare your interest earned. Btw, wrt wiring money to and fro from one's personal accounts, that statement is made based on the assumption that he/she has fully declared their foreign assets to the US IRS as well as to the US Treasury now. All US persons need to fill in form TDF 90-22.1 reporting all non-US bank or financial accts over which he/she has a financial interest or signature exceeding US$10k at any time during the year (even if only for 1 day). 
With effect from Oct 2004, penalties for incorrect filing or failure to file have been increased to the greater of US$100k or up to 50% off the value of the acct per incorrect declaration. So, just a heads up for anyone on the 'flagging' question. And assuming you have declared all your foreign assets, there is no 'flagging' issue when you wire money to and fro from your personal bank accts.  
Waiting for FX rates to move in your favor can be a hit and miss affair, unless you watch it everyday and read market news and make sure you are on top of the numbers. Depending on how much you have, you may not want to do that, because moving money to the US and putting it in CDs would yield a higher return for you than having a measly return on interest sitting in UBS.

If you do not know the name of the company then contact the company managing the pension fund for your current employer and explain the situation.   I expect you will get help from the latter as they have a vested interest in helping you.

What happens is the father will delcare that the child is his(Vaterschaft Anurkennung) at the Civilstandsamt. The child will have your last name until you marry- then it will change just like yours.    
Since you are not married, the Vormanschaftbehorder/in (sp?) or someone in the Social Amt will contact you to put on paper an agreed amount should something happen (aka you spilt up before marrying) so the child is financially protected (child support) until you do marry.   
As for nationality, your child has the right to a Swiss passport and your homeland passport (my son is Swiss American  ).

I guess with UBS on a daily rate it looks like they would want me to go through the payroll. 
Will investigate the company side and expensing legitimate expenses but then again for me the bottom line is savings so don't wan to expense myself out.. 
I looked at

			I am lucky to be  old enough to be out of taking my pension lot out of UK, but I have a question.  Called the Inland Revenue, or its new name today for non residents. They informed me that the sum I shall get for my house here in England can remain here and I can use the interest tax free in CH.(With a form R105) given to a bank or building soc. which will accept this. 
As I have a   British pension of £49per month here in UK and my Swiss Pension, it will not make enough to get a flat and pay all expenses in CH including Health Insurance and utilities. 
Has anyone else used the R105?  Who did they use and what experience did they get in Switzerland.  Have I formulated this correctly or am in totally in stress?

5690	Financebankingtaxation	Tax on overseas earnings	Fahle	1556	8	Location: Zurich	05.06.2007, 19:06	"    Taking it a little deeper - what about the country where you have the bank account.  Will you be decalring the interest there?  If it's somewhere like the UK then the tax authorities know about that interest and it may even be deducted at source.     
If you pay tax on the interest in another country, and Switzerland has a double tax agreement with that country, then you would probably not be liable to tax here if the other country has higher tax rates (you would still declare it but the tax you paid in the other country is then offset against what you may pay here).   
It is relatively easy to keep the Swiss tax authorities at bay but a sudden lump of income could lead to questions you might want to avoid - once questions are asked, they will be tenacious  .

Where the UK salaries compare to here (in the City of London), you would be paying a minimum of 40% base tax plus NI, etc - this normally comes out to about 50-60% stoppages. Then either your cost of living is really high or your commute cost is high (in time and money).

			Some info from a group newbie    
If you have any savings and would like the interest gross then register with HSBC for an online saver account. They specify in the terms and conditions that if you become non-UK resident (ie: after you tell the IR you're no longer resident) you can get interest gross after submitting an R105. No tax re-claim necessary.   
This is exactly what I have done with First Direct (a member of HSBC) but since the HSBC rate is better (5.75% vs 5.25% AER) I would go for them. Note that these two rates have not yet increased since the BoE hiked borrowing to 5.5% so I expect another rate increase soon.

			Hi tgpt   
According to the advice we have been given, yes, the law should give same rights with regard to taxation (not that this is necessarily an advantage!) and inheritance, BUT the local implementation is not yet ready in all cantons and it may actually be 1-2 years before the cantonal inheritance legislation is in place in all cantons.   
My partner and I are ""registered partners"" in Denmark and this is recognized by the Swiss, but the bureaucracy of having it actually registered here seems a bit difficult to sort out! Until now the Swiss embassy in Denmark has confrimed our registration to the Federal authorities. Now, it seems, we ned to have it registered in Basel, because my partner is a Swiss citizen from Basel, and only then can it be registered in Vaud where we are living.   
I would be interested in hearing your experience, if you have come any further since you posted the message.

			Hi,   
Thanks so much for the link. It was good to stretch my French language muscles after a long time...   
I have also asked some more around and the general approach seems to be that the amount you stay should be logical for what your job is...meaning there's no fixed amount. If you have responsibilities for international projects, then that justifies traveling, etc.    
Of course there's still tax liability (which I understand to be after 30 days if you are working) and the need to maintain an abode.    
I really appreciate your taking time to answer my post, thanks again.

			I live in Kanton Aargau - here we must pay tax in advance I.E. I have the 2007 bill sent in March 2007 and it must be paid in full at the latest by October 2007 or you get threatened with Betreibungs if you haven't agreed a payment schedule with the Gemeinde (it took me nearly 3 years to ""catch up"" from the Zurich tax calander - this December I think I will at last be in sync).  
Does this new married allowance Tax change mean that this 2007 Bill, mentioned above, could be reduced? I do understand that it will be adjusted in next years estimated bill.  
What sort of realistic saving could my wife and I expect to make? We have one kid and reasonable incomes? (just a for instance estimate would me nice). Her Christmas present may depend on this      
I suppose if we ever sold up and moved back to Kanton Zurich - it would be a nice financial holiday to catch back ""down"" to their Calendar.

			Yes you are right, the Keyclub is very inflated unless you are superrich, and then the card can become free, but that is no use to me either.   
What about the Postcard Gold, do they automatically make it free after the 6k or do you have to undertake action??

			income tax on canton of residence with the wochenaufenthalt.   For the first year its not going to be a problem but if you stay longer than a year then you might have to prove to the authorities ,where you have your Wochenaufenthalt ,that you have strong ties with your canton of residence... otherwise they might make you change where you pay your income tax without moving your residency.

			As you will have seen from searching these forums, there are three 'columns' in the Swiss pension system. If you deposit your SA pension cash in Column 3a - maybe over a number of years to maximise the effect, you can actually get tax relief, up to specified limits, on the amount you deposit, though you will not be able to remove the money until you retire.    
Zurich Financial Services among others run such schemes...

			Welcome!   
Taxation depends heavily on your marital status and whether or not you have children. If you calculate 25% of your brutto loan for taxes/social security/health insurance, you are on the safe side.   
Rents are quite high here, better prepare to pay 1500 CHF upwards / month.

Pension savings in Switzerland can no longer be taken out of the country ( refers to obligatory payments ).

Generally, dividends are treated as income and added to your work income. Total is then taxable at the appropriate Geneva rates.

			Check the following Link for nationals of non-signatory states          See point 18 on page 52.       It looks like AHV (Old Age &amp; Survivors Insurance or OASI) can be paid out when you leave if you are a resident of a non-signatory state. Page 45 of the document lists the signatory states.    The form for actually claiming the OASI refund when you leave is as follows:  http://www.ahv.ch/Commun/602101-e.pdf   The deductions for AHV are about 5% so can add up if you are here for a while.

Yes, I think you are right, the focus of my attention is now shifting to Swiss taxes.   
I re-read IR20 which is quite clear that resident or not, if your employment is in the UK, for a UK company and paid in the UK then you are subject to income tax.   
As I am a Commonwealth citizen (which includes British) I retain my personal allowances.   
As I will be non-resident, not ordinarily resident and non-domiciled, I can receive bank interest without deduction of basic rate tax which is a minor consolation.

I am not sure how that works in detail, only that the risk of getting a bill is much higher if you do it yourself, because when a Treuhand (tax person) does it, the government is more likely to assume it is correct.

5751	Financebankingtaxation	Credit Cards: Something worth remembering	guest	3627	12	null	null	" 
			
			Hi all - interesting discussions seem to be going on in this thread and others regarding credit cards.  We have been here one month and we are about to apply for credit cards - we are thinking of the Coop and Migros due to no annual fees.  However, the insurance issue, raised by one or two people could be important if you want to rent a car, have some kind of travel insurance etc.     
Does anyone have a definitive answer about whether Coop or Migros offer any insurance of this type?  Perhaps that is what the annual fees are with the other cards/banks?   
Any advice on the above as well as applications, online payments etc, much appreciated.  It all seems a bit scary when all the small print is in German

5754	Financebankingtaxation	Social Security Deductions	vivekjindal	2604	2	Location: Zurich	30.01.2007, 00:31	"    It all depends... Generally you are able to work for 3 months on assignment without any deductions. If you are staying longer than that it depends on the type of your stay. If you fly in Monday leave Friday and are working on a contract through a non-Swiss company assignment ie it just happens to be in Switzerland then for the length of your stay you are free from all deductions. If however you are resident here then you are liable to deductions but first after 90 days. Note if you exceed the 90 days then these deductions are backdated to your entry point. The point at which tax is leviable follows the same route. IF you are in the country for more than 180 days excluding days in which you travel to and from your home then you are again liable. Hence if you are here Monday - Friday travelling in on Monday and leaving again on Friday you are exempt.  
But Tax and social contributions are coupled with a work permit. IF you have a work permit then you will be Taxed and liable to social contributions irrespective of length of stay. Note work permits have a general minimum length of 4 months.

5755	Financebankingtaxation	To save in funds	whoop123	1648	4	Location: SG	01.02.2007, 02:25	" 
			
			All the 'retirement funds' in switzerland that give you tax breaks (Pillar 3a they are called) have very limited funds options from government regulation - each bank normally has their 4 choices allong the lines of conservative-dynamic with a more stock:bond ratio in each...they are all pretty dismal performers compared to the open market.   
So what you want is a normal investment account and 2-300/month is definitely low in most bank eyes.  Credit Suisse has a huge stable of funds, including all the ones from the non-in house firms (and everything available in English), but stock funds have a 2% buying commision with a minimum of 50Fr, so at 300Fr a pop it is distressing and if you like to switch funds every month you would by Mr. credit Suisse a nice little chalet...   
Kantonal Bank has funds more directed to 'real' people in that you can invest 100+fr at a regular rate and not be hit so badly.  But everything is in german.   
Post finance might really be the option because they seem to have info in English on their website, but I have no experience with them...

5756	Financebankingtaxation	Taxation on commission payments	private_banker	1639	1	Location: Zurich	26.01.2007, 18:50	"    That is not an easy question to answer and I'd suggest that you should speak to an accountant about it.  One would need to know a lot about the transaction before one could even have a stab at it.  For instance: 
- What is the nature of the service being provided 
- Where was the service provided 
- What kind of invoice was raised 
- The turnover of the distributor, if not already registered for VAT 
- If registered for VAT, what method of accounting is being used 
- Are there going to be further transactions   
Bottom line:  If there is serious money involved, then get professional advice.

5759	Financebankingtaxation	Mutual Fund Distributions Taxable?	andrew1306	1965	3	Location: Zürich	15.01.2007, 17:49	"    Correct. Until the new legislation came in force there was no deduction on Lux domiciled fund for EU-national and domiciled citizen. In your case, assuming you are domiciled in Switzerland, there will be no withholding however you are supposed to declare dividends as income.

5760	Financebankingtaxation	Greetings fellow English speakers	Franca	2247	0	Location: zürich	17.01.2007, 11:10	" 
			
			Just a short and sweet hello to you all.  
I've been living in Switzerland for the past year and a half, and only just discovered this site. Purely delighted I was while reading a few threads from the financial section to discover that that there are more Aussies in Switzerland than I imagined. Reading the financial section brings me to my question does anyone know a good financial advisor in Zürich? I'm not in the banking industry and therefore no clue. Also does anyone know how long it takes to get your BVG once you decide to leave the country?   
Cheers

5761	Financebankingtaxation	Uk Interest rate rise - better to change Sfr to Stg now or wait?	Gav	2266	6	Location: Ireland	11.01.2007, 18:47	"      Worst I ever saw was 1stg = 2chf but that was about 15 years ago (when I was just visiting some friends and wanting to change stg to chf. d'oh!).   
   In the 7-8  years that I was resident in Switzerland, ISTR that the rate has varied between 2.2 and 2.6 CHF per pound.  So the current rate isn't great, but it's not too bad either.  Maybe a good time to change.

			Richard I think you are more correct as far as the banking side of GwG is concerned, my point only being that a numbered account is no certainty of complete anonymity. But if I were to stumble across a briefcase full of ""doozigers"", I would head for Vaduz. They seem to be more passionate about this kind of banking.       
So far a lot of the Money Laundering Act has been ""Self-Regulation"" administered by the Banks and Casinos own association bodies. But the EBK and the ESBK (Banking and Casino Commissions respectively) have been moving towards stricter regulation, but have balked, seeing that it would be ""quantity"" more than ""quality"", not to mention an administrative nightmare.    
For casinos I know it is bad enough already. If you change more than 15'000chf in one day (and for some that is not a lot), you must provide a passport copy. Otherwise you don't get to collect your winnings. But again this only records the transactions. Remember that money you win in casinos located on Swiss soil are not subject to   tax, only tax on your total net worth. Although casino gambling itself is usually a form of idiot tax.

			Stuinzuiri, why did you move your plastic to CS then? What was your perceived advantage?   
Litespeed and others, why not sign up for automatic debits, so your UBS card gets paid straight away every month? I mean if you intend to always pay it in full, you might just as well automate it?   
Evilshell, you can get the free cc's without a deposit.   
Here is a list:   
PS. Info is gleamed from various sources including posts from the Praise Be coop thread.   
Colors had a good tip too:  
where you can compare different cards here in Switzerland.

5767	Financebankingtaxation	UBS cut off times changed for online payments?	muze7	2084	0	Location: Uk now	23.11.2006, 15:04	" 
			
			I am one of these people who have to remind mysefl about paying bills so I often pay just before the deadline. This means just before UBS cut off times  .   
Now you used to be able to enter payments online until 13.59 hours to have a payment made that same day, then it changed to 13.45 hours but now even just after 13.30 hours, your dated will be adjusted one day forward.   
Does anyone know what the real life cut off time now is? (The pdf with times has not changed last time I looked so I am hoping someone is just as bad as me and knows the real time  ).   
Also, is it true that Friday is a non-day in terms of transactions, so any payment that you want to arrive by Monday needs to be transferred on Thursday, probably before 1300 hours?

5770	Financebankingtaxation	Tax In Switzerland	Richard	7160	7	Location: Luzern currently	16.12.2005, 16:22	" 
			
			Just for your information and of course if you have any questions I will provide an answer:   
The EU is currently investigating Switzerland for providing state assistance to companies coming to Switzerland. There is a basic EU law which restricts and sometimes prohibits the help a government can give a company. Switzerland has a three tier tax system which allows a Gemeinde and Canton to discount tax for businesses and people for that matter and the Cantons of Schwyz and Zug are famous for doing this. The EU is of the opinion that this systems provides companies moving to Switzerland instead of being domiciled in the EU with an unfair advantage... Switzerland of course disputes this as the bilateral agreement was related to the transfer of people and not of businesses and certainly not a harmonisation of laws and taxes as implied by this EU investigation.   
Recently also the Canton Zurich agreed to maintain its Cantonal 100% tax level. This has serious implications for those who will be living in Zurich in 2007 and paying tax there... Any Canton can write a small loss but larger ones based on their GDP are only allowed to occur for two consecutive years. Thereafter the Canton is obliged to bring its tax to a level where it will break even. This is a problem for Canton Zurich as the tax will need to increase by double digit % to say 115% further the Gemeindes will need to increase the tax too and business in Zurich will become less attractive. Now obviously there must be an alternative and this can be for example increasing revenue from some other source (speeding cameras, and parking tickets for example!) or reducing the expenditure (closing schools for example). All in all though 2007 will be a tough year...   
Richard

			Hi guys, thanks for the answers, I will try the machine that sounds fast and easy.      Thanks heaps, yes I meant changing the personal address to another kanton's. Reason being I do not fancy becoming an official wochenaufenthaltperson, by which I mean that two kantons might want to start a fight about who gets my taxes if I am elsewhere during part of the week.

If not, you might be able to get away with spending more than you have in your account for just one day, rather than seven. The only way to find out would be to try it.
