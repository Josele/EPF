			After much debate an excellent idea by Treverus was to create a social group for the 'Practice Writing German thread'   
it can be found here for any that want to be involved       
Mods will check in from time to time but as with the other social groups they are pretty much left up to the participants to maintain. So play nicely   
If anyone wants to set a similar group up for French, Italian or Romanisch then you are free to do so, just let us know so we can create a sticky for it also

			Welcome to the Language Corner. Please take a moment to review these guidelines before you post.       
Switzerland has three main official languages (German, French, Italian). To make it easier for people to select the threads that interest them please prefix your subject line with the name of the language. For example:         
In some cases no prefix is necessary, for example:       
As always - try to make your subject line as relevant and as informative as possible.     
Discussions here should be limited to the use of language as it applies to life in Switzerland. This could include the use of English (see next section), but should not incude other languages (e.g. Spanish, Japanese) unless they are relevant to a topic in discussion (such as highlighting the difference between German and Japense, or the similarities between Italian and Spanish).        
This forum may be called ""English Forum"", but the focus is for English-speaking people living in Switzerland. This area  . Posts from non-natives (especially outside Switzerland) looking for help with their English  . There are other forums on the internet that deal with the English language, please use these instead (hint: google).   
From time to time there may be coverage about the English language but this will only be in the following cases:   
Please take note of the following linguistic terms that are frequently spelled incorrectly by native English speakers (since they will be used often in this area):     , not grammer.   , not pronounciation. Pronounce contains an   after the first  , pronunciation does not.

			I took the exam without much preparation other than doing a couple of practice exams. I found the use of English parts easy, I practiced those parts that I struggled with most. The oral part was not difficult either, in preparation I watched some videos and looked at the examiner notes on those exams, which are all available online as examples. This really helped, as I knew what was expected. The essay was not hard, but you need to know how to write different types of essays, letters, etc, once you have the structure right, the rest is easy. There was one part in the reading that I found tricky, where you had to put text pieces into the right order. The text made sense to me in a few different ways. The other part I found rather difficult was the 2nd part of the listening exam, where you had a variety of of muliple choice answers. I kind of guessed at some of those answers, but since I aced the other part of the listening exam, it didn't matter so much. I ended up passing with an A Grade.

Great.  Based on my experience, it does help to have English as a buffer language (at least for me to learn Italian).  Let me know the times you are available and we can see how far we go.  For now, I'm just recovering from a severe cold and should be practically ok next week.

			Have you already checked the prices for private German lessons? If not, you will see that you usually have to pay between 90 and 130 chf for 50 or 60 minutes. Everything under 50 chf  is not acceptable for teachers who have to live from that. So I would suggest that you think again or rather look for online lessons.

			Hi, thank you User9! A good answer is never too late  .  
I had to postpone my language course, just stuff happening, you know ...   
I must say I checked some of the small print in HBS and I didn't like some of their terms&conditions. For example once you pay for a certain course, you basically can't change your mind, postpone learning or get a refund. Not even if you get injured or seriously sick. I see they have made some changes to web pages, so the terms might have changed as well, but at that time they were pretty clear about that. I can understand their position, saying no to one student, because the class is filled up and then people just falling out. But still, it seems kind of unfair. And as you have said in a school that size if you just don't get along with a teacher or a group, you are basically stuck.   
So basically I'm back to Migros or Billingua, I hope new starting dates will come soon

			Looking for videos and games with Swiss German speak most often turns into being high German.   
Watching Peppa Pig (in High German) and many other videos, the kids love it. I found songs and stories in video, but just a static picture - doesn't really fit the purpose.   
Not trying to have the kids entirely fluent before we move from HK to CH, but want to give them a little exposure to it beforehand to ease the transition.   
Next time in CH I plan to go to local stores and see what I can find in DVDs and games, but we are looking at anything useful, whether iPad games, youtube videos or other content. Fun and entertaining is essential, so the focus is on play rather than learning.

			Hi, 
   I just wanted to come back to this to share what I've learned.    
You get up to Fr. 5000 to spend on different courses but only with certain approved education institutions. The Fr. 5000 doesn't have to be spent on one course, you can re-apply multiple times until you reach the 5000 limit.    
You can also claim up to Fr. 2300 for loss of earnings where attendence of the course has meant you have had to take time off work.   
While I have mentioned a specific vendor applying for this training above I am sure that there are multiple different ones and please don't take my earlier posts of an endorsement of them.The specific term for this monetary grant that I have come acroos is ""The collective bargaining agreement for temporary staff training"".   
With the vendor I used I had to fill out an online form which included my personal details, AHV number, nationality, residence permit along with other information.   
I have attached a scan copy of a leaflet which I was provided which explains the process in a flow chart (mods please let me know if this counts as advertising and if so I will remove it).   
I was informed the application process to seek approval could take between 2-4 weeks.         
Thanks,

			Hi there.  Having gone through this process of online tests years ago, my personal recommendation would be to go to the   end of what the tests indicate.     
I studied a bit at home before starting German classes, and got placed into too high a class.  I could not speak much, could not follow the class, had different vocabulary etc.  I gave up.  So when I came to Switzerland I deliberately started from the very beginning.  Then when I was comfortable with how the classes functioned, and my prior learning started to help, it was easy to leap a month and catch up with my ""true"" level.     
I cannot help with child care, but Migrosklubschule may have something.  I have been with them most of the way and they are flexible and responsive and I have loved the classes.  Good luck!

			After reading many texts in English I can usually spot non-native written text. It is not just about spelling or grammar, but about style. But even then I cannot write in such a style myself.   
So, if you cannot afford a professional copywriter, then my advice is: google each sentence or pieces of it, find similar sentences, and copy them without changing much.

Writing more complex texts in German is easier when you have an extensive vocabulary, but every grammatical rule that you somehow failed to integrate into the so complex mechanism of actually thinking in a foreign language is so evident (and embarrassing, depending on the circumstances).  
One thing is sure - learning German it's a lifetime process.

			Hello, 
I am looking for a German language teacher to give me private lessons. The lessons would be weekly, for one hour over lunchtime, at my office in Zollikerberg. 
I am quite fluent in German and use it to talk with my colleagues at work over lunchtime, in the corridoor, etc. However I in English and write my emails in English when I am dealing with job/business related issues as it is quicker and I don't make mistakes.  
I need to improve by grammar (der, die, das...) and my German in the context of business. My objective is ultimately to do everything in German at work: write emails, deliver presentations... 
I have seen the rates of language schools in Zurich and I find them excessive so am looking for more competitive pricing. 
Does anyone have someone they can recommend?

			I am just coming to the end of the semi-intensive A1.1 course at Flying Teachers and thought it was quite good. I had next to no German before starting and can now hold basic conversations, which is exactly what the course prescribed. The only thing I really didn't like about it was the length of the classes - they're 2.5 hours long, which was a little tough after a full day of work and then commute from Basel to Zurich. I think I would have gotten a lot more out of them if the course had been conducted over a slightly longer period with, say, 1 or 1.5 hour classes (like the Migros Clubschule lessons for example).      
I think if you don't have to go from work then this wouldn't be a problem but I will be using a different school for A1.2 just for the shorter lessons.

The OP was awarded 90% for speaking ability at B1 level, which means their grammar is pretty solid. It's inconceivable that the written part was so bad that they didn't get a single point. Even if German writing is relatively poor, someone regarded as highly competent for speaking will know enough about vocabulary, word order and grammar to muddle through with a low-scoring pass.   
There's clearly another explanation. If this isn't simply an admin error, the suggestion about not using the correct answer sheet sounds fairly plausible to me.

			I can highly recommend italki - you pay through the website and have lessons over video on Skype.   
I have been having private lessons with two teachers (both from Germany, both with Masters degrees in German) over the past 6 months and they have both been great.   
The other thing I like about the website is in addition to having teachers, they also have regular people who speak the language (as native speakers) offering sessions for a lower price, which I've found really helpful to practice everyday conversation.

			Hello,     
I will be moving to Brazil few months from now and wanted to learn Portuguese as much as possible before doing so. I have never learned Portuguese in the past. I am, however, fluent in Spanish which might help a bit... I hope... 
French is my mother tongue (I am French) and English is close second. I would be happy to help in any of these 2 languages. I live in Luzern, work in Zug and go frequently to Zurich. I would, therefore, be open to practice within any of these cities. 
Please message me if interested

Mrs. Heidi Wyss is a well experienced and certified German teacher. She teaches the class in a friendly, interactive and understandable way. Fees structure are really reasonable.

			To second (third?) other comments:   
Often the admin's job is to fill in where an executive lacks local language skills.   
For instance, in an officially English speaking company you may find that top management and highly skilled employees are often recruited from the anglosphere. As these key people likely do not have German, French, Italian, etc. it becomes even more important that the admins are fluent, written and spoken, in the local and frequently used languages. Often native level fluency is a basic requirement of the job even in company where English is the official language used.   
Obviously YMMV, but if you are set on a career in admin, set your language goals realistically.   
Good luck!

			I discovered this recently and thought it's worth sharing: Hiking (or just strolling around the village) around Braunwald leads you through countless book exchange shelves full of, you know, the usual stuff that tends to reside on shelves like that (crime novels etc, but the occasional serendipitous find that is truly awesome). 99% of it is in German which is why I put this thread in the language corner.   
You're supposed to bring a book if you take one (a non-enforced rule but makes sense). Perfect if you're, for example, hesitant to buy stuff that might prove too difficult for your language skills; just bring it back and try again...   
...and oh yes I know there's libraries closer to where people tend to live. But this one gives you a reason to hike too - and you'll be reading a different book on the train back!

			Thanks for the reply.   
When I discussed with the teacher and told her I only want to go to B1+, but they put me in B1, according to them, the test I performed is not good. Though I learnt good Grammar in Goethe Institute, while it existed a bit of Grammar I haven't experienced in their test(10 page test, only grammar focused). The school strongly emphasize they are STRICT, that's why they can't accept my request to put me in B1+, though the B1+ is more for brushing up learnt key points and writing, and I have passed my B1 test. And B1+ is not a new level like B2. In a word, there is no negotiation with this school. They agree that I can redo the test, but I may have a second thought.

123	Language corner	""" zu + verbs """	Mischka	1176	3	Canada // Switzerland	07.04.2016, 07:34	"    All germanic languages have a kind of infinitive particle: 
DE: zu 
EN: to 
DK: at 
NO: å 
NL: te 
etc.   
But each language describe this differently: 
English:   is part of the infinitive form as such. 
German:   is not part of the infinitive as the ending -en (-ern/-eln) is enough to note the infinitive form as opposed to conjugated forms. This   is only one way to link two verbs in the same clause.   
This means that you just have to learn the rules when   pups up and when not in German and stop comparing.

			Very difficult as the text itself seems to contain severe inconsistencies, and that's not even counting the difficulty of it being phonetically written:   
This is on New Year, the general theme is ""New Year brings new luck"". However ""lick"", ""klick"" and ""glick"" all stand for the same ""glick"", probably even ""lek"", i.e. the german Glück;  (""En lek diss onklick weit serick              "" => ""Ein Glück dass dieses Unglück weit zurück [liegt]"").   
Same goes for ""neis"", ""neiens"" and ""neies"", all are forms of ""neues"".   
It would probably help a lot to hear it loud, spoken by an german-native from nova scotia.

Well, then I am old fashioned, because I use the adress ""Werte/r"" all the time, for me it is the perfect middle way neither being too formal and not yet too cordial, especially when you are not (yet) on first name terms with someone.   
And for a condolence/birthday or some such card I feel it is a good way to address someone.   
Also, in the end, it is the thought that counts, as I have experienced personally on a couple of sad events in my family. It is indeed  very consoling, when someone takes the time to think of you in this way, when you go through hell!

Hello   
I really enjoyed my clases. I achieved a2.2 after 5 months study. I felt encouraged to speak and use my German in each class. The teacher was really great and they allowed for us to have free tine to speak in German about things we were interested in such as current events, our culture/homeland etc. The course was only 2 hours a day with daily homework in an activity book. If you are wanting to learn faster do an all day course otherwise this is a good place to start from the beginning and ease your way into learning German.

At one end you have Spain, where J is pretty much exactly as the ch in German  . On the other end, people from countries close to the Caribbean (such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and Venezuela) do pronounce it as an H; in fact this is a quick way to distinguish someone from those latitudes, and also a quick way to mock them.    
Chile is at neither end, but I would say we pronounce J more like in Spain than like in Cuba.

At Sprachwelten, we had a very small group of 4 students, so there was a lot of personal attention and a lot of opportunity to speak - something that big schools with 20 people in one class don't have. I wish I had found it sooner - I would certainly have found it a lot easier to absorb the basic grammar.

I don't know 2 weeks intensive course. Usually 1 level takes 2 months. It's the shortest. 
If you are looking for more convenient course, you can go to Germany (Loerrach, Rheinfelden, Weil am Rhein). It's 20 min from Basel but prices are not so high both in private schools and VHS (schools for adults, where they also have intensive courses). 
You can also look for private lessons. Price in germany around 30 chf/45 min.

			Hi all,   
My girlfriend, though, is Bernese, and I am going to go visit her for the entire month of December (or from 03/12/15 to 05/01/16 specifically).    
I would like to use my month there wisely and   learning German, because I am fairly certain that I am going to relocate there sometime in the next year (and I will spend the first half of next year learning it in the USA as well).    
I was wondering if anyone could give me some recommendations; I know zero German, though I am using Memrise to start learning some basics.    
Thankfully having a swiss gf is helpful because she found a list of all the German school in Bern on the canton website (though it, ironically, is all in German), so I at least ""know"" my options.   
My problems, though, are    
1. I do not know how to seriously discriminate between the 15 or so that are listed.    
2. this month long period is an awkward amount of times because it is quite short and because of Christmas holidays; many school end their courses in the middle of December; not so convenient for me.    
3. When one knows little/no German, is it better to go to klubschule migros, for example, and have a group lesson that is cheaper, or to pay more money for a 1v1 session and potentially move through the basics much more quickly?   
4. My desire to do this was conceived recently and thus gives little time for preparation.    
Thanks for your input and I apologize for the length of this query.

This original post made me chuckle, reminding me that when I first arrived in CH (from a big city), during my first startled supermarket visits, with feeble German skills, I was subjected multiple and seemingly infinite parting salutations at the supermarket check out (just when I thought I'd made it out alive, she'd say yet another thing for me to decypher). At first it literally had me turning back to face the Verkauferin, asking ""wie bitte"", as she inevitably said just one more thing:      all in Swiss German of course 
...I have since become used to the embracing politeness of Dorf life. And that a slightly slow motion goodbye is expected and polite. This isn't the impersonal big city after all. I like it, it's home.

			Just wanted to give an update. In the end I've went with Voxea and I must say I'm super happy with them. Progressed quite a bit in A2 course and teacher really put lots of effort into it, helped and explained as much as possible. The other students were great (Foreigners with different backgrounds) and they tried to get the most out of the lessons. 
If it would be cheaper, I like to continue there, but for now I'll go for online classes.

216	Language corner	Help [writing German cover letter]	FrankSinatra	2819	36	Zurich	01.10.2015, 22:13	"    There are certain avoidable mistakes (capitalization anywhere but with nouns/beginnings of sentences, mentioning things in CV which belong in the cover letter and vice versa, misspelling of names/job descriptions) which should definitely be done perfectly. Others aren't as important - but if one hands in a cover letter which isn't at least free of grammatical/spelling errors, there are simply too many other applicants nowadays who possibly have gone through the trouble to weed out grammatical/spelling errors and thus might get a better chance at a job. The cover letter/CV is the first and sometimes only impression one can give for a job and thus score a job interview (unless you call in advance and know how to build sentences and keep up a job-related discussion in a foreign language while under stress), so one should make as good a first impression as possible.   
I believe that an applicant has enough time to convince the future boss of their abilities/will to learn when in the job interview, why risk not even getting a chance to attend a job interview if you can avoid it by writing a very good cover letter/CV?

I'm Laura - originally from Birmingham in the UK but I moved to Switzerland a year ago. I'm now based in Lausanne but I work in Bern. Although I speak high German (not amazingly, but I understand nearly everything and can just about manage to work in German) I really struggle with Swiss German.    
I'd be interested in meeting up with a native Swiss German speaker over a coffee and speaking half in German (and Swiss German where possible - but to start with this might be a bit of a boring conversation!!) and half in English.    
Just so you know what sort of person I am, I'm interested in films, reading, travelling, languages, cooking and meeting up with friends.    
I hope to hear from a new language buddy soon (or get some advice about where I might be able to find one!)

Try to establish some contacts in the field you are planning on working in and ask them to send you some representative texts so you can get an idea of the level and style commonly used. The higher the level you read at the better your vocabulary is, and reading literature from the field will help you get to grips with the terminology.

			Dear EFers, 
We are moving to Singapore. For the Singaporean residence permit, we have to translate quite a few documents from French and German into English. They requires that it should be done by a certified translator.  
Please let me know if you know some good addresses in Zurich areas. 
Many thanks

Life in the Australian Army....   
Text of a letter from a kid from Eromanga to Mum and Dad. (For Those of    you not in the know, Eromanga is a small town, west of Quilpie in the    far south west of Queensland )   
Dear Mum & Dad,   
I am well. Hope youse are too. Tell me big brothers Doug and Phil that    the Army is better than workin' on the station - tell them to get in    bloody quick smart before the jobs are all gone! I wuz a bit slow in    settling down at first, because ya don't hafta get outta bed until 6am.    But I like sleeping in now, cuz all ya gotta do before brekky is make   ya  bed and shine ya boots and clean ya uniform. No bloody horses to  get   in, no calves to feed, no troughs to clean - nothin'!! Ya haz  gotta   shower though, but its not so bad, coz there's lotsa hot water  and even a   light to see what ya doing! 
At brekky ya get cereal, fruit and eggs but there's no kangaroo steaks    or goanna stew like wot Mum makes. You don't get fed again until noon    and by that time all the city boys are buggered because we've been on a    'route march' - geez its only just like walking to the windmill in  the   bullock paddock!! 
This one will kill me brothers Doug and Phil with laughter. I keep    getting medals for shootin' - dunno why. The bullseye is as big as a    bloody dingo's arse and it don't move and it's not firing back at ya    like the Johnsons did when our big scrubber bull got into their prize    cows before the Ekka last year! All ya gotta do is make yourself    comfortable and hit the target - it's a piece of piss!! You don't even    load your own cartridges, they comes in little boxes, and ya don't have    to steady yourself against the rollbar of the roo shooting truck when    you reload! 
Sometimes ya gotta wrestle with the city boys and I gotta be real    careful coz they break easy - it's not like fighting with Doug and Phil    and Jack and Boori and Steve and Muzza all at once like we do at home    after the muster. 
Turns out I'm not a bad boxer either and it looks like I'm the best the    platoon's got, and I've only been beaten by this one bloke from the    Engineers - he's 6 foot 5 and 15 stone and three pick handles across the    shoulders and as ya know I'm only 5 foot 7 and eight stone wringin'    wet, but I fought him till the other blokes carried me off to the    boozer.   
I can't complain about the Army - tell the boys to get in quick before word gets around how bloody good it is.   
Your loving daughter,   
Susan   
--------------------------------------------------------------------   :    Dear Ma and Pa:    
   I am well. Hope yall are too. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer     the Marine Corps is easy and beats working for old man Minch by a     country mile. They really ought to join up quick before all the places     are filled. 
    I was restless at first because they make you stay in bed till     nearly 5:00 a.m., but I am getting so I like to sleepin in late. Tell     Walt and Elmer all you has to do before breakfast is smooth your cot  and    shine your boots and buckles. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch,  mash to    mix, wood to split, hay to lay practically nothing. Men gots  to  shave   but it is not so bad, theyve even got warm water. 
    Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs,     bacon, etc., but kind of weak on the pork chops, fried potatoes, salt     cured ham, steak, sausage, gravy and biscuits and other regular     breakfast foods, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by some city     boys that live on coffee and doughnuts. Their food plus yours holds    you  till noon when you get fed again. Its no wonder these city boys    cant  walk far. 
    Speakin of walkin; we go on route marches which the Platoon     Sergeant says are long walks to toughen us up. If he thinks so, its not     my place to tell him different. A route march is about as far as  to    our mailbox at home. The countryside is nice but awfully flat. We   dont   climb hills or nothin. Them city guys get sore feet and we all   get to   ride back in trucks. The Sergeant is like a school teacher. He   nags us a   lot. The Captain is like the school board. Majors and   Colonels just   ride around and frown. They dont bother you none. 
    This next part will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep     getting medals for shooting! I dont know why. The bulls-eye is purt-ear     as big as a chipmunks head and it dont move, and it aint shooting     back at you like the Higgett boys do at home. All you got to do is  lie    there all comfortable and hit it. You dont even load your own     cartridges. They come in boxes. 
    Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training. You get     to wrestle with them city boys. I have to be real careful though, they     break real easy. It aint like fighting with that ole bull at home.  Im    about the best they got in this except for that guy Jordan from  over  in   Silver Lake. I only beat him once. He joined up the same time  as  me,  but  Im only 56″ and 130 pounds, and hes 68″ and weighs  near  300  pounds  dry. 
    Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers get onto this setup and come stampeding in.  
 Your loving daughter, 
 Gail

Brief eines Bundeswehrrekruten an die Eltern:   
Liebe Mutter, lieber Vater, 
mir gehts gut. Ich hoffe, Euch, Annemarie, Klaus, Karl, Willi, Sigrid,    Peter und Hans auch. Sagt Karl und Willi, dass Beim-Heer-sein jede    Landarbeit um Längen schlägt. Sie sollen sich schnell verpflichten,    bevor alle Plätze voll sind. 
Zuerst war ich sehr unruhig, weil man bis fast bis um 6 Uhr im Bett    bleiben muss, aber nun gefällt mir das mit dem Lange-Ausschlafen. Sagt    Karl und Willi, man muss nur sein Bett richten und ein paar Sachen vor    dem Frühstück polieren. 
Keine Tiere füttern, kein Feuer machen, keinen Stall sauber machen oder    Holz hacken... praktisch gar nichts. Die Männer müssen sich rasieren,    aber das ist nicht so schlimm, es gibt nämlich warmes Wasser. 
Das Frühstück ist ein bisschen komisch, mit jeder Menge Saft, Getreide,    Eier, aber dafür fehlt völlig Kartoffeln, Schinken, Steaks und das    andere normale Zeug, aber sagt Karl und Willi, man kann immer neben    irgendwelchen Städtern sitzen, die nur Kaffee trinken und das Essen von    denen mit deinem eigenen hält dann bis zum Mittag, wenn es wieder was    zuessen gibt. 
Es wundert mich nicht, dass die Jungs aus der Stadt nicht weit laufen können. 
Wir gehen viel auf ""Überlandmärsche"", von denen der Vizeleutnant sagt,    dass langes Laufen gut ist für die Abhärtung. Naja, wenn er das glaubt,    als Rekrut kann ich da nichts dagegen sagen. 
Ein ""Überlandmarsch"" ist ungefähr so weit wie bei uns zum Postamt, aber    wenn wir da sind, haben die Städter wunde Füße und wir fahren alle in    LKWs zurück. 
Die Landschaft hier im Burgenland ist schön, aber fast ganz flach. Der    Vizeleutnant ist wie unser Lehrer. Er nörgelt immer. Der Hauptmann ist    wie der Bürgermeister. 
Majore und Oberste fahren viel in Autos und gucken komisch, aber sie lassen einen völlig in Ruhe. 
Und jetzt das Beste. Das wird Karl und Willi umbringen vor Lachen: 
Ich kriege Auszeichnungen für`s Schießen! Ich weiß nicht warum. Das    Schwarze ist viel größer als ein Rattenkopf und bewegt sich nicht mal    und es schießt auch nicht zurück, wie die Laubrunner Brüder mit dem    Luftgewehr. 
Alles was du machen musst ist, dich bequem hinlegen und es treffen. 
Man muss nicht mal seine eigenen Patronen machen. Sie haben sie schon fertig in Kisten. 
Dann gibt's noch ""Nahkampfausbildung"". Du kannst mit den Städtern    ringen. Aber ich muss sehr vorsichtig sein, die gehen leicht kaputt. 
Ist viel leichter als den Stier zu bändigen. Ich bin am besten darin,    außer gegen den Voller Sepp, der hat genau am gleichen Tag angefangen    wie ich, aber ich hab nur einmal gegen ihn gewonnen. 
Das wird daran liegen, dass ich mit meinen 65 Kilo nur 1,70 m bin und er mit seinen 2 Metern und 120 Kilos ist halt schwieriger. 
Vergesst nicht Karl und Willi schnell Bescheid zu sagen, bevor andere mitkriegen, wie das hier läuft und uns die Bude einrennen. 
Alles Liebe, 
Eure Tochter Maria

			Hi, I just arrived here in Basel, as a visiting PhD student. I am looking for someone who is interested in Chinese language and culture. As return, you can share your ideas about Switzerland or Germany, and help to improve my German ability.   
I've spent one year in Germany, but for an English program, so my German is just not good (B1). Now I want to improve it. If you feel interested, please contact me (yliueagle@googlemail.com)   
Looking forward~

			I'm trying very hard to learn Swiss German, but currently what I speak sounds more like bad Hochdeutsch with a Swiss accent and some Swiss words thrown in and some lapses back to Norwegian when I get out of my comfort zone grammar and vocabulary wise.   
I remember when I moved to Norway in the late 90s. Foreigners were easily identified by their lack of dialect as they learned ""normative"" Norwegian at ""immigrant school"". Didn't really help integration. I learned Norwegian while living in a Norwegian family and going to school and thus went right to the local dialect. It really helped me ""blend in"" and feel at home where I lived, and even if people could hear that I was a foreignerm they usually commented positively on my use of dialect. Now mostly people from the place where I picked up my dialect can hear that I'm not from there, and even they don't alway get that I'm a foreigner.    
In an ideal world, I would both speak and write Hochdeutsch and speak Swiss German fluently. For now, my immediate goal is to speak passable Swiss German, write understandable High German and understand both more or less fluently.

I have completed German A1 level with Goethe Institute. Currently, I am looking for super intensive class for A2 and then B1 level. Ideally, I would like to study from Monday - Friday, 3-4 hours/session.  
I base in St. Moritz where there are not much option for language school.  
If language school is not an option, I am open to group tutor as well.    
Thanks in advance for your advise.

			Hi there!   
Thanks for answering! I actually started A2 course in migros and did already 2/3 of A2 level. It would be great to join when  you guys get there! I had two teachers in migros klubschule and I liked  them both. However, I didn't like the teachers who came for replacement when our teachers went for holidays. 
Anyways, it was more about the people in the office - they were very  rude. During level A1 my class was quite big, but people started to  quit. In the middle of A2 there was only few of us left and finally they  decided not to prolong the course. Maybe after holidays I will take a  look again at klubschule and join last part of A2 if I don't find  anything else...   
Thanks again and take care!

My dearest one costs me £18 an hour,  both tutors I have are really easy to talk to and the time flies!  My mistakes aren't pointed out whilst I am speaking so train of thought isn't lost and the mistakes are added to the chat bit so you can see later on where you went wrong.  You can choose what you want to talk about or what grammar points you need help with.  I think this works out better than a class situation.    "		 Jun 0001		[]	[]

But do I understand you correctly that you are planning on resuming nursing studies? Did you begin and have to leave off? Or do you have a degree and are adding to that?

			While High German may be considered a standardized language, word usage can vary by region. For some fun, you might wish to look at ""Atlas zur deutschen Alltagssprache"".    
For example, the German word for dialect can be Mundart, Dialekt or Platt:

			High German (better: Standardsprache, Standarddeutsch) is an artificial language for all German speakers. It was put together of all the dialects spoken to create a written language common to the German speakers of Belgien, Elsass, Luxemburg, Liechtenstein, Südtirol, Lothringen, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. High German allows many local variants. It is like britified, aussified, scottified, eirefied and 'mericafied English as the thread opener so aptly put it :-)    
So die Butter and der Butter are both correct as der Tunnel and das Tunnel, Finken and Pantoffeln, Patschen and Hausschuhe are all perfectly good Standardsprache and can be used by any German speaker if he likes it. But Finken will be used mainly by the Swiss, Patschen by the Austrians, Hausschuhe and Pantoffeln mostly by the Germans. Trottoir and Gehsteig and Bürgersteig are all perfectly good Standarddeutsch and so on. 
Just because a German speaker from the northern shores thinks Trottoir for Bürgersteig is weird, it is nonetheless absolutely correct. As I once tried to find Rahm in a Hildesheim Supermarket, nobody knew what I meant and I tried to explain and then they found out...oh, you mean Schlagsahne! I certainly knew the word, but I normally use the more southern German Rahm which they don't use up there and it just didn't come to my mind at that moment, it was very funny after all!  There is no lesser or better German, there are just many valid variants.    
Dialects are something else alltogether, because they are oral and only written in informal situations. Sometimes this becomes kinda quirky: My niece speaks the same dialect as my sister and I at home. But when she writes me a text- message, she writes it in the local dialect; the dialect she speaks with her friends (Bündnerland). Just love it.

			Hi    
I've been meaning to post something about my experiences with passing the C2 exam for a while, so this is a good prompt.  My language journey is maybe a bit unusual, I brushed up an old German GCSE before I moved to Switzerland and managed to pass the B1 course before I made the move but once here I didn't have a strong desire to do a further course for about another 6 years! What prompted me to study further was a realization that when I had stagnated a bit and was making the same old mistakes.  I was also weighing up some further education (retraining as a teacher) and that also required the C2.  In the end I decided to plump for a private lesson (1.5hours per week at Sprachwelten in Zurich) and it took about 12 months before I felt ready to have a stab at the exam.  As with all language exams it's pretty formulaic so you really need to have the exam technique nailed, particularly as certain parts of the exam are pretty tight time wise.  You also really need to have the broad range of vocab and doing a course forces you to think about using alternative adjectives and phrases (rather than your stock ones).   
So what has the C2 brought me?  I think it's been a bit of a confidence boost to be honest because it was challenging and I managed to come through it.  It has also been a platform to explore new career opportunities (as I'd been working primarily in English).  Ultimately, having the goal of the exam also helped focus my learning on areas of weakness (for mewritten German and Grammar).    
Anyway best of luck if you do decide to go for it.

			For the days I completely agree with your interpretation as this is what I would use.   
For the months however I use 'this' for months in the current year ( irrespective of if it's in the past or the future) and 'last' or 'next' for the previous or following years.   
For example I would say 'this February' for February 2015 and 'last February' for February 2014 and 'next February' for February 2016. 
The same would apply for August so 'this August' would be August 2015 and next August would be 2016.

			I am the first to say that anecdotal, non-scientific evidence has limited value. But I have a certain amount of experience and observation and have lived in many countries, usually among Americans, and we sent all our children to local French schools at least to age 12. They all speak French, one is married to a French man. The children of the others all go to French lycées or (in 1 case) a French nursery school. I speak only French to him, others speak mostly English to him; he doesn't speak at all yet (he's not yet 2) except for a few words, arbitrarily one language or the other: un, deux, shoe, car. (FWIW all the grandchildren other than the French ones are Swiss citizens, so their parents agree that they ought to speak at least 1 Swiss language. Especially my son who went to college with a Danish guy who spoke no Danish, only German, because his German mother divorced his Danish father when he was a toddler and both Denmark and Germany bar or limit dual nationality.)   
I knew parents who sent their children to French schools and, one year later, despaired that they were learning nothing and took them out of the French system. Big mistake. Our kids started speaking French almost the first day of their second year of primary school, not before.   
Ne vous en faites pas : votre enfant sait plus que vous ne le pensez.    
There are books and books written on this. I started a thread the other day because I am interested -- out of curiosity not necessity -- in the learning of sign languages ( Swiss SL is based on the French system, as is ASL; British SL and German SL are different. Swiss German is close to Swiss French ). Anyway my point is that languages are easily learned before puberty, but not afterwards unless you have special aptitude. And while they are best learned beginning at age 0, anything before 5 is fine.    
Many years ago my daughter was in a class in Ecolint, French Section, Geneva. One of her classmates was a Down child with a high level of ability. He spoke 3 languages.    
Those are all anecdotes and should be read as such. I ask only that you take with some cynicism those who say that one should first be grounded in a single language before learning others. Whole generations of deaf children who were refused ASL because of the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (Milan Conference of 1880) where that view was established, were cheated: many never learned any language at all.    
Look around you in Switzerland: I had a Swiss ancestor who, on stage, told jokes in six languages. In the 1920s Iowa and Nebraska tried to make it illegal to teach a foreign language to a child. Happily the Supreme Court threw that one out: Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U.S. 404 (1923). (Gov. Ma Ferguson is reputed to have said ""If the King's English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it's good enough for the children of Texas!"" She didn't of course, but you get the point.   )   
Good luck. Hope that helps.

			Hello.   
I've been pointed by others I asked (outside this forum) to Web sites that more or less answer the question. There are 10,000 deaf signers in all of Switzerland, 5,500 using Swiss-German, 1,700 Swiss-French, 300 Swiss-Italian and the others can be presumed to be using ASL.        
But: Wikipedia says ""In 2011 it was estimated that 7,500 deaf and 13,000 hearing people use DSGS.""   
There are also hearing-capable signers, some of whom will be trained as interpreters. Wikipedia suggests they number 13,000 in all of Switzerland.   
A general study for the Council of Europe is here and is widely quoted and distributed on the Internet:     
Wikipedia's English-language page on German Sign Language says: ""It (GSL) is not related to Austrian Sign Language, which is used in parts of southern Germany, nor to Swiss Sign Language, both of which are part of the French Sign Language family, though they have had some influence from German Sign Language.""   
Thanks to anyone who gave thought to my question. For the rest I shall have to get in touch with professionals in the field. I find it interesting that Swiss-German SL is distinct from the signing used in Germany, and that even in Germany there are distinct variants.

			To preface, I'm an adult ESL teacher with 5 years experience. At my last job especially, my school really focused on making sure students practice all their language schools and balanced listening/speaking/writing/reading. Also, we made sure the was grammar, vocab, and phonics involved in every lesson. I have high expectations.   
Here in Switzerland, it seems like they're still teaching language the mid-20th century way. Teacher talks at you for 2 hours and you do gap fills to practice grammar and study vocab out of a book.   I've tried Allemania and talking to the other students it seems that Migroschule and Flying Teachers are the same.   
Any tips greatly appreciated!

			Wow, I have been researching a lot about language schools for my Deutsch Kurse. 
Thing is, I always end up concentrating myself on knowing better EB and Migros Klub Schule.  
Both of them, I heard really good things.... 
I had a bad experience with EB, when I finally decided, they just wouldn't answer my emails properly. They said they had spot only on may. I asked them about other days course or the intensiv, I never got an answer!  
Well, in the other hand I found another one here in Uster (where I live) - the name is Audio Vis. They are in other cities as well.  
They are not the cheaper one, but they have small classes, and I went there yesterday and seems pretty nice...some people from other cities come here to they're classes and well...I think it might be better than Migros.  
It is a little bit more expenseive...but in the other hand, I don't have to pay for transportation...I can go by bike... ! And they have a summer break program...so they won't stop on march, may...    
What do you think about that? Or schould I just go to Migros Klub Schule?   "	67	 Jan 2015	2.0	['1', '1']	['46', '13']	0

			Full immersion is the only way to rapidly improve your French but honestly it takes years to get to a good level unless you are super smart. I would also recommend private lessons on the side for structured learning. French is a very structured language and you need to learn about grammar in order to make decent sentences.  Bonne chance.

Then in May when we're probably back in CH, take German classes in a standard course that's offered...

			I think reading is one of the best things she can do, and Antolin is great as it gives both of you a good idea of how much she is understanding. When you enter the name of a book it tells you the grade level but I wouldn't worry about that too much. I think any reading is good reading at this stage. We used Antolin a lot when my daughter was in the 2nd class (she's now in the 4th) and it really helped to build her confidence.   
You could also try the Lük and Minilük puzzle as well ( )   
You can buy the actual puzzle device and also do it as an app, I think. There are lots of different puzzle books covering all aspects of German language as well as maths etc, and you should be able to find one specifically for the cases or that at least includes it. It can be expensive but try second-hand, too, such as Ricardo. My daughter's class also used this quite often in the 2nd class, I think, so ask your daughter's teacher if she can find some for you.   
Otherwise, my daughter's teacher gave her a book to help her understand the different articles, and therefore by default the different cases, too. It was from the Kantonaler Lehrmittelverlag St Gallen ( ) so that might be useful, too.   
There's also a Zürich one ( ) and my daughter has used this online for maths, and I'm assuming it might have some good language stuff as well.   
You could also try something like Duolingo:   and I'm sure there must be lots of other apps out there.   
Good luck!

The price is 1590 for the full 6 months.

			Hey Dan,   
I moved to Lugano 3 months ago from London. I have studied at the ILI school near the station for the last 2 months and was really unimpressed so I am also looking to change! As you have found out it is REALLY difficult online.    
I have been recommended the Migros language school in the centre but I am yet to try it out.   
What I would say about ILI is they only seem to care about the money you are paying. They gave me my start date and put me in a class much, much higher than my level (which they tested when I started!). When i complained they argued back that this was my level - trust me it wasn't. I can speak a little and understand practically nothing and this was a class that had been studying for 5 months full time! It was a constant struggle and when I was finally put in my correct level the class was 14 when they promise a maximum of 10. Half the people don't pay as it is where they send the unemployed so you end up being with people who don't care, try and waste alot of time.   
For an intensive course you will be looking at around 1000 - 1200 francs a month which (I think) is around 700 - 800 pounds. This doesn't include accomodation or anything but I do know some of the schools do this.   
I will try and keep you posted on what I find out as hopefully it will be easier for me being here.   
GOOD LUCK!!!

Gasmask. The first syllable is usually pronounced with a short ""a"", but seldom, if ever, as ""ar"". The second syllable may be short ""a"" or ""ar"". The educated southern English pronunciation would be:

			It seems to me that in spoken French most people don't care. It's certainly classy to get it right, but it's not a disaster to use the indicative. Similarly, as someone mentioned, saying ""je sais pas"" without the ""ne"" is very frequent and not a big mistake, but it is not classy - I never do it  .   
I read an email this week which included ""il faut que j'est..."". Oh dear, it should be the subjunctive of avoir : ""aies"" (or is it ""aie""? wtf). The (French) writer knew that the subjunctive was needed, but didn't know how to spell it... Moral of the story: Foreigner learners - don't sweat what doesn't really matter!

Yes, the pet words and idioms are horribly difficult and can vary wildly from village to village, but that is true for every language.

At ENAIP the B livel is splitted in 3, each of it last 5 weeks or at least it was that way some months ago. I've checked now and i think that they reduced it to 4 weeks and it is even cheaper.  
Here is the link to ENAIP in case that you need it.    
In my opinion EB Zürich is much better.       Here is the link to ENAIP, they dont have C1 courses       
EB Does,   
Cheers,

			Hey Guys,   
I am living in Basel and currently do not have a job yet, because I am still learning German. Since I don't have a job then I try to minimize my expenses, e.g. I am learning German in Loerrach, where the language school is much cheaper than in Basel.   
Now I am interested to learn French, I have learned French about 4 years ago and have an A2 DELF Certification, but it's been a while and I really have to brush up a little bit and maybe do it from A1 again.   
Is there any French Language schools in the France near Basel, something like Saint Loius, if there is I am sure it is definitely cheaper than in CH.   
Thank you guys

			Hi iboocheeky,   
If you have a smartphone, the easiest thing is to use the CFF or TL apps . Just insert the address (Rue de Geneve 60) and it'll tell you how to get there. The thing is, if you use the exact address it might not find very frequent combinations.   
Another strategy is to go to one of the main stops close by like Flon, Chauderon, or Vigie. These all have more frequent combinations and you can just walk from there.   
In your case, I think 66 stops at St Francois, right? If so, from St Francois you can just take bus 17 until stop recordon or boston (I'm not sure which stop is closest) and walk 5 min.   
Hope this helps,

			A surprisingly accurate explanation! Are you a linguist? I especially liked these two sentences because they are best describing what it is about with our language:      There is a little objection, however: Instead of saying Swiss German, you should use the lingustically correct expression Alemannic. That's the language spoken in the (French) Alsace, in Baden-Württemberg, some regions of Bavaria (Germany), Vorarlberg (Austria), in the Southern part of Liechtenstein - and Switzerland. Using this expression would avoid plenty of misunderstandings. But I know, the Swiss will come up soon and oppose. They think Alemannic is only spoken in (Southern) Germany - and no Swiss wants to be confused with a German. Another old story...

			Hi,   
I am looking for someone to who can provide private one-to-one German lessons. I studied A1 a couple of years ago at Bilingua and can read to a better standard having picked up things just by being here. However, I never write in German and my spoken German is very basic. I do not want to return to evening classes as I will miss too many through travel. Therefore flexibility of timing is important for me. Ideally I would like to have two one hour lessons per week if we can find the time. I would be able to do lessons during the day time (if you could come to my work - located near Hardbrücke) and evenings / weekends.   
In addition, my girlfriend is also looking for private lessons. Her level is much greater than mine, hence we would not want to do lessons together. In addition, we have recently had a baby so she would be looking for someone willing to come to our flat (also near Hardbrücke).   
Please let me know if you can help   
Thanks

  I found this site very nice for people trying to learn Swiss German or specifically Bern German, you might need some assistance from a work colleague or a partner for pronunciation as well for differentiating between similar expressions, but overall I see it as a good start -

Unless you manage that risk, of course. The answer to the question on the form, if you are self-employed, is a big fat ""yes"" because if your clients don't pay, you don't get paid.

My native language in English. And I live in Bern. 
We can meet or do skype sessions twice or three times a week. 
Thanks!

			Hi,     
I am considering starting a A1 Japanese course at Klubschule Migros in Bern next week ( ). However, I find the pricing of the learning material (188 CHF, or 25% of the whole cost) extremely high. Can someone (preferrably having done a A1 course with Klubschule and this book / CD / other material) confirm whether that price appears justified?     
Also, would you have the reference of the material used, so that I can see whether I can find it second hand (I'll also check with Migros KS directly, but they probably will want to sell me the course and book at full price before I can have a look at it)?     
Thanks

It is probably a very long shot, but I am looking for people interested in learning ... Polish language:-)    
At the moment my husband is finishing his A0/A1 course at Allegra school in Zurich and they are missing 1 more person to continue the course in autumn.  
The classes take place once a week after work (6:30 at the moment, 7:00 pm could be an option too).    
Is there anyone with basic knowledge of Polish here, who is interested in joining the course? :-)  
It won't be too advanced of course, but some basic knowledge is required.

			Hello all,   
Thought I would share a website with all which lists out all the facilities in Baden for German language learning...       
A few comments on whats on the list:     - heavily depends on the teacher you get stuck with... (therefore a lot of mixed reviews from this institute      - slightly cheaper option but again... right from the very start the tutor may only speak German. So if you don't know a word of German... better get starting practice from elsewhere and then go here.       - Good place to    because at the beginning they are slow, take their time and get repetitive in teaching you... so it may seems dragged out if are comfortable with A1-A2. However if you just want to learn conversational German (skip the professional certificates and grammar) I would highly recommend -  A friend managed to cover got from A1 to B2 in 2 years.      - personally I don't know many that have been here.. so if anyone has had any experience with these institutes feel free to share .. i would really like to know their reviews.

			I was in your situation when I first came here so can comment from that perspective and also teach English so can comment from a teacher perspective. I signed up for private lessons as I needed the flexibility to have the lessons when I was here so I didn't miss any steps in the learning. 10 lessons were around 900chf and this would last me for between 20 and 30 weeks as I couldn't always go every week. My progress was slow but there was progress over the couple of years I had that set up.    
If you join a class and then can't go to some if the classes the teacher won't spend the time getting you up to speed as it wastes time for everyone that was at all the classes. You then end up with gaps of what has been covered and have to guess the in between info. It's also a waste of money.    
The language school where I teach has an online course called E-Learning through Rosetta Stone. It's not perfect but can be ok for people who are prepared to get on with it themselves and don't need a teacher spelling it out the whole time. It's also less expensive.    
I don't rate duolingo as anything other than a fun app. It has a lot of mistakes in terms of the meanings from German to English as doesn't provide any explanations. I suggest it to my students as a fun way of practicing in their free time but not as their only learning method.

I must admit that you might remember Züridüütsch with less High-German ""infuse"" than the usual talk one hears in real life. But it's more a question of life style: Modern life is linguistically expressed in High-German adapted to dialect grammar and phonetics. The farther one is from modern life style, the more distant from Züridüütsch a given dialect seems to be. It's just due to what one talks about, not the dialect in itself.

I studied to end of A2 with Allegra in Zurich but haven't been able to commit to more classes as I travel a lot and am away usually at least 1 week every month.

A friend suggested these guys and so I gave them a try and so far I am impressed. They are under 100Euro for 5 x 1 hour lessons. You pay by credit card online and can chooses your lesson times. They seem to be quite flexible in that you can switch teachers easily if you aren't happy and as long as you cancel in advance you don't loose the lessons.  
I have just signed up for 10 lessons and will take it from there. I am concentrating on conversation German, and they are going to email me a text that we will discuss in the lesson,  but you can also work from text books and towards tests.       "	216	 Jun 2014	3.0	['0', '0']	['183', '95']	1

			Don't want to rain on your parade, but I wonder if your employers have been abiding by the non-EU hiring rules.  If you applied and got a job in less than 10 days, then I very much doubt that your employer went through the process to prove to the Swiss authorities that they couldn't find a Swiss, EU national or someone else already living here with a valid work permit to do that job.  If they did, then that's an amazing turnaround time because this usually takes months.     
This is what they should have done:

We regularly go to Bristol with Swiss students. I personally love it there. In terms of which is better for learning the language: doesn't matter. What matters is the quality of the school and whether you travel with other Swiss students (which means you'll speak more German than English). Another factor is where you stay: you wont speak much English if you stay in a hotel room but will profit much more in a his family.

			I'm in a perennial state of trying to learn German -- not with great success, admittedly. I like podcasts, and thought I'd drop in to mention the most recent one I've found that seems particularly useful. I have no relationship of any sort with these people, apart from being a subscriber.   
It's called Dazpod ( ). There is a free version that gives you a weekly podcast featuring a brief sketch, followed by some explanation. Typically, an episode lasts 15-20 minutes. All of this is in German, so note that the standard is not for complete beginners. They divide the material into Beginners and Intermediate level, but in reality you need to be at least A2.    
You can also upgrade to a paid version for 3 euros a month. For this, you get the podcasts plus a full transcript of each episode. Personally, I find this essential to enable me to look up words. But the cost is very low, so no complaints.   
What i like most about this one is the professionalism of the material. The couple acting out the sketches sound like pro actors, or certainly experienced teachers. And there is also a lot of humour and insights into German culture. I repeat - the material consists mainly of little playlets, which may not satisfy everyone. There are no long explanations about the finer points of grammar. It focuses on increasing vocabulary, understanding usage, and above all, listening practice.   
My only minor grumble so far is that there is no comprehensive   provided, so it means a lot of looking up. But for 3 euros, you can't have it all.   
Well worth a try.

			if you are going into Finance, learn French.  yes, the German-speaking part of Switzerland has a banking sector, but it is inbred, strongly caters to local hires and is much more private-banking as opposed to pure finance focused.  and the finance markets in Germany and Austria (where your German would also help) are not particularly attractive, and will pay far less than elsewhere in Europe.   
with French, you will have the financial markets in the French-speaking part of Switzerland open to you, as well as the finance markets in France (Paris) and Luxembourg (which also trends toward private banking but is much stronger in private equity and other pure finance markets).   
lastly, the French language instruction at a US university will be tenfold better than the German language instruction.       
P.S. in the interest of full disclosure, I learned German and Swiss German, but I'm a lawyer and the legal markets are completely different than the finance markets.  in my experience, lawyers and engineers in central Europe speak German, and people in finance (again, leaving aside private banking) speak French.

577	Language corner	When to get a german speaking aupaire?	gvanrenterghem	881	10	Zurich	02.07.2014, 09:46	" 
			
			This just won't work because of the language + cultural requirements- eg an Au Pair goes to a country to be immersed in the local language, culture, etc, and follow a language course. Also they cannot have sole charge of young children- and can't work for more than 30 hrs, 50% of which with one of the parents present (part of the immersion requirement and for safety reasons).   
An Au Pair cannot be employed to teach her own language to the children - as that would totally defeat the object. When we employed Au Pairs in the UK, we had to speak English only at home (even though 2 of the Au Pairs were from French speaking Switzerland, like me).

It is direct on the train from here, and a gorgeous city. It is not hard to find accommodation, as there are either hostels, or you check out the university notice boards for sub-leases as it is summer holidays.    
They also have activities organised daily in the afternoons.

			I'm a Duolingo fan for sure.  I use both the app on my iPad and the website on my PC. They are slightly different.  When I'm doing a new lesson I try to use the computer because it offers more explanation, conjugations, discussion with other people, etc. I tend to use my app more for strengthening skills and challenging others to a competition for speed practice. I also like it because when you go back and strengthen skills they are usually more difficult than they originally were, incorporating new words or grammatical problems.    
I've been using it since January and I can tell a huge difference in my ability!   
For beginners, I really liked Michael Thomas's 8 hour program. Within a few days I felt comfortable enough to at least open my mouth and try to speak the language.  He also explained relationships among words and sounds that has really helped. (Unfortunately, not a free app.)   
I also have iLang, Lingo Arcade and Kleine Grammatik apps for very basic vocabulary and really great charts.    
Finally, my husband has been reading stuff on FB from ""German Language Learners (Wir lernen Deutsch)"" and I'm going to start looking at that also.

it is the ""TCF"" = test de connaissance de français   
This one is cheaper, and you can not fail, because it's more like an evaluation test. However, it is just a comprehension test. 
You are given grammar, reading and listening score.   
E.G. you might be C1 in reading, but, say, B2 in listening.

			Hello,     
I am an English trainer that has experience with telephone and Skype for training professionals and I would say that it is effective.  You can get immediate corrections if the teacher is alert and written corrections as well.  You can view each others pdf files and send links.  It is actually a bit more demanding orally as you are forced to speak the whole time.  If you were looking for a teacher to explain and other classmates to listen to than this may not be the route for you.  Most of the people I have talked to really do enjoy it but there are pros and cons.  At this moment, I am learning French this way and I am enjoying it but I knew what I was looking for and have a great teacher.  Normally, this is a cheaper option as there are fewer expenses.

			I learned both, more or less at the same time although the opportunities for speaking Swiss German in Zürich far exceeded the opportunities for speaking German.  an A2 to B1 level understanding of standard German was very, very helpful for me in navigating Swiss German, but you can always learn the basics of both at the same time.  learning both meant that my standard German suffered (and still suffers, especially when speaking), which is a downside when trying to speak German outside of Switzerland or with German friends and colleagues.   
I have never had anyone switch to English when I speak dialect with them (Germans simply respond in German), when I try in standard German it is more of a mix.  I have also never had anyone react with anything other than surprise and a smile at my learning and speaking dialect, other than German friends and colleagues who cannot imagine why I would bother.   
good luck whichever path you choose, German is a harsh mistress but learning the language can also be fun.      "	642	 Nov 2013	5.0	['7', '7']	['1', '002', '384']	6

			One should not be too hard on talkative cashiers, as to some, the chit-chat may be an attempt, as clumsy and untimely as it may be, to socially and romantically connect with their peers. While certainly less noble and conducive to chance encounters leading to an exchange of phone numbers than waiting at a trendy café or restaurant, cashiers do get to briefly ""meet"" a lot of people in a day. To them, those brief but real encounters at the till might bring much needed comfort after continuously experiencing dismal failures on dating sites.

			Are you taking classes, and where? What level? And what sort of work are you looking for? Not easy and I sympathise, but in many ways your wife is right- the sooner you crack the language, the sooner you will be able to get out of this rut you sadly got yourself stuck in.   
Hope you do find the light at the end of this horrible Tunnel. Summer is on its way and it will be much easier- walking along the beach, sitting out in Cafés. What do you enjoy doing? Have you been out to discover some of the wonderful sights around Colombier, both by the lake, in town (s) and the mountains nearby? I know the rubbish weather these last few days are not helping- but Summer is defo on the way- s don't despair, honest.   
miniMia- yes a shame that so many teachers still have that mentality of teaching stuff which even educated natives would not have a clue about - not just in Switzerland either- very much the French way too, perhaps more so as this is the way teachers are trained and promoted (eg on sophisticated Grammar and Literature and not on the ability to communicate or teach). Although at C1 level, it does make sense to begin to tackle more complicated structures- as long as it is not 'just to trip people up' but to genuinely increase their communicative level. More appropriate at C2 imho. But it is totally inappropriate with beginners and intermediates- where a much better skill is to learn how to avoid difficulties but swapping to another way of saying things- or just learning difficult structures for passive understanding rather than active use. (for instance avoiding the Passé Simple- and using perfect tense + imperfect/ or avoiding structures with the subjunctive, like -je dois aller, instead of - il faut que j'aille, etc).

			Hi. I'm recently thinking of taking the DELF exam, but I'm not sure if it is worth doing.   
I currently work in an English speaking company. But in the future I want to widen my career possibilities in French speaking companies too as I mainly live in the Suisse romande part and most jobs require French.   
I use French every day in my life (my partner, all the family-in-law, most friends only speak French), but I've never used it in a working/profession environment. I studied several sample test materials and I feel that I can take the B2 level (without special preparation), or the C1 level (after some preparation and familiarization with the test).   
My question: is the DELF test really worth taking? How much importance the future employer will put on it? I mean, if it is a French speaking company they can judge your French skill well during the interview. Right? Or does putting DELF diploma in the CV will simply increase the chance of being shortlisted and interviewed?   
Someone has some experience?

I think the same publisher has a book called ""hoi"" for learning swiss german too, (mostly based on zuri deutsch).

			Naturally, you can learn 2 languages simultaneously. Think about the children of parents of different mother tongues. Learning becomes more challenging as we become older, so be prepared for language interference in your learning. You say you are bored with German; finding ways to maintain motivation in any learning, will increase chances of success. Maybe you can find a study buddy?

Considering you opened such a thread as your first post, doesn't give you any credit whatsoever as to your intentions or otherwise.     
You want a helpful post, then here's one:   
When you allow trust to disintegrate to a point you search for confirmation, you only ever make things harder on yourself.   
It's not important what the text says, what is important is that trust has been broken and you are looking for some sort of 'confirmation' for what you already assume.   
You are only feeding your insecurity by trying to find evidence that you are right. Feeding this insecurity only makes you feel more shit..... and when you DO find the evidence - then you feel even more shit.   
So why punish yourself?   
What you should do is confront the person directly about this, particularly if you haven't ""snooped"" through a phone and someone has read this to you.   
If you don't trust the person after you have dealt with the person, then WTF are you doing with them?   
My advice,  
let the message go and deal with it face to face.

720	Language corner	German teacher for absolute beginners in Zurich!	louise13	765	0	Zurich	27.01.2014, 13:28	" 
			
			Hello!    
My boyfriend and I have been in Zurich several months now but working full-time and long hours mean that we are finding it VERY difficult to get to grips with our basic German. He is more advanced than I am, but that's not hard to beat as I can barely count to ten... 
We're after help with general pronounciation of the language and a start to basic German converstaion. New vocab we can learn in our own time once we know the correct way to go about pronouncing words correctly and constructing sentences!  
Is there anyone who may be able to help? We are looking for perhaps 60/90 minute tutorials on Saturdays or Sundays - we can be flexible with the time of day I would say.  
Thanks for reading...here is my email address if anyone would like to message me:<removed>

- they email back formally but with Best/Kind regards at the end 
- I email in the same way 
- they reply with ""Dear FirstName/Best regards"" or ""Kind regards""   
This has happened 3-4 times so far, so I'm now assuming this is the standard once a few emails have been exchanged. I wonder if it's the same when emailing in German.   
In the UK, I started the same but the greetings quickly turned into ""Hello FirstName"" with ""Best regards"" or ""Kind regards"" at the end.

Of course, there are many more factors that affect pricing such as client's ability to pay, which is likely to come into play in academia - but there is a balance between the two. Undercharging in any field ultimately does nobody any good because it stops money moving around the economy.

I would like to pick up the pace with my German (high) and this would be ideal if someone wants a native English speaker to exchange with on an informal basis.    
I am A1 level and need more practise. It would ideally be at lunch time during the week, not a specific day or time every week, but generally once a week on a mutually convenient day.    
I work in finance so this might also appeal to business people if you are at a high level in English.   
kind regards

Get any standard test practise book from a book store. They have like series of 5-10 tests with all the section. I can remember Hueber as a good publication. I am considering that you are already at the level and just want to practise and pass the exam.

Most people involved in recruitment will recognise this problem. If I'm looking for someone to fill that sales or techie role (or whatever), I want to know if this person will help me and the company do the job.

as resident of 3 nations border, Im stuck with the fact that, to be in the job competition, I have to know ((at least ) 3 foreign popular languages beside my own... Those choices are Deutsch, French and/or Italian.   
After long surveys, I managed to enroll Deutsch course and completed the minimum level of (most) Job field would required.. 
Now wait, what I mean by surveys was about Course Fees and then the quality... Yes, the fee of language course plays big roles as I havent earn good income yet. (The idea to learn language is to get good job)   
Now, My post is about French or Italian language course...     
If any of you have information and experience about cheap (and hopefully good)   near the border of Weil am Rhein (that will be Basel, Swiz and Huninge,France)..Plisss pleaseeee let me know..     
Hoping for enlightenment

			Okay, good news and bad news... Do you know Radio Eriwan? This is a lot like that.   
Good News: They do, in fact pay for German courses. 
Bad News: You need to be officially unemployed for that.   
Good News: Being unemployed is not too difficult. 
Bad News: In order to qualify as officially unemployed you'll have to have worked in Switzerland for a number of days. Unless there are different rules for recent immigrants.   
Good News: They might actually pay all of it. 
Bad News: They will make you apply for and take any job that sortakinda fits your profile.   
Good News: That's not a bad thing. 
Bad News: There aren't any bookstores that are not only willing to hire someone who barely speaks any German in St. Gallen. There's the Rösslitor, who is part of the Orell Füssli group. Huge bookstore, full of twits, has everything but books and ridiculous requirements as to qualifications of their staff. That's pretty much the only bookstore that pays decent wages. There's also Comedia down the Katharinengasse. They struggle to survive. They have struggled to survive for the past decade or so.    
Good News: I'm fresh out of good news. 
Bad News: Bookshops aren't your best bet, currently. Orell Füssli (aka. Big Bookstore Chain #1) is having a fusion with Thalia (aka. Big Bookstore Chain #2). So personnel cuts are expected.   
There. Bleak and dreary a perspective. Should you go to the RAV and talk to them about your German course. Do not mention that you want to go to work in a Bookshop. Go with ""I want to do what I have qualifications in"".

It's almost impossible to stop Swiss people flicking over to English and you have to actively ask them to keep to German.  It was a nightmare in the early days when I was trying to learn.  It's not a criticism because it was done out of kindness as their language skills were far superior to mine at the time, but I needed that kick up the arse to help me learn German.   
Fortunately, I have some lovely Swiss friends that refuse to speak English to me and mercilessly tease me if I make mistakes but we're usually all pissed on schnapps by then so my German is fluent.

			Hello everyone! 
Originally from Russia, I lived and studied in France. I had a chance to make a Master programme in the university of Montpellier. I propose French and Russian private lessons in Lausanne, Geneva or maybe at my place (not far from Lausanne). I have a teacher's diploma and a big experience of working in language schools and of giving private lessons. I also speak Italian and English. If you are interested, you can contact me by my e-mail:   Merci et à bientôt j'espère!

			I used to get them (have been busy or on holidays the last month or so and stopped momentarily) and yes they are good. 
The thing is that you still have to do your homework and practice outside the 'classroom' for them to be effective.   
Give them a try...good luck!!

			Hi there,   
I did it. I went to Berlin for two weeks in July, had intensive german classes and went on excursions with the school.   
I stayed with a host, but she was talking too fast all the time with me even if I asked her to slow down, she said she doesn't do that, that it was like that. I had trains running under my window until midnight and starting again at 4am, and all the night through at weekends. So, if you go, ask details about the bedroom and its surroundings!   
Some of the other student had either the same problem, or the host people were not always here in the evening etc.. Depending on your level, I would recommend you to ask to stay with a family with children. They tend to be more patient and to speak slower.   
About the school, DID institut, it was really really hot in the classroom, no air conditioning and with the windows opened, we were annoyed by the noise outside. Most of the students were young and partying in the evening which means that during the class, they were a bit disconnected, shy to speak etc.. But teachers were very good and very well prepared.   
Between students, we were talking most of the time in English as our level of German was not enough to always say what we wanted to say.   
The city in itself is very interesting and captivating. But having, said that, I am not entirely convinced that it's the best way to learn German.    
However, if you are thinking about going there, you can PM me to have more details on which questions to ask the school.

			Here in Zurich I meet people who learn Russian. And they are, to my surprise, are not so rare. I mean not only German/Swiss people. English speakers also. I can understand those who need to know Russian in Geneve since there are many international organizations and this language can really be if not in demand but in need. But in Zurich?..   
The point is I am a Russian speaker. I am very, no,   literate Russian speaker. To tell more, I am actually a teacher of Russian  well, teacher of English as well, but not a native speaker and it spoils my life (just kidding   ).    
So maybe here are some forum people (or their friends) who want to get some nice Russian language? I don't dare to hope for a tandem actually  I mean German/Russian tandem. But if an english speaker speaks good German  I'd love to get some in exchange, of course.  Don't care about accent, really, I speak two more languages apart from my mother tongue (and understand one more), and I have accent in all of them, so not a big deal, really.    
I am aware this post can go to oblivion quite quickly, but still  hope dies last   "	26	 Aug 2010	1.0	['0', '0']	['13', '3']	0

I'd quite like to do this 4 day intensive course in scientific writing in German run by the Clinical Trials Unit at the UniSpital Zurich:         
I'm a Brit with B2/C1 level German but could do with a bit of work on my writing.  I contacted the woman in charge of the course and she says it's appropriate for non-native speakers of German.  BUT, they don't have enough sign-ups yet to run it (they need another three students).  So I thought I'd ask on here and see if anyone might be interested.   
Contact Silke Ludwig directly (her email's at the bottom of the linked page).     
Pretty sure it counts as ""integrating"" so tax can be reclaimed.

It's important that you only speak English and your husband only Dutch when speaking directly to your child.

			Ok, it's finally come to this, begging for help.    
I have a little amateur history project going which involves correspondence interviews with people around the world. One of the sources is an alderly German gentlemen. He can write in good English, and his wife, in her eighties I imagine, has impeccable Queen's English in a way that puts most people here to shame. So corresponding is going fine. However, he'd previously written some of his experiences down in a German magazine, which he photocopied and posted to me.    
I have tried translating it via google translate but that's a mammoth task to retype it. It's about four pages.   
So if you have good German, and would enjoy summarizing the article into English that would be a fantastic help. An interest in history or military history would be handy too.      
Please pm me if you are interested in helping.

			The usual recommendation seems to be to learn High German first. You can do courses in Swiss German here in Basel, but they usually require you to have B1 level High German. If you want to study Swiss German as a linguist, the materials would generally be written in High German too.   
That said, your case is a bit different, having a Baslerin for a girlfriend, but I wonder whether you might find it easier to establish a basis in High German before you arrive. It's easier to find materials and it is useful for learning Swiss German later.

			I think it is quite important that each parent speak his/her own mother tongue and the German/Swiss German will come due to the child being immersed in it. Both parents do have to be consistent though.   
Children really amaze you with their ability to take on new languages and switch between them effortlessly.   
Good luck it will be fun and do not be surprised as due to the fact that the child is speaking multiple languages she/he speaks in full sentences later that his peers who are only dealing with one language.

952	Language corner	she tells him off - translation	Taty99	1318	18	Zollikerberg	27.06.2013, 13:46	"    Right. There are those rare cases, often somewhat unexpected, like, for instance, the first time I heard Michiganders say, ""Have a nice one"" (read: day), which exactly corresponds to Swiss German ""Heb en schöne"" (read: Tag), or, ""I haven't the faintest / foggiest"" (read: idea), like Swiss German ""I han kein blasse"" (read: Schimmer).    
However, the similarities between phrasal verbs in English and separable verbs in German immediately fade away when it comes to slightly more complicated sentences, where the second part of the phrasal verb automatically gets moved next to the verb, whereas in German there can be lightyears between the two parts.    
Examples: ""She   him  "" / ""Sie   ihn  ."" But: ""She   just about everybody"" / ""Sie   absolut ausnahmslos jeden, der ihr zu irgendeiner Zeit aus beliebigem Grund in die Quere kommt, sei es jemand aus der Verwandt- oder Bekanntschaft oder auch ein Wildfremder, mit boshafter Hartnäckigkeit und unter Einsatz all ihrer ziemlich begrenzten geistigen Möglichkeiten  .""    
Granted, that monster sentence can be restructured to read, ""Sie   absolut ausnahmslos jeden  , der......"", which makes things a little bit easier, but the first version is perfectly correct too.

buy an Amazon Kindle and purchase & install German-English as your primary dictionary (google and you'll find plenty of how-to-guides on this).  I found ""Collins concise German-English Dictionary"" to be the best one available.   This allows you to get a quick translation on any new words quickly just by highlighting/pressing on the word.   
This doesn't work for ipad kindle apps, only true kindles.  With this, it makes it a hell of a lot easier to read normal novels.  I'm at a B2 level and typical Nick Hornby or John Grisham books have been challenging but enjoyable through this.

			Hi, I think Billhardie's response deserve more consideration. Reading newspapers is a great way to improve your German in my view, especially something pretty basic like Blick am Abend or 20 Minuten. Articles are short and generally easy to get the gist of even if you are not a native. In fact, I wish I made more time for it myself!

A site search for ""terms"" returns this, which makes no mention of exam cancellation, but does mentions generally that cancelations can be made within 1 week of the conclusion of the contract - which, I guess, would mean that Berlitz are in the right if you cancelled after two (especially if a booking with TELC counts as a service being used).         
It would be nice if it was just a clear part of the booking form though.

			Hoi zäme,   
I am taking the Goethe b1 exam at the end of the month. 
I have been going to class 2x a week for 1 year now but it was always very focused on grammar: We have not done much conversation even though we were a very small group.   
I would like to practise a bit speaking. Anyone taking the exam soon ? It's good to talk to and listen to other beginners + we can do special practice (the examiners like to hear the specific stuff like ""meiner Meinung nach..."") 
I also have a bunch of exams I can share.   
I'm in Zurich. Send me a PM if you want to meet.

The courses do not run during the holidays though...new course begins in August/September 2013.  It is also very reasonable, about 150 CHF for 10 Wednesday morning sessions from 9am-11am.

			It's all about the teacher. So if possible, try to get a teacher that is recommended by someone (you trust).    
The best German teacher I ever had was Polish. She knew everything about the grammar and would specifically ask each person, at the beginning of each class, a question about the last class. As a result, you were studying beforehand, what you did the week before, because you didn't want to look a bit dumb.   That was at Migro Klubschule Baden.

The city of Lausanne has a 'department' for the  , and they print/put together this p amphlet which is available for people going to register with the city when they first arrive in Lausanne (the same office to get one's visa).      So perhaps Geneva has an equivalent office for 'integration' that prepares a smiliar document? I understand that most cities offer free language classes though they aren't always easy to find. In fact, I only know about these classes becuase I was in the summer classes offered  by the city and they gave us each a copy of the pamphlet at the end of the course.     I also know of other classes that aren't on this pamplet, and it was only through word of mouth that I know about them. Doesn't really help someone recently arrived, however.

1018	Language corner	German intermediate (B1/B2) course in Uster - Thursday evenings	bobhope	3489	10	Zurich	04.02.2009, 13:37	"    Hi - it is the wac. The website is being revamped  .   
The details are the same - Thursday evenings 8 - 9:30.   
The cost varies according to the number of partcipants, but currently it is 20 CHF for each 1.5 hour lesson (i.e. 10 francs per 45 minutes, if you want to compare with language schools) when you sign up for a semester.   
Probably best just to do a free trial class and see if it's right for you. Just let me know and I'll inform the teacher.

			Thanks for these recommendations, I will check them out.    
Not exactly podcasts but this pack of short stories cost 10 Euros.  I am really enjoying them as they, so far, seem quite  quirky. You also download the text and there's translation in english plus some questions (w answers) at the end so it's really helpful. It states they are German level a2 - B1 which i think is about right.          
They are from this website which is free and not bad at all.       
I hope that helps someone.    
Anyone know of anything similar as I am enjoying this way of learning. (Actually,  not exactly enjoying, it just seems less painful).   
I also bought Downton Abbey in German with subtitles though only watched the first one. Not sure how effective this is but can't be bad!

			Attempt at a diplomatic answer:   
Dear OP, just learn French in Lausanne as much and as long as you want. No problem. The prosody is a bit different but there are many of those within France too. Just watch TV regularly and you'll pick up the main stream accent if you really feel that vaudois French is too special. When you've become fluent in French, you'll notice the 20-30 words typical of Lausanne/Switzerland that are not understood in France and you'll manage to adapt to that too. But that's a question for advanced learners. Don't worry about it now.   
But I wouldn't care at all. French in Lausanne is perfectly fine. Don't loose time thinking about it. Just start learning.   
_________________________     
Less diplomatic answer:    
Dear OP, before you are in a position to ask yourself how your Lausanne French sounds to French ears, you'll have to loose your original accent (English?). That will keep you busy a while.

			Potentially, a diploma can allways be of any help; it shows your comptences in a particular field.   
Now, it would be preferable if the one you mention would be focused on the European Language Portfolio; this system has got a normative value throughout EU both for educations institutions as for employers. In other words, it should document your competences according to the EU Language Portfolio. If not, I'd advise to choose another provider for your English course.

			if your English is fluent then there are some self-learning materials available that are not too bad (though not great), you can find some of them here:       
the online grammar tool is pretty good and not terribly expensive (I think less than CHF 50), although candidly all of the English-to-Swiss German materials I have come across are weak in their explanations of grammar.  the benefit with self-learning is that you can study and learn when your schedule permits.  the biggest hurdle with self-learning is finding an environment where Swiss German is spoken and where you can use the language enough to start building vocabulary (which is not too terribly steep a hurdle in Zurich but may be more so where you live).   
good luck!

but i think this is probably one of the only schools in zurich doing once a week classes on saturday. unless you wanna spurge on private lessons, this is still a pretty good alternative

			Hi Scott, I spoke to Academia on phone yesterday, but their prices for a normal A1 course seem to be pretty high (close to 3000 CHF) . I have a face to face appointment with them today @10. Let me have a word with them for any rebates because even with your 35% this was a bit on the higher side for me. Cheers, Puneet.

			Dear All,   
Since last few months I am attending ELDIS German Language course organized by 
Stadt Zurich for Adult with children over 2 years of age. I really find this 
course very useful because this course doesn't only teach German language but it 
also gives lot of information about schooling in general in Switzerland. It is 
equivalent to A1 level but it costs much less than private German language 
courses (450 CHF for whole year and course is conducted twice a week in school 
days). New batch is starting from March 2013 and please feel free to check the link 
below to findout more info about the course and locations.       
Kind regards, 
shrineha

I would like to practice german, russian and french if possible. I also like painting, so if someone is interested on that it would be nice to paint something together, to see how other people paint the same subject (mountains, sea...) I paint with acrylic as it seems easier than oil painting, but still have some difficulty trying to find the right color mix sometimes (I started painting a year ago). And of course if you would like to learn Spanish I would be happy to help you!

I spent my first year in Munich doing what you are doing and being frustrated. It was only after I found opportunities to immerse myself did my german really start to improve. Head down to Zeughauskellar and talk to some locals; go down to the flea market on Saturday morning and chat to the folks running the stand; go to a local cafe and bug the people sitting there reading their papers... or whatever. The tip re the post-its is a good one, also, should you have a hobby, why not get together with like-minded folk in your area, I guarantee you they will be thrilled to have someone from abroad who shares their interests. My experience on this front came with a fellow old timer nut and a couple of fellow Oktoberfest freaks - we had things in common, they spoke no English and I wanted to learn German. And it works.    
Chatting on Englishforum may be fun but it will not improve your language skills. Sorry mods.    
I also recommend listening to German talk radio and ""reading"" German newspapers everyday... out loud if it does not feel too ridiculous. Half of your problem right now is being understood by the locals, any improvement in your pronunciation will really help you out.    
Last tip, be patient and do not worry about sounding like a total fool. Good luck!

These are quite cheap, with native speakers all over the world and as it is one to one lessons you will have a lot of time to practice speaking.

Eurocentre, Berlitz and Alemania, the 3 schools I have attended in Switzerland, all teach in the language you are studying.   
Although you are not expected to know anything, it can be frustrating that they speak to you as though you do.    
However, immersion teaching does seem to help the learning process even if it may not feel like it at the beginning.

			My daughter has attended LSI Zurich for 4 months.  She had no knowledge of German when she started.  She likes the school and we are pleased with the progress she has made.  Some of her teachers have been good and others have been better.   So far we can't say she's had a bad teacher (even the subs).   
Back in July, she started in a class already in progress.  At first she felt overwhelmed because everyone else seemed so much more advanced.  She stuck with it and eventually caught up (within ~5 weeks).  After about 12 weeks her class was combined with another class that was about one week ahead of hers.  She was apprehensive about it but, again, within a couple of weeks, students from both classes were at  the same level.  The teachers seem very capable at handling these transitions.   
Also, the school seems to be flexible in allowing you to move up/down a level if need be.     
She has made many friends.  The hardest part is saying goodbye to them when they start new jobs or return to their home countries.    
Based on our experience, I am happy to recommend the school.

			In my experience, you don't need it but if you're planning to stay long term it's good to try and adapt it.    
There are a LOT of Germans in Zurich (at least in the city) and quite a few foreigners (or Swiss French and Swiss Italians) as well (students and others).    
It's quite common to communicate in Hochdeutsch in Zürich, especially if you're foreign. Once you've been around for a while and your Hochdeutsch is good, perhaps you could try communicating in the dialect.    
I don't think it's too hard to pick up, especially if you're immerged in a Swiss German speaking environment.

I assume that they will not only have space for the registration but also for the event results and thus can be easily used for book, score, and whatever keeping. As they are standardized everybody working at such competitions will know what information can be found on this card and where on has to fill in the score. Smart.   
Seems like you could replace ""Nenn-"" or ""Nennung"" with Registration 
Nennstartkarte - Start registration card 
Nennsystem - Registration system 
Nenngeld - Registration fee 
Nennschluss - Registration deadline 
Nachnennung - Late registration (at competition) 
Nachnenngebühr - Nachnenngeld - Late registration fee   
This terms may also be used for other sport competitions, such as street races, Marathons, Ski competitions etc.

Once you become a repeat client, you get 8% off. You can  decide if you want to do 45-minute or whatever suits you in length, but  once your 720 minutes are up, then you buy a new package. Once you're in  exam preparation mode, it jumps to 105 CHF an hour. But that usually is  only 4-5 weeks before the exam that you're in that mode.   
I'd say  I worked with my teacher once a week most of the time, but for a few  months it was twice a week. Right before my C1 exam, I was SUPER nervous  and met with her 3-4 times a week. But I still don't think there's any  group course I could have taken to get me from B1 to C1 in 12 months  when I add up how much I paid.   
Good luck!      Ha, that made me laugh! Thanks! The information you provided is really helpful. There's absolutely no way that I could interview in French right now, but there was a time when I in fact lived and functioned in French speaking families during my study abroads. The language is somewhere there still...I hope...

It's not an obsession but the result of a necessitiy caused by another obsession of mine, namely model railroad building, where those thin plastic sheets can serve many purposes.    
As you may imagine, they all have 12 or 15 rectangles, one for each month of the year plus sometimes three more for the last months of the previous year or the first months of the next year. Each month square has five (February sometimes only four) lines, one for each week.    
Without a single exception, they all have Monday as the first day of the week, no matter how far back I go.    
By the way, in the 1950s, we had a silly joke. We asked a class mate, ""Do you know what 'Modimidofrsaso' means?"" Of course no one knew. ""What, you don't know? Are you blind or what?

This happens to me alot when I have been speaking English for sometime and then must switch to German, I end up directly translating from English at first and my German sounds really funny as I use English grammar.

			We've lived in Geneva for almost a year and both our girls go to the public school. They are native english speaking and speak polish fluently.   
My 9 year old can understand, read and write French but her standard is not satisfying the school who expect more competence after almost 1 year.    
She actually knows plenty, but is hesitant to take risks and make mistakes and doesn't yet connect learned vocabulary into sentences and have conversations.   
This is making it difficult for her to keep up with other subjects, particularly maths.   
I'd like a recommendation, from personal experience for an empathetic tutor in Geneva, to work with her on 1:1 to improve her confidence with spoken french, focus her maths learning and help her catch up with the class.   
My preference is a tutor familiar with the Geneva public education system and curriculum.   
Thank you.

Bella Lingua seems good, but ultimately I think that they wanted too much money up front.  They wouldn't even give a trial lesson.  But Swissing was very accommodating and let me have a free group lesson and a free private lesson.  I was most impressed.

In addition to my High German and Swiss German language lessons, I would like to start a book group for those at a C1-C2 level.   
We would read a mixture of literature in a broad range of genres, written by well-known (as well as less well-known) German, Swiss and Austrian authors.     
The book group meetings would take place at my home office/classroom in Wädenswil.  Alternatively, we could take it in turns and each member of the group could host a meeting at their place - I am flexible in this regard.   
If you are interested in more information, please send me a PM.  I look forward to hearing from you!

			The best thing to do would be an intensive German course, full immersion is the way to go and they teach you the grammar which are super important for understanding in German. 
There are some good apps out there for learning German and some really terrible ones. I've tried a heap of them and the biggest recommendation I can make for someone who is just beginning is the Michel Thomas Method (you will see him recommended in other threads). They have made an app for his program, which is expensive but hardly the cost of buying the CDs. The app is Iphone built but it's all audio so the larger layout is not required. It gives you a heap of confidence in speaking fast.  
For a tap and play Ipad app Busuu works well but they are always trying to get more money out of you. I would highly recommend 'German Flash Cards' by Declan Software. Absolutely awesome as it has phased repetition and a bunch of other tricks to make it stick. Get it it's worth it. Avoid 'word power' or 'word bots' they are terrible. The only thing with app programs is they usually give you words, German needs grammar for understanding and learning this alone can be painful. In a class it can actually be fun!

1287	Language corner	German lessons with daycare in Zug?	redfish	784	0	Neuchatel	08.07.2012, 23:03	" 
			
			Hi all,   
We currently live in Neuchatel and are moving to Zug at the end of July.     
In Neuchatel, Ive been attending French classes at an organization for women called Recif.  Its brilliant!  Basically, whilst I have a French class, my toddler goes to a supervised crèche/playgroup run by the same organization (and its in the same building).  Its a great way for me to meet other people and for both me and my son to practice French.   
So, my question is does a similar organization offering German lessons exist in or near Zug?  And/or does the Canton of Zug offer integration courses with daycare?   
Hoping someone can help!   
Thanks in advance xx

			I enrolled for the summer school at the University of Geneva many years ago and it was the best course for me to improve my French.   
First they test everyone to provide the right level.  The course is fairly intensive and includes lectures/teaching of grammar etc., language lab to improve pronunciation and some fun add-ons   
Most students are young; between 18 and 24   
I know you mentioned the price may be an issue, but I highly recommend it as for me it was worth what I paid at the time.

Caribou is not just the reindeer like animal in Northern Québec, it is also something consumed at carnival. Typically a blend of red wine and spirits. After a few shots it does not feel so cold outside.    
By the way the accent is not funny or strange, it is just traditional old Norman and Breton French, unsullied by the Paris intellectuals who changed fin de semaine to ""week-end"" and stationment to ""parking"".    
Of course there are always a few good natured misunderstandings, such as ""Ne touche pas à ma blonde"" Which a Belgian would interpret as ""don't touch my beer"" and the Québecois knows is ""leave my girlfriend alone"".

			I'm not a translator...   
But I am a native English speaker and I think that passage needs some work to improve the quality of the English before you start translating it into French.    
For starters, what is it supposed to be? An advert, a mission statement, or a 'what we believe' statement? To be honest I can't decide if the passage is supposed to be chatty or formal in tone - it is an uncomfortable mix of the two. Your sentences are too long, poorly structured and some of them don't make a great deal of sense.   
If you want help, I suggest you provide more information about what you are trying to say, what your target audience is, and what the context is. Then perhaps someone will be able to help you get that paragraph into a paragrapher that is decently-structured, grammatically correct, and that contains vocabulary that is appropriate for your aim and audience.    
You might also consider updating your profile to be a little more specific. I am not inclined to help someone who cannot decide if they are a 'business student', a 'business man' or a 'business owner'. Why? Because I prefer to help people who are upfront about who they are, what they need help with and why they need it. I am under the impression that most of the posters on here feel the same way. If you come back and explain a little more, I'd be happy to try and get your English into better shape. And then perhaps someone might help with the French.

			I second that, they are crafty: the schools in each city were separate companies, he just immediately closed the companies that were not making a profit.    
Maybe a reasonable action for him, but many employees had to sue him to get their wages paid, while the other cities were making enough money. Why couldn't he give formal notice and pay his employees?    
So I would only pay him on a daily basis, in case the school went bankrupt before the next lesson.

			I agree with Stifoan. The Cambrige Proficiency proves you can express yourself in English - but this does not mean you can translate well.    
A learner with a vocabulary of 2000 words can understand 96% of spoken words but only 80% of average written text. A learner with 6000 words understands 90%. However, using them correctly in context is far more difficult. Like asking an equestrian to ride a tiger.    
From Wikipedia, a 1995  study estimated the vocabulary size of first-year college students (high-school educated) at about 12,000, and college-educated speakers at  about 17,000 word families.   
With the help of a dictionary you can be more precise, but only a native speaker can choose easily between close synonyms. ""A Swiss with CPE would be quite good  at translating from English into German, but not necessarily the other  way around."" I'm an English teacher, but no matter how long I learn German, I will always be very wary of translating into it.   
Check your vocabulary on

			I am neither a hiker nor a climber...   
But I do live in Swiss Romande... and it seems to me I've heard that word used to refer to energetic babies or toddlers who are scaling the sofa!   I'm not sure where that leaves you...   
Word reference, which I generally use when in doubt, translates it as 'rock climber'. See  .   
Hopefully someone who actually does the sport will come along soon and help you...   
But I can confirm it is used in Swiss Romande to refer to a climber in a very general sense, at the very least!

			Okay I am going to attempt to post this one more time, since the last two wouldn't post.  Where to start......my name is Tyra and I am in the U.S.  I found this forum due to teasing from a friend.  He would say things to me in what I now lovingly refer to as swissy (Berndeutsch).  He would taunt me with the fact that there was no translator online that could tell me what he was saying.  Well he was wrong........I found all of you here.  lol.  He even gave me the old chuchichaschtli test!  He and I have become rather close in the months that have passed since this has all started.  He is an amazing man.  He calls me Sweetness and his Sunshine, he has told me macht das dsunne schint.  I make his sun shine.  I wanted to impress him so I'd ask for some translations and how to say certain things on this forum.  Unfortunately he has been right though, I don't have many resources.   
I read your thread about the resources for learning swiss german and some of it has proved to be helpful, but very little.  Most of the listed resources are in German then going to Swiss German or they are not the dialect I am looking for.  I also saw your post about tandem language partners but most people are in Switzerland for that.  I am here in the U.S.  There are no classes here and not much in resources to learn Swiss German in general let alone Berndeutsch.  I want to be able to talk to this man in his beautiful language not mine.  Sorry for the long winded explanation.  I guess what I am getting at.... is I am asking if someone on here could help a little american girl learn some real Swiss German (preferrably Berndeutsch).  I am fully aware that learning another language does not happen over night.  If someone on here invested their time in teaching me I promise you I will not waste it.  Any help would be much appreciated, more than you'll ever know.  I will be in debt to you.

1344	Language corner	making a choice of English institute (intensive course) .	Misspork	1570	2	Hoenggerberg	15.04.2012, 17:25	"    I would recommend Hull's School (at Stadelhofen) or AKAD (in Oerlikon). I did my Lower Cambridge with Hull and my Proficiency with AKAD. Both were great decades ago, and apparently have improved. Migros is tremendous for private correspondence and holiday trips. Mum was at Migros School learning English between 1972 and 2001 and found it splendid. But for university you need the proficiency, and this is quite a different thing. You will get lectured by Cambridge educated teachers, who may be humourous but mean serious business. It is not easy work to get the Proficiency Certificate but you learn a lot, not just about English but even about how to teach other people in a senseful way, about English culture, about how to behave in the English speaking world, about business, and more. A lot of work but worth any minute.    
From Hönggerberg, AKAD may be nearer, the question however is where you work. And S-Bahn trains from Hardbrücke to Stadelhofen need less than 10 minutes. So that both options are open. Locationwise, my preference would be Hull

I'm looking for summer German or Swiss German language courses in the Basel area. Any recommendations? I will be staying from around the 25th of May to the 15 of August, so I would like something that would fit in that time frame.   
Now, a lot of people have told me   to go to Switzerland to learn german, but I have a good reason I swear! I'm a young Swiss-American college student who, because of various circumstances, never learned Swiss German from my Swiss parent. However, I started taking German this year, and I really enjoy speaking it (go figure), and I would like to be able to use the opportunities that my dual nationality opens up for me.   
Also, some type of summer job/way to earn some pocket money would't be a bad thing, so any suggestions on that front would be helpful as well. Because of my other languages, is working in a hostel or being a tour guide feasible? Any music related suggestions (I play violin)?

			Hello,   
My husband and me are learning German but unfortunately not having the chance to practice. I mean: learning a lot of grammar in School (A2-B1 level) but not able to have a conversation.  
We are both Spanish. We think it will be nice if we can find someone interested in practice Spanish and willing to teach us some German (you need to be patient, hehe).   
Joining ones a week some where else for a drink in or near Olten sounds good for us.    
Anyone interested?????

			Thank you for your help everyone - and sorry for the delay in replying - I have been reading your replies but have been struggling to keep on top of tasks this week!   
Interestingly several people seem to struggle to understand what I mean by breath hitching. Perhaps it is not a common phrase. Or perhaps I'm loosing my English...   
To try and clarify, the best explanation I can give is that I I use the phrase 'hitching' to describe a sensation I often experience which is very similar to a series of gentle hiccups in my chest - without the 'hic'! So my breath comes short, slightly faster than usual and in an irregular pattern. But it is not due to overexertion, anxiety or being upset - hence why I want to avoid saying my breath is catching in my chest which for me (in English) implies a more obvious breathing problem generally linked to an physical or emotional cause.    
(As an aside, if you really want to refine your English and French vocabulary in the areas of emotions and physical sensations, a 20 week CBT group will provide an excellent training... and if you do 3 such groups, you will find yourself pondering minute details of vocabulary as described above on a regular basis)!    
I think that the 'chatouiller' suggestion might be best, as to me that sounds the least dramatic! Or someone offline suggested I simply said 'J'ai la respiration irregulière'.    
Thank you again - for nothing else, for demonstrating to me once again that we all identify and describe our physical sensations in different ways.    
Now to go and do tonight's exercises!

Good Luck!

We love it when you try our language, no matter how bad your pronunciation is. And most Swiss are really happy to hear something nice about our language, or even see people trying to learn it, boosts our self-confidence a bit.   We don't really like it getting compared to German too much, or hearing that it sounds similar. So if you want to say something nice just say it sounds a bit similar to Dutch, something the Dutch themselves would agree to as well. Have never witnessed any bad reaction from Swiss when exposed to foreigners trying to speak Swiss German, and I interact with quite a lot of foreigners on a daily basis in both work and private life. Be prepared to be made fun of though, and don't take it to heart, it just really sounds funny/lovely to us.  
It seems like most Swiss really have a huge deficit when it comes to speaking about their language, so chances are you'll get an hour-long lecture about the differences in dialects and how this and that canton speaks a nice/ugly accent.   "	57	 Apr 2009	2.0	['4', '3']	['131', '11']	3

1414	Language corner	Rosetta Stone	smtrickett	4399	25	Zug	12.11.2011, 09:57	"    Few people learn languages ""automatically"" and to learn another language if done thoroughly IS work. I have taken up a paid assignment as a private German teacher once per week. The student is a Latin American lady who came to CH 8 years ago and has a 6 years old son who speaks  fluently Swiss German but of course not yet Standard German. When being there I throughout the hour strictly keep to Standard German, and try to bring a bit of grammar and structure into her German language mess. She does not lack intelligence at all, but I strongly suspect that she never learnt proper Spanish grammar either. Another aspect to be cared about is prononciation(s) and regional variations.    
I have done such teachings for apprentices in our company in the 80ies in German, French and English.  The problem was that they, majority-wise of Italian origin, spoke Swiss German perfectly well and were better in French in a general way then their native Swiss colleagues, but missed structures, grammar and spelling. Critical was the situation with English, as in aircargo your professional (legally binding) language IS English, and not just a ""bla-bla Swinglish English"" but a correct one. Things did not arrive with those teachers of the Commercial School of KV-Z really well, so that action was needed.    
My grandfather (mother-side) language-wise was good but a bit the ""victim"" of his father (my grand-grandfather) who had lived for roughly a decade in the USA, but had returned in the late 1870ies and married. AND demanded of his son fairly early to learn properly English, which was not excactly easy at the time. He then had to ride by train to Zürich in the evening twice per week and when needing more of it on one side in the 1920ies bought some of the earliest ""audio"" things available, and had one radio tuned on the BBC and listened to BBC broadcasts and to speeches of people like Lloyd George, Ramsay McDonald, and Neville Chamberlain. He by some self-courses also learnt Italian, and so was the correspondent in his company for English, French and Italian. He improved his linguistic proficiencies by meeting Englishmen, Frenchmen and Italians while on holidays in the Alps, sitting together with them until midnight.    
He of course heavily encouraged the enthusiasm of his daughter for other languages    "	79	 Nov 2011	2.0	['2', '1']	['9', '8']	1

The mountain settlements in Southern St. Gallen and partly also in Glarus were founded by   settlers too.

			When I was learing German in college, I had one teachter from Austria who played us a tape of what Swiss-German sounded like. There's no way you can even learn it without being there. The best you can do is learn southern German, like Austrian or Bavarian. For some reason it's also hard to find a German teacher in the schools around the world who happens to be from Switzerland. The closest thing you can do to learning Switzerland's languages before living there is to learn German from Austrians and to learn French from Belgians. Or Italian from people from Northern Italy. Those are the places people have to be from before they'll bother to remember to tell you, ""Oh by the way, this is what Switzerland says..."" or ""this is how it's done in Switzerland...""    
The best I was able to do was get out the Austrian that Switzerland always uses the ss instead of that symbol that HochDeutsch uses (I don't even have it on this keyboard) and says Sonnabend like Austria instead of Samstag. On the French side, the best I could get was that they use the original-Latin words for seventy and ninety like Belgium (septante and nonante) instead of saying ""sixty-ten"" and ""four-twenty-ten"" like France. This far I got from learning French from Belgians.    
The countries around it whose languages it shares, all seem to treat it like it's not even there, or that its ""variation"" of the language in question is somehow ""not correct."" I had a German teacher from Berlin who seemed not to even remember that Switzerland is even THERE, somehow. I'm in Quebec now, so don't get me started on how the French treat Switzerland regarding their shared language...!

1435	Language corner	Group German class in Zurich focusing more on grammar?	NicoleCZ	2519	12	Birmensdorf ZH, ex-Lausanne	09.02.2012, 12:22	"    I right now give German lessons to a lady from Latin America, who does not hesitate to speak in German, but whose grammar and structure in German was a bit of a mess, and so, I concentrated my efforts on grammar. Many German teachers, even North Germans, however have a meagre command of grammar and so rather avoid than tackle grammar which is widely regarded as boring, while it is the skeleton of a language. I do not believe that there are any schools with ""Deutsche Grammatik"" classes, while there are teachers who give more or less emphasis to grammar.   
What you mention about your talking problem in fact obviously is a mental and psychological problem. You possibly when going to such places like those lessons should relax more and take it easier. I in secondary class had a teacher who, under a bit ""shady"" pretenses on specific days picked on me and ""condemned"" me to an ""extra-hour"" after 4pm. It was his Italian lesson, he gave me some nice stuff to work on, which I even could take home with me. And then, as he knew that I from holidays had quite some command in practical Italian, when those students got ""stucked"" suddenly asked me  ""how would YOU say it"" and I then replied ""well, simply  ........""  .  And I took the most simple way possible.  Which, as Dr.Dr. R.M. stated, was THE way to go. So, back again, relax and take it easy.  Do not try to be perfect, but try to communicate. Do not feel frustrated when/if the teacher corrects you.

			It seems  strange to me, that the term ""lotrecht"" is used in the context of maths (where normally ""rechtwinklig"" or ""orthogonal"" would be used).   
A ""Lot"" is a tool which is mostly used to determine wheter a wall is pependicular to the ground or not. In its simplest form it is just a string which a weight attached. ""Lotrecht"" litterally means the direction into which the Lot is pointing (i.e. the direction of gravity.) 
According to wikipedia the corresponding English term is vertical direction.    
It seems though that in Geometry the therm Lot is used (altougth I never heard it in this context before). In which case it just means a line which is perpendicular to an other line.   
The term Senkrecht is a bit ambigious it is actually synonymos to ""Lotrecht"" (it derived from the word ""Senkblei"" which is onother word for ""Lot"") and means the vertical direction.   it is on the same time often used to express that two lines are perpendicular to each other (here ""rechtwinklig"" or ""orthogonal"" would be better choices). It seems as if the teacher did not pick the best termology.

Since we will probably be in Switzerland for the long haul, I just wanted my daughter to be able to make some friends and to hopefully learn some of the language before she starts kindergarten. I would also like to help her French as none of her French family speak English and as I mentioned in the original post, she is reluctant to speak it. Also, what I didn't say was perhaps more selfishly, one of the main reasons for seeking local playgroups is for me to meet other parents as moving abroad with small children (I also have a 9 week old) is a very scary prospect, and one that many of you have been through!

There are many kinds of written Swiss German - its existance is not questioned, the Bücher Brocky will show you nice examples of it. However, the authors just write it like they want, and that is not always that easy to follow. Each author demands a certain training, or even just to read it loud. Not standardized, with all the inconvinients of that situation and the taste of authenticity at the same time. One likes it or not, that´s a question of taste.

			I did the intensive, month-long CELTA several years ago. The biggest challenge for us was cramming all the prep and assignments into those 4 weeks - with theory in the mornings, that often meant CELTA-ing 14 hours a day. Hopefully you won't suffer the same pressure with the 3 month one!   
Overall though, a brilliant learning experience, and my biggest worry - having your fellow students and tutor observing /critiquing - was soon forgotten. I learnt masses, despite having years of observation/teaching experience to begin with (as a Teaching Assistant).   
I didn't completely agree with the marking scheme - e.g. rapport was one box to tick, but given equal value to every other box - e.g. presentation of materials. That meant that a guy in our group, with zero connection to any of the students and whose class everyone dreaded, got the second highest grade, having ticked enough boxes in other categories. But.. that's a minor gripe!   
The very detailed tutor report at the end is really useful. Just don't lose your certificate. I've heard they are irreplaceable.    
Good luck

School wouldn't have worked for me because I have difficulties learning in a theoretical way. I have to do and experience things. I'm sure if I moved to a  German city I would speak good German in a short time by absorbing the language around me.   
If your a theoretical learner then I would advise a good German course, for the rest I'd get out and about and communicate as much as possible with those around you, it's not difficult to keep both separate.

If you are here with a job (or with someone who has a job), and therefore have an income, then I doubt very much you will get something for free. I would imagine the same thing applies if you are a student.    
If you are out of work, then you   be entitled to a free language course (talk to your ORP advisor or social worker).    
If you are on a low income, or in a 'precarious situation', and are not able to benefit from other French classes, you may be able to get help from these people:  . The classes are not free, but they are very cheap.    
If none of these options apply / appeal, you could post a request for a langauge exchange on  . I think that you might also be able to find someone studying at UNIL or EPFL for a language exchange...

When making the switch from English to German, they say 'half to' the hour whereas we say 'half past' - so 'halb 2' is 13:30.

			We own   I found it to be a useful resource and read it before the birth of our first.   
We choose to operate as a OPOL (One Parent, One Language) household. No matter where we live or where we are, I speak exclusively in English with our children and my husband speaks exclusively in Swiss German. As a matter of politeness, when guests are at the table with us, we speak predominantly in the least common denominator language. However, when telling my daughter to, ""sit down properly"" or other manners things, I'll still speak to her in English.   
Before we moved to Switzerland when she was just shy of 2.5, she was fluent with her understanding, but spoke back almost always in English. Personally, I wanted my husband to push her more to speak back, but he didn't think it was necessary and her Swiss German is not under my control.   
When we moved here, it took about six weeks before she was fluent in both speaking and listening. The real turning point was when we went on a week long vacation with another Swiss German family. The intensity of that experience really helped her spoken language blossom.   
Then in October, we went back to the US and it worked the same way in reverse. The intensity of two weeks in an English speaking environment resulted in yet another language explosion in English.   
My daughter has always been extremely very verbal in English and she began early. I found that as she started speaking more and more Swiss German, she followed the same path in regards to the extent of her vocabulary and ways that she uses it.   
*****   
I have put a lot of thought into how to do bilingualism in my household and have considered a lot of methods. I always ask other bilingual families how they do it and bilingual adults what they did and didn't like about the experience growing up. I've come to the conclusion that there are many, MANY ways to raise bilingual children. You have to figure out what makes most sense for YOUR family. It also very much depends on the child. My daughter loves to talk and loves to express herself. I am not at all shocked by her fluency and how long it took. It's just the way she is. Other children are shy or some don't want to say a word until they know it's perfect. What works for one, may not work or simply may not make sense for your family. In the book that I linked above, there are many examples as well.   
*****   
Direct to your question, I once read on the forum about a family who introduced a doll to their child during bathtime or something like this. This doll could only understand Swiss German. Apparently this was a non-threatening way for the child to practice and during a limited period of time so it wasn't overwhelming. I liked that idea and have put it in my toolbox if I ever need it.   
Hope that helps!

The vocabulary exercises seem very good. You start off slowly and then build up to the full spelling of the word. I was hoping they might have something like that for sentences, especially to help with word order.

For the last 11 years I have been visiting my Wife's family in Valais on Holidays, Christmas etc staying with them for anything up to 10 days. It has been quite painful at times. Since none of her family spoke any English.    
Since these were brief visits I didn't make a big enough effort to learn French. I did take some evening classes however living and working in England meant I had very little use / practice for it. My Wife still blames herself for not teaching me and now we don't get the time with a 2 year old running around.    
Now also we have moved to Switzerland she's worried she'll start losing her English so wants to speak English at home. I'll be going off to more French classes in Late September, so for now it's back to the books / cd's / Television.

			I did an ""understanding Swiss German"" course at the Volkshochschule in Basel.  It was really good.  Although it was entitled ""understanding"", we were also encouraged to speak it a bit, although it was fine if people only wanted to stick to German as well (but saying things out loud does help get them in your head I find).   
You had to have a minimum of B1 german to do the course, and I discovered that my greatest problem was understanding the other participants, most of whom came from Northern Germany and had a quite inpenetrable accent (well to me anyway!)   
There was not a class where I didn't think ""oh wow, that's what that means .."" so it was really worth while.  As we are in Basel, it was Basler SG, but as I come from the depths of Baselland, the teacher tried to differentiate where he knew things were said a little differently round us.   
All in all, would warmly recommend it.

A bit more information could help. Maybe a tandem learning partner could be the right option and/or hanging out in Irish pubs.   
Concerning the short time period, an intensive language course could be necessary.

			I'm very sorry for that. 
You have to know that generally speaking Italians don't speak english so this fact could be the reason why you found this bad feedback from my  fellow citizens. 
Italian languege is very difficult but if you want to learn it you'll learn it.   
If I can help you, please let me know.

Cavalier	9534	56	San Francisco	02.10.2011, 23:48	"    I don't know any Bavarian nor any Austrian that can speak Hochdeutsch without revealing their true origine. And that's NORMAL. Same with Swiss. Keep your accent, it's natural. It can still be perfectly correct High German. A fellow (very) Swiss teacher speaks dialect only to the cleaning ladies, otherwise I've never heard her speaking anything else than perfect High German... she however pronounces   with a long /o:/, like ""ohp"" that's quite disturbing but still, she has the nicest High German south of the Neckar.    
Swiss High German is perfectly fine. Local specificities are normal, and it's not any different in High German north of the Rhine (and of Schafhausen).   
Frankly, one hears usually quite clearly when a German comes from Schleswig or an old Hamburg fellow. They also have their own High German sometimes.

And it is similar in case of TV, where also those in crime-stories where the Dative gets gradually eliminated.

One tip........practice practice and more practice. Make your intentions clear to a native Swiss German speaker and go for it. Ask to be corrected when you get it wrong, but stick at it.

			Just in case somebody wants to know: LENGTH OF VOWELS   
- First part: Vowels are long when followed by single consonant, short when followed by double consonant  
NOTE: ck, tz are ""doubles"" and ch is ambiguous as it can not be written double   
- Second part: Vowels are long when specifically elongated by -h or double-vowel. 
NOTE: Double-vowels are mostly low-German northern words that somehow found their way into the High German dictionary.  
EXCEPTION: IE. When comming from monophtongason of old ie pronounced /iä/ like in modern Swiss-German, the old spelling ie stayed for the new long vowel.   
- Third part: Elongation with -h (Dehnungs-H) is not specified before voiced occlusives (b,d,g) as the elongation always finds place in the official version of high-German (northern German accent keeps the old short vowels), the only exception being the absence of elongation in one low German word with low German spelling kept in Ebbe.   
- Fourth part: in -IEH-the h is not a Dehnungs-H but a remain of the shift due to Verner's law (hence shift h/g in ziehen/zog and h/ch in Vieh/Viecher)   
- Fifth part: Regional pronounciation may have kept the old short vowels, it's especially the case in the two extremes low-German and Swiss-German. Standart Bühnendeutsch however have consistent elongation of vowels in syllables with voiced consonant that where open originally at middle-high-German stage. With unvoiced consonant in that configuration, the vowel normally stays short and the spelling is double consonant.

In the past I had a lot of clients who wanted to use the summer before a move to try to help their kids get a better start and the schools advised against it saying it was better to start them off their way.

			Hi, 
depending on your needs you may consider this option or a similar company :        
I am very sorry if i take away work from locals and EFs but for what i needed this company was a better option. Top journals in my field (fluid dynamics) are suggesting it together with others companies. I have used their services to edit my PhD thesis and it saved me several headaches.    
It is targeting academics that need help editing their English for technical papers. It is cheaper and much faster than any local editor and the paper will be edited by somebody with direct experience in your field.     
Locals editors that i had experience with had an amazing English but not technical enough to meet my advisor 'standards'. Here i have to say that my advisor is reeaaaalllly picky about it, and my field is quite technical and mathematical ... Moreover, local editors were not alway able to understand the deep logic of the period thus they were slightly changing the meaning and the logical implications of the sentences.     
Obviously, local editors have their major advantages (usually targeting different kind of customer, more flexibility, more personal interactions etc etc ) and you have to evaluate by yourself what do you really need and which is your best option.    
I have no conflict of interest with the cited company.

It's not a Swiss or German problem, though. Such misleading situations can happen in just about any language. During my first months in Greece, I had to learn all sorts of such subtleties. Like, when you say, ""Den katalaveno,"" (""I don't understand""), that means you don't understand the language, but when you say, ""Den katalava"" (""I have not understood"" -- yes, sounds silly, but there is no really equivalent translation for the Greek aoristos), it means, ""Pardon me?"" I learned that during my first hour in Greece.    
On our little island, when the proprietor of one of those picturesque taverns on the waterfront asks me, ""Do you want to have a beer?"", that means he is treating me to it. If I tried to pay afterwards, I'd badly offend him. If, on the other hand, he asks, ""What do you want to drink?"", he's expecting a normal order.

1553	Language corner	[English] Grammar primer part 1: Nominative and Accusative Case	mark	16647	13	Zollikon, Switzerland	30.08.2006, 21:31	"   , it is designed to provide some background information on some of the grammatical constructs used in English. Why? Knowledge of how certain things work in English can be directly applied when learning other foreign languages.      (for people who didn't go to school)      - A doing word e.g. run, jump, laugh, speak, be, have, become.    - A word which describes a verb e.g. quickly, slowly, patiently.    - A person, place or thing e.g. computer, internet, John, Zurich.    - Describes a noun e.g. big, small, smart, stupid.    - Replaces nouns indicating people e.g. I, me, you, him, her, they, them, myself.    - modifies noun and verb phrases e.g. for, with, at, on, below, through, around, by.       
Nominative case is simply a fancy name for the  of a sentence. Consider the sentence:       
The subject of the sentence is the dog. It's the part of the sentence that is performing the action (verb). Therefore we say that ""The dog"" is in nominative case.       
Accusative is also a fancy name for the   of a sentence. The object receives the action from the verb. So in our sentence above, the boy is the object.       
In English our sentence patterns are often formed with specific word order. Generally it is very easy for us to tell which part of the sentence is subject and object simply because the  subject  usually comes first, followed by a  verb , followed by the  object . Colours have been used to illustrate the point.         Other languages use different word order. Some may have an almost fixed pattern like English, and others may have variable order depending on the other elements in the sentence. German may be SVO or it may be SOV - in some cases the order of subject or object may be reversed.   
Therefore instead of thinking in terms of word order it is more useful to ask yourself the question ""Who is doing what to whom"". Who is giving the action, and who is receiving it?     
Consider the following:     
We know that the subject is ""I"", and ""am eating"" is the verb, but where is the object? We could imagine that the object is whatever might be in my mouth. So the sentence really looks like:     
What about :     Now the subject seems to be missing - but the person must be talking to someone, so it is most likely:           
Passive voice won't be covered here, it is mentioned only because these types of sentences do not fit into to the normal structure given above. Passive sentences do not contain an object. An example might be:   
Passive voice:  
Active voice:    
When trying to find the subject and object in passive voice the student may become confused, so it is important to at least recognise these types of sentences at this point.       
Can you see the subject and object in these sentences?     Now you can see that ""I"" is a nominative pronoun, and ""me"" is an accusative pronoun. Likewise he/she is nominative and him/her is accusative.    
If you are unsure about a sentence, try to rearrange it slightly so you can put ""I"" or ""me"" into the sentence. So if you are having trouble with:       
Change it to either:     , or   .   
Now by seeing where ""I"" or ""me"" would fit, you can instantly tell which part of the sentence is nominative and which part is accusative.       
Nominative and accusative case are not difficult, but unless you have a basic understanding of what they mean and how they work you will probably find that you can never progress past a certain point in the foreign language you are trying to learn. An understanding of how they work in your native language will be very important if you wish to also use them effectively in another European language.

I really enjoyed it and learnt a lot, and there are classes at different levels and times of day, once or twice a week, etc. Much depends on the teacher, though - mine was marvellous (but she no longer works there). I also believe it's possible to swap if for some reason you don't 'click' with the group or teacher you're first allocated, they're quite flexible (as they want to keep you attending as long as possible, naturally  ). You sign up for a term at a time, so it's not a terribly long commitment, and I think I was allowed a free trial lesson before signing up.

Firstly, there was about 15 people in the class and only 3 of us spoke no German; the rest all spoke German but with poor grammar etc. Therefore us 3 were already at a distinct disadvantage, this therefore led the teacher to work at different speeds and favoured the German speaking students more.      That put me off learning German..and I quit the course. I will try one to one lessons or try a different course provider.   	608	 Dec 2009	5.0	['9', '9']	['635', '264']	5

			One can perfectly learn High German in Switzerland. So do the Swiss. It can even be less confusing, as Swiss High German words are integrated right from the beginning. In a course in Switzerland, you'll learn  right away. In Germany, you learn die S-Bahn (in Hamburg even die Hochbahn) and have to adapt when coming to Switzerland. It is no problem at all when you speak German very well (German people adapt very quickly) but it may be more disturbing as a beginner. I don't know, just guessing... I may be wrong.

			From the student side, having tried both, I must admit I always enjoyed the group lessons more. In the 1:1 situation I felt far too self conscious and kind of stupid - at least with others there I felt like I wasn't alone in my stupidity  (and realised that actually I was quite good compared to some of the others  ).    
Even though the teacher was very nice I just didn't enjoy the 1:1 situation. I imagine it depends on you as much as the teacher, but why not try both and see which you prefer?   
The most important part for me was being able to practice outside of classes, because my work was in English and pretty much everyone I knew spoke English. For that I'd highly recommend enrolling in some kind of other practical adult education class - like cookery or painting or DIY, to give you a chance to just hear the language being spoken in a normal setting outside of German class. Make it something where you can follow by copying - so not German literature or something, but anything where there will be practical work as well as listening. I learnt to drive here which did wonders for my German! Also, watch German TV as much as you can stand - start with something like the news (where they generally speak clearly!) or sports programs if you're into football or something.

			You will get there.  These things take time.  Most imporatantly that I have seen in people is that you are seen to be making an effort to communicate and learn how to communicate with them.   
I have travelled a lot all over the world over the last 3 years and often find myself in situaitons where I don't understand the majority language being spoken.  I have adopted the following tactics:   
I see if I can pick up the thread of the convesation and then if I feel that I have something to contribute, I will chip in and put my point across in English.....always prefixed by a polite ""excuse me but are you talking about .... "".  People will make a lot of allowances if you have something to contribute to a conversation and and often this can lead to you learning a lot as they explain what was being said and you can relate it to what you thought was being said.   
Occasionally feel free to chip in with the odd humourous    You need to pick the right circumstances for this one and read the crowd.  Sometimes they will give you a couple of minutes of English conversation.  Once again, the more you wow them with your conversational skills, the more they will make an extended effort to educate your into how to communicate with them.   
The more you hear ""Dude, you really need to learn German."" or the such, the more they are telling you that they want to help you.   
We are social creatures by nature, all embarressed by these situations and our languages.  A little humour and witty conversation and ice breakers always goes a very long way.

			In regards to torrents: Get Nod32 or equivalent and read comments to each torrent. There problem solved.   
As for the original question, I've used Pimsleur for a few langauges and have found that the retention rate is quite high for everything you do. Downside is even after a few levels your vocabulary is quite low (less than 1000) but you should remember all of it. It's more for conversations rather than true knowledge of a language and you never see the words your learning so you can't learn to read. It starts off with Hi, how are you, good, where do you live, what, what do you want to eat, with me, with you, etc simple things but useful. 
If your an audio learner then it works well, if your visual well.....   
Rosetta Stone: I've never used it myself however from my understanding it's based on a picture/word approach similar to a site like livemocha.com (which is free, try it out). So you see a picture of a horse and the software says Cheval and you associate Cheval with a horse. And repeat.

Jemanden Zucker in den Arsch blasen - ""to blow sugar into someones ass"" - meaning: to suck up to someone.   
Jemanden geht der Arsch auf Grundeis - ""someones hitting anchor ice with his ass"" - meaning: somebody is ""shitting bricks""    
Jemanden schein die Sonne aus dem Arsch - the sun is shining from someones... - meaning: somebody is very happy.   
Jemanden mit dem Arsch ins Gesicht springen - to jump ass-ahead into somebody's face - meaning: threaten/attack somebody...

And yes, with languages it depends on the language in question and you yourself. I always find Spanish fairly easy even if I never really learnt it, but Portuguese rather difficult. In Turkish, when trying some words in Turkish I tend to pronounce the Arab way, which they do not like at all. And as German is spoken by so many Turks in so many places so excellently, no problem. Greek is a language which is not mine, but as so many Greeks speak English, no problem. Hebrew is relatively easy, except that many words in Hebrew have quite a different meaning from the same word in Arabic, which irritate. But as virtually all Israelis speak English and amazingly many German, this also is no problem. Interesting was, when I had to make phone-calls to Argentina, the questions ""do you speak English"" ""parlez-vous Français"" lead to nowhere, but ""parliate Italiano""  had quite a positive result fairly often.

The link I gave in my previous posting will direct you to your nearest course.     
But the teacher will usually know more than one language - to help a student totally unable to understand a given word! 
My teacher was a Linguist, and spoke very good english, as well as Albanian, Serb, French, Italian, Spanish, and a few other languages as well, but only used them in dire circumstances! He even knew the different Swiss dialects.

If I follow it with a verb for a specific type of action, I tend to say ""er macht sich"" (ans Putzen, an den Abwasch, etc.)   
If not, which is often the case with the phrase ""going about,"" I use ""er stellt sich."" Meaning, he is going about it in whatever way: 
Er stellt sich dabei unbeholfen an/he's going about this is a clumsy way

My frustration led me to speaking more and more English at home and after I while we stopped using Spanish.  Now I regret this almost daily after seeing how easy my kids have learned German...  ! 
I suggest that you keep speaking English to them even if they answer in German, I bet you they are understanding and retaining everything and the speaking part will come later.  Maybe when they get older they'll be more willing to speak it with you.  I am trying to spend some time now playing games and reading books in Spanish with my kids which keeps their interest and it doesn't feel like extra work for them (My oldest son is now 10 and he actually remembers a lot of words), hopefully this will begin to mend my dumb mistake. 
Good luck!

			I live in your city - the commune might have some lessons for you, even better choices for females. They are slow paced and catered to new arrivals pending their approval for settlement ( asylum seekers for example ), new arrivals such as a foreign spouse and so on. These are low cost and not more than once / 4 hours a week. More information from your Stadt Verwaltung, Florhofstr. 6   
In CH, normally one adapts to the way things are, and not the other way around. Private lessons IMO are the best options for you. There are plenty of DE teachers who can be flexible enough to meet your needs. If you need a certificate of proficiency ( A1, A2, B1 etc. ), you might have to sign up at the test center and / or school, nearest being in Zurich city.

1649	Language corner	Bookshop Storchenpl	pasty	1744	4	Zürich	16.06.2011, 15:39	"    When Friedrich Däniker of the Däniker English Bookshop died in 1989 at only 70 years, his shop was sold to Orell Füssli, who integrated it into their mainshop, but in a rather bad way. Unacceptably bad, a real shame. When Mr Staeheli, a great chap actually, died 10 years later, his shop also was taken over by Orell Füssli, and I feared the worst. But Orell Füssli in the meantime had come under the influence of a family of real professionals from München, and so, what now is the ""English Bookshop"" at Rennweg was continued as was the Interlingua. The Interlingua amazingly retained the Staeheli name to some extent, which is nice. I think that now, both great old gentlemen would be happy to see what has come out of their two shops     
The start of the Staeheli English bookshop had a cultural-political background. Up to WW-II, lots of German language books were simultaneously printed  in Leipzig, Wien + Zürich, as Leipzig was the Capital of German bookprinting. In the first few years of Nazi rule, it was still possible to print good books in Germany, amazingly as it looks. BUT after about 1936, all changed, and books from Leipzig were filled with Nazi ideology. So, as a result of that, Mr Staeheli and his partner decided to go into English language books.

			Okay I am going to attempt to post this one more time, since the last two wouldn't post.  Where to start......my name is Tyra and I am in the U.S.  I found this forum due to teasing from a friend.  He would say things to me in what I now lovingly refer to as swissy (Berndeutsch).  He would taunt me with the fact that there was no translator online that could tell me what he was saying.  Well he was wrong........I found all of you here.  lol.  He even gave me the old chuchichaschtli test!  He and I have become rather close in the months that have passed since this has all started.  He is an amazing man.  He calls me Sweetness and his Sunshine, he has told me macht das dsunne schint.  I make his sun shine.  I wanted to impress him so I'd ask for some translations and how to say certain things on this forum.  Unfortunately he has been right though, I don't have many resources.   
I read your thread about the resources for learning swiss german and some of it has proved to be helpful, but very little.  Most of the listed resources are in German then going to Swiss German or they are not the dialect I am looking for.  I also saw your post about tandem language partners but most people are in Switzerland for that.  I am here in the U.S.  There are no classes here and not much in resources to learn Swiss German in general let alone Berndeutsch.  I want to be able to talk to this man in his beautiful language not mine.  Sorry for the long winded explanation.  I guess what I am getting at.... is I am asking if someone on here could help a little american girl learn some real Swiss German (preferrably Berndeutsch).  I am fully aware that learning another language does not happen over night.  If someone on here invested their time in teaching me I promise you I will not waste it.  Any help would be much appreciated, more than you'll ever know.  I will be in debt to you.

			Hello Simon,   
My name is Nicholas,   
I am actually a Swiss citizen but have lived in the UK since I was about 5 years old and been in China for the past 4 years.   
My mother tongue was Swiss-German, which I unfortunately 'forgot' due to the lack of exposure to it.   
I am at an intermediate stage of fluency in Mandarin and my English is about as British as it gets.   
I am highly keen on regaining ground in Swiss-German and would be more than glad to exchange it for Mandarin and English. The only matter of Concern is that I currently am not in Switzerland so that the exchange (were you so inclined) would have to be undertook via means of something a liken to Skype.   
If you are interested at all, please feel free to contact me via PM   
Yours Respectfully,   
Nicholas.

			I find Swiss more tolerent than Germans on that one. In Germany, I would check the gender first or go for Frau Müller and see if the Müller in question reacts to that... if it's a Herr, you just have to add a sentence in your next letter with a polite appology and if it is a Frau, it's bingo. My experience: Frauen hate to be called Herr and make big fuzz (German expression for that would be    ), the other way around will just be politely corrected without declaration of war.    
But in CH, I'd go for Frau/Herr Müller if you really can't call them to find out gender or get the first name on a website or email address.

I am not 100% sure if this is the same for all universities but the few that I have checked require the following for entry (this includes normal universities and the engineering schools): 
1) 6 leaving certificate subjects. 
2) Minimum of 3 at higher level with a C or higher in each. 
3) Minimum of 3 at ordinary level with a C or higher in each. 
4) Of the 3 higher level subjects one must be in a natural science or maths. 
5) There is generally a language exam required for entry. Each universities / engineering school's language level required differs.   
If you decide to come to switzerland to study it would of course be best to find out first hand from the university what is required.   
I have lived in Fribourg for the last year learning french for entry to the university here (high langauge level required for Fribourg, b2+ in german or french in reference to CELP). Fribourg is very much a student town, similar to galway I would say.   
I can give you a rundown of what kind of prices you'd be facing if you like (of course those would be figures for fribourg).

			when I first came I chose private lessons in the place closest to my work.  It cost 110 CHF per hour which I find a huge amount of money but I figured it would be worth it.  When I arrived the informed me that the sell these lessons in blocks of 10 - which meant that I owed them 1100 CHF, all I had done was sent an email!   
I didn't care for the teaching style or the materials so I didn't renew after this initial welcome to Switzerland experience.  I have since done a one year course of 2 hours per week and a LOT of my own work, I am now able to communicate quite well, here are the resources I have used, some are free some are low cost   
All the best!       Here is the translation dictionary that I use, you can get a toolbar in your browser and when you highlight a word you click a link to go straight to the translation, make a user account and you can save words to your vocabulary list   www.dict.cc     If you need to know how to conjugate a verb then go to the next link   http://www.verbix.com/languages/german.shtml   Type in the infinitive and your off     http://www.canoo.net/   Very good resource - does too many things for me to explain     Podcasts   www.slowgerman.com   www.geo.de  (seacrch for podcasts)     They are free - the first one is good for beginners.     Reading   www.spiegel.de   A bit advanced but easier than speigel magazine which I also recommend when you progress   www.geo.de   Also not really ideal for beginners - but the stuff they write about is really interesting so keep it for when you progress     www.bkyi.com   Flashcard software - you can get free stuff which is good for beginners or buy it if you want to make your own, I make my own and find it really helpful     I can't remember the text to speech software that I use at the moment, I have it at home.  It isn't free but for the package and two native German voices I paid about CFH 100 - well worth it for what I have been able to do.  You can make mp3s and have them playing on your ipod while you work.  This takes care of all memory work which doesn't have any logic.       I really recommend this   http://www.amazon.co.uk/Frequency-Di...2307674&amp;sr=8-1   It is not really cheap but again well worth it - instead of learning random stuff you can learn the words that are used the most.

Being in the French speaking part of CH - your closest CELTA centre is in Geneva (The Bell School) see link above.   
At this moment in time you can only do the CELTA there, and in Zurich (FT)Full time and in Baden (The language Centre) part time   
As from next year you'll be able to also do the CELTA in St Gallen (part time with Cambridge ESOL) and in Basel Full-time (based at academia school)   
I was a tutor on a CELTA course in York UK.                
1) Fees for the intensive course in the UK are much lower than here in CH    
1095 pounds in the UK - between 3,700 - 4,000+CHF in Switzerland   
(this means if you know someone you can stay with in the UK, it can actually turn out cheaper to do it there)   
2) The CELTA course and your experience on it very much depends on the type of tutors you have.    
3) If you opt to do the intensive don't even consider commuting anymore than 40 mins   it is very intensive to say the least.   
4) The CELTA certainly will help in getting you through the door and into jobs, but the certificate is done in 4 weeks - it provides you with a foundation or a basis to work from. In other words teachers post CELTA normally still need plenty of professional development and training.   
5) Based on the above point - once you have the CELTA it isn't ideal to just then go off and teach in isolation - good schools will offer teachers   internal development opportunities in the form of workshops and teachers meetings and the possibility of a mentor system. These are very valuable. Good schools will also offer to pay for 1 or 2 newer teachers to attend national ETAS conferences as part of that development.     
Hope that helps somewhat

I found them very flexible, and supportive. I was hospitalised and the owner and my tutor sent me a get well card, and when I came out of hospital they arranged for me to switch to a different lesson model that meant less pressure - and they gave me a good deal on the switch.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but you all seem pretty nice, so here goes:   
I'm currently a grad. student in education in Hawaii.  In a year and 2 months, I'll have a master's in teaching (secondary English).  My wife and I have a dream to live in Switzerland...specifically Basel.  We've never even been to Europe, but love traveling, languages, and culture.  We've also spent a lot of time in Japan (she's Japanese), so we're very comfortable living in countries other than our own.  We want to make this dream a reality, so we're both studying Pimsleur German.  Will that work for getting around Switzerland?  There is also a Pimsleur Swiss German, but it's only like 10 lessons vs. the 90 for the more ""standardized"" German.   
Also, any other enlightening info on life in Switzerland and Basel would be great!  Is it hard getting a teaching job in Basel?  Would love to work at the international school or even a Swiss school for that matter, though that would have to wait for the language skills to improve.

Also some questions   
How do you compare to other schools 
- a friendly professionnal team with aims and sucessfull methods in 29 schools 
around the world for more than 40 years    
What makes your school unique: 
- our professionalism and the way we follow the students, the atmosphere of the 
school   
What is the teaching style used 
- communicative teaching and work on 4 competences: speaking, listening, reading 
and writing   
How many students in a class: 
- max 14   
What is the teachers background: 
- master (university) and specific pedagogical study   
What is the average profile of the students: 
From 16 years old until 84, international and all social environments   
What is the proficiency of students once they finish the beginners intensive  
Class: 
- depends on their own capacity, but when we say that the level is reached, they 
can interact in a simple way, askand answer simple questions about themselves, 
where they live, people they know and things they have, initiate and respond to 
simple statements in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.

I live in Basel, a bit too far maybe to meet up especially I have no car but if you can write to me in French if you want! I am French, and I have lived in the UK for 10 years before ending up in Basel a few months ago. I have 2 children, one is 3 and the other one is 13 weeks old! That keeps me quite busy at home! I studied a bit Mandarin a few years ago, I loved it, I think it is such a great language. I actually finds it easier to learn than German! My German is close to zero but I am learning, step by step, as much as I can. So maybe I could try to write to you in German and you could write to me in French.

			There are two different things:   
- There is a determinant/article in front, in your sentence: zwei.  
- The questions is: Does it have the needed ending matching Gender/case? 
- When not (here because it is a number where one can not add an ending), then the normal ending goes over to the adjective if there is one. - If several adjectives, they all take the same ending, for order and clarity's sake.  
- If yes, the normal ending is on the determainant/article (eine, dem, jener, dieses...) then the adjective take a ""fill-in"" ending just to fill in the blanc. 
- There are three cases where ein does not take an ending even though it logically should (Masculin Nominative, Neuter Nominative, Neuter Accusative). The normal ending jumps over to the adjective if there is one.   
Therefore:

Ein rot er  Hut würde dir gut stehen

			Ok, here is the first part and the Refrain in some poor english:   
Sepp has a cat that reproduces very fast 
thats why he gives the cat as a present to his godchild 
he takes a basket and puts the animal in it 
and wrote ""she is yours forever""   
Refrain: 
But the cat returns, suddenly she stands there 
The cat returns with the kittens arranged behind 
You won't believe it, it's kind of gruesome (not sure about that) 
miau, miau, miau, in front of the house she stands

			How about us getting back on topic. Has anyone been in this situation? What did you do? 
My first thought was, if you don't 'have' to use the language in everyday life, go for a trip, even a short one, to the country or area of the language that you are learning and try out the bit you already have. Sometimes it is depressing, but sometimes, when you understand just few words, you are very motivated to have another shot.  
Sometimes taking a short break isn't a bad thing. You don't forget all you have learned by any means, and listening to an early lesson, or reading one of the first chapters again, can be quite fun.

			Hello,   
I am looking for somebody who can offer private German classes at a good price or in eschange for Spanish lessons. I am a certified teacher of Spanish and professional translator of English. I am very good with languages so I would like just somebody who can explain some small issues and give me some direction of what to study. At the moment I am only working part time as a Spanish teacher so I need somedy who can make a good offer for classes or somebody who is interested in exchanging the lessons for Spanish. Please note that I am not interested in just making conversation in German I need somebody that can more or less explain and teach me the language. 
I live in Kreis 6 and have a place that I use for teaching Spanish so we could make the lessons there or somewhere in the city.   
If you are interested please send me a PM.   
PS: I need somebody that commit meeting at least once a week. I had students before teaching me German but it was terrible to have a class a month so please only write if you can commit minimum one hour a week   
Thanks!!!

			Go figure, I came here to learn German. I arrived here 3 months and 2 weeks ago and I started my German classes after 2 weeks of my arrival.  
I have been wanting to learn German since I was in Gymnasium but most of the schools in my country offer English, French, Latin, some even Russian, German-not so many schools, unless you go to a School or High School that have German classes or everything is in German. I learned English, French and bit Latin.  
Anyway, none of my friends speak German so I was watching TV programmes in German which I liked and I was keep saying that  I want to learn German, it sounds so nice, I like the writting  bla bla. 
So I said ''Ok, I really want to learn German and I have to do something about it''. So I came here. Before coming here I was saying ''Oh I will learn it quite fast, I understand a bit, I know the basic words'' so I was enthusiastic and open to everything that my German course and teacher would offer me. Of course I know and I have been told by so many people in my country and even here that German is not an easy language and why do I really want to learn it? Well, I just want to. 
Now, after 3 months, what do I know?- waaaay too less things than I expected!! I think I expected too much from my self!! I can not believe that after 3 months of German classes I am cr@p. I understand, I read quite well, I write well but my speaking sucks. I have no words, I don't know how to make a right sentence and I am confused. 
I even have some people in my class that have been living here for 4yrs or 6 yrs and they don't speak German! I didn't ask them but the reasons in my opinion are: they have a job that doesn't require German, their friends and families don't speak German and they preffer to speak their native language, when they go shopping they just pick things from the shelf or search for them untill they find it, instead of asking for help, and they just pay on the way out, if they need help somewhere they will just use their English. 
In my case I want to apply for UZH but apparently they only have  1 German test a year, in January 2011, and I have to get to a B2 level by then, for me it is impossible! I am going to an A1 level eventhough all the tests I am taking (online) say I am an A2 towards B1 level (maybe they are wrong) but I am so dissapointed because I can't apply next year and I will lose a year just like that, that I don't even have the drive to learn German anymore, I feel I came here for nothing and it will take me so much time to learn it that I will get bored of it. In fact I am bored on my German class because everybody is slow and I don't like being slow, I want to progress. I think I will change the class/level or take a break.

			The International English route really is the way to go for anyone typing more than three umlauts/accents in a message. The cut/paste from the Character map can truly get tedious.   
You can easily *push in the clutch* for the International English for the duration and then then shift back. As soon as you define multiple input languages, you can get a little menu added to the task bar with a keyboard button from which you can switch back and forth. (Be careful: I often accidentally stumble upon the keyboard shortcuts (which I've since disabled) to switch between input locales).   
These characters are called ""diacriticals"" - consisting of the accent character and then the accented character (e.g.: "" and then a  to form ä). If you ARE in international English and you want one of the characters, if you just press "", you'll see nothing. I often use "" followed by a space. Once the diacritical isn't ""satisfied"" (i.e., after "" you enter something for which there's no umlaut), you get the "" and then the character. "" and then z gives you ""z. "" and then space gives you only the "" (the same holds true for the others, "", ', etc.). ' and e gives you é. Oddly, ' and c gives you ç.

For anyone who is keen on learning German, i highly recommend Bellingua which is near Lowenstrasse.

The teachers are really good and the administrative staff are helpful and very efficient. This is not a publicity ad, but after trying out a few other schools, i know how frustrating it must be to feel like some schools are only keen on earning your $$$.

1773	Language corner	German Lessons (aimed towards business)	Gully	659	0	Argau	14.12.2010, 14:05	"   Hi All     Having been born in Switzerland but moved to England at age 7 I now find myself back here (after 25 years) at a German speaking company, but with the effective German vocabulary of a 7 year old!  Fortunately most of my work is graphics based and does not require high proficiency of German.  I have had a lot of experience of Project and People Management in UK (I'm APMP qualified) and would like to transfer these skills over to my work in Switzerland.     Therefore, my Manager and I have agreed to send me on a German course.  However, I'm struggling to find the right one to suit my standard.  Ideally, I would like a course aimed at introduction to German business language.  My spoken German is very good (in a social environment) but my written German (particularly grammar) is awful!!!        Does anyone have any suggestions for where I can get good advice on this matter or can anyone recommend a suitable course for me?  I work near Lenzburg in Aargau and live near Bremgarten, so any course in this region would be preferable.     Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.     Kind regards

I am looking for someone who is interested to meet-up to learn German. This is not like a Tandem but more self-study oriented. I believe that having a study partner may help to keep consistency      
I am at B1 level and would be interested to meet twice a week around 18.00 at ETH or University  I am 28 years old guy currently working as Software Engineer.

1776	Language corner	Resources to learn Bündnerdeutsch	Röschti	1167	0	Tessin	14.12.2010, 02:11	" 
			
			I'm interested in learning Bündnerdeutsch, as I'm quite fascinated by the culture of our (current) neighbour Canton.   
Much to my dismay however I could find no resources whatsoever at the cantonal library here in town about Bündnerdeutsch - or about any other Swiss German dialect for the matter.    
Can anybody suggest good phrasebooks, grammars, dictionaries or other printed or web materials and resources that would help me familiarise with this dialect?   
Also, do you know of narrative or comics written in this dialect, that I could get hold of?   
Or is there any native Grisonian here I could maybe pester with my questions?    
Thanks in advance!

			Several discussions on leo:       
Grammatically the comma does change the meaning, but this is a slogan, so here the sense would be to interpret the sentence as a whole with the comma separating a subjunctive clause.   
You could say and this would carry the meaning. Here also this could be interpreted in two ways but the sense is clear from the interpretation.

			First of all, Ziger, you did not understand that danish is not even my mother tongue.  
Secondly, intelligibility in scandinavia is defined as intelligibility between speakers of different languages. 
Third point, intelligibility between English speakers is a question of intelligibility between speakers of the same language.   
So, one more time more simple words: 
It is easy to understand each other NO/DK with a little willingness although the differences are defining them as different languages,  
THUS, 
understanding other English speakers should not be more difficult that scandinavians among themselves do.   
But do NOT put words into my mouth, what you infer about yourself from my message are your imagination only, not my words.  
And don't lecture me on topics I have a master degree in and places I spent six years in. Thanks.

German TV shows: 
- Schlag den Raab - it's a show where some candiates compete against a German TV moderator in different kinds of sports 
- TV Total - kind of like a late night comedy show with the same guy as in the above Stefan Raab 
- Wetten dass...? - live bets on TV with celebrities 
- Wer wird Millionaer? - German version of who wants to be a millionaire - might actually be good for learning german vocab 
- Deutschland sucht den Superstar - German version of American Idol or Pop Idol   
TV series: 
- Tatort - crime series 
- Galileo - more like a knowledge/documentary series 
- Komissar Rex - not sure if that one actually still runs but its also a crime series - main character is a German shepherd 
- Der Alte - crime series 
- Ein Fall fuer 2 - also crime series     
Im not a soap fan and I cannot stand Desperate Housewives, Lost, all these soppy hospital series etc. I have a short attention span when it comes to those and I cannot follow every day whilenothing ever happens and then the season ends. If you want cheesy German soaps though, try Lindenstrasse, Marienhof, Unter Uns, Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten, Verbotene Liebe.   
I assume you can get these online somewhere. ARD and ZDF (German public TV stations have shows online, look for the Mediathek on their websites   and   )

			I am not sure what you expect from your French speaking friends, if it is to learn the lingo - think about what benefit they would have form hanging out with you...It sounds funny, I know, but if people speak no language or a very little, it gets boring to constantly correct. If you speak well, then of course you will find friends in no time (yes, it is efficient), especially given your outgoing personality, etc. But if your level is low, take a class and maximize your exposure (extra conv classes, language exchanges, etc.) Volunteering is really good, people are patient, will help you out. But you might want to rethink your apparel maybe, image, etc. - some of the religious volunteering organizations might object   and also the fact that culturally, people here are a lot more...low key, down playing themselves, not as suggestive, etc. and from your posts, it seems you are one of a big kinky party animal. So, if you want friends, you will most probably click with similar mindsets, students, young organisations (there is something called Org for free time, I know they have bunch of courses, afternoon activities, Geneva is really good with this, google it). Uni is a great source for activities, as well. In fact, I am heading today to a Ge mycological society, since I love picking mushrooms and it is too cool to miss. Might not be your cup of tea, but the French I am learning - fab, much better than courses! Just look around, go to theater groups, some activity driven bunch of peeps, so you don't just party. Good luck and up and at it (books ain't that bad, afterall, I promise...)

A very large proportion of the books are in English, all the library staff speak terrific English - there will be plenty of people for you to talk to, and who will happily give you a hand with translating an electric bill and whatnot.   
In the wider area, you could very easily 'survive' with just English, but will of course have a better and more enriching experience if you move into French-speaking circles.  Any attempt at all with the language, even if the conversation then switches to English, is met with encouragement and pleasure as so many people here just stay in their English comfort zone and expect the shop staff, mechanics, etc to make all the concessions.   
Lots of info on here already about good ways to learn languages - scan the threads.   
Good luck for your move.

			Your English has a lot of grammar errors and oddities.  For the most part your sentences are understandable but take some work to get through.  For example, I have noticed that saying ""Ein dunkles Weizen, bitte"" in a pub works far better than ""Ein dunkel Weizen, bitte"".  The former is actually understood faster and easier even though both should be obvious.   
I will give you a few points to remember, but really an instructor should be explaining this to you in person:   
In English it extremely rare and somewhat poetic to have an object be ""he"" or ""she"".   
Next, you normally don't want a comma before that. Especially when it introduce a clause serving as an object.  ""I see that you are right."" is right, ""I see, that you are right."" is wrong.    
""like for example"" is extremely casual, you would in any serious writing replace it with something else, such as ""such as"".   
P.S. I think that billhardie made some changes which are themselves mistakes. e.g. reknown is not a word in English and ""such as 'thanks giving' for example"" is redundant in a bad way.

It would have started this week if enough people signed up, but it will start when they get 10 people.  They also have childcare available for children 6 months and older for $150 for the term.  I don't know if they will prorate the cost for the time missed due to a late start date.  But it's such a deal!

If I knew a bit of Welsh or a bit of Rumantsch, yes, I would probably go out of my way to find practice opportunities.  I would chat indefatigably about yesterday's weather and My Hometown and the new red shoes of the baker's wife's cousin's daughter and be thrilled just to be   the language no matter how banal the topic.     
Living in Zurich, though, I get enough German immersion just going about my daily life that I don't feel the need to seek it out specially.  As it is, I socialize pretty indiscriminately: I go out with whoever I feel like  going out with, and speak whichever language that calls for as well as I  can, and if I can't speak it I nod and smile.  I don't exclaim over new  idioms, take notes or ask people to repeat themselves because (a) I  have a special horror of being a nuisance, and (b) it is too much like  work.  Treating your whole social life as a language lab may be a worthy idea  but it is   tedious.

			When talking to Germans, even ""real"" Swiss tend to translate - Handy - because they know Natel is widely unknown in Germany.  
When speaking to foreigners in German, some Swiss will keep the perfectly Schriftdeutsch Natel, others will change it into the more German Hochdeutsch Handy. Some Swiss may think (wrongly) that Natel is dialectal and will be hypercorrect and use the German word that they think is more Hochdeutsch.   
In short: you will hear both, but mind the reasonning behind the word change. And Natel is perfectly correct Swiss Hochdeutsch, written and spoken.

1934	Language corner	Genders in French	SwissPete	1159	11	California	07.08.2010, 23:43	"    Yes, it does, especially when speaking.   
When writing, the mistakes appear quite obviously, because it is very rare that a word properly spelled can have either a masculine or feminine meanings .   
When speaking, the gender-mistakes can be of little importance quite often, but it can also be really confusing with a bit bad luck, or too much confidence/persistence in the ""wrong"" gender.   
Some words, by sound, have different meanings when they are used with a masculine or feminine article. Here are some examples that pop to my mind :   
 - la fête (the party), le faîte (the top) or le fait (the fact).   ( ) /=    
 - un fil (a thread, or a phone call), une file (a queue).    
 - un noeud (a knot), une (one, a she-thing).  .   
 - un père (the father) une paire (a pair).    
 - la vie, le vit... J'aime la vie, j'aime le vit...   
It can also be confusing, and turn a proper sentence in a mess (so imagine the mess it can become if there is some additional mistakes...) For example : 
 - [correct]   ( ) 
 - [not correct]   ( , with a lacking article for  , and a foreigner-like pronunciation for  )   
The gender gets also declined, so the mistake can become more subtle : 
- [correct]  (de le => du ) 
 - [not correct]  de la pain = deux lapins, so: )   
If you use a pronoun (il/elle) for naming wrongly a feminine/masculine thing, then it become even more confusing.   instead of  .   
I guess it requires some serious efforts to remember the masculine/feminine of things, but it's worth it. People having French as their mother tongue would almost never mingle the masculine and feminine of things, so it's quite unexpected for them when foreigners make such mistakes, especially when the mistakes are amplified by a logically-correct declinations of adjectives and pronouns; for example:  , the mistake can be understood only when the last word is pronounced, and before that,  and   had quite rule out the eventuality that the feminine word   would be finally pronounced, let's say that some French-speaking would think the last pronounced is more likely tableau (masculine) than table.

I'm not that showing a birth certificate not more than 6 months old over a passport is proof of an unforced marriage. Irrespective how can the Swiss authorities accept a visa application from a married couple if this is what they are really seeking to prove without these very same checks... Your argument does not stack up and is flawed, insofar that the only way to prove that I am actually the father of the child is not through documentation but through DNA testing.

for bequests which might also be of negative value,  
for freeing the organiser of an event against subsequent claims maybe when a band plays poorly or it rains so you can't pitch a tent etc 
for freeing against claims of value something for which you have not paid classically here are free air tickets through collecting miles

			Glad to know someone else has this question....I am actually pretty fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and German, but the use of the Du and Sie form is totally different in each language, and depends upon the country, even within the same language....(Spanish in Spain is not the same, as in South America, especially in relation to the use of ""tu"" and ""Usted"").   
So, is the use of Du and Sie the same between Germans and Swiss? I had this adorable young man as a patient today, and found myself floating between du and Sie for the entire appointment and finally felt rather foolish....help!

Such lessons are either free, or very affordable. you might also wish to look into RAV providing you DE lessons through an authorised provider ( some reputable schools are on the panel list )   you are eligible. Another option, as a student, is to tandem with a fellow student.

I found LSI a mixed bag - one tutor I had was great for me (very structured, grammatical, logical rule based approach to the language), but had a girl in our course near to tears on numerous occasions as he could not appreciate that style wasn't working well for her.   
In other respects I found it frustrating - they were disorganised, sometimes having no desks available for the class.  The afternoon discussion classes were pretty random, and seemed to suit the interests of the tutor better than the student - one guy took us to visits to the Landesmuseum and medical museum, sometimes we watched films (albeit in German, but on a dodgy little TV with crappy speakers).  Found all that pretty unsatisfactory.

This happened to me my first month or so, but as I improved my pronunciation and fluency it stopped happening. In fact the opposite happened - many Swiss would then be embarassed to speak English around me, as if I would judge them. I found this most curious. Nowadays I only get the switch to english thing once in a while, usually from someone who is overjoyed at the chance to practice.   
One thing to bear in mind that many expats, even though they work really hard on their german seem to do very little work on their pronunciation. The English seem to have a habit of putting umlauts on all their vowel sounds and refusing to do the deeper sounds such as u and o. Most insist on pronouncing Zug as ""Zoooog"" (as if it were spelt süüg in German). Many Americans seem totally unaware of the rolling ""R"" in German, flattening it and dragging it into a nasal sound which is like fingernails on a blackboard to a native speaker. These dead giveaways simply trigger a response in a native that ""this person is very uncomfortable with German"" and the response would come in English simply out of politeness.   
To think about it another way - imagine you are in the UK and someone comes up to you and says ""vitch vay to bahnhof"". You'd hear the heavy accent and probably answer in German. But if you just heard a light German accent, you'd most likely answer in English.

Have a look at    
I am on my third course.  They are cheap and the teachers friendly and the work books they use suit me  (lots of pics to explain things.  I learn by seeing rather than hearing!)   
It is subsidised and as it is part of the integration service for foreigners, you get a huge mix of nationalities  so of course all the classes are in German but that is nothing to worry about even as a complete beginner.  You can attend courses without living in Baselland but they will no doubt charge more.   
I also recommend Michele Thomas cds to start you off.  Really helps explain things and helps with the pronunciation and reading   
Good luck

			OK, I went to the RAV interview today.  They told me I need to be in CH at least 3 months, submit 5 to 8 job applications a month, send them proof that I was denied. After the 3 months, they will pay for the German Language class. In the same school I'm in.   
They also told me, that they have 2,000 people registered jobless ( don't know if in that office or the Canton) and they only find around 50 jobs a month for them, and usually they are low skilled jobs. So I was better off, getting a headhunter or looking on my own than using their services.   
They told me where to get my Bachelor's diploma certified, also to get my social security card (AHV) and some other tips. So I guess it was worth it.    
Good Luck All!

Anyway, this guy - who was neither saggar-maker nor saggar-maker's bottom-dropper nor yet the saggar-maker's bottom-dropper's mate - would hit the stove hard with a large stick to unstick them; hence,  .

So, you're from around Hannover?  :-)   
Indeed a lot of 'Swiss German words' are spoken in Germany.  Though it tends to be in the Allemanisch and Schwaebisch areas.   From what I understand, the Bavarian German dialect is much different than that from northern Germany (or at least that's what a friend who is from Munich mentioned).   
One thing that always amuses me is that the Swiss almost always pronounce German placenames in perfect High German.  For example, Weil am Rhein, just north of Basel is pronounced Wyyl am Rhyy by many of the local Germans, but not by the Swiss.     
BTW, in the Basel dialect it's

			Exactly. First I was going to suggest a translator. A text like this (especially towards the end) can easily be misinterpreted.   
Asking readers to give you a reference as to the level of your writing, well, that's something more conceivable.   
It depends, of course, what you want to use the language for. I guess in some contexts, it could be sufficient, while in others not.   
As a teacher, I'd just suggest that you do other things than translate (provided that the text is your work). Sometimes one's mother tongue can negatively influence the output, given the differences between the two languages. Try forgetting about the original language and use the (little or more) English you have. I know its more and more difficult to do as we get older, but it improves our skills a lot if we don't rely on our mother tongue but use the rules and words we know in the other language. And reading similar texts than the one you're trying to write will give you an idea of the phrases you might use   "	11	 Jan 2010	1.0	['0', '0']	['1', '1']	-1

If you are a native French speaker living in the Lausanne area, and you have a child similar in age to mine, please send me a PM!   
I used to run English speaking playgroups for kids aged 0-4 and their parents (so I am used to teaching rhymes, doing story time, engaging kids in various games and craft activities, etc.).   
If you can teach me French (with my child in tow), I can help you with your English or do some fun stuff in English with your child.

Since it has a news-like structure, it's pretty easy not to lose concentration.

The ones which are meant to preschoolers (say Mickey Mouse Wunderhaus, Winnie the Pooh, Dora, Caillou) guarantee a pretty high rate of understanding since the concepts and words are...well...suitable for toddlers.

West  Germanic ( Eventually High German as we know it today) 
North Germanic  ( Swedish/Danish)   
Martin Luther- fascinating guy, did a great job of translating bibles from Low German ( basically Dutch) to High German, and it's because of him we have High German today.   
Have recently observed, how like Dutch Swiss German sounds,  
1. Words like Hoi 
2.dropping of the end of verbs and words 
3. Guttural G,     
perhaps then it is a mixture of Yiddish and Dutch sounding idiosyncrasies, or simply- it is influenced by many influences over time.

Expect an answer to be more on the long term though: landlords or parking lots owners look for long terms rental.

			Gosh, what a topic! You're confusing me, and I am German!  
I am trying to think of a simple rule... all I can come up with ist this: 
Strangers are always ""Sie"" unless they are children/teenagers. 
Once you get to know people it gets a little complicated... if your German is good enough you can try and juggle around addressing people. If not it is always safe (but somtimes a little impolite) to use ""Sie"". If in doubt, why don't you simply ask? Coming to think of it, that's what I do (here in the French part), and people mostly respond well.  
Don't despair,

One Hauswart I know well (he and his wife look after a group of small buildings) told me that the state some people leave the laundry room in can be awful.    
What I find amazing is that in flats with specific wash days and sign up sheets, you almost always know who the culprit is. The best thing is to tell the Hauswart and let them confront the culprit. Unfortunately, no amount of signage or rules is going to change the way some people behave.    
It's a real pain when you have to clean up after someone before you can begin washing.   
It's no wonder everyone wants their own washer/dryer. This is becoming more and more popular now and some people are willing to pay that little bit extra for this.    
Other than flats built to be sold, renovated apartments in unusual buildings (without cellars) tend to have their own laundry, as do houses. The advantage of the shared laundry is you have more drying space often with a wall dryer.

Don't be fooled by the course being called 'Basic' - it goes from beginner up to a very solid B1, almost B2 level (good enough for free-flowing conversation and almost any situation you'll find yourself in).   
Choose a course (I'd recommend Basic, then after a few months try the Phonology to tidy up pronunciation of those tricky vowels), open up the workbook, then play the associated 'tape'.   
(Edit: Just been reading the forums on the FSI site, and apparently for total beginners it's best to start with the Phonology THEN move to the Basic; if you already have rusty school French you could do it the other way round, which is what I did.)   
It's an old course, from around the 1960s or 70s I think, so don't expect whizzy graphics or fun.  It's traditional learning, with lots of repetition and lots of verb drills.  But it's very, very effective, very comprehensive and totally free!   
kodokan   
PS: There are also lots of other languages on the FSI course, including German and Italian

			Hello Everyone,   
I saw the other thread about people meeting in Zurich on Wednesdays to practice their German and was wondering if anyone would like to meet on the weekend? My thought was Saturday mornings, around 10am, maybe once or twice a month. I have an English playgroup so we could use my space and you can bring your kids along if needed -- plenty of toys for them to play with! It just might be a bit noisy but I think this could be convienient for moms.   
Anyone intererested? My space is located in 8966 Oberwil-Lieli.

			I have had a few lessons from a few different schools.  I have foudn they all have good and not so good teachers - the porgrams are all relatively similar.  I currently have a truly excellent teacher with lots of energy and she is also pretty imaginative.  The school is Hull's school.  The teacher I had before her was not so good.         
In the past I had Lingua-top ( ).  Teh guy that set up the company is an excellent teacher, otherwise I had one excellent and one rubbish teacher from them.   
I have a firend who went to a migros school for a while, level B1-B2 and he was happy with that.

A favorite of mine is : ""chacun sa merde"", literally ""everyone (has) their schitt"". As far as I can tell, it means ""each to his own"", but is much more satisfyingly rude. Improved interpretations welcome!

SummerBreeze	3048	33	Presidentsungada	26.01.2010, 19:53	"    And to really speed up the process, read out loud.  Remember how you learned to chant times tables as a kid, so that merely by saying '5 nines are...' the answer would pop into your head to finish the pattern?  It's just like that - after a while, sentences will just 'sound' right, the way they do in your native language.   
Pronunciation doesn't matter for this, so don't worry overmuch about it.  And make it easy on yourself - stick things up around the house, so you can read out loud little and often.  Our entire downstairs bathroom is wallpapered with articles and kids' comics, and I regularly change what's on the kitchen cupboard above where the kettle boils.

			hello   
i've been a student at both Goethe and GLS in Berlin. Goethe is very expensive relative to the other schools in Berlin, but the teachers are very good and I would rate the course highly.   
Prior to Goethe I was at GLS   which is a lot cheaper and the teachers I had were also pretty good. If i was going back I would probably just go to GLS because its cheaper and at my beginner level its all pretty much the same. You can start any monday from one week up. This is good but also a downside if you're there a little longer as your classmates always change.   
Another option is the volkshochschule, there are branches all around Berlin at its very cheap but i hear the teaching quality can vary. This is the one nearest to me when I was there      
if you're a german citizen there is also some deal where the government will subsidise 600 hours of german language courses at VHS, but unfortunately I didn't hear about it till I was about to leave. I can dig up some details if thats the case for you.

			I think it would depend upon your usage needs...?   
If you are looking to work in some corporate office, it is likely that your needs will be for ""High"" German and English (assuming one is hired from the standpoint that they ALREADY speak English) and then learn Swiss German for day-to-day dealings outside of work.   
ON the other hand - 
If one is working in a ""front line"" position, say a hotel desk clerk, a store sales associate, a restaurant server... I think learning Swiss German first is more valuable as spoken communication then takes precedence over written.

			They usually do give you a test which is aimed to find out at what level of profficiency you are. They are cost free. If you have no idea about German alphabet and never spoke a word I would simply tell them it is a waste of time on both sides. However if you have some basics and you can remember anything, it's good to determine where you would best fit. Sometimes taking A1 level is not fun and you could rehearse entire book in few days.

2220	Language corner	Short German translation help- rental application?	ZenAgent	1388	3	Solothurn	10.01.2010, 18:32	"    Shopping on credit has become more common in Switzerland in the last few  years, partly as a new business of the banking industry, party because  of increasing financial constraints. Furniture stores such as 'Pfister' now even offer their own installment options and credit cards.   
'Mobiliar' is usually limited to furniture only. Landlords often ask many very personal questions  simply because they can  I assume the possibility to seize a tenant's furniture (distraint proceedings) is the background of the particular question here.

			Wow....got to love the law of attraction.      
This just triggered a thought. When I learnt Albanian I did it with an Audio course, that speaks about attracting a language rather than learning it. Funny concept in a way, but wow, did it work!    
Anyway.... lol...don't know why I am posting this here.... Just had to think of that when I read ""law of attraction"".    
Hmmmm... maybe can be of help anyway on what concerns learning French.    
I am a French teacher (for primary school kids that is) and I always find that listening to radio programmes or buying books on cd's can help.    
If you are a beginner then try to dive into the language as well as you can, make sure you surround yourself by it, giving your brain the message: This is important.    
Thinking.... I will go and check whether they have those audios in French too....    
Yep.... they do:    
Hurray...  This may really help you. If it is anythign similar to the one I did in Albanian it is well worth it.    
Other than that playgrounds are great places to learn a language in too. Find French speaking moms (if you have any kids, that is) and off you go.... engage in a conversation...

Switzerland should not separate from German. The dialects spoken in the Alsace, in southern Baden-Württemberg up to Stuttgart, in southwestern Bavaria and in Vorarlberg and Tirol are almost or really the same as the Swiss-German ones. ""Native German speakers"" ?  Depends on where they are from. People from South Germany and Western Austria understand most Swiss German dialects.    
Low German is a term which refers to the ""Lowlands"" of NorthWest Germany, with one of its forms being Platt-Deutsch which sounds similar to Dutch (and even English) but by structure and grammar is closer to Standard German than the South German, Swiss German, West Austrian dialects.    
You remind me of a visit to Leipzig and Halle, where I told a local from Halle that Switzerland was positive about German reunification, but at the other hand could have lived with two, three, four or five Germanies, and also for instance with the Kingdom of Bavaria (having Bavarian as national language). It then was HIS point to be VERY positive about the idea   "	982	 Nov 2009	5.0	['20', '18']	['641', '356']	5

			Hi everyone,    
I had already posted this link before for a person looking for a german lessons in Wintethur, but I thought I would post it in this thread too, because ECAP is also in Basel, Bern, Zurich, Luzern, Ticino, Solothurn, Aargau..   
Some of them have childcare, some don't have it, it depends on wich kanton, but almost all of them have evening courses (2 times per week), intensive courses (monday to friday) and saturday courses.   
Just to give you an idea, in Zurich I attend tuesdays and thursdays from 7:00pm to 8:50 aprox. with a ten minute pause, and the cost for 3 months was about CHF420 (I can't remember exactly) but includes books and CD.   
You can check it out in the website   and use   to translate it if you have problems:

			I will be looking to start a German course in Zurich in January, and wondered if anyone else was doing the same.   
I am a complete beginner ( i know about 3 word and pronounce those badly! so will be starting at the bottom - A1 (unless theres a lower level  ) I just thought I'd check to see if anyone else had the same plan.   
I haven't decided where or when yet, ideally evenings, but as I have no idea what time I will be home from work and most courses seemed to start at 6:30 so I might have to be looking at Saturday mornings instead (good bye Friday - drinking sessions  ).   
Anyway if you interesting in starting a course in January feel free to get in touch. I thought it might make the whole thing a bit easier if theres someone to practice with mid week over a couple of drinks.

			i used to keep a notebook (eventually i migrated to excel), in which i maintained a list of words i learnt. but there were too many to note, so i kept only those i thought were useful/interesting. at the beginning, i would conscientiously go back to review the words, but i never recorded the context in which the word was used, which presented various challenges. knowing what a word meant, did not necessarily mean i knew how to   it. nothing stuck, eventually i gave up. its akin to the german theory of ""logical atomism.""   
then i started doing newspaper cuttings, looked up the words and wrote them on some space on the article (printing off the internet gives you more space). this way, i have a finite number of new words to learn, an article that put meanings in context and sentences that demonstrated its use. it's a mini ""logical holism"" that strings everything together nicely. i file them away for future references, as i know certain words are often used in certain topics.   
when learning new words, i accept that i will forget a good portion of what i come across, maybe 50%. so i just try to do as many cuttings as i can   "	304	 Aug 2008	4.0	['0', '0']	['14', '13']	0

			So I have been here for 2.5yrs. I take my german classes each week and I can get by with day to day situations, and basic converstaion. To be honest I am dissapointed with my progress. I have a Swiss Boyfriend and many german speaking (High and Swiss) friends so exposure to the language is not the issue -- but I work in an English Speaking environment which does not help.   
I know that I need to take an intensive class. Unfortuntaley these are aimed at people who are not working. Taking more then a week off at a time is not an option for me, so I was wondering if anyone has been able to find an alternative intensive learning format. 1x per week is not working!

In German and Swiss German, you will find many words with an ""umlaut"", basically: ü ä ö, like in the word Zürich.   
For languages, keyboards, typewriters that do not have/recognize the ""¨"" the letter ""e"" is placed after the vowel, so it can be spelled, Zürich or Zuerich.   
You will come across this variation very often.

They have the EduQua basic QM system (that even the Zurich hairdresser school has - no joke) and make it appear as a sort of ""official governmental accreditation"". They even offer doctorates! When I googled a bit, they seem to target specifically Indian and African distance students. If those print a ""name, MBA"" on their business card in the impression that they did receive ""the real deal"" for their money they might get into trouble in the EU.

Got my Casio G2200 in 2004, it's very handy considering that it carries 5 dictionaries in such a small package. Most of all, (common) word combinations in German are also defined which is practical in the advanced level, when trying to read complicated texts / newspapers on your own.  
It is more expensive than conventional dictionaries at about CHF 400 but it's worth the price..

			To save my pedantry hijacking a recent thread I thought I'd point the difference out here. It may help some people who are in need of one or the other, and could help avoid an embarrassing situation where wrong person has been employed   
A   typically translates the written word from one language to another - books, documents - anything that is written. From my knowledge most translators translate in one direction only, normally from foreign language into mother tongue. Of course there are exceptions to this and it is possible to find translators who can work in both directions equally ably.   
An   translates the spoken word immediately, and does so with both languages - typically employed for interviews, discussions, speeches etc.   
Of course the crossover between the two types is large and there are people who work as both translator and interpreter.

			Hi guys,   
I already introduced myself in the introduction topic thingy... 
My first language is German but i am quite fluent in English too - especially orally (no not the kinda oral some of you might be thinking of now :-)   
Anyway as you can see my English is too informal - so that kinda rules me out for helping Germans learn English...   
But I'd love to help some of you guys out in learning German. I already have experience in doing translation work and i can translate from English to German instantly. I speak German without ANY accent but i CAN speak Alemanic (the basis of Switzerduitsch) if necesary.   
So i would like to offer myself as a tutor or translator and since i wanna gain experiences in tutoring 1 on 1 i would do the tutoring for free (for now).    
Maybe you guys also know some place that i could like register or something, so that i might be able to better get into contact with people looking for a tutor or translator (as i fell just posting it here probably won't reach everyone).   
Anyway i guess it would work doing it via skype or whatever... so if ya interested just drop a reply or send me a PM or whatever...

I'd say go for it, given you have a few years to play with and that you're keen. Given you have a little background in French, maybe start just with that, develop some good learning habits, try it out in real life if you can, then start German.   
The languages are very different and you won't confuse them. You should find French easier though, especially to read, with your background in English.

			In German, ""wenn"" and ""falls"" often can be interchanged, but yes, sometimes it's a matter of vibes to know what's appropriate. I think it's very difficult to cast it into simple rules.    
The very same applies to ""if"" and ""whether"" in English. There are cases where there's not even the slightest doubt, but sometimes even my Michigoose, who is a professional writer, isn't quite sure what to use.

			At various times England was invaded by Romans, Anglo Saxons, Vikings and then the Normans. Each left their mark on English vocab which means often in English you have different words which express the same meaning because English vocab imports words from German, French, Latin etc.  
""Invoice"" is derived from the French word   = to send. Envoy comes from the same root. 
""Bill"" probably comes from the Latin   = a document. 
You could also use ""account"" which came to us via the Latin   meaning a calculation, which became à compter, then  in French. Ditto  ""Facture"" which comes from the French ""Facture"" or German ""Faktur""   
At then end of the day it all means the same ......you have to pay up  "	180	 Mar 2007	3.0	['0', '0']	['39', '29']	1

I have a one hour one-to-one lesson every week, which costs CHF125.  I'm aware that this is more expensive than most other schools and I will consider trying somewhere else when I finish this course.  I can't fault the quality of the lessons though.   
One-to-one has worked very well for me as I did have some school German lying dormant in my brain . . . if I suddenly remember a chunk we can skip on to other stuff quickly.

You're right, getting a job in Switzerland without knowing the language will be difficult to impossible. Just in order to make things clear: The daily, spoken language in the Northern/North Eastern part of the country is NOT German but Alemannic (a topic which is discussed in several threads in this forum). Still, if you want to learn High German, I suggest to see the website of   (however only in German, French, Italian, three of the four official Swiss languages). Migros Klubschule is the largest private school in Switzerland, you can learn anything between languages and repairing a car from them, they are very reasonable pricewise, their teachers are some of the best you can find in Willy Tell's own country. The nearest Migros school however is in Thun, quite a bit away from Lenk. To see where they are to be found in central Switzerland, check  .   
If you have additional questions, feel free to come back. The more you post/ask, the more you'll be noticed. The EF is not only a place of knowledge but also an ideal site to make friends. You'll need them here once you have made the jump over the big pond, they can contribute immensly to your integration into a society that is of course quite a bit different from the one that you are going to leave soon.

			This is aimed to all mothers (or mothers to be) who have recently arrived to the germanic Switzerland.   
I arrived 2 years ago and for me it was very valuable to attend to a MuKi Deutsch course (MuKi is the short form for ""Mutter und Kind"" so it is German for Mother and Child).  I did it in Bern but I know there are courses like that in Basel and Zürich (at least), you just need to go to your gemeinde and query about it.  You might even be welcomed to attend to another gemeinde (if you can get there in time for lessons and there are places available - of course priority is given to residents of the gemeinde).  The greatest thing is that you take your child along (no matter how young - but the setting is ideal for 3-5 year olds, younger than that and you will need to ask, because it will depend in the number of children there) and they learn through play while you are next door,  in a proper classroom setting.  In many cases you don't even need to take a child along (they might be already in school or you might be expecting it  ) to take part.   
The aim of the course is to provide you enough German: I took the above from:  , but I can tell it was very useful to me.  I also did various ""high street"" language courses (a lot more expensive) but none addressed the pointers above and the MuKi courses did.   
As I said, just go to your gemeinde and ask whether they provide a similar course if you are interested.  Hope this is of help!

			I don't know if any of you may know about this already, but I just found out that some gemeindes may offer subsidised German lessons. The one I will be attending is done by Fällanden and it costs  , once a week for 2 hours. It's an integration initiative for mothers and children above 3, although not everyone who attends need to have a child with them (I'm not sure if they include men in this, sorry). The children stay with their mothers during the first part of the lesson with the idea that they would help the mums because children aren't as easily embarrassed. Later they are taken out to a playroom and looked after. Class sizes are up to 12 adults.   
If any of you live in or around Fällanden, this could be a great option for you. I was told that they still have free places. They start end of Aug/early Sept and here is the link to it:   Funnily enough, the site is in German =)   
And if you don't live nearby, check what your gemeinde might offer. You never know.

			"".I think the difference between ""gauche caviar"" and ""bobos"" is that gauchecaviar was mostly used to talk about high profile members of the french socialist party while bobos seems to be used for pretty much any member of the socialist party with money.   
In France ""bobos"" seems to be used with scorn by right wing politicians (to try to divide the left wing electorate) but I really don't see anything wrong with being rich and being for solidarity in society, on the contrary I think it is very respectable.""   
BOBOS is an expression that is pretty much the same as ""gauche caviar"" but that does not only apply to people belonging to the socialitist party. It is also used against any kind of people well off and who pretend to hold ""social"" or ""liberal"" views. The scorn is not aimed at the money in itself but on the feeling many people have of having been betrayed by the socialist party and the left in general.  
Also it is a criticism of the way of life. For instance the fact that they love living in the heart of cities, in old handwork shops ets, thus rising the cost of living for the lesser of who find themselves having to live further and further away from where they live. The term is much more used in France than in Switzerland, though.

2419	Language corner	Advice on French academy or private teacher in Lausanne	j.a.	1624	1	Lausanne	28.07.2009, 17:05	"    If going for the language school then check if they have special offers for foreigners/""certain groups of people"", etc. For example glocals keyword works in some of them.   
I would go for private tutoring as this is extremely flexible and very efficient way of studying. 100% of the teacher time is reserved only for you and your needs. Of course this would cost more - something like 1CHF per minute or more. 
And it's worth to try several teachers, because a) their teaching styles would differ (some will suit you, while others not) b) some teachers are not the best ones...   
No matter which way you choose, try to find a tandem learning language partner in order to practice more...    
There are some blogs and podcast for learning French, but for me their usefulness (as a main learning resource) is rather low, as I want to learn the things I want, and not the things that the author of the site wants me to.

			Hi there!    
Just read your posts. And it turns out that I'm looking for pupils.    
Just to give you my background: I was a primary teacher for 8 years and am now studying science of education.    
I'm presently also giving one-on-one german lessons to English speaking pupils here in Zurich. I'm doing this privately because I found that the schools make you overpay and underpay me.   On average over 100.- CHF on one-on-one lessons and I found that they usually don't even use properly trained teachers.   
This is what I charge: 75.- per lesson. If you need more details don't hesitate to contact me on my e-mail (isabatliner@gmx.li).   
I'll be writing a post to give you more details.   
Have a nice day 
Isabelle.

			Hi Sandra!   
How do you find working in the finance industry in Lugano? Congrats, a bold choice for a woman... but then again Russians are smart (don't ask me to play chess with you =)! I'm also interested in entering that field, but don't they expect you to be fluent in German for this kind of rocket sciency jobs in Switzerland? I suppose your everyday routine is based on English (and possibly Italian for the more informal situations in the workplace)... do you ever run into trouble because of the language, or do you feel pressured into improving your German?   
You say your conversation skills are good, that makes me think your self-assessment as A2/B1 is a little understated. Either that or your grammar/written skills are lagging. Grammar is best learned on your own, with a paper companion of a suitable level. Have you tried reading some  Swiss/German publications about the topics that concern you professionally? E.g. for the same company, my uncle used to keep copies of annual reports in several languages (E, D, F, I, as available) for translation purposes.   
Best of luck!

Badly is still practice, right??

			Hey all, 
Does anyone know TLC Sprachschule in Baden? Especially in relation to their teacher training courses. I'm thinking of doing Module 1 of the DELTA there starting August. The cost is about 2095CHF (and then add exam fee) for face to face, versus the DELTA online which is £350 + £85 exam fee. 
I know the benefits of face to face versus distance, having studied both in the past, but does anyone have anything to say about this school in particular? 
This is the first time Module 1 has run, so I know it might be hit or miss with TLC. The Distance DELTA people have a lot more experiece. So, you can see how I might waver. Anyone with experience of TLC want to chip in?   
Thanks!    
Anyone wants in on a DELTA-esque/ESOL/applied linguistics-ish discussion group from August in Zurich please get in touch.

			We don't expect anyone to learning Swiss German and most probably wouldn't have the slightest clue how you could learn it.  
It's appreciated, however, if you know a few common expressions like 
-Merci instead of Danke 
-Äxgüsi (Excusez-moi) instead of Entschuldigung bitte 
etc.   
And it's probably true that we're happy enough if foreigners speak German, for Germans however, many expect them to at least show the slightest hint of accepting our own ways, so just a word of Swiss-German will be taken kindly.  The reasons for this has probably been explained in many other threads, no reason to go into it again.

			KuniC,  
thanks for your response. If you have been with the same school all these years, it must be good. I was considering taking intensive courses with them in Paris for a month or two, but then my life took an unexpected turn and brought me here to Zurich (which I am very happy about), but I don't want to give up on learning French...  Will look at their website for classes and when it is possible to join. Thanks a lot, again!

			Hi EF'ers,   
I am here now on my 6th week job-hunting holiday and haven't got much of a luck so far   Before my tourist visa expires, am thinking about applying for a student visa to learn German to extend my stay while I look for job.   
I went to Academia (in Basel) to check on their courses, I must say their prices is 7 times more than I would pay to Goethe Institute, Singapore. Its kinda crazy if you asked me   So I wonder if anyone has such a similar situation or if you can recommend any other school (in Basel or nearby) that will offer intensive German courses and is willing to help out on the student visa application. I've check with Migros Club School but they aren't as flexible and their lessons did not meet the requirement of at least 23 lessons per week (required by the authority).   
Would you know if I am able to convert my tourist visa to student visa without leaving the country?   
Thank you all for any advise, and pardon me if this column is the wrong place to post such question    
-Merci vielmal-

Be comforted, though, that even if you can't get any lessons in Stryne, most Australians can also speak limited English.

About a day later you will get many results back - one of which may or may not be a translation of your text.   
You will also get a number of results either telling you how stupid you are for having posted such a dumb translation request and giving you a link which invariably leads to Google.

I am in the intermediate stages of learning Russian so I was hoping for something a bit less painful than that and it seems my assumptions where correct.   
Its actually strange but , in Russian there are many words that are similar to Afrikaans too, possibly owing to proximity between traditional slavic regions and germanic regions   
ie Meubel, Apteek, soldaat, papegaai all have similar Russian equivalents.   
That being said the hardest thing at the moment is trying to find a job in CH. Looks like its getting better but still tough.

			My partner and I did this in Zürich and the form was completely different. I'm kind of taken aback - although I can understand why - about the part asking how you met - kept in touch - etc.   
For me - a US citizen - once we completed the form I had to have an original birth certificate issued within 6 months - a copy of my passport - a notarized residency statement (showing the my current official residence) was outside of Switzerland at the time - and of course the 300CHF or so in fees. However - we made sure we had all of this information prior to going to the canton office and so when we completed the application they reviewed our documents - made copies where necessary and approved the application on the spot. We actually then chose the date for our civil ceremony that day - and were done.   
All in all it was a pretty easy process -- I know -- a shock, right    
Now we are in Schaffhausen - I applied for my B permit and it was issued 7 days later -- of course it took another 10 days for them to notifiy me it was ready - but overall pretty smooth sailing.   
Good luck -- I wish you all the best.

			The question is what *kind* of charity you mean...   
Some of the options German provides are:   
Almosen  = alms 
Barmherzigkeit = mercy or compassion 
Güte = kindness 
Mitleid = sympathy 
Nachsicht = leniency 
Wohltätigkeit = beneficence (from Wohltat = good deed)   
I'd go for the suggestion made already (Wohltätigkeit ohne 
Grenzen) simply because it has the closest equivalents to 
the English uses (a charity bazaar would be a Wohltätigkeitsbazaar 
in German).   
Second option: Güte ohne Grenzen (it has a slightly antiquated 
tone to it, and is a little treacly - charity 'out of the goodness 
of my heart' and the like - but it retains some of the older sense 
of ennoblement that doing good used to have).

			On Ricardo, you could opt for ""Neuwertig"", which means as good as new.  
However, in the case you describe, I would choose ""Gebraucht"" (= used) and then elaborate in the text the actual condition. This will save you getting bad rep if the buyer is disappointed.

			hello everyone 
My mother toungue is italian but as everyday language at work i use english. i have been studying german to a level where i can say the basics and so i have been starting to speak german with the german speaking people but in many cases they prefer speaking english to me and that is so frustrating.....i really want to master this language so that i can integrate myself better here and therefore i'm looking for either german conversation classes or just someone with whom i could practice german in the Thun or also the Bern area. If anyone could let me know. 
thanks a lot

			For those Zurich-living people who are interested in learning French, Alliance Francaise is starting new classes on Apr 27th 2009, and they still have room (I called them to check). Here's class info;       
Study material cost extra on top of that, 48 CHF I was told.    
From what she said A1 is for absolute beginners (no previous knowledge), A2 for slight but very little knowledge. A3 is when you start with future & past, and from there on out I didn't ask, I assume B1 you have some better understanding and can make yourself somewhat understood.

			Hi All,   
After looking a lot on the forum, I realized  we are having numerous replies for the language exchange. But nothing is clear as whether it really works or not.    
So I am posting one more thread for German-English exchange. 
I speak A2 level German and perfect english. So anybody who is interested in some German practice sessions is most welcome. We can meet ones a week over a coffee or beer and can have some fun practicing this difficult language.

			Hi, I agree. Learn High-German. Your son will be fine, but you're the one who's going to have to be able to fill in all the endless forms for everything and understand what they say in the first place and that will all be in High-German.  Once you have the basics then you can try and pick up some Swiss German.   
You'll get by with High German wherever you go in the German speaking area, whereas Swiss German changes from area to area.    
The other thing to consider is how you learn. My daughter has picked up Swiss German from her kinderkrippe but of course, at age four, has no interest in the ins and outs of grammar, whereas that is how you will initially learn.  Your son will learn from hearing and being immersed in it, so he'll pick it up quickly but kids learn in a different way and in a way that is so different to formal  teaching.   
I found the best way for me was to do a combination of class lessons and audio lessons. The audio tapes (Pimsleur) don't explain grammar but get  you talking really quickly while the lessons explained everything and were very complementary to the tapes. Not that I'm anywhere near fluent yet!!   
Good luck!

			I am starting an intensive French course a week from Monday at the Inlingua school in Lausanne.  At the end of my first week I will update this post and let you know how it went.   
The course is every morning, Mon-Fri.  The hours will depend on how many sign up for the class.  They take no more than 8 people per class.  If 6-8 people sign up, it is 3 hours every day.  If it is 4-5 people in the class, the class is for 2 hours and 15 minutes.  We are supposed to call on the Friday before the class starts and they tell us how many people signed up.  I think it starts at 8:30, but I'm not 100% sure about that.   
The cost is 350 CHF per week.  You can skip weeks if you need to (which is why I'm trying this school, because the week-by-week enrollment is so flexible).  Anyway, this is dirt cheap compared to the private tutor that my husband's work had originally set up for us.  That person wanted 115 CHF per hour!

2546	Language corner	Grammar and pronunciation question	kiwiguy08	7094	93	Horgen	23.04.2008, 14:29	"    No, that's wrong (sorry...). Eben and ebenfalls have different meanings. Ebenfalls means - as you said - likewise or as well.   
""Die Kinder kommen ebenfalls"" - the children come as well.   
Eben can mean many different things as an adjective (e.g., flat), but when used as an adverb its typically used to reinforce a statement. ""Ja, eben"" then means something like ""Yes, exactly"".    
""Ja, eben, das habe ich dir doch schon gesagt"" - yes, exactly, that's what I've told you before.   
Just ""eben"" alone basically means ""yes"" with a slight qualifier meaning something like ""yes, why are you telling me that - that's clear anyway"" or ""yes, that's what I've said before"".   
Eben can also mean right now like in ""Er ist eben aus dem Zimmer gegangen"". Well, looking at that sentence eben could also mean something different again, but that's getting too complex. I think best is to try listen to when/how people around you use it. Unless you're sure its probably better not to use it to fill sentences since it actually can alter the meaning of the sentence quite a lot....   
Now, the Konjunktiv question. ""Das wäre"" is correct Konjunktiv II Präsens. So, you better use that. ""Das würde sein"" is actually Konjunktiv II Futur (""das würde morgen sein""). In spoken language people will often use würde for the Konjunktiv II, but in writing its better to use the other forms unless they sound very awkward/old fashioned (e.g., Konjunktiv II of ""gewinnen"" - ""gewönne"" sounds strange - better to say ""würde gewinnen"")   
Hope that helps.....

			To be frank, I've been learning languages since I started school as a kid! In Malaysia, Malay, Mandarin and English is taught in school and then there are the other dialects like Cantonese, Hokkien, Hindi, Tamil, and such which people learn at home. So it's nothing new for me (picking up a new language) - it's just a question of how easy it is to be fluent in a language.   
I started learning French when I was dating the hubby. Felt that it would be important and such not for our relationship but for myself, resume/education/career-wise. However, work commitments made it somewhat difficult to continue and I stopped after a year.   
I continued again after arriving in Switzerland only to stop due to my pregnancy and financial issues. Still, I am using what little French I have learnt (basic-intermediate stuff).    
I read French BDs & Swiss newspapers, listen to French music/radio, watch French films and speak to the HB in French at least once a week (or more). When I go out, I try to start off conversations in French and finish them instead of bailing out with a ""Vous parlez Anglais?"". At my ILs (they are French), it's French, French, French so much so that I learn more in the two weeks I spend with them than two terms of classes back in Malaysia.

			Hi all,   
after living for 4 years in CH, I have made up my mind to learn German  (more oriented to conversation then to grammar).   
I'm looking for a private teacher in Basel, primarily focused on conversation, then to grammar, for me and possibly another colleague of mine. 
Ideally we would enroll for 6-8 hours/week during working time to be decided (Mon to Fri, 9 to 18). 
My first aim is to be able, within 5-6 months, to hold a basic conversation. 
Anyway, I'm willing to discuss for an ongoing service (1 year+)   
If interested (or know someone who might be) you can contact me providing reference, price and the other details.   
Cheers

			Many thanks for all the advice and consolation.  Macchiato, this is the first time I've ever done it (to my knowledge!) so I think I'll be OK... treading on thin ice though...   
Yeah, normally if I'm unsure with someone I'm very good about listening to hear what pronoun   use, but this time there was simply nothing to go on.   
I'm supposed to meet with him tomorrow afternoon - that'll be in English - maybe if I get an opening I'll just ask him then.  In the meantime I guess I'll avoid pronouns if at all possible, and use ""Sie"" if I must use something.     
Question: if I ask him and he does say he would prefer ""Sie"", should that also be my cue not to call him by his first name any more (in German)? It's always seemed to me that there's some correlation there... but maybe I'm just perceiving a rule because I so want there to be one.

			Hi   
I think best for you would be to having someone for language exchange and I hope you will find someone    
Because if you find someone older 18 years and you pay for the lessons and this person has not his/her own registered company or is not employed by e.g. a language school where you get an invoice from you are going to be counted as an employer in Switzerland and you are required to register the person by AHV/IV. This is new since 1.1.2008 in Switzerland. ( )   
If you are looking for one to one teaching from a language school, there are several. We at awewa also offer German lessons in one to one teaching or in small groups. Should you be interested in such an opportunity please feel free to contact me.

			Honestly, I think it is better that you take the German lessons when you are already living on the German side.   
I took German lessons at the école-club Migros, and went to advanced 1 level and when I came here I couldn't understand a iota.   
The thing is, people here don't speak german, they speak swiss german, german is another foreign language for them.  Most of them speak it yes, but not all and they speak it in a different way as the germans.   
my teacher in Geneva, was a great teacher, she came from Hannover and had a beautiful accent.   
But it didn't really helped here.   
Now if you want to take some lessons to be prepared, try to find a german student who is trying to give lessons.   
There are usually plenty of them at the Unis or High schools and they won't charge you 100 CHF per hour.

			I'm a Singaporean working in Beringen but I stay in Schaffhausen. I've been picking up the basics of German on my own but finding it tough to get a good grasp of the grammar.   
The thing is that I can probably put together a simple sentence and hopefully get people to understand me. But my limited vocabulary hampers my ability to comprehend what others are saying to me.   
My main concern right now is to be able to converse fluently at work and on the streets. I need to find a way to learn the language effectively rather than tackling it blindly.   
So bottomline is that I'm trying to find someone who knows German well and wishes to improve on their English or Chinese. Hopefully we can help each other out.    
As mentioned above I stay in Schaffhausen so if by chance anyone is nearby do drop me a PM or make a reply here.

			Hi,   
I have been staying in Baden AG for a few months and am currently taking German lessons. I find, however, that I need more speaking practice than I get at the course. Therefore, I´m looking for somebody with a good knowledge of German (doesn´t have to be native) to meet up for some German talk. In exchange I can help you with your English or Swedish for conversation, grammar or whatever you´d prefer. I am a native Swedish speaker, have a master´s degree in English as well as a teaching degree.  
I am 28 years old, maybe you are about the same age, with or without kids. I would prefer to meet daytime so it would be best if you don´t work full time.    
Please PM me if you or somebody you know might be interested in this!

			Hi,   
I am looking for someone in Luzern to give me 1 on 1 German lessons, my level is intermediate, i can hold a good conversation but my grammar isnt great.   
I feel if i go into a group class i will be good at some areas but way behind in other areas so a private tutor would be best for a few months.   
I think 40-50CHF per hour is reasonable to pay ?   
Thanks for any info

sounds like you and your son are having a good time getting him settled in school! 
I found that my son (he's only 4, though) has picked up an impressive amount of French by being with his maman de jour and her 4 year old son. He can talk about knights and aeroplanes now, and I don't understand the half of it! Maybe you can find him a friend who can teach him the essential boy vocab? I have also seen some good picture books on all kinds of topics called L'imagerie, but I don't know if you are too grown-up for them at the age of 9. 
PM me if you would like to meet up for a cup of tea and a good rant... 
Good luck for your talk to the teacher!

However, to benefit these free courses, you should be officially registered as an un-employed person in Geneva. This means that you must have been working minimum 18 months, and then lost your job. If I understand your situation, you just arrived. So, unfortunately, you will not be able to benefit these free language courses.

			I had this when I went to do a French course in zurich (with the uni!) I was expecting that the teacher would be speaking all the time in French - even to explain things to us as that is how it's always been in my language courses. But he never even tried to explain in French, always in SG! I tried to follow as much as I could but when I didn't understand, someone else in the class explained to me in English. Was quite annoying when he gave us vocab lists to learn though..had to translate from german to english before I could understand the French!

What I mean to say is that your daughter does not necessarily need extra French teaching. But, of course, it will hurt it she gets extra teaching.   "	10	 Jan 2008	1.0	['0', '0']	['2', '2']	0

			So, i have almost completed my 3rd week in the school of Migros. It's basic but hard anyway as I have never studied another language before and never knew what I was letting myself in for.   
It's complete immersion, that is to say, they don't speak in English or anything (unless they are pushed to if you don't know what the hell they are saying ) I mean, it's the only way it can possibly work, there a people in the class from all different parts of the world, 12 students in all and has now decreased to 10 due to reasons unknown.   
The first week flew by, I was learning numbers, verbs, how to introduce myself, where i work, that kind of thing.   
2nd week, we were learning how to put verbs into practise and use them like you would in an everyday conversation. My girlfriend put post-it notes on everything in the house to explain what it was which was a huge help because it meant i was not slowing the class down by having to look into the dictionary all the time to translate a word.   
3rd week and I can already tell a passing chav how ""sorry I am that I cannot give them a cigarette"" which I was immensly proud of    
The learning experience there has been strange and gives you a great injection of the being able to grasp the basics, now they are asking me to do the 2nd level which i will be declining because of the amount of resources available to me on the net and also with help from family and friends.   
In a nutshell, i have found that, even though i am learning with Migros, I am learning pretty slow, you can only learn as fast as the rest of the class are capable of and 1000 chf is quite a lot to shell out considering what you get out of it.   
I will use Rosetta Stone again after I have finished the schooling, it is pretty good but i am extremely glad I took the lessons (so far)  "	56	 Aug 2008	2.0	['1', '1']	['10', '7']	0

			This is the mother of all free online language courses:    
My link is to the French page, but there's a German course down the menu on the left (and tons of other languages).   
It was originally devised for American diplomats being sent overseas, and is designed to go from complete beginner to reasonably fluent coversation standard.   
It's veeeery thorough, to the point of 'gnaw your own foot off to relieve the tedium'-ness, but very, very good, as it makes you repeat the same phrase over and over, with slight variations for conjugation, noun and so on - 'I have a dog, I have a car, he has a dog, they have a car' sort of thing. There are little dialogues, where you first hear the whole thing and then take the different parts within it, as if you're having a conversation.    
I have a lot of French learning packs and out of all of them, bought or free, this is the one that gives me the best workout with actually speaking the language, over and over, until my mouth automatically knows the shape of the words and phrases.   
To use, first open the workbook for the required level (takes a couple of minutes, it's nearly 500 pages) then have it on the screen whilst you listen to the various 'tapes'.   
In the French section, there's also a 'Phonology' course, which takes the language to pieces sentence by sentence, word by word, syllable by syllable, and is immensely useful for improving pronunciation and accent.   
Hope this helps.

Anyway here's what I know which I want to share but remember that its all subject to change as time passes:

Private lessons CHF 50 for an hour 
She has prepared her own materials.   
I'm probably either going to go with Swissing, Harry or Peter  - fwiw.   
You can see that the range for an hour-long lesson on the wide side is between CHF 50-115.  The middle ground is between 80 and 100.   
Please do your homework and don't make the mistake I did.  
Good luck!

			Hi, and thank you for the quick response.     
I am a native English speaker (born in Germany, but grew up in Australia and now live in England.  Been speaking English all my life, and I think I could be a useful practice partner.   
My French is adequate for reading and also conversation, but I still make a lot of mistakes and need to build up speed and gain more confidence.  Ideally I would like to improve my skill to greater fluency, so as to be able to work in a French-speaking environment.   I am taking some conversation  lessons every week, but I would like more practice.  My main interest is in being able to communicate more fluently in French, and I feel that practice is important, but grammar also.    
I expect it is similar for you with English, so if you want to meet up and see how it goes, please send me an email to  .  I normally go home to England of Fridays for the weekend, but I am in Zurich the rest of the time.  I will be in Zurich until December, though they might renew my contract again.

prego as a verb would be the 1st person, present tense, of ""pregare"" (to pray) 
I pray in the church = prego in chiesa 
pregare is also a politer/formal way to say ""to ask"", that is the ""si prega"" form. 
""si prega di non fumare"" = literally ""it is asked to not smoke"" = no smoking, please 
la prego di sedersi = I ask you to sit down = sit down, please

Once or twice a week would work out perfectly well for me and I can help you with French, Italian and German. Do you still need someone for tandem? If not, would you know of a Russian friend who might be interested?   
Looking forward to reading you,   
cheers,   
Laure

Whilst i agree about the Züridütsch with you as being to quick and often like a staccato , I am a Bernese, I rely on lipreading mostly and I find my dialect not particularly difficult, I am lipreading in H Ger ,English and French as well and don't think them either as difficult at all, thus I conclude that it has a lot to do with personal adaptibility and ability.   
For some it may help to book a course with the local Schwerhörigenverein,whereas for others who really struggle it may be easier to switch to High German alltogether.   
I am one of these persons who never had trouble learning or understanding a new language ,but I can not calculate well nor am I any good with numbers in general...... and I know the opposite to this exists as well  I think it has to do with the brain which half of it is your stronger one.

2728	Language corner	Your experience in learning Swiss German please	Vanee	1028	1	Thun, Berne	18.07.2008, 20:37	"    Surely there are others more qualified than me, but my experience might still be of some value...   
I am not fluent in either German or Swiss-German, but what Swiss-German knowledge I do have is built squarely on a foundation of High-German, which IMHO is very helpful, if not downright necessary.  My admittedly limited Swiss-German knowledge and skills have otherwise come mostly from as much ""immersion"" as I've been able to get.  Lots of listening and repeating (and plenty of ""not getting it"").   
Since my initial post-classroom ""immersion"" in both languages during two consecutive summers in Winterthur, I've spent more time in the U.S. than in Switzerland, so it has been a struggle to prevent losing what was gained.  But I have found a few Swiss films on DVD, as well as both   resources, that have allowed me to keep something of an ""ear"" for Swiss-German, and even build some vocabulary, as I would eventually like to return and live there for at least a few years. As you're already there, I think you have access to a much wider selection of resources and tools.   
It sounds to me like you've got more of an advantage than you may realize, with opportunities to listen to, converse with, and learn from other members of your own household.  My family just tolerates my efforts at Swiss-German, though some are interested enough to learn and repeat words and phrases.  But by being there and taking advantage of the opportunities and examples available to you, I think that with patience and perseverance (and as much ""self-immersion"" as you can manage) you can   reach a place where you can adequately communicate in Swiss-German.   
Best wishes for a successful learning experience!

2742	Language corner	[German] 4 niggley things	DaveA	2504	14	Appenzell	30.08.2006, 13:17	"    Your question was whether it was present or perfect? The answer is ""present perfect"". If it were past perfect then both verbs would be in the past - ""I had brought my book with me"", but your sentence indicates that something has ""just happened"" so it is kind of still in the now, even though it refers to the past, hence the term present perfect. Present perfect can also be called ""perfect"" and past perfect can also be called ""pluperfect"". Confused? Excellent    
I agree with Wombat's comment except that ""Ich bringe das Buch mit"" could be used in other situations other than if you are walking towards someone with a book. This is called present continuous in English and would be ""I am bringing"", however present continuous doesn't exist in German, so we use ""Ich bringe"" instead. As well as potentially having a present continuous meaning it could   indicate a habitual action - ""(Jeden Donnestag) bringe ich das Buch"". More importantly it could also indicate a  action - ""bringe ich das Buch"" could indicate that you are going to bring it later.   
Please note that this use indicating the future is not strictly correct. If you look in a grammar book you'll see that the future tense should be ""Ich werde das Buch bringen"". Unfortunately nobody seems to have told any native speakers that they are supposed to use werden in a situation like this, so you'll almost always here the future tense formed without werden in this case... For example - you'll almost always hear ""Ich gehe"" to mean I am going to go. Correct would be ""Ich werde gehen"", but you'll almost never hear it being spoken that way (in either High or Swiss German).   
Hope you aren't more confused that when we started       Agree with Wombat on this one - just wanted to expand a little. Just remember this little joke. A german walks up an Englishman and says ""What for a dog have you?"". The Englishman is puzzled and has no clue with the German means. But if we literally translate and have the same word order we get ""Was für ein Hund haben Sie?"" - In this case the ""What for"" or ""Was für"" means ""what type of"". Note that ""was für"" is two words. Wofür, Wobei, Woran are single words and are questions where the answer can also be paired as ""Dafür, Dabei, Daran"" - I'm guessing you'll get to these later on, but for the moment just remember ""Was für"" to be ""what kind of"". Remember the dog joke - it helps       I agree with Wombat, but I would probably shorten it slightly to ""Hab' ich nicht verstanden"". If said quickly and naturally then the missing ""das"" doesn't sound bad.   
By the way - the good news is that English and German tenses almost map exactly to each other - so once you learn the terminology to describe each tense you can apply those terms in both languages.

Her goal is to pass the German entrance exam of the university of Zurich, thus she will be attending extensive classes which are intended exclusively for preparing to this exam and are conducted by the University of Zurich. My girlfriend is a real hard-worker, she is very motivated, and we estimate that she will need something like 3 lessons a week with a tutor for a period of one month.   
So, if any of you give private lessons in German or know someone who gives those lessons, please contact me. It is recommended that this tutor will be familiar with this exam or have experience with preparing students to such tests (this test is in the same level as the C1 exam of the Goethe institute).   
Thanks everyone in advance.

			hi,   
I am a native Russian speaker, newcomer to Zurich, 29 years old, looking to practice my German. I have just completed A1 level in Migroshule, so my German is still very basic. I'd like to have very simple conversations once or twice per week.   
I'd be glad to find a conversation partner who's interested in learning Russian (I am also fluent in English, lived almost 4 years in the US).

			Dear All   
I am looking for someone for doing some conversation and trying to let me understand German ! 
Area Horgen-Waedenswil-Thalwil or similar...   
I studyed a lot of rules.. not everything but a lot... but I absolutely need to talk with someone and interact in a speech.   
I offer Italian (mothertongue) or English (fluent) in exchange.   
I could also consider to pay someone for this ""lesson"" without exchange, but for a reasonable and cheap price...    
ciao

What are your expectations, for how long would you like to get teached, I mean for how many hours each day and for how many weeks or months all together?

2773	Language corner	German course attended by banking expats needed	Flower	1558	12	Zurich	05.06.2008, 16:29	"    Back to the actual post...What is intensive for you? Here it would normally be 4 hours per day (a la Migro), semi-intensive might be 3x per week. Neither are vastly subscribed by high level proffessionals because they dont have that much time. So once per week is standard. If you are already working at a bank, they should be offering you courses anyways...   
I have taken a course with these type of people (swissing.ch), but also have to say the experience was underwhelming. There was far too much chit-chat and too little actual german learning for me. I was far happier at Migro Klubschule with the Brazilian housewives and RAVies - and they are up for socializing, don't expect many english ex-pats - but you want to learn German anyways    
Also professionals are too busy (or think they are) to be doing a huge amount of smoozing with their german classmates, and the high level ones will either already know german or be taking private lessons with a flexible schedule.

			If my application to Novartis is successful, we may have to consider upping sticks and moving to Basel. However, for the moment I'd rather not as my daughters are still in primary school and the eldest will be entering the 5eme year, where things start to get pretty important prior to CO. Should the commute turn out to be too much and we have to move, will my girls be able to continue their Education in French in Basel? There is a German-speaking school here in Fribourg (obviously being a bilingual canton) and I was wondering if there was the equivalent in Basel. 
Cheers,

It's kind of what I was trying to get at with the comment about there being benefits from standardizing languages instead of perpetuating patois. And it's not just the political unity of China but also the cultural unity which is huge. Even the most independant minded Taiwanese I worked with still regarded themselves as part of a ""greater"" Chinese cultural family. As for China itself, centralised rule, an iron fist and Confucius also probably had a hand in keeping China together. The other thing is the language was free from outside influences, as was Japanese, for hundreds of years. That helps maintain stability of language. Unlike poor old English which was changed for ever after the Normans came. But if Chinese stayed basically the same down the centuries (I take his word on it) then presumably it was because the culture was stable so it remained a relevant, living language. It must have adapted some over the years - new vocabulary for new ideas (communism for example and ""capitalism with chinese characteristics"") etc. What's interesting is how languages ""move on"". If you listen to Welsh tv  you hear english words for modern stuff. Same in Japanese - the Japanese for hamburger is ""hambagga"" and they have a special alphabet to write words of foreign origin.

			Hi Nate,   
I took German lessons at the Ecole Migros. No real complaints, although I must say that learning German in a French-speaking place is obviously a bit more difficult. Our classes were all held in German only, but the materials all had French translations (which is okay for me, but might be a problem for you, depending on your French.) The bigger problem I found is that francophones have a very hard time pronouncing German correctly (they can't pronounce -ich ,-ach, and similar sounds) and I didn't find practicing speaking with my classmates to be particularly productive. I ended up doing most of my learning on my own.   
You might do well to go with a private tutor, seeing as you already have some background in the language and might need something more tailored to an anglophone. I'm afraid I can't offer any advice on that, but you might wish to search the forum for information on learning French in Lausanne. This will at least provide you with more information on the various language schools here, or how to go about finding a tutor.

ESL, Migros and even with individual trainers, but since I know Jean-Francois and Anne Marie from Ecole Agora I only suggest them, I met both already 9 years ago in Geneva where they worked before they started their own business in Lausanne. My wife is from Russian and within 6 month she mad excellent progresses. One of my colleagues moved from Bresil to Switzerland with his family without any French Background and after 3 month Saturday classes we had already very good discussions in French. Ecole Agora mad a very good Job.   One of the key factor for this success is, they are the owners of the business not only paid teachers, the other is the special way to teach.      Its your joys and its also a question where you are located.     - Check the Schedules (Saturday, Evening and Day classes) important if you are working    - Check the Prices   - How long are the lessons     If you have other questions please contact me but any how have a good start in Switzerland.    	11	 Mar 2008	1.0	['0', '0']	['0', '0']	0

Otherwise it'd all still be ""The"", ""Thou"" and ""Whence"".   
FWIW: ""communication"" is the act, ""communications"" is the means.

			The resources state above I have found are very good, with Leo and the Pons or yellow German/english dictionaries (langenscheidt).     
If you need more of a beginner's level, I have this wonderful one that really helped me out when I first moved here and it's a Visual, German/English dictionary.  This is more for the complete beginner since it doesn't have allot of more specific words and terms I needed later,  
also Hueber has a wonderful resource of German learning material as well as Pons.  I have the ""Grosser Lernwortschatz - Deutsch als Fremdsprache""; which is a big English/German vocabulary book with Thesaurus which divides vocabulary into different subject areas (topics).  They also have it in German with other combinations, I think French/German, Italian/German, etc....   
Good Luck...

She won't be going to Kindergarten for another 2 years. And even if she doesn't speak German by then, she'll learn in no time. And she won't be the only child in her Kindergarten class that doesn't speak German, I can promise you that. 
As I said before in other threads - if you'll be staying in Switzerland for the long haul, send your daughter to a public school - the public school system here is excellent. If you'll be leaving again in the foreseeable future, send her to an international school - but don't expect her to integrate well if you choose the latter.   
As your daughter speaks French, she'll have an advantage over the other kids in Primary School which she can use to make up for her deficiencies in German (if she still has any by then, which I don't think is likely).

If you just need to be able to converse with people, then no one really cares whether you say le or la. They'll still understand you. I'm having to learn both French and German (and Swiss german) simultaneously because half of my husband's family speak swiss german, the other half French. It is possible. Just be aware that every now and again the words will come out in the wrong language!   
If you are continually using German e.g. for work, then I don't think it will be too much of a problem to learn French as well. If you don't use German day to day, then you may have more problems.

			It is possible to pick up a dialect, or a rough approximation of one, or at least a similar accent that people can understand. It just takes time and a bit of effort - and sometimes not as much effort as you would expect.   
For the last three years I was working in the Netherlands and living in Germany. Everyone in NL wanted to speak English with me, despite my many requests/demands to learn Dutch - at first this was helpful, but after a while you couldn't help but feel that they wanted me to simply help improve their English. But I eventually managed to get by in Dutch.    
But since I was switching back to German on the weekends, my German gradually changed without me knowing it. I think largely due to me eventually absorbing how the Dutch intonate. So eventually, many Germans thought I was Dutch (previously, most thought I was English) and many Dutch could understand my half-arsed attempts at their language.   
After that experience, I don't see why Swiss German should be any different. I think you first need some sort of basis in German - it doesn't need to be fluent, just a basic level of understanding. Then you just need to listen to people speaking Swiss German - HOW they say things is just as important as WHAT they are saying. Find the rhythm and try to adopt it.   
You can't force it. I've tried that, and it simply doesn't work. Just relax and try to go with the flow.

Same here and honestly it gets on my wick when people say that Swissgerman is not a written language.   
Granted that there might not be a general Thesaurus covering all the grammatical rules and acting like a dictionary,but there are quite a lot covering several dialects.   
Ever heard of Jeremias Gotthelf who used a mix of high german and Swissgerman in his books, or Rudolf von Tavel who wrote book after book in Bernese dialect more than hundred years ago.........and whose writing (e.g. grammar and spelling) was a sort of foundation for many others to build up on.   
Only because the dialects are not used as official languages, doesn't mean they are not languages in their own right   
*** step off soap box   
feel free to get in touch with me by PM if you want to have something in SWISSgerman written or translated

			You could try volunteering on a farm in Germany. I know someone that came over from Canada knowing very minimal German, went to work on a farm where they knew even less English than he knew German, and he very quickly became skilled at German - he didn't know all of the grammar rules perfectly but he had no problem talking to people and understanding what they said. There is an organization called WWOOF ( , which is in English and German, similar organizations exists in many countries) who can put you in touch with organic farmers who are looking for people willing to work in exchange for room and board. Because you don't get paid, you don't need a work visa, but if you are non-EU then a tourist visa may be necessary. I believe most farmers expect a minimum commitment of two weeks.

The MediaMarkt in Sihl City has a huge selection of these devices.   
They're not terribly cheap, at about 200 minimum for a reasonably decent one.  Then again, it's way easier to carry than a dictionary.  The one I have has roughly 5,000,000 entries.  It's even got some of the more colorful terms in it. ;-)  These devices also have the advantage that you can look things up way quicker.  The only disadvantage is that you can't just sit back and read random pages.

			Yup, the procession starts at 12 and winds it's way through Arth to Goldau, returning to Arth at about 3:30. At least that what's the flyer seems to indicate.   
And yes, judging by the looks we sometimes get from our neighbors, it seems like we are the only expats in Arth...my husband is here on a year assignment, and we figured we might as well live somewhere completely different from where we usually live. And Arth certainly is a far cry from San Francisco! Despite the occasionally ""earthy"" smell that wafts through the open windows on hot days, it's really lovely here. We spent the summer hiking all over Mt. Rigi, and jumping in the lake on days it wasn't raining. It isn't too far/long to Zurich or Luzern, but sometimes I do miss city life. I feel lucky to be living somewhere so beautiful, and also lucky to have someplace to San Francisco to go home to    
So anyway, if anyone wants to venture out to the sticks to see how the other half lives, swing on by Arth this weekend! We'll be the Americans trying to control the dog from lunging at the cows...

			Don't worry too much abouth the are.   
At my high school (gymnasium) in Denmark, there was and American girl doing one year (year 11 afair). She did not know any foreign language before she came, but she lived with a Danish family and passed both written and oral Danish test at the end of the year.   
OK, Danish is simpler than German, but anyway.   
The main problem is if kids arrive much later thn that to a Swiss school. If they start aged 10 or 11, they just do not have the time to get their German good enough by the end of year 5.   
And if they are not deemed good enough, they will in reality be barred from academic studies, no matter their abilities in math etc.   
If you fear that may be a problem for your kid, private German lessons might be a problem - I am sure e.g. Berlitz will be able to arrange something; they found a teacher for Swiss German for our then 7 year old. And it is still likely to be cheaper than international school.   
Being a multilingual home (Danish and Portuguese to the kids, English between adults) we are probably less worried than monolinguals.   
Good luck

			Dear Oscar   
Since moving into your appartment we have had over 47 complaints of noise and unneighbourly behaviour from local residents, some of them so disturbing they have made my teeth curl.   
To this end we request you to leave the appartment, town, country and continent without delay.   
Failure to adhere to this demand will result in sending in 23 of our most brutal troops armed with the sharpest Swiss army knives to cut holes in your favourite underpants.    
You may feel that the punishment for your crimes is a trifle severe, your only saving grace is that you did not flush your toilet after 10pm, if this had been the case you would have been executed in your bed.   
Before your flight, which I suggest you undertake in the early hours of the morning, before your neighbours are warned by the security cows please deliver one more bottle of this excellant wine to me (address will be PM'ed to you later with a scan of the label) and a letter of apology to the Swiss nation.   
Forever yours

			Thank you all for your replies; I've been away on holiday so I haven't had a chance to respond until now.   
I found   post particularly enlightening, and gave me hope that it might be possible. I nevertheless understand that even with lecture notes and much of the course being taught in the universal language of mathematics, if my German is not to a high standard I will have a lot of trouble, and the language barrier will be an unnecessary disadvantage to me from the start.   
So if university decisions come round and I'm not confident that I can learn German to that standard, I will go to one of the alternatives. As I mentioned before, my A-Level results may or may not be good enough for Oxbridge, I will certainly apply but I don't think Oxbridge is right for me. I am still yet to go round Edinburgh and Imperial College which are both on the agenda.       
As it stands I imagine I will end up applying to (not in order):   
Kings College Cambridge 
Edinburgh 
Imperial College 
[ ETH Zurich   
MIT (although if I were to get in - which is unlikely - I would have a major financial problem)     
To answer  I've been with an engineering course called Smallpiece Trust to Durham University, Kings College Cambridge, Churchill College Cambridge and Southampton. On the courses you spend a few days at the university going to lectures (sometimes from people in the Physics department). You get a feel for what a place is like, what drives the staff, and the students too. My dad is an academic so a university is always a place of interest whenever we visit a city, so I generally do get an idea of what the different univerisities offer in their courses. The course plan is also a major indicator to me as to what to expect from that university,   
Anyway, everything in this post is subject to change, thankfully no decisions need to be made yet. I thank you all again for the help you've given me, much of which is invaluable.

I`m a native english speaker and have learned some fairly embarrassing pidgeon-german so far. But I`d love to improve it! If there is anyone located near the city centre of Geneva who would like to work on their English while bearing some of my german in return, I`d love to hear from you! (I really want to prepare for the lowest level of the Deutsche als Fremdschprach exam so someone with a linguistic background would be super). 
Either way, write me if you`re interested! Thanks!

			Hello,    
I'm actually a French teacher, and have seen your notice. Since I speak English myself, I could - if you haven't yet had a French course - give you a crash course myself, that would last about a week. Otherwise, I also have an intensive French course (with a class of a few people) but that's three hours a day during 1, 2 or three weeks (but cheaper, since more people will take part).    
If you are interested or just want to know more, you can contact me at :

I did not get a chance to see if it is used anywhere else in Austria.  Though if the word did in fact originate in Switzerland, then I would expect its use to be common throughout Tyrol for it to have reached as far east as Salzburg.

Myself, I took my lessons from my local community college in the US, at the local Auslanderdienst in Baselland (Pratteln) and I've taken courses at Klubschule Migros.

I've been living in Switzerland for three years, but because of the working env (English speakers) I have never had the chance to learn German seriously.   
I'm looking for someone willing to teach me and my wife German; in change, we can teach English (she's American) or Italian (me). 
Since I'm a software engineer, I can also teach computer/programming stuff, or mathematics, as needed.   
Ideally we are looking for someone located in Basel or Aargau, because we live in the same area.

And the term Gang go, is directly translated to Gopher/Go for.  I'm the Gopher (I go fer this, I go fer that).     
Once when I was at a dinner with a few Swiss friends, I was asked if I knew what the 'Gang go Klub' was by the men there.  I said that yes, I'm a member, and the Swiss men laughed and said they were also members.  You have to be married to be in the 'Gang go Klub'. ;-)   
The Schnitzelbank are pretty tough to figure out even if you're Swiss.  On top of that, they usually have double or triple meanings.  They're some of the best word-play in the German language.  Always read them out loud to your self to try to figure out what's going on, then have your Swiss significant other explain them to you.  Thanks for the link.

A really neat idea -- a couple of German film students took to the streets to 'say hello to the people' and see what the people say back.    
Somehow nice to see that someone actually does say all these strange words written in my textbook!    
Now, if only a kindly Swiss would do the same in the streets of Berne ...

			I have been going twice a week to the Migro school in Zug, and once a week to Liz also in Zug. Both are as good as the teacher and other students allow - I don't think which school you choose is the issue.    
The problem (I think) is that becoming profficient in classroom German is less important than having the opportunity to speak every day in German to someone who wants to speak recreational/colloquial German with you as an end in itself......konnen Sie helfen mir kind of stuff isn't much use in  recreational chit-chat scenarios - all in my humble opinion naturlich!

2957	Language corner	Is it easy to learn German?	Julia Victoria	3503	6	Taiwan	06.05.2007, 22:33	"    There's a fast learning method called 'Pimsleur', but it really depends on your aim.  If you want to speak the language, Pimsleur appears to be the shortcut to build up at least a base vocabulary for conversation.  However, to understand structure and read/write German takes quite a bit longer.  I never really learned formal German but it's part of my home dialect (I grew up in the south of the Netherlands) so I have a reasonable vocabulary grasp of the structure by sheer exposure.  Also note that German is not   German.   
My theory is that getting to a conversational standard will get you much quicker into a position where you can USE the language and thus assimilate structure (grammar, syntax) and more vocabulary on the fly which must be better than just cramming it from a book and CDs.   
I'm going to use that theory as I have need to lean Spanish.  I'll probably try and start with Pimsleur, so I can at least start listening to TV/radio in that language, then work my way through a Berlitz pack for vocab, reading and writing. From my few years in Belgium I know I have little talent for languages so I need all the help I can get :-).  Oh, BTW, aim for CD based courses as you can copy them into an iPod and listen to them while travelling..

			I am in a similar situation of trying to learn a little of the language before I move to Switzerland. I have five years of German under my belt, although I have never yet been in the position to use it in everyday situations.   
That being said, I am currently trying to refresh my German whilst simultaneously learning as much Swiss German as possible. Ho boy! It's a different language alright! The Swiss German is messing up my High German and vice versa. Every time I try to speak in one, the other comes out, and since I only have a smattering of Swiss, I finish sentences and phrases in High German.   
My advice based on this experience is to focus on one or the other, rather than learning High German and hoping to pick up SG in Zurich. They're similar enough to get REALLY confusing if learning both.   
Also, if you want to get a jump-start on learning Swiss German, there are some good learning aides that you can get relatively easily. Pimsleur makes a Swiss German audio set. I also bought a copy of Dr Chly Prinz direct from the translator and have been reading it alongside the English translation (The Little Prince). My personal favorite is a book that is made to go along with the Swiss-made movie   (which you can get by googling the movie title). That one is good because the movie itself is a parody of Swiss culture.

			Hi Felix,   
If you are still in London, check out the Goethe-Institut.  In addition to running German classes they often run local social events for expat Germans and very one is welcome.  When I lived in Dublin year ago, I used to attend German breakfasts and there you got a chance to practice your German in real situations.  I expect they do the same in London.   
If you are already over here, then think about joining a local club or association.   This will help, but I expect that you may end up learning more Swiss German than High German!   
Best Regards,   
Jim

			I'm attending beginner German at Migros Klubschule and we have about 8 different nationalities in the class.  The teacher speaks in German but she will say it in English if we don't understand.  One of the first things she did was check if everyone could speak some English, however I have heard her explain things to people in Spanish and even attempt some Arabic.  Perhaps your boyfriend should try again or try a school with smaller classes, my boyfriend is in a class of 3 and his teacher is also quite happy to explain things in English if they are having problems.

			I think in Berliz you are not allowed to take trial lessons, but you may give it a try anyway.   
I think the most important factor is not the school itself, but the teacher. Many of them work in more than one school, so you are not necessarily getting the best teachers just because you're paying the most expensive school (since the same teacher may be also lecturing in another cheaper school).   
Besides, each teacher has a particular style. Some focus on speaking, others in grammar, some follow the course book, others don't and so on. I recommend you to ask specifically about the teacher assigned to your level and check if his/hers philosophy match yours about language learning.

			Hello,   
Many of you may be familiar with the use of flash cards for learning new vocabulary. For those who don't, a flash card is basically a card that has a word written on the front side (or a picture) and the correspondent word in the foreign language on the back side.   
It turns out that there is a lot of programs that make the task of creating and using flash cards easier and funnier. For those of you who use Linux (the large minority I suppose :-) there is an excellent program called KVocTrain, where you can practice your vocabulary, create random queries, multiple choice questions,  practice with verbs and much more.   
I'm sure that there are similar programs for Windows as well, so if anybody knows about one of them please tell your experience.   
Best regards!

The real weak spot is that you do not have much time to practice your verbal skills. However, your general skills will improve substantially there.

			For me, it is the grammar. And I don't mean the complicated high-level grammar. I mean the basics.   
I don't have a clue what half of the terms are in English, much less when someone tries to explain them to me for German (and in German, no less!). I just blank out and nothing is absorbed.    
I learn best by recognizing patterns, figuring them out and building on them, which is difficult when learning German. When I was a programmer, I'd learn to read the code first, and then use the code. But writing from scratch always had me looking up old code to get the clues to start me off.

The CDs opened up all sorts of knew tenses for me and I liked the way Michel continually pushes you to say some pretty complicated sentences eg If I had known you would be arriving this morning then I would have waited for you.   
Yet it was sinking in quite painlessly! After a few spins of each CD I was uttering sentences of a complexity that would have been beyond my comprehension before starting the course.   
A lot of difficult grammar is covered but because everything is geared towards   the language, I found it quite easy to assimilate. Listening to the students making mistakes on the CD was also useful because it helps steer you away from common pitfalls.   
A very worthwhile CD package. I'd be very interested to hear how someone with no prior knowledge of the language fared with the beginners course.

			One factor that made Swiss German so easy to learn where I worked, was that so much of it was in fact, English. ""Mir bruuched schnall s Business Plan mit Financials und dazu ein One Pager"". Duh.   
It's sometimes difficult for me to speak German and chuck English words in, because I don't know what non-English speakers will understand. I watched the Swiss movie Breakout (great German language name, eh?) and was surprised about the English.    
On the other hand, sometimes I just don't know the word in German so try the English one just in case.    
On the other other hand, there are some words like ""Anyway"" which sound pretty cool when used in an otherwise German speaking situation.   
If mixing languages together helps for a better understanding, then I agree with it.

No. Using a language that not everyone at the meeting can speak is rude. It might also suggest that the offender isn't competent enough at speaking the language of the meeting, in which case, why are they a member of that group in the first place?

			Hey Cyrus,   
Thanks for your response...good luck starting class.  Would you mind letting me know how it goes?   
On another discussion, someone suggested asking to go to a class for free to see if it suits - think I might try that.   
Good luck with all the äeiöü's

			Hi 
I would like to get hold of Inlingua's Intensive Course books for level 2 (called 2 and 2+ I think) 
Am practically bankrupt after their first course I did but I thought their books were great and wish I could somehow get hold of them. Have emailed but had no answer. I think maybe they are proprietary and for paying students only. If anyone has them (possibly not written in or written in, in pencil) please let me know! 
Thanks

			Its not an exam, it is a grading test. 40% is probably sufficient to do a B1 course without struggling. A lot depends on your existing language skills ie. people with very good English skills progress quite rapidly in german classes because of the inherent similarities (with the exception of gender).      Don't worry, you are not alone. Written skills are normally the weakest for any foreign language, and German is no exception, especially because of the complex grammar.    
But one way or another, if you want to learn this language you are going to have to practice the written component.   Mark has gone to great length to assemble a wide array of topics and cheat sheats that you will find very helpful when you put pen to paper.

3021	Language corner	[German] Basic pronunciation guide	guest	10139	0	null	1.1.0001, 00:00	" 
			
			Pronunciation is very important in many languages. It determines whether you will be taken seriously in German, since it gives a clue to the person listening to you about your ability to speak the language. Good pronunciation will not only make you feel more comfortable with the language, it will help to avoid those situations where people switch to English out of ""politeness"".   
As English-speakers we naturally bring our own pronunciation into German - it's just a matter of habit. Learning the correct pronunciation of certain vowels and a few consonants can go a long way.   
The following table is from my first German notebook. It is listed on the very first page, as it was the very first thing I learned. I wasn't allowed to proceed further until I was able to pronounce each letter correctly.          ( )         I've modified this table from the original slightly as I didn't fully agree with some of the examples. It should also be noted that the examples given are for standard English, if you speak with an accent in English, try to think of how the sound should be in standard English before trying the German examples.     
The ""d"" in German tends to be a little shorter and doesn't linger quite as long as it does in English. Consider ""landed"" - the d sound can be heard quite distictly. ""und"" in German is halfway between a ""d"" and a ""t"", and the sound doesn't linger - it's very crisp and short. 
The ""y"" in German is closer to ü. Consider ""typical"" in English - the ""y"" sounds more like the ""i"" in tip. German   is actually more like toopish, except with a much shorter ""oo"" than the sound in ""goose"". 
The ""th"" in German doesn't exist as it does in English where the letters are combined into a single sound as in ""thistle"". In German if you encounter it in a word like ""Mathias"" (male name) the ""t"" and the ""h"" will be pronounced separately, but in quick succession.       
People have different problems with different parts of German pronunciation, often depending on where they are from. The following observations are generalisations and not true in all cases. If you fall into one of these groups you may want to double-check certain aspects of your pronunciation so that you can get it correct as you progress.   
British people tend to have the biggest problem with the deeper vowel sounds in German. Vowels like ""u"" are quite deep and the British tend to  move their tounge further forward in the mouth to create a vowel  sound with a higher pitch. This often sounds as if they have added an umlaut to the vowel, resulting in u sounding like ü or ö, etc. A classic example is "" "" (the town, and a train). It should sound like tsug (with a low sounding ""u"", quite short), but if often sounds like zoog (as in the oo in goose), with the oo sound often extended to ""ooo"".   
Almost all English-speakers have problems with the rolling ""r"" of German, with perhaps the exception of South Africans who are used to the more guteral sound of Afrikaans. Americans and Irish have the greatest problem as their own ""r"" sound in English is more drawn out and pronounced than with other nationalities. Special care should be taken with German ""r"" - the tip of the tounge actually almost touches the roof of the mouth as air is forced past. Imagine imitating the sound of a cat purring, while simultaneously attempting the ""r"" sound. Practice with the word  . The ""r"" should be crisp and quick with the tip of the tounge moving upward to the roof of the mouth, not flat and drawn out.   
Irish should have an advantage with ""th"" since in Irish English many ""th"" sounds are shortened into ""t"". This should make it easier to cope with the separate pronunciation of ""t"" and ""h"" in German (see above).   
German ""z"" and ""s"" are often problematic for native English speakers. It's important to remember that generally there is a ""shift"" of these letters. In other words ""s"" normally sounds like ""z"" and ""z"" normally sounds like ""ts"". The difference is the position of your tounge - with an English ""s"" the tounge sits further back in the mouth as you breathe out. As you move the tounge further out toward the lips the sound will change from ""s"" to ""z"" and then to ""ts"" before stopping altogether. As you pronounce these sounds in German, hold your tounge slightly further forward to get the shift. Note that the ""ss"" in German which is sometimes written as ß (but never in Switzerland) sounds exactly like English ""s"" - no shifting toward ""z"" is required, in fact it can be treated just as ""ss"" would be in English   
German ""ch"" is often a big source of problems. Taking the word   (I) for example, English speakers often say it as ""Ish"" or ""Ick"". The correct pronunciation is  exactly in the middle and sounds almost like a hiss is being emitted. Some people may like to think of a word they might have heard often which ends in ""....loch"" - this is the same ""ch"" sound used in   etc.   
Finally a note regarding the correct pronunciation of ""g"" in words like  (twenty). The correct pronunciation is a soft ""ch"" sound, but it is more often than not heard as a hard ""g"" - this is known as hyper-correction - an attempt to over-correct other common mispronunciations in other words. It's not really wrong, but you'll never be able to get a straight answer from a German native-speaker or a teacher. The academics are still arguing about it  .   as heard in the area around Frankfurt  is definitely not correct (unless trying to speak in Hessisch dialect).

			Often at federal level some documents will be able in English, but at the canton level you generally only get the language of that canton. For example if you live in the French-speaking part and you get caught by a speed camera in Zurich they will send you all the documentation in German, which people on the other side of the  probably can't read.   
You will find that some places such as the motor registry may produce some documents in other languages. I recall seeing some info sheets in Turkish, English and various other languages last time I was there.
