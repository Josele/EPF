			The vice president of pro-immigrant organization Secondos Plus has infuriated far-right politicians and others in Switzerland with his 'humorous' calls for a new Swiss flag, contributor Meritzell Mir reports.                just funny how people react to provocations...SVP are more than happy to provoke, but can't take any, zip, zero, none...typical Swiss...   
			
			Agree with part one - but second part should read 'typically SVP/UDC type Swiss.
		    Sounds familiar...       If I heard that a pro immigrant group was suggesting to change the American flag, to make it more, non American friendly, I don't think I would be laughing it off. Or maybe I would be, but not the way it sounds. I would expect the SVP to be irritated by it like, I would any conservative American, and it goes for any other country as well.
		 
			
			""All Petrusic was trying to do was get people’s attention through humour in order to make them reflect on the values of Switzerland...""   
They must be new here....I'll just pour myself another glass of wine and enjoy the show.
		 
			
			Funny as he may have found it, he's just helping the SVP to win more votes...
		 
			
			What I find as ""funny"" is that people are more interested in trying to provoke each other then looking for common ground solutions to the problems.
		    Hard to understand your post - maybe some different punctuation would help?   
Maybe you should ask an educated native English speaker for help?
		    Oh like this guy...       
I can see you not understanding my post with such a heavy accent and all.
		    what is it that makes you think the SVP are angry?   
They've just had the opportunity to stir things up handed to them on a golden plate.   
I bet the champaigne corks are flying in SVP HQ.   
(or maybe the Chasselas and Bündner Herrschaften corks)
		 
			
			Nobody said it in the other thread on the ""new Swiss flag""... so, since I followed the Swiss German newspapers over the past years more than most others here:   
The Secondos Plus club is a bit of a bad joke. It used to be dominated by Italians and Spanish who really tried to improve the situation for their fellow countrymen in times where there was more and more open discrimination than today. The membership based changed just with the foreign population of Switzerland - it is by now run by folks with a Kosovo Albanian background. Therefore did they choose Balkan Beats when they wanted to make a ""more international version"" of the Swiss anthem. While I sometimes enjoy their stuff must I say that it is always pretty clear that the guys are not exactly the brightest crayons in the box: The flag thing surely was a planned and calculated provocation. But what exactly do they want to achieve? They claim to want to get more press for foreigners - to be honest is the newspaper already today full of it, but only the negative stuff. So they should try to get positive news out there instead of making idiots out of foreigners - as the media and for sure the SVP jumps at this golden opportunity and pretends that the guys are serious. The worst part is the timing: Offering the SVP an awesome chance to demonstrate that the evil foreigners really want the Swiss to give up everything Swiss is a golden opportunity for their agitators - let alone so shortly before the elections.    
Result: Newspaper is full of the rubbish, everyone only reads about the SVP and the others are quiet - SVP gains ground. Simple as that.   
Unfortunately are Secondos Plus quite obviously not on par with the SVP. The SVP is the most professionally organized political party of the country while that club does not really seem to have many people that have seen schools from the inside. At least that's how smart they act.
		    Ummmm.... We don't need a solution, Switzerland is a christion nation and if non-swiss of a different religion find it offensive they can gladly go back from whence they came.
		 
			
			I don't see any reference to religion in that quote, which makes your statement somewhat odd.
		    You responded to posts placed two years ago.   
And, the Swiss flag is the flag of the Swiss Confederation. Whether CH is a Christian nation or not is irrelevant. Irrelevant in practice, while not in theory and history   
Whomever feels unhappy about this flag, has not to go whence he/she came from, but only to the nearest psychiatrist
		    The statement not only is ""odd"" but simply wrong. As the cross of the Swiss flag originated from European tradition (Chistian influence admitted) like the flag of the Kingdom of Italy          
			
			Yes, the cross is Christian in origin.   
But that doesn't mean that Christianity is a state religion.   
Look at the French tricolore for example. It embodies values of the French Revolution, especially the struggle to overthrow the Feudal system. This is not precisely a rallying call for modern France. But the flag lives on.   
The German flag was actually originally the banner of a student fraternity. There is very little link to the present Germany there.    
There are similarly many other national flags that have become symbols of their nation while losing their earlier meaning.
		       
Eleftheria i Deutsches Reich?        
You possibly mean the flags of the German Imperial Navy       
 Flaggen der kaiserlichen Marine         
or the various flags of the German Empire       
 Flaggen, Standarten und Wimpel zur Zeit der  . Die Admiralsflaggen sind seither unverändert.
		     
exactly. I do not see any reason to not adapt if you go somewhere. If you move to US or to Russia, you either have to adapt to their values or you just die on the street because there is no social system to catch you.   
I do not say that Russia or US should be the role model but indeed it helps immigrants to be motivated to adapt...
		     
In Switzerland, the flag of the Union and the flag of your Canton in combination  are both a Tradition and a vital part of the national identity.  And NOT subject to change
		    Depends on the state, some US states have fairly elaborate state-provided or subsidized medical care, WIC programs etc.; there is nobody dying of starvation in Maine.
		 
			
			If you live in Ukraine, the Russian state comes to you whether you like it or not.          Oh no. Does that mean my watch is illegal? Are Swatch going to be shut-down for treason?           
no reason for panic
		 
			
			Transgressions are punishable by being forced to put Maggi Gewurz on all your food.           
It may be mentioned that Mr Maggi was an immigrant from Italy, while Mr Nestle came from the Schwarzwald
		    Well, Julius Maggi was born in Frauenfeld. That may be called Campo Delle Donne in Italian, but it's still in Switzerland. His father was an immigrant from Monza, Italy, though, but his mother, née Esslinger, was the daughter of a politician in Zurich.
		    I am not sure which conclusion should I draw after reading your post. Having a Swiss mother, and a daughter of a politician from Zürich at that, makes a true  ethnic Swiss (is there such a thing) out of Mr. Maggi? Suppose the immigrant Italian father's contribution is secondary and should be disregarded then. Details. 
But whatever, I have noticed that most developed countries simply erase the  identities of successful immigrants, so if you are a nuisance and a trouble-maker immediately your origins are brought into light, whereas none says a word about anything ""foreign"" when it comes to a mathematician, engineer, artist etc 
If one is a trouble-maker it becomes ""obvious"" that it is so because of his origins, of course, how else, but if one is more than just decent, rather exceptional....well, you got the idea.    
Back to the OP, though. Swiss flag is nice and I personally don't see the need to be changed. I don't even think that immigrants should have a say in this matter.
		    I think that flags as well as any other national symbols should be decided democratically. This includes the naturalised immigrants... sooner or later they'll turn the flag into a minus       I certainly know in the USA almost everyone seems to be talking about Chinese and Indian immigrants flooding the science and math based fields. And if you are Indian or Chinese here, I have heard people talk about those two groups as they must be here because they must be cheaper then a Swiss employee. Fact is, almost all Indians I know working in Switzerland are by no means cheaper then anyone local. But, the assumption is that they are, and I haven't heard any positive comments to that effect.
		    Well, that doesn't really surprise me, in the USA almost every country/nationality has a different image, closer to reality, than the caricature-like images and perceptions Western Europeans enjoy having about different groups. I have heard so many stories, especially from the academic related  fields, when it actually was an advantage to be from a specific location... no wonder America attracts so many brains and people that want to do something. It seems they value more people in general, whereas Europe is all about preconceptions.  And it is funny (in a way)  at the same time to see the nostalgia and illusions many Americans have about the old continent.
		    Have you ever been to the US?
		    Cute. I wouldn't have spoken otherwise, but thank you anyway.    
Of course everyone knows the segment they get into contact with, but I'm afraid that in Western Europe we don't have, at least, anything like it. Yes, I do know what I'm talking about. It surprised be the level of ignorance in places I would have never thought of finding it here.
		    That's hardly standard EF practice.
		    Wolli wrote that the inventor of Maggi Würze was an immigrant. An immigrant is someone who immigrates or has immigrated. The inventor wasn't an immigrant; not even both his parents were, only his father was.    
That's all. No judging, no assessing, no assuming, no supposing. Just correcting a little error.
		    A couple of years ago I had dinner with the CEO of a medium-sized US technology company, who was himself of Chinese origin. We were discussing the large number of Chinese scientists he had working in R&D and he said that he would love to hire more Americans but there just weren't very many who had the required qualifications and the relevant subjects were not sufficiently popular in American universities.   
The way he said it made it sound quite apologetic, as if it would actually be better to hire Americans but we have to make do with these Chinese.   
So this coming from the lion's mouth, it seems in America too, the development is seen as one of necessity rather than one of choice.   
Of course one of the reasons these university courses are not as popular as they could be is perception of low salary. So in that case, hiring Chinese rather than upping salaries is indeed a question of cost.      That's not the impression I'm getting. Maybe Indians may work their way to higher salaries over time, but their initial salaries are often low. Several Indians that I know are actually on expat contracts working for Indian companies on Indian salaries, but of course with basic costs covered outside of the salary. Once they are trained and up to speed, many of these jobs will be relocated to India. So cost is indeed a driver here.
		     As per the Lion's mouth comment...the problem is, is that it is hard to encourage American high school students to choose these fields, when there was such a large inundation of cheap Chinese and Indians to the market there, jamming down salaries to a pittance. I know it very well. Coming from a family of people educated in engineering, science, and economics. It's a hot topic of discussion at half time football. The reason we have so many 1/2 assed ""Chinese"" restaurants in the US, is because they come to be educated there, find a way to stay on student visas, but cannot find a job in their field, or from abroad, so they open Chinese restaurants until they get hired. Go to the Midwest, and ask how many Chinese restaurant owners have degrees in math. You will see, the US has shot themselves in the foot with importing cheap intelligence. So, how do you convince a genius 17 year old to become an electrical engineer or the like at 30 to 40k a year? You don't.    
ALL of the Indians I know that work for UBS, Novartis, Credit Suisse, are making no less then 20k a month. Maybe I am so much out of reality that I do not realize that is the bare bottom salary, but for me it is a lot.
		 
			
			Foreigners who come to Switzerland, only to complain about it first struck me as possibly insightful.  Then I realize they are just immature.  For a time, they started to annoy me, and then just deserved my pity.  But now I think they are ridiculous.  Therefore, I think I'll just now laugh at them.     
I mean, FFS, why go through all the trouble of coming to Switzerland only to realize it isn't some strange fantasy they had of the place?  The flag might be more fitting for Swaziland.  Did they perhaps punch in the wrong abbreviation?     How tragic, yet so laughable.  Buahahaha       Sorry, but what are the alternatives? What all those people who could do well in this field should do? Or are doing.
		    Why, indeed? But one can hardly blame the foreigners for falling for it, can one?   
As you yourself said:          And so they should blame the Swiss?  Hahaha    
meh, at some point, people need to grow up and take responsibility for themselves. It's one of the biggest favors people can do for themselves.     
Unhappy and miserable in Switzerland?  Good!  Congratulations, because you did it to yourself.  Buahahaha       
Taking personal responsibility is one of the most empowering actions one can take.
		     
>  a SECONDO
		    That's the same the world over - and I sound the same sort of apologetic when I talk about my last job: I spend the last couple of years building up an IT team in Singapore (changed my job this year so no applications anymore...). I would have preferred to hire locals. And cost is not always the main driver - I think it is important to have a rather stable core team. If some people come and go is it ok, but you really need a couple of people who are unlikely to move to another country. 
Long story short: within two years and some twenty rounds of hiring a person did I hire two locals and 18 or so immigrants. And I openly admit that I hired one of the two only because I had a strong bias towards his nationality... I simple did not receive any applications from local candidates while I got swamped by CVs mostly from India but also the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. The bottom line is that locals only want to work in famous large MNCs which have a certain prestige. Ideally in the financial sector, but something the size of Microsoft or Facebook is also ok... what really gets me is that you have the same discussions the world over: people complain about all the immigrants and how ""they are taking our jobs"" but are honestly not even applying for said jobs... 
Just try to open a service business like a restaurant in Zurich with only Swiss nationals...
		       
a Restaurant in Zürich with only Swiss nationals as employees is an Oxymoron        ...and also the theory that youngsters are hard to persuade to follow a certain path of studies because of the low salaries in the field. I mean, the lack of enough people trained in a specific field was the cause for bringing in those ""cheap"" immigrants in the first place, I should think.   
Ta ta. Cheap intelligence. I have never though of finding them in the same sentence, but here you are.
		    Fun fact: I am not that cheap. And neither are any other specialists you need to import because you told your kids that being a banker is the smarter choice...
		     The alternative is to not make it so easy for students to study abroad and stay in the host country after their education is over. The alternatives? Well we seem to have a booming video game industry right?
		    I do notice that especially in smaller establishments you do see a lot of staff who at least make the impression of being local. I haven't inspected their papers of course.
		    Including the cooks, kitchen staff and cleaners?
		    Ah yes, but reality doesn't come into it. It's the   that certain jobs don't pay well that drives the talent elsewhere.    
If we could find a way to encourage database specialists to splash more money on champaigne in cool and hip clubs, that might be the beginning of change.   
Even if your Indian IT guy is (supposedly) making 20K a month, as long as he wears a mix of Indian and C&A clothes, drives a second-hand Mazda, lives in a crappy appartment in deepest agglo-land and eats microwave food in the office, people are going to think he's on a cheap salary and accordingly assume their boss is practicing wage dumping.   
If on the other hand, bankers could learn a bit from that lifestyle, people might envy them a bit less.   
Sometimes perception matters more than reality.
		    I don't normally hang around at the hours the cleaners come. I tend to limit my drinking excesses to the point that I can still walk home       If they got a stipendium they have to go back to their countries of origin, as far as I know. At least this was the rule 10 years ago.  
Even so, I am not sure this would solve the problem of fewer students looking to study engineering sciences for example. I think many students are naturally attracted to less (perceived) arid fields, encouraged by what they see around - marketing, banking, media studies being much better advertised.   
And it's counter-productive for a good university, really. Their interest is to get the best students they can get.
		     Is Sri Lanka or Dresden local?
		    Haha, I am yet to see a database specialist to splash money on stupid things in a cool and hip club...what's that?  
And I think you perfectly described a mentality that people from some countries have: live relatively modestly, even   beneath your means, in order to save money for a ""greater"" purpose- buying a house, etc. It's just the way it is, not always, of course. It can be really irritating/amusing for the outsiders sometimes, for all I know.
		     Well I am speaking from the US side of the argument, just to be clear. US universities do want a good mix of students, but, they don't ask for so much money because they are doing charity work. 
They often times get 3 times for a foreigner, then they would for a local(US resident). What is the justification of that? More patience?  
Since I am from Detroit, as I may have mentioned before, ALOT of students are attracted to 3 main fields, marketing(waste of time), communications(more out of work radio dj hopefuls per capita then anywhere in the USA), and research related. There are a lot of programs designed at encouraging anything in engineering, design, electronics, tool and dye, and so on in the Detroit area because we have the heaviest concentration of technology based entrepreneurs then anywhere else in the world. I mean probably not the most then everywhere, but the most concentrated.    
And still, when union work pushed up the value of these workers, in the early days you had the flood of people from the south for the jobs on the assembly line. So much that is created the slums and ghetto situations we still have today. Because even though there wasn't any more work to be had, they just still kept coming and coming in hope something would eventually open up, or someone would die. Because in the south both black and white(irish, Italian) people were being persecution, and all had more rights in the north. Even though they intentionally for the most part segregated each other. Then later it became forced.    
Now today, we have a flood of Chinese and Indians, in a similar situation that have flooded the tech side, coming also over in waves, and also have to move to the less desirable, if not slum areas, waiting for something to open up as it appears to be better human rights if you are from China to live in the USA, and if you were poor in India, no cast system thinking in Detroit.    
I think there are some people attracted to a field they think is easier, but, the atmosphere in Detroit is a culture of technology, entrepreneurs, families of mechanics, so you are naturally encouraged to go this route. And even still, kids have to take the decision eventually, do I study like mad, and do this to make as much as being a night manager at KFC, or do I simply do something else?   
 Most my family is very educated(yeah, what happened to me?), and all pro Detroit/Michigan. And all work hard, and have degrees thru the nose. And yet, they have only seen their wages drop in general since the last 25 years. Most of them not union workers(or maybe half). My father has 2 doctorates, a masters, a bachelors, and 1 associates degree(really, he thinks he wins all arguments with me by default). He has taught at Rutgers, University of Michigan(and so on), published many times over, but not cheap enough.    
My cousin's husband repair's air conditioners in the summer and makes double what my Dad does/did.    
Actually the biggest growth industry in Detroit as of recent has been nursing. Apparently Detroit is a good place to get shot, or have terrible social assistance so a bee sting can end you up in the emergency room, because insurance won't cover that basic form of prescription drugs.   
I am rambling, sorry...
		    Yes, but we live in a society that idolizes people who get rich quick and splash it all on glitz. Working hard, saving up and being modest are not things that are looked up to any more. Rather, such attitudes are ridiculed. And because engineers and scientists tend to fall more into the ""be modest and save up"" category, those career paths are not considered desirable by schoolkids.
		    I do think I am still able to distinguish Züritüütsch from Sächsich.
		    I don't think we have that impression of them because of that.   
I think it is the negotiating, way beyond reason, to the point it is insulting is why they get that ""perception"".
		     While that may be the case, it's not what is in the back. Nor the front.
		    The Education proposition in the US has changed a LOT in the last 10 years.  Before, everyone was encouraged to take in as much education as they can.  Get a minimum graduate degree, then go for a postgraduate degree if you want more.  But the financial crisis left a lot of over-educated people with few available positions.     
I was amazed to hear William Bennett, our former education Czar, state a couple of years ago that not everybody should be getting an education.  If one will be working in some specialized skill, it is not necessary to try to get advanced degrees.   
I have heard of students nowadays coming out of universities with half a million dollar in debt, and no jobs lined up.  Many of them may never be able to repay their loans.  The student debt crisis in the US is estimated at $1 Trillion.
		    Well, I know loads of people like that. (not necessarily from Detroit or USA to be clear)
		    Student debt and indirectly, costs of education are a topic that needs to be tackled. Just as with a mortgage or any other form of borrowing, a person's debt celiing must be in some reasonable relation to their actual salary or at least realistic projections of future earnings. The present situation is anything but that.   
On the other hand, available skills do to some extent influence the type of companies that you attract to a city or region. Create a strong base of technology education, and tech companies begin to see you as a good place to set up shop. Educating media studies experts and HR managers also fills some demand gap no doubt, but there are few companies that primarily thrive on those skillsets.
		 
			
			Back when the economy was booming, I heard pre-med students were already being scouted by medical companies before they even graduated.  That is not a bad proposition.  When you have an employer already involved in a student's education before they come out.  The intelligence community does this.  It's not a bad arrangement to have.  Perhaps advanced education should be justified in this same way.  As we know, US Universities are for profit organizations and very expensive.
		    My understanding is that there is already a lot of sponsorship of this type going on in the US, with companies paying part of tuition fees and offering vacation internships. And rightly so. It's weaselish of companies to complain about the lack of skillsets and expecting government to do something about it rather than putting their own money where their mouth is.   
But there still aren't enough of these schemes.
		    Or shoot yourself in the foot, create a very unstable business environment with the only constant of having high and higher taxes, and then make all your specialists (whose studies were financed by you, the ""state"") flee not only the region, but the country itself.  
There, job well done.        But why do taxes have to go up?
		    Sounds like a topic for an entirely new thread, or forum even.         Well, I don't understand how she said growth equaled higher taxes that go up endlessly. A good city plan will keep taxes down, and actually, wealthy communities, have lower taxes because of a variety of things.
		    But poverty can often be a vicious cycle for a community.   
The more poverty you have, the more money you need to support those in need and so the more you need to raise taxes for those who aren't yet in poverty. Thus you make businesses and high earners leave and thus add even even more to the burden of those left behind. Add to that a town government that is asleep at the wheel and doesn't see where the problem is and doesn't attempt to innovatively try and break out of that cycle and you get what was described.
		    Yep. Specially when you talk about old ideals of having free universal health care, free education up to the university level, social protection (or some sort) for the many needy etc. Unfortunately, not every country is Sweden.       FTFY.    
Tom
		     Or communist.
		 
			
			Oh, c'mon, don't you love this flag? I really do. If Switzerland   change its flag, at least let's have this one. Although I have a vague idea that it's not exactly the kind of flag some immigrants would like to see...     
Which brings us back to the topic. Honestly, what a cheeky idea.
		     
This reminds me home accessories and kottbullar meatballs.   
But no, don't really like free crap.  Makes people demotivated, dumb, lazy, spineless, passive-aggressive and ultimately miserable.
		    Yep, I knew kottbullar meatballs had that effect on people.           
If you imagine a graduate with a huge debt burden entering the workforce.  That person is not likely to spend a lot of money until the loan is paid off.  That is a lot of economic productivity tied down.  That is like indentured slavery for their first couple of working years.
		    couple of years?   
I don't know what starter salaries are like in the US, but when i started my first job post university I was saving maybe a couple of hundred a month. Paying back a 100K or so debt in a couple of years would have been nigh impossible.
		    When I see the kind of debt Americans have after finishing their studies...frankly, that kind of ""free crap"" I got back home does seem very appealing now. I bet it's the same for many other people I know.  
But, where do you draw the line?
		    I think it's also embedded in overall expectations.   
My engineering friends in the US are earning salaries pretty much on par with what they'd get in Switzerland for the same job. However, average income there is a fair bit lower. So I guess this means the salary gap between an engineer and say a technician must be more than here.    
I've been in jobs in CH where the pay gap between myself and technicians was in the range of 500 CHF per month. And if you factor in that the technician got a salary (albeit a small one) during his training, and finished the training many years before I left university, he actually had more money overall at my age and it would have taken quite a few years of work for me to balance that out. Maybe not until you're in your mid 30s.   
Now in the event I think it balanced faster than that as I got promoted. But there is no guarantee of promotion. So given the choice between a vocational apprenticeship and a university degree, I would say it's about just as good both ways. If you have to pay a lot for university, Î'd say the training is the better option.   
The fact that people go to university in the US at all must (therefore, in my reasoning) be explained by the bigger salary gap.
		    All people? Or, cheap stuff allows those who care less for image and spending, actually be able to invest into something that matters to them and isn't expensive furniture nor material stuff. Like education. Bring on cheap meatballs if we can invest in a worthy lecture to take, anytime. Or, what about those who have to shop in cheap retailers..who are we gonna trash next, Aldi shoppers? Love it, myself. Saved me. Why shaming those who prefer or have to prioritise cheaper furniture shops..Not everyone is a snob. Cheap or free doesn't make people lazy. Lazy makes certain people lazy, no matter how much one spends.   
There are a lot of uncomfortably assertive assumptions here.    
People live and contribute here, local or not, they are free to nag should they choose to. Many had no choice to avoid CH, too. Assuming everybody appreciates the local life style and priorities and hence should keep their mouth shut..is arrogant. Nobody knows for certain the level of liberty somebody else has, and making presumptuous claims throwing judgements on those who might not be able to leave now or soon sounds quite limited and myopic. If they criticise, they might have a reason, even if they do not have to stay, anyways. Sometimes staying here is a must because one is taking more personal responsibility, when somebody else's failed.
		     
The thread was on about socialized public education, taxes, commies, and the hell of Sweden.
		    The discussion moved on from ""secondos"" to cheap students from China and India making the local American genius take an easier path in life, to expensive tertiary education vs. free tertiary education, to bad public policies associated with high taxes vs. low taxes associated with good policies,etc. etc. etc. Not really important, but no-one had a bad word against Ikea stuff actually. There are no snobs here, how could you think that...       Whose fault is that? Not of those cheap immigrants anyway. As I said, making it harder for foreign students or foreigners who already have the skills and willingness it's not going to change much.
		    Oh no, certainly  not.       I could wax on public edu, socialized or not, taxes and commies, but the theme is a bit recycled. I would prefer to not wax about Sweden, if any of the Scandinavian countries, I am interested in Norway and Finland more, sil is doing her edu research there at the moment, so far it seems quite interesting.    
My point was, free does not mean crap. Lots of people have to do with free and cheap. Lots of people make that choice, even here, nobody should kid themselves. I agree with what amogles pointed out, how modest and discrete lifestyle does not attract today's youth. It is that way everywhere, and it is not just youth. It is hard to promote, market, make cash on. I run a thing in each class these days, ""today's coolest kid"" (yes, it is so corny on purpose, fun to work with dated tags..teachers rarely have the right license for trend spotting). The criteria change a bit every time, but it makes kids think..why do I pick selfless, modest, hard working kids, why I reward those who claim zero credit for actually very meaningful things. They do it for free. They get school for free, they return to the community.    
Instant gratification is an enormously marketable weakness of our times.    
I did read the thread, btw, see my last line.    
It's the height of the horse and some wild assumptions on free linked to laziness, spineless, aggressive, etc etc. Entitlement is probably a better concept to analyze.
		    No, I didn't say it was their fault.   
Neither did I say anything should be made harder for anybody.   
I was trying to anlayze causations, not judge them.
		    Yes, criticising is one thing and wanting to actually change the symbols (i.e. the flag) of a country other than your ""own"", a country that you chose to live in or you were forced to do so and were kindly taken aboard, it does seem a bit of the entitlement thingy to me. I like people that are not following everything Swiss blindly, dislike those with no critical thinking in general and easy to be manipulated, but the silly idea that this thread is based on is just similar to high horses and wild assumptions IMO.
		    Oh, absolutely. Like people can actually easily change a flag of any country, just like that...I can imagine we could all send our creative ideas either here or home, suggestions for flags, anthems, symbols, money, uniforms. I kinda do not want to really think about this particular creativity thing, no matter how much I promote it otherwise    
It would be cool if flags would change every year, just like gov. Kids should make them. And national anthems, too. I heard some interesting ones a little while ago coming from the bath.
		 
			
			Wait a sec, I thought this was a free country.  Why can't anyone just come here if they want to?  Borders are just man-made illusions.  And if they don't like things here, why can't they change it?  Everyone is equal.  Pah!  Free country, ya right.         Hehe, talking about those high horses...  
But, jokes aside....Why rub it then? I don't get it. It's not like the Swiss are taking things lightly or something.   
And yes, I also had a proposal for a new flag, I know what you mean.       Most people don't retain the flags that currently exist, really..  I did a quiz the other day, it is amazing to compare the skills some have for memorizing visual stimuli, wish I had a memory for all flags.    
I was being funny with the bathroom anthems, silly, it's just fun to hear. I don't think the lyrics would quite make the cut, anyways.    
Well, as per why the suggestion to change a flag..A strange way to get noticed?
		    Of course, but I wish they were more mature, it's not really helping their cause (whatever that is?), neither other foreigners. One can question symbols and mythology that is specific to every nation/culture/religion, even try to demolish them so to speak, no doubt, as we live in a free world (thankfully) but it's never going to get appreciations on a large scale, on the contrary. I thought   theme is recycled. (see Mohammed caricatures for instance) 
Anyway, too much noise for nothing, I can agree on that.
		     
Indeed, a flag is not just some colour schemes but rather the symbol of the national identity, and a longstanding tradition.      
The Mohammed caricatures were comparable as they also angered people NOT religious at all     
And this is why the SVP captured the trend, realising that 90%-plus reject the notion, while the enthusiasm for the Union flag has its clear Limits     
Look around in the Schrebergärten and on Trams and S-Bahnen, where the flags of communes and of the Canton dominate  --- and THIS leads to the centre. Changes in Switzerland have to be started on the Cantonal or Municipal Level and not on the Union level
		    In my perception, the changing of national symbols is something tinpot dictatorships in the Third World do. Every time there's a new dictator they have to rename the capital, reword the national anthem and tinker with the flag. It's the political power equivalent of the dog peeing on the hydrant.   
Stable and mature nations can live with their history and traditions and don't need to constantly tipp-ex around in them.
		    Yes Wolli, it's curious they have chosen exactly these sort of things to discuss (poke fun at), one would think they are a political organisation with some substance  and not a bunch of disgruntled teenagers, although these feelings must be still somewhere there, deep down.  
But, it must have to do with the level of inner freedom they have, isn't it...We are so critical of SVP's dumb things and their ultra-schematic way of communicating, why not with that.      Absolutely.
		     
I think the SVP took the opportunity to highlight how migrants to Switzerland do not hold the same values as the Swiss, and should not be trusted with Swiss National sovereignty and identity.  The SVP is a tenacious bunch.  In terms of political rhetoric, they do know how to pick points that strike nerves for added impact.  Shrewd, maybe tasteless, but apparently effective.
		    Couldn't agree more on this one. Despite all things I don't like here (there aren't too many tbh, yes, I'm that simple), I do believe that as a foreigner, it's much better living here than in other places in Europe.
		    You know, it costs to keep and maintain Switzerland.  It's a small place, and there is very little room for f***ups.  The Swiss exercise a certain diligence in how they conduct their public lives, and how they impact society.  Coming from other larger countries, foreigners can be very ignorant of this and sometimes feel they have the leeway to take their own actions lightly.  I think it aggravates the locals to see foreigners pee in their cheerios.  I can relate to that.  Considering Switzerland is now my country, when I see foreigner screwing with it, and not really adding much value to society..... makes me want to deport them.     Nothing racist about it.  I'm not even ethnically Swiss.        Although the SVP may at first come across like a bunch of teenagers on a hormone overdose driven by whatever crazy idea comes into their head after drinking their seventh beer, if you look more carefully and observe them over longer periods you'll see that on the contrary, there is a lot of shrewd strategy behind it all and that time and time again the other parties (who fall into the trap of underestimating them and assuming they're stupid) fail to see what's coming to hit them until its too late. If you can filter out the emotional stuff and the content its like watching an advanced game of chess. Especially if the chess master isn't playing only by his own strengths but is tricking his opponent into damaging his own position. In many cases, misguided anti-SVP rhetoric has helped the party more than its own campaigns have.   
In many ways, what they've done is studied the 1968 generation and their methods of communication, provactaion, of manipulating language, of slaughtering holy cows and of mass-claiming topics and areas of discontent - and more or less fine-tuned that while replacing the oiriginal content and solutions by their own. This makes it all the more surprising that the veteran battle-bruised 68ers of the SP are failing to recognize that they're at the wrong end of their own former campaign methods and are apparently unable to develop a feasible counter-strategy.   
The SVP certainly makes the right wing parties of most other countries, including UKIP, look like a bunch of clueless amateurs.
		 
			
			Obviously, SVP posters don't appeal to foreigners because foreigners can't vote anyway.  But on the political scale, they cover a broad swath of economic liberalism and conservatism that other parties don't.  That is an awful lot of intelligent and educated people.  While not everyone in that range is a member of the SVP, upon critical analysis, find the SVP propositions makes sense for them.  So no, the SVP does not only represent the views of a bunch of uneducated farmers.  I think they often pull from the FDP's and CVP constituents, because those two parties are often very uninspired.
		    Both CVP and FDP are pretty embarassing and it surprises me they still get the support they do. SVP is pretty good at draining off FDP supporters on economic and business questions, while poaching SP supporters on social and societal questions. In both cases this is an easy game as both parties have a blnd spot to their own failings in their core areas. It's a bit difficult to argue against CVP on anything as they don't actually have a coherent or consistent position on any important topic. The mistake most of the other parties is that they try anway.
		    You come across as a very involved person, Phos. A real asset to Switzerland, keep watching.  
Btw, it's not necessary to add you are not an ethnic Swiss, it's obvious.       Buahaha.     I flush my toilet late at night, I spend most of my money outside of Switzerland, I don't do Fasnacht, hate yodelling, run red lights at 4AM and I jaywalk.  I 'game the system' when it is legally left open and doesn't harm anything.  But I do enjoy the peace, stability and reliability in Switzerland and would like to keep it that way.     
I just don't agree with whiners and malcontents any more.  I don't know who invited them here, and why they couldn't backtrack and go back to where they came from.  Time is too short and life is too beautiful for such a dim outlook in life.
		     I agree and disagree.
		    As you know, if you come from certain countries within EU is extremely simple, once you find even a mundane job here, to get your residence permit. This, coupled with the fact that people get used quite quickly with a certain life style (because let's admit it, Swiss salaries are much higher than in many other places for the same type of work) to the point that nothing makes them content so easily, start seeing every imperfection. Whateva'.
		    Some people will seek out and focus on the negative, no matter what.
		     I find this happens more with either people who have just arrived here, or have been here for years, but surrounded by an English bubble. Since most the people I know outside of speaking German is English here.    
They never learn the language, or really get to know people, and have people they know like that, and manifest things that over exaggerate everything here.    
I remember helping with someone move a few years ago in Basel. When we were basically done a woman the flight of stairs down from them invited all of us over for coffee or tea. One of the languages she spoke was French as well. But, no English. Of the group I was the only that accepted. The woman was kind and friendly, and told me it was such a shame. She knew everyone in the building, except for the couple from the UK because they never spoke one word of German with her, or any of the 4 other languages she also spoke. They apparently didn't even push out the word Gruetzi. I mean heard them speaking to her in English basic things, and she of course didn't understand.   
Back in that apartment, and the group of only English speakers, except for 1, were talking about the building, the woman, Switzerland, and had no idea how to communicate with anyone here.    
It's easy to talk about people when they are not in the room. To make blanket statements about a country as whole from one or two isolated incidents. To say everyone is rude because they didn't read up on your mother tongue before you arrived. (And you I don't mean Greenmount).    
I think it has to do with not integrating. Even if you are going to only see yourself being here for two years, if you don't try to get along with your neighbor, and make an effort to understand him/her what is the point about making an international experience if you will take nothing away from it other then talking to a group of people, just like you, also not exposed to anything but each other?   
I did not come to Switzerland for a job, I came here because I had too. I never saw myself living here in the millions of plans I had, but it happened. I have gone with the flow so to say. But, hating everything because it is not what I am used isn't going to do me any favors.   
It could be worse, it could be Cleveland(people from Olten see what I mean).
		    of course i know you don't mean me. When one comes from a perceived ""minor"" culture like me one never even fantasize about any other soul knowing anything about their culture (to be clear TV stuff is not what I count as knowledge, for very objective reasons). In a strange way it's good, you can surprise a lot of people. Nah, actually I couldn't care less now tbh. 
Besides, I speak aprox. 5 foreign languages, never bothered me.
		    But look at the musical talents that have come from Cleveland.   
I forgot which Zen monk, Alan Watts, or some other who said, ""The quickest way out of hell is straight through the middle of its fire.""  I think it means that trying to avoid it only increase and prolongs its unpleasantries, or something like that.
		     
the Lady spoke several languages and so gave choices to the guests.  When I am abroad I offer German, English, French and (bad case) Îtalian and Arabic     
I fail to understand MONOlinguals
		     
co-operation is the word.  Mum, as long as my brother was alive, always said   
he died 27 SEP 94 but I still miss him

Tom
		     Toledo, Dayton, and a place they call Miami...the only thing good about Ohio is a long lost tv show based on WKRP.
		        That state is really hurting bad
		     It's because it is named Ohio...   
O!...hi!...o(h) 
Plus they lost a war with Michigan.
		 
			
			That wasn't even a real war. A few rounds were shot in the air at the so-called Battle of Phillips Corners in spring 1835, and a MI Deputy Sheriff was injured with a pen knife half a year later, known as the Toledo Bloodshed.    
In the end, Michigan lost the Toledo strip, about 470 square miles with nothing but a few thousand Ohioans. As a compensation, it got the Upper Peninsula with more than 16,000 square miles and, as was found out later, huge iron and copper deposits. Ok, the problem was that the Upper Perninsula was settled by Yoopers, but they eventually learned to live with those.
		 
			
			Ohio has produce hundreds, if not thousands of great bands from all kinds of genres.  From old soul (O'Jays, Isley Brothers, Lakeside, etc.) to Rock n Roll (Eagles, The Cars, etc.) to New Wave Punk (The Pretenders, The Cramps, Devo, etc).   
If it takes so much doldrum and misery to produce so many great musical talents, then more doldrum and misery to Ohio then!       
And by the way, they also have one of the biggest swinger communities in the world.           
Ohio also produced   
General Ulysses Sydney Grant
		    What state is high in the middle and round at both ends.....Ohio        
The father of Granddad on the mother side worked on the railways building between New York and Chicago in the 1870ies , became a US citizen in the mid 70ies, and after his return in 1880 arranged that learning English was mandatory for his son, my granddad, my mother and me
		    Speaking of railroads, this thread has long been sufficiently derailed.   
And BTW, it shows.
		     
it shows ??   what do you mean ?
		 
			
			that'd go perfectly with the changing of the swiss anthem!...
		 
			
			Most countries would be unhappy with a flag change 
as for a new anthem, I personally find that sad, I like the current one
		 
			
			Of all the things about living in Switzerland, I find the flag to be a big plus.
		    What? We've moved on to railroads now        
While I DETEST the current one which was forced onto Switzerland by foreign powers and still love the old one we had into the 1960ies              
here in Italian with a nice Video     
plus 
here in German            Ok, taste always is a matter of taste, but I assume you know that there was a very good reason for the change, even without any pressure from outside. It was really awkward when, at certain international events, the British and the former Swiss national anthems were played immediately after each other.
		    then how about changing it to this one?             
Also the rail loks have FLAGS and names on them, like these ones                            Good one.  
I'll be using it.

something for you  
-
		            How about Liechtenstein's National Anthem?       
Or the de facto National Anthem of the USA, before   caught on?       
Or Norway's Royal Anthem,   (not their National Anthem)?       
Or the National Anthem of the Russian Empire, 200 years ago?       
Or ... you see where I'm going with this?
		     
Sure, the same melody in all cases, also in fact in case of  .  Many of the Anthems of the Arab World are copies of the UAE Anthem, some of the Lebanese one. I do not see any Problem with this. Switzerland however gave it up in favour of a lousy ridiculous thing.     
THIS   
would have been better, of course with a new FEDERAL text
		 
			
			it is really true... but Switzerland do a good job to motivate to adapt and push to change the situation for those people that uses social system. Other countries like Brazil try to do some similar thing but the effect is the oppositive. There they create ten year ago one benefit for the people that have children and do not work jut to take out those people from the poverty line to put Brazil on better worldwide racking. So now they have an bigger problem: have a lot of dependent from that system and the govern did not push to improve those people and consequently do not need those 'social rescue' anymore.  
""give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime""
		    That the descendants of whomever wrote that melody wish it wasn't in the public domain?
		 
			
			I would propose to change the ""plus"" inside the Swiss flag to a ""minus""....but I'm afraid it would only get a ""negative"" reaction                   Link above shows that this idea has been used already  
Sorry for that empty post...could someone delete it?
		    A bit like the German and old Austrian anthems.   
Seeing it was the Germans who stole the tune from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and not vice versa I find it a bit tough that the Austrians let the Germans keep it.    
Haydn actually borrowed the tune from a Croatian folk song, so nothing to do with Germany at all.   
But I guess there was a little colonel with only one ball who messed things up.
		     
Shhhhh   
the only correct text is       
These words, written by Lorenz Leopold Haschka owe their direct inspiration to  .   
There was even a Hungarian version           
HERE the sung Version of the Anthem of Austria-Hungary            In order to stick closer to Swiss reality, I would replace the ""plus"" by the sign ""devide""...
		       
Why not with the far nicer           %   
			
			yes, can you imagine the American reaction to a headline reading ""MEXICAN PROPOSES A NEW AMERICAN FLAG DESIGN"" or even ""CANADIAN PROPOSES A NEW AMERICAN FLAG DESIGN""....yeah, I don't think that would make it through the house or senate! Ah well....
		     
clear. Either the Mexican embassy or/and the Canadian embassy in Washington/DC would become a matter of history
		 
			
			you think so? Do we Americans even have an embassy in Switzerland? I say the Swiss should use the old ""saying"" that I used to hear about Canada: ""The Americans have the American dream while the Canadians (or Swiss, more accurately) live it."" what do you think?
		    already taken by Deutsche Bank
		    are you kidding, i hope?    
just wait till you have to go there for some reason, and they treat you as a criminal.    
Swiss living the American dream? not at all. The Swiss are smart enough to reject the American sense of rugged individualism, imperialism, and manifest destiny...
		    I know one Canadian that has proposed the US change their flag by adding ten stars to it. Don't think his idea is popular with his fellow Canadians, though...       
P.S. Correction---Diane Francis is American, not Canadian. I don't think many of her fellow Americans are in favour of this idea, either. Even if Quebec was left out and there was no language issue, this ""merger"" would be a political nightmare to implement.
		     
Well, imagine the new USA to be a monarchy, with QE-II being the HEAD OF STATE of the enlarged USA. ""God Save the Queen"" would then be the new National Anthem. The President would simply be the new PRIME MINISTER  of the UDA --  USAF and RCAF would become the  And the US Navy would become the    The Broadway in NY  will become the QUEENSWAY and later the KINGSWAY.  And of course, the American dominions will Change to driving on the LEFT     
Also some nominations 
> Jimmy Carter will become the EARL OF GEORGIA 
> Geoge Herbert Walker Bush (GHWB)  
       will become the COUNT OF HOUSTON

>  Barack Hussein Obama will become the LORD OF CHICAGO
		 
			
			I think that putting an NFL franchise in London (which seems more and more likely within a decade) is a baby step to making the UK the next four US states.   
As for Austria being the ""minus"" sign to Switzerland's ""plus"", it's only appropriate considering for how long Switzerland fought against Austria when they were under the rule of the ex-Swiss Hapsburg dynasty.
		     
Switzerland and Austria were not at war often really. The HABSBURGER originated from the Habsburg Close to Baden and so were just some AARGAUER AGGLOS   ....    and even long after the Habsburger had become EMPERORS in Vienna, they happily took part in intra Swiss conflicts. .  Strangely, the Habsburger in the times when they ruled much of later Switzerland were not yet in Wien but in Aachen.
		    Weren't the Habsburgs (before they moved to Aargau and started wearing white socks) originally from Alsace. So really they're just a bunch of Frenchmen    
Swiss history is complicated, with enemies changing over time and external powers frequently getting involved in internal conflicts and enemies of one generation becoming the allies of the next (and vice versa). However, the original breakaway of the Urkantone was definitely a rebellion against Habsburg power.   
Of course the Habsburgs of the 13 Century had in little in common with the Habsburgs at the later peak of their power. So one shouldn't let the name conjure up a certain picture.
		    Until they signed the FATCA agreement and now the Swiss banks have officially become the long arm of the IRS... doing all the screening, investigative and reporting work of monitoring all US citizens financial actions FOR FREE.
		 
			
			So, the joke about the Swiss flag being a big plus doesn't fly too well with the Swiss people?   
Also, I love ""olygirl""'s comment about the Swiss banks becoming the long arm of the IRS. Isn't that the truth?! But, on the other hand, this has provided all us Americans with great jobs in Switzerland. You gotta love that!    
You guys are hilarious! Whatever the NFL or the IRS or any other frustrated American institution decides to do, we really must get together some time and trade horror stories. I know I've got more than my share....hehehe   
Go local sports team! Er....I mean....U! S! A! U! S! A!....er....I mean....America the Beautiful....or whatever....
		 
			
			by the way, the States has an embassy in Switzerland. I was just kidding about that one...we have an embassy in Zurich and I think another one in Bern. Good old USA. Always thinking on it's toes and coming up with creative political solutions to creative political problems made by other creative politicians so that other creative politicians can further make more creative political solutions to yet more creative political problems and so on and so forth....to infinity and beyond!
		    Actually, the first time I heard this joke it was from a Swiss person. This was about 20 years ago mind you.   
The joke, as best as I can remember it was like this.   
The Austrian president was fed up with the Swiss making jokes about the Austrians so he summoned the Swiss ambassador to complain.   
The president said   
""i don't understand why you Swiss always make jokes about us. After all, out two countries have so  much in common, we are both mountain countries, we speak in strange dialects, come on, even our flags have the same colours ...""   
Whereupon the ambassador retorted   
""yeah, and ours has a plus and yours a minus"".   
Not exactly hilarious, I know, but after about 8 beers you do sort of chuckle ...
		     
When Rudolf II was emperor and made Zürich and Bern FREIE REICHS-STAEDTE, France was NOT YET existing. It was the Grand-Duchy of Paris, heavily rivalled by the Kingdoms of Burgundy and Normandie (those of the Normandie later became Kings of Britain
		 
			
			I know this story is quite old, but I think it's quite rude for an immigrant to suggest changing the flag, even as a sort of joke.
		    Technically they are not immigrants because they're born here, some even third generation.   It will take another couple of generations and some name alterations (the ""-ic"" must be transformed in ""-er"") in order to be seen as ""natives""....probably.        
Where somebody was born is irrelevant. What matters is the citizenship
		    Of course Wolli....my point was that we're already talking about adults who not only  lived here all their lives, but also were born here...I find it hard to believe they're not yet Swiss citizens....at least the majority.  
If not, it means CH has a problem.
		     
if they have lived here as foreigners so be it  ---  THEIR Problem but NOT a Problem for CH
		    It won't take that long.   
There has over the last couple of years already been a change in attitudes to ""-ic people"". This is in part due to the problematic generation growing out of their rebel, boy-racing and anti-authoritarian years and settling down and moving into responsible professions and planting red geraniums (and not to mention many joining the SVP Stammtischs where their Swiss neighbours discover they're actually much the same as themselves and share many of the same aspirations and problems). Also, other immigrant groups have replaced the ""ics"" as the nation's favourite bogeymen.
		      Wolli, you are assuming that must be these people's choice that they have lived their entire lives in Switzerland as foreigners. That may not necessarily be the case.
		     
I am not assuming either.  However, for decades an Italian or a German citizenship offered Advantages over the Swiss one
		    Though I'm not sure the same can be said of an Albanian one.
		     
I basically meant West-European ones, and not the Balkans

1	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/151583-allow-porn-schools-swiss-men-s-group.html	" 
			
			A Swiss organization for men and fathers is pressing for teachers to be given the freedom to show pornographic materials to children in class.         
			
			From what I've seen and heard from schoolies they're all sending pics of each other on their phones as it is.   
Parents: teach your children well
		 
			
			Isn't that doing the art book section of the school library out of business???
		    I think it is good to not raise inhibited children, letting them know that sex is ok provided they are properly educated about ... ... ...    
but, I think it is a bit much to be bringing porn into school. I am hardly against porn, in fact, other than the creepy stuff, I think it is relatively healthy. Markus Theunert may need to take his sociology to a psychologist. If a child should see porn, it is imho the parents responsibility to share it, not a school teacher.    
With that said, I have not been here long enough to know how the swiss culture is towards showing porn openly. I know hired sex is legal, drugs are legal, etc... but no clue about this one.
		 
			
			Worth noting that the sensationalist headline says ""children"", in this case referring to 16+ age group which also happens to be the age if consent. And the porn is softcore.    
I don't think I'm comfortable with the proposal but certainly people need to read the article to form an opinion - it's not like they are wanting to show hard ore stuff to 5 year olds.
		 
			
			Before internet, school kids found their porn in the piles of old paper they collected.
		 
			
			Look: Nobody's gonna show  to the kids. This is just another National Enquirer type of story.      Of course that's only what you've  , isn't it ?
		 
			
			Showing 16 year olds a few minutes of pron so they can discuss it and develop the tools to ""deal with it"" sounds so woolly and pointless.   
Exactly how should people ""deal"" with such material?  Most people who use it, use it in subterfuge and apart from a few oblique references with peers very rarely discuss it.    
Bringing it into a formal classroom environment with a group of 16 year old boys with raging hormones lurching from inappropriate outbursts to acute embarrassment will just make it awkward and ridiculous.
		 
			
			I don't discuss TheLocal's lies, nobody cares. Just a personal note to it:   
We had that in ethics with the older ones, it was funny.  
My lesson's ""kick off"": 
Given the fact that at least some of you have porn on their mobiles, 
and given the fact that I am an adult with full access right to porn, 
what are the ethical implications of knowing that you know that I know and vice-versa?   
They all left that lesson with a clear idea that ethics is not just for politics and religion...
		 
			
			Wow. I guess I didn't realize that there is a ""proper"" way to ""deal"" with porn.    
I can just see it now...    
Ron Jeremy's Guide to Porn Etiquette.       Wow, doesn't anyone remember being a kid? I sure remember finding my father's hidden stash of Playboy and a skanky Hustler in the woods one time. It didn't appeal to me, but I was curious just the same. Of course, being a Catholic girl, I had no idea what it was all about until I got to University.   
It's a tough call though, these days, where access to porn is so much more easily had and much earlier. I contemplate this issue frequently, not only as someone who helped build the internet, but as a parent who knows there is no software anywhere that can limit someone who wants what they want. If the schools are teaching children about the various flavors of porn, that'd be one thing but...shouldn't that be something the parents should do (in the land of the much vaunted  )?
		    I have two words for this thread...National Geographic
		    You don't discuss the Locals ""lies"" yet you want to leave a ""personal"" note. Whatever it is you are asking isn't clear and has nothing to do with children wether 5 plus or 16 plus being introduced porn in school.
		 
			
			If the first time some teenage kid sees genitalia ""in the flesh"" rather than through internet porn, then I'd question their internet connection speed rates.
		 
			
			""Just like Mommy""          I missed that episode of ""Thunderbirds"", do you have it on VHS?
		    Er, yeah. Shh. I'll bring it over later.              You didn't understand, that's fine. The point was that discussing porn for many different reasons is already part of different aspects of education in school at different ages and that there is no need for pictures or films for that. My example was the utter extreme in philosophy class with older, but it's the same at any stage.
		    Well since no one else has since commented on your personal note, I don't think I was the only one that didn't understand. And if no one understands you, it's hard to discuss it.    
If we are talking about the Swiss system, and the US system at the very least, I think you would be hard pressed to find any regular teaching or discussing of porn by professors in any subject at a public or private school. Sounds like an instant firing if you ask me.    
And your extreme philosophy porn discussions older or any age is a surprise. Was there a professor where you attended school that you nicknamed the Hedgehog, by any chance? I suppose some teachers do moonlight from time to time.   
I mean Hung for example?
		    That's your words. What I said: 
- my lesson kick-off 
- extreme example 
- philosophy class 
You mixed them all in your blender. Not me.    
The reason I don't discuss the Local's lies is exactly what you point out: one does not discuss porn as such in class, it's not a subject and not part of a subject either and won't ever be it. One knows that porn exist, accepts this fact and does not censor it away from the actual teaching. We teach concepts, and if by doing so, we ""touch"" pornography, then so be it. We don't avoid it here but it's not a porn class.    
Even in sexual education, where the discussion about showing porn originated, the idea is to liberate verbal expression in order to kill myths. Giving them condoms to roll up on colourful dildos is part of it, the reflection leading to porn is the ground attitude that if one needs something in class, we use it, no censorship. How useful and for what pedagogical purpose porn could be useful, that's the core of the discussion, and it's not what TheLocal catching line is about. Hence my refusal to relate to them.    
By deviating to philosophy when talking about porn in this thread, it should be clear that I don't advocate the use of porn films. Not because I'm shocked by it of even condemn it as such, but only because in my professional eyes, it would serve no pedagogical purpose. When porn is relevant to my teaching, pictures are not necessary, they all know what is it about and we can proceed to the actual teaching. But who am I to forbid other people to continue that discussion for sex education with pupils 16-19 years old? I do advocate sex education in school, but I don't tell them how to do their job. There are enough people in the field of sex education who participate to this debate, they don't need theLocal's headlines to lead a sensible pedagogical discussion.    
In each field of education, there are outrageous ideas out there. Sex makes it to the headlines, not the other ones. To me, this story is a pedagogical discussion like another one. Business as usual, people have different opinions, exchanging ideas is always a good idea, disagreeing is positive for constructive professional educational discussions etc.
		    Yeah, I remember sneaking Playgirl and Penthouse magazines that I found hidden in my mom's wardrobe. There was a spread (no pun intended) with a naked Don Johnson, which I thought was pretty cool at the time.      
But really, I sneaked them mostly for the articles.       It's hard to read anything of what you post if you tell me that the words you wrote are my words when I quote you by copying it. You wrote ""extreme philosophy"". You think no one else sees that?   
But from reading your post I still have to say if you don't want to discuss what theLocal posted as an article why don't you open your own thread about the subject? You want to post about a different subject then what this thread is about, and your wasting your time when it would be better spent opening threads or commenting on threads relating. Popping in wherever you like and talking about different subjects isn't going to go anywhere.    
And for me to be clear, the word Mixmaster that you have crowned me, yes I am. But in this case when you write in Haiku fashion, on a different subject then the title thread, then I have to do my best to sort it out.
		 
			
			Please. By the time they are 16, boys can already be considered somewhat as experts on porn. Thinking that this will be the first contact that they have with the stuff is as naive as thinking that the moon is made out of cheese.   
As for the matter of showing it in class- I'm not really sure there is a need for that. Kids can have access to it anytime they want, regardless if we show it in class or not. I think sex ed classes should focus more on educating kids in PROPER sexual behaviour, staying safe and being smart.
		    I wholeheartedly thank you for your concerns. My words were the following:    Thank to you, I do see that my post is cryptic. I assumed (wrongly perhaps) that the sensationalistic titles of TheLocal were of no interest to anybody. Their title is plain wrong, as always, it doesn't even match what they write. Everybody agrees on sex ed for discussing PROPER sexual behaviour (with a certain degree of diversity), even the people who advocate the use of short soft porn extracts to engage the discussion about dealing with cyberpornography. I might see that with a technical pedagogical eye and only see the lack of interest to use such clips as a pedagogical start off for a discussion about sexuality. The ""bridge"" to philosophy class is that naming pornography is enough for everybody over 16 to know what is meant and there is nothing we could show them usefully in class that they don't already have seen. Hence the absence of point, for me, to use short soft porn clips for anything meaningful in a lesson.    
I might be cynical about it because most main public French films will have more sex in it that what those pedagogues meant in the first place. When 18th century literature is in the focus of our attention, I have shown the film ""Ridicule"". The first scene is a guy urinating on an old baron with full screen penis. Later, one sees a Abbé making a marquise have an orgasm. Soft porn indeed. But that's a main stream movie, also shown at 08:45 on national TV. There are many such examples and nobody go to the Local to make a juicy head line.
		     Dude I copied and pasted your quote, contact the moderators at EF if you want to continue discussing this.
		    Whats naive about thinking that?
		    Hmmm, yeah, I agree.  But I guess kids are watching porn and assuming that's the norm (surveys show that more young adults think that anal sex is the done thing).  Being in an environment where it can be discussed openly with a responsible adult might manage expectations.  On the other hand, it might just be an embarrassing mess.
		 
			
			maybe such intimate education should be handled by the local priest as is the habit in other countries ;-/
		 
			
			The question should be, What is next ?       16 is probably a bit old for them, no?
		 
			
			What a joke!!! there is no way on this earth that i would allow my kids to see porn in schools... PERIOD! i don't care what any government says, i will rip my kids out of any schooling system that allows this faster than anything...    
I can't believe they are even entertaining this!
		    Is stanvrensburg the new Local.ch? Reporting on news three years after the event?
		    Thank you for posting this...I am sure it has nothing to do with you trying to reach your 10 post to sell some crap, and more to do with your random concern over random subject on this community.

Tom
		    My thoughts exactly.  Don't crash into one whatever you do!        Because gas/petrol/diesel has the opposite effect.
		    No, because at least we know the problems with these and hopefully the manufacturers take some precautions to prevent explosions on crashing.  What research have Swatch and Toyota done on the new fuel cells in a crash situation?  Not much is my guess, given the cost to make the things in the first place.  Can't go smashing them up willy-nilly like you can with an ordinary vehicle.   
And how much more pollution is being added in the making of these fuel cells as well?  What most people don't realise is that more pollution is created making these ""so called"" green cars than you get with ordinary ones.  It's simply been shifted from the cars themselves to the manufacturing process.
		     Guessing as usual.
		    You mean like those propane trucks that explode every day?  BTW the amount of hydrogen in the fuel cell is about the same as the amount of petrol in a petrol engine at any given time - i.e. not much.  The rest is  in a gas tank and I know they ARE crash tested.      More guessing?
		 
			
			The most interesting project is the one from Quant. 
And it should be tested soon on German streets.   
it's based on nanoflowcell technology.                That's not quite the same though - no liquid H2 under incredible pressure to cause problems in that one.    
400l fuel tank isn't exactly a trivial volume loose in the car... and they don't say what specific metal ions they've used - a bit misleading to say it's powered on ""an ocean"". Yeah, technically it is ""salt water"", but what  of ionic solution? Those can get pretty exotic, and pricey.   
But 925hp, 1-100 in3.8s and 400-600km range? I would be very interested in a price. sadly, I don't expect that to be in a range most would consider realistic.
		    And after a bit more research into the company... you may want to google the founder. Turns out he was trying to push a similar design a while ago, using vanadium as the salt. No problem with that, but it makes his performance well, well above the the best results for vanadium redox flow cells to date (they claim 600 Wh/kg, best production models I've heard of give 25 Wh/kg. that's a 40x energy density increase!). There's no mention of what salt they're using this round, but the absence of that info just makes me more wary.   
Slightly more digging found that he  have a history of overly optimistic performance projections, having been accused of fraud by investors for supposedly rigging a demo photovoltaic that coincidentally also had extremely high performance predictions. Court ruled that the investors simply failed in their due diligence. Take that as you will.    
Long story short, I'll believe the numbers when I see them from independent testing.
		 
			
			I heard they were planning a clockwork car but in the end it was just a wind-up.
		    Yes, most hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels.  It is pretty much another of these 'catalytic converter' style scams: finding new and interesting ways to get cars to use even more oil whilst claiming to save the environment.  And even supposedly intelligent people fall for it.       What is scammy about the catalytic converter?  Or are you referring to the catalysis of the electrolysis reaction to break apart H 2  and O?
		 
			
			I don't know why these things keep on going around in circles.   
Hydrogen cells have been around for a long time but their problem is their miserably low energy efficiency. Progress in battery technology has put the technology in the limelight.
		    That's what they said about petrol as well. That and it would never work because you would need to put fuel stations everywhere so the cars could opperate..... pffft petrol, what a stupid idea that turned out to be.   
Maybe we should all just go back to distilling whale blubber, that sounds sustainable.
		    I don't think it is the efficiency of the cell, so much as too much energy is currently lossed in the process of isolating the necessary amount of hydrogen fuel.
		    Last I checked they were planning to strip it from Methane.  Certainly not carbon neutral but I believe expected to be near twice the carbon efficiency of internal combustion.
		    Catalytic converters are claimed to be good for the environment, but if you saw the devastation left after mining for the materials you might think different.  Also they weigh, which causes a car to use more fuel to carry it about, also they need to be kept at an optimum temperature which in all cases means the car pushes extra fuel at them, i.e. uses more fuel to clean up.   
Don't know about you but to be better environmentally it might be an idea to do stuff that menas you need put less fuel in in the first place, hence why it's a scam: claim to do one thing, does the exact opposite: whilst costing you plenty.
		    Completely missing the point that the purpose of a catalytic converter is to remove the poisons produced by an internal combustion engine.  Of which there are otherwise quite a lot and there is no other reasonable way of removing them.   
BTW Platimium mining in itself is not particularly problematic given that the bulk is produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining which we do anyway.
		    As well as Aluminum, ., same can be said for gold and a few other higher value minerals.  not the bulk, necessarily, but it is extractable.   
The catalytic converter's weight is well within the +/- of which and how many passengers are on board, and it's definitely pulling it's own weight.
		    It is still extra weight and therefore it still costs extra to carry around.  
A car with a cat will use 10% more fuel than one without, removing it will up the performance a bit, removal and remap to a non-cat map, not a performance map just one that doesn't waste fuel, will improve it alot.  Driving normally will then produce a 10% saving in fuel. 
Amusingly my old 750 had a heater in the cat to warm it up faster so it qualified as a high efficiency vehicle.       It must be a big cat:        Give it a couple years and carvolution will eliminate the bad drivers       So, without the catalytic converter, a 10% full savings means you are pouring 10% less NOx, SOx, and COx into the atmosphere.   
As opposed to with the cat, where once at prime conversion conditions, well over 90%* of pollutants are converted.  head scratcher, that.       not high efficiency, but low emission.  the preheated e-cat reached optimal conversion conditions faster => more pollutants neutralized     
* quick number search on 3 way converter, can probably get more specific;   in my search I spotted this though:  www.gizmag.com/more-effective- - /30636/
		    The 10% figure is nonsense anyway. In a very few cases, in the very early days of cat converters being required they were sometimes fitted to engines not designed for them, and did have a noticeable effect on economy, but once the engine designs and mappings were modified accordingly, this difference largely disappeared.    
The additional few kilos of weight will of course make a marginal difference to efficiency, but only equivalent to carrying a spare tyre, a toolkit and an extra can of petrol.    
The very fact that it's the conspiracy-theory nutjobs pushing the idea should be a big enough clue in itself, e.g.    
Still, it gives them something to whinge about, and a good laugh for the rest of us.      ""Unsafe at any speed"" Ralph Nader 1965 has a chapter about how the steering column becomes a javelin in some collisions.  And I've seen several accidents on admittedly older cars where a rear end shunt pushed the rear bumper mounting brackets into the petrol tank rupturing it.  People were stood around smoking and nothing happened.  One might think some form of Darwinism would reduce the bad driver and idiot population but, if anything such as that awakening to an angry tram bell this morning would say, it is safer cars that are keeping them alive.
		    I have yet to see any difference in fuel economy with the cat removed.   
Tom
		    Thanks Ace, I figured as much in post #25, .., the second part of my comment that you quote was my attempt at indicating the real benefit of cat. converters, a clumsy attempt at sarcasm i guess.
		 
			
			So the point being made is that burning more fuel and carrying around a cat is better environmentally than not burning it?  Right.       hahaha 
The car could be a portable toilet!
		    Yes and to achieve this feat they need two (i.e. 1 more than the normal 1) huge lead-acid batteries in the boot (so big there is no room under the bonnet for them).  What a great way to achieve low emissions. LOL    
There again the 750 I had before that had two batteries too, however they weren't as big.
		     
I'm guessing you don't know a lot about catalysis
		 
			
			Good thing is ,if you see some little mushroom on the horizon . Take  a detour right away       The E38 750 had an e-cat in the facelift (production after Sept. '98) for emissions. The two battery system was in place since '95 (beginning of production). The car is a limousine and had an abundance of electrical components that were expected to be operated by drivers waiting for their passengers. One 120Ah battery (and even smaller) is more than enough. Also the starter for that V12 besides sounding amazing, was eating up a lot of amps, and was better with one battery that was not powering stereo+TV+electric seats + the REST heating function with the aux water pump and the fans in the car.         
The purpose of cats are immediately-destroying pollutants, namely carbon monoxide (CO) and absolutely hateful nitrous oxides. If we didn't implement them, lean burning engines could have lower emissions of CO2 and lower consumption, but much higher NOx and instead of worrying about what will happen in 20 years of greenhousing the earth, we would die of poisoning much sooner.   
There is always a trade off in using technology. There is no such thing as a free meal. If you want to move around fast you will need energy and you will emit something. Some people will always find something to complain about.        
Energy will either be cheap but dirty, or expensive and less dirty. You can't have both. The only way humans have a zero impact on the environment is actually renouncing civilisation and everything that comes with it.   
The matter of the fact remains though, that people will have to remember that other species would do the same with us having the same tools or capacities we do. Birds build nests, we build houses. It's a different scale but it's the fact that we can use resources on a much grander scale is what has allowed us to leave comfortably and involve ourselves with other things than basic survival.   
So stop complaining about ""it's better to not spend energy"", and just promote more sensible use of energy. And no, taking the bicycle is not sensible if I have to move 35 ton cargo around Europe...       
About fire safety:   
When you talk about fire hazards in fuels, please have in mind the following: 
A lithium battery has everything it needs to continue burn until it burns out and has nothing else. You can actually extinguish a gasoline or hydrogen fire. There is little to nothing you can do for a battery fire. You just wait it out. Even  , are just keeping it under ""control"" until it burns out. And while gas/hydrogen tanks need a shock and a spark to catch fire, a lithium battery can just spontaneously combust since it's (almost) always excited. Yes safe-guards in charging and power electronics systems reduce the statistical probability of that significantly, and they are considered perfectly safe, but because people know that gasoline/hydrogen are flammable doesn't mean they are unsafe.       
Also, as an engineer that has partly designed, built, and raced a dedicated one-seater race car, seeing the percentages, guesses, and numbers thrown around like someone's talking about flour quantities in pancakes make me cringe. Throwing away the cat on its own makes nothing to economy, can make it much worse in everyday use of a car, and adding a battery to a two tonne car with a 5.6 l V12 engine with 2 valves on the head does pretty much jack shit to its 20lt/100Km consumption. Case in point the BMW 850Ci, which has one battery and can easily go to 25 and 30 lt/100Km when driven in a mildly fun way (have driven both in many occasions and a dear friend owns both among other late 90s behemoths).
		    Both my 850s a 5.7 Alpina B12 and a csi MTech had two batteries.
		    A) would you like to adopt me? Or could I pay you actual money so I can sit in those?   
B) Factory installed yes, it's a 2 battery system, but the car works fine with one. You just can't let it sit for more than a week because of the drains   
C) The point stands        
I fully believe in the future of electric cars     
and in the longer term in electronically guided ones. Which means that you enter the co-ordinates and take your place in the back
		 
			
			Iceland has enormous reserves of geo-thermal energy, and years ago they wanted to lay an undersea cable and export electricity to Scotland. But electric power losses, on the UK electric grid as heat, are around 30%.    
But Iceland could easily produce hydrogen without creating any pollution, and export the hydrogen by pipeline to Scotland, or similarly as gasses from oil production countries are liquified and exported by ship to Europe.    
Hydrogen does explode, but so does petrol. When released, hydrogen will rise up, but petrol falls down. So in a serious accident I would guess hydrogen is going to be the safer fuel.
		 
			
			The Toyota Mirai hydrogen powered car is now on sale. It is big and expensive, but hydrogen powered, (5 meters long, 2 tons, and costing $60,000 )        
			
			Corporate idea = next scam.
		 
			
			Swatch dropped the plans for a hydrogen powered car ( ).
		     
Sold the Project of hydrogen cars to SWISS HYDROGEN SA in Marin and now goes under the name of RENATA in Ittingen for battery driven cars
		 
			
			Well at least I got to drive it. We worked on a novel composite storage vessel with a piezoelectric barrier layer and self health monitoring system. PSI developed new more efficient membranes for the fuel cell. It was always only ever going to be a research project based on the idea of a Hydrogen community. Check out this     
			
			I was just about to post a reply about the Swatch car being a wind-up - then realised this was a thread revived from the graveyard, and I posted that joke 2 years ago.   
Anyway, why don't they build a helium powered car? It might not go anywhere but you can have great fun impersonating the chipmunks.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			The European Union said on Thursday it is helping Greece negotiate with Switzerland in a bid to claw back some the 60 billion in unpaid taxes believed to be hidden in Swiss banks.         
			
			Switzerland also should be aiding Greece in this. Why ?  Because Greece always has been and in fact even now still IS a good customer of Swiss industry !
		 
			
			Still going?       Get your facts straight, please.   Switzerland would NOT help Greece this way, it would help only a bunch of corrupted Greeks. Otherwise ""simpletons"" will have to pay so that bunch would continue to be rich by dishonest means.
		    The last paragraph of the article sums it up nicely.
		     
Be realistic. Some People will ALWAYS Profit. This already was the case in the times of the Roman Empire and will be so in future     
And 
A)  it would allow the Greeks to use a REAL currency for everything 
B)  Greece would push the CHF down to an acceptable rate against the Euro
		 
			
			Those governments helping each other to confiscate other peoples money worry me. Is it illegal in Switzerland not to pay taxes in some foreign country? I'm not advocating not to pay taxes, but it's just not Switzerland's business.
		    Tax evasion is an administrative matter in CH rather than a criminal matter, that's why they took a blind eye on foreign tax evasion.
		    Isn't it an administrative matter only as long as the authorities cannot prove criminal intent?   
This is still different to many EU countries of course where you're guilty until proven innocent.
		     The problem is that many rich Greek people and greek companies were avoiding paying taxes to the tune of several billions of euros by hiding their money in swiss accounts with the help of the Swiss banks.    
You do see the problem right? If not, probably your are one of these greedy swiss bankers    
Nobody is talking about confiscating innocent people's money or anything, but instead it's about paying the amount of tax that is duly owed to the greek government by its citizens.
		    What I am worried about is not that those people evade taxes somewhere abroad, it's the fact that Switzerland tries to enforce laws of another country on the Swiss soil. If we go to the extreme, we can expect Swiss authorities to extradite a gay couple back to Saudi Arabia, because it's illegal to be gay there.
		     What?? You're way off the mark I'm afraid.    
First of all, a random gay person is not (necessarily) a Saudi citizen, so the Saudi government cannot exert any authority over this person. If this person were a Saudi citizen, then he/she could ask for asylum in a number of countries.    
However, tax evasion is not a reason to ask for asylum last time I checked! Therefore, your example is moot.   
Second, nobody will take your money without any reason at all. This issue is about Greek and/or other EU citizens who secretly hid money in swiss banks, so they only ones to pay for this are these people.    
Third, the Swiss banks actively and willingly  helped these people tax evade and commit a crime, from which they benefited a lot, while Greece lost significant income, especially in a time of need. Therefore, I feel that Switzerland has a moral obligation to right this injustice.
		    A moral obligation, eh?    
lol
		     
To transfer money onto bank accounts in Switzerland is perfectly legal. Whether the customers declare the money on the tax forms is a matter between those individuals and their country. I do NOT see any  in any way
		     
Forgetting to mention something is clearly a mistake       So, if one of your family members stole a large amount of money from you and your next door neighbour helped him/her to hide it, that would be ok with you?    
Also, you really believe the neighbour would have no moral or legal obligation to mention the theft and help resolve the situation?        What's so funny about that? Ever since the crisis begun, northern European countries, eg Germany, Finland, are touting the virtues and the morality of paying ones debts etc.    
So, why isn't it moral to help another country track down its people who do not want to pay their debts and tax evade?
		     
Because countries don't have morals.     
Do you have any understanding of what you're talking about at all?       I've just realized that I'm wasting my time responding in this thread.    
Cheers
		     
Toodle pip!        
Immoral is that you regard whomever is investing his money abroad as tax-evader.  Countries like Greece had the possibility to ask for help accordingly but failed to do so over decades.
		    So, for you not paying taxes and hiding your money abroad is ""investing""???   
Only a corrupt swiss banker would say that...
		 
			
			opening an account and investing in market funds within that bank is not hiding money. Of course it is investing. it's not up to UBS to hold your hand and ask if you filled out your tax returns properly and be sure you declare accounts in your name. what ficking nanny planet are you from?             
....it is so much simpler if they just have you sign all the paperwork before you can open the account.... aka the US citizen process!         
if the Investor Forgets to declare the profits he made back home it is something between him and his corrupt home country
		     
Whomever opens a bank account in Switzerland has to fill out the paperwork as required  (even in Zug)  --  and what you call the US citizen process was forced through by the USA government
		    That's bull$h1t and you know it. Aiding someone to hide undeclared income and cheating on taxes makes you an accomplice, it's as simple as that.    
On another note, quite frankly I can't remember a year in the last decade or so, when a  swiss bank didn't get a multi-billion $$$ fine or was not involved in a  money laundering scandal. Therefore, it must be clear even to you that  some of the most corrupt and greedy banks on the planet are here and  obviously the swiss government knows this and does nothing about it.    
I'm  really happy that the EU and other countries (US etc) are bullying  Switzerland to adopt transparency rules and to stop helping criminals hiding their money here.
		    Can you at least make an effort at trolling? This stuff wasn't all that hilarious when porsch1909 was doing it, and it sure as hell isn't funny now.
		    I believe only US citizens have to sign preauthorization for disclosure and certify they don't have outstanding tax liabilities to the IRS as a condition for opening an account.  US permanent residents may have to as well, I don't know and I don't know if they are asked about their US status since they are also subject to U.S. tax.     
By the way, much as I dislike some of what US government does, it is ultimately and eventually answerable to the citizens.  Sometimes that just takes awhile.
		     
A)  Nobody here is aiding anybody to hide anything 
B)  The banks in Switzerland were founded long before 1990 
C) ever heard about the UK Channel Islands or the State of Delaware  
C-2)  ever heard about the Isle of Man or about the dependencies of the UK 
C-3)  ever heard about Monaco 
D)  do you want to tell me that the UK government does NOT know about this  
E) the Swiss Federal Government is NOT in the position to act against free enterprise
		     
And why ?  Because the US government blackmailed CH accordingly
		    I think there is a discussion about some corruption here that hardly ANY banks any where can claim innocence and certainly not HERE !
		     
Few Bankers violated against Swiss Federal laws, and you might clarify who got bribed. Yes, CH Bankers should forget about the Niagara Falls and Miami Beach as US laws are weird indeed and be content with the RHEINFALL, Lugano, Tenero and the Toscana, plus Mallorca. Also Morocco and Tunisia and Egypt and Lebanon and the UAE are no problem

			Animal lovers have expressed outrage after an official at the Swiss environment ministry said all stray cats should be killed.             
			
			This is the end of Switzerland global good reputation (if still any)!     
			
			Where is the groan button for that idiot?
		 
			
			That has always happened in rural areas when there are too many around I'm afraid. And when I was a kid many people ate them- especially the groups of Italian season workers. Around farms there are always plenty- and tolerated so they kill mice, etc- but when too numerous, they get culled. 
Mind you, it was the same in rural UK too.   
Cats sadly are responsible for a huge proportion of bird deaths every year. 
I do dot condone, but it's always been the way in rural areas.
		 
			
			I'm not sure that it was the same in rural England Odile - when are you thinking about?  And they were certainly never eaten    
			
			I love cats, not eat them. though. If you kill a wild one for its meat because this is the only thing you can eat, ok. But to kill it for sport??? No way!
		    Where I lived they were fed to the hounds of the local Hunt (quite recently - we lived in an area with many famous Hunts).   
Totally agree Nil - I am a cat lover and I find it disgusting too. I don't know anybody who would eat cat by choice now, but it was very different in the 50s. However, I do wonder if it is not 'preferable' to having 10000s of  stray cats in terrible condition, skinny ans starving, diseased and maimed, as in many Med countries (sorry, but like Spain Nil).
		    Problem is, most stray cats are too skinny to eat, very little meat on them.
		    What?  I have never heard of that happening and I lived in hunting areas too.
		     
			
			What's the difference between a cat and a rabbit?    
In Australia feral cat's are decimating the small indigenous creatures. The problem is made by humans and the problem must be solved by humans. There is a difference between someones pet and over population by one creature.
		 
			
			There's a Korean man who lives above me. One day I was in the hallway, looking for my cat, and I saw my neighbor walking down the stairs. So I said to him: ""If you see my cat, will you please let me know? She may have sneaked out.""   
His reply:   
""I eat it!""    
(and then laughed)   
I was giggling over that one for days. I had no idea this guy had such a great sense of humor.   
Anyways... he told me that eating cat was not uncommon once here in CH. But maybe that shouldn't surprise me, since they also eat horse.    
Hopefully they won't someday start rounding up the foreigners and donating us to the Metzger.       So what is the solution?    
A rabbit is in a cage or in the wild while a cat can be n a home of free to go around. So how do you know if the cat is wild or domestic?   
If one accept this, where to draw the line? What are the protection for abuse?
		      She's speaking of Switzerland, where they were/are eaten!    
Tom
		    Collar = domestic, no collar = wild, as was explained to me when I moved to Ticino 22 years ago. Not that the locals who eat them care that it a pet, but rather pets are presumed to eat industrial food, which ruins the taste!    
Tom
		    At 200 meters, I don't think one will look for a collar.
		 
			
			Is Kilchberg rural?          Why stop at just stray ones?   
As for eating cats ...... what a load of pussies you are.   
Outside of any city, it was common practice, only a generation ago here.   
My wife's maiden aunt, who still lives in the 250yr. old family farm house has a couple of cat pelts on her hard wooden dining chairs to keep bums warm in winter, can even remember ""their"" names ...... and as for what was inside the skins, she just smiles and rubs her belly.
		 
			
			If stray cats are such a problem, why not introduce mandatory microchipping, database registration, and tax as has been done with dogs?   
Especially since it is the norm for cats to roam free. If all pet cats were chipped, there would at least be a way to distinguish between strays and ferals.    
When mandatory microchipping was first introduced there was much moaning and groaning and predictions of 'it will never work, people will just ignore the law..."" but 6 years on, it is estimated that there is a 95% complicance rate. Mandatory chipping has all but solved the stray dog problem. (Note I said stray, not homeless.)   
The scheme is self-financed via the dog tax and registration fees.   
So cat owners - what do you think about - would mandatory microchipping of cats help in a similar way?
		 
			
			I blame Coop and Migros. We are just too soft, emotional and well fed these days.
		    It was mandatory to microchip Toutoune when we moved to CH.
		    I don't know how the financial part would be dealt with - who is responsible for the existence of the stray cats? The farmer? The random person who leaves a bowl of cat food on his back porch? The regular cat owners who let their cats roam the neighborhood before they're spayed?   
With dogs, it seems that there are less wild ones so that most dogs who live here have a specific owner who can be made responsible to pay for the chip...
		 
			
			Around here everybody knows the cats and who they 'belong to' or which are strays. Their behaviour will normally be quickly indicative- stray cats being totally unapproachable and will shun any human contact.   
Again, I am not saying that what is proposed is right- but that it has always been the case. We certainly always kept our cats indoors before Christmas- because they were the favourite fare of the Italian working 'gangs' working in the area- as they were poorly paid and exploited, and it was the norm for them coming from poor regions of Italy. (in 50s). Our local hockey team still has a black cat on it's sweatshirts- as they always celebrated the beginning of the season by catching and cooking a few local fat cats   
			
			""Please don't kill us - we might be getting old, but they liked us in the 80's.""       
			
			Sorry, but domestic cats don't belong in nature. In addition to being an ecological nightmare, they also harbor and spread toxoplasmosis. Switzerland has a dwindling, tiny population of true wild cats (not feral or stray) that aren't going to last much longer thanks in part to competition from strays and roaming domestics, not to mention the devastating effects on birds and other small wildlife. Cats are already microchipped, it doesn't help with the stray problem when people don't neuter and spay outdoor cats, and you can't exactly check for a microchip through a scope.    
If cat owners were required to be responsible pet owners like dog owners are legally required to be we wouldn't have this problem.    
			
			And in the '60s:       
Tom
		 
			
			I would say that any stray cat caught doing anything illegal should be kicked out the country.   
Black cats should also be kicked out.   
Oh, and cats shouldn't be allowed to build miaowrettes.   
Sounds purrfectly logical to me.   
Just saying.    
Christoff the Blo-cat
		 
			
			So Swiss men   eat p***y after all?
		    Apparently, Swiss women too! But don't say it to the freak homophobe on the other thread.
		       
			
			And all this because somebody who works for the government gave his personal opinion (in the context of protecting rare birds).      Maybe again you should care more for looking for another ambiente.    
But seriously, in defense of the ""locals"", not everybody in the countryside is and was poor (it is simply not true that all Ticino used to be a poor canton or baliaggio for centuries - a glimpse on some nice rural mansion could suffice) and/or in a need to eat cats and dogs.        It was the human to introduce them to Australia, and humanity did much more damage to the countryside than anything else.   
And - last but not least - for nature and its protection it's not important if a species is rare, but if it's "" system relevant"".        ... where it has never been common sense, however. Sometimes tolerated, but always with disgust towards the ""cafoni"".        Thank God that guy is stupid enough.   
The problem is that others might be not. So more difficult to get rid of them.
		    It's not a question of need, by choice!    
After all, no one needs to eat snails, frogs, molluscs, etc.   
Tom
		 
			
			Hey you guys ever heard of ""Dachhase""? (Roof rabbit) I grew up in a part of Bavaria so rural that we used to get the catholic priest roaring drunk and dance around the Thingstone naked when he passed out. 
Cat's found further away than 200 meters from the village were regarded as pests and got blown away by the village hunter. period!
		    sounds typical alter-boy games actually
		 
			
			Either don't eat any animals and become vegetarian or stop the hypocrisy while tucking into other animals. One man's pet is another man's tasty dinner.
		    The line is drawn at 200 meters... really simple.   
I do not get this discussion, this is nothing new at all but has been the same in most European countries for decades. I grew up at the edge of a forest and everyone knew that if their cats would roam too far into it during hunting season would there be a chance for it to get shot. Legally so.   
I love cats and really don't want to see this happening, but it looks like some city kids here have no idea how a forest functions: European forests are not really natural anymore, they are no rainforests. Most big predators like bears and wolves are gone and it takes foresters and hunters to make sure the forest stays healthy - our impact is so large that nature alone could not react quick enough. 
Cats are pretty high up in the food chain. Naturally would each get a pretty large territory to hunt and kill and they would only reproduce if there is sufficient food. We decide to breed them instead and keep them in far too small areas. In short: If you have too many stray cats will you have a devastating impact on birds and rodents. On top of that will the cats themselves suffer from a short supply of food and intensive fights for territory. This is exactly the type of thing forresters have to prevent. That's why they shoot boars if there are too many or try to nurture species that need support. Thinking that cats deserve some special status is just wrong.
		 
			
			Disclaimer: this is not directed at cat ownership, but at the outtrade between the law and the needs of society.          
This is the crux of the problem - the law places very little responsibility on cat owners. The law views cats as 'semi domesticated', and therefore gives them the right to roam. In itself this is not the problem, but unfortunately some owners take this view of the nature of a cat to mean they have no responsibility for their pet's actions.   
Yet we do not afford the same to owners of other pets . Dogs are not allowed to act 'according their nature', as the law says that once we bring a dog into human society the dog must abide by human rules.   we are saying that cats too cause problems, then it would seem that the solution is to place an equal level of responsibility on cat owners. (Note I said 'if'.)   
While many cat owners do chip, it is not mandatory as it is for dogs. Look at the number of strays on the Tierschutz database. (And yes, to import a cat into CH it needs to be chipped, but there is no such requirement for any cat born here.)   
Chipping and registration itself does not solve the problem, but as we have seen with dogs it goes a long way toward changing a pet owner's behavior, as it makes the owner identifiable - and therefore more easily held liable for problems caused. It changes the pet owner's mindset.   
I'd also like to see a licensing fee for pet cats, as there is for dogs. The money raised would go a long way towards funding solutions to 'cat related' problems, for instance for a catch, castrate, and release scheme for feral cats.   
(CCR schemes are practiced in many countries, with good results.)   
Bottom line - all pet owners, of any species, need to understand the impact the decision to take on a pet might have on society and the environment, and take responsibility for the welfare   of the animal.
		 
			
			this has already been discussed many times on this forum... if cat is x metres away (300 i think)  from a dwelling it can be shot.    
use a big bright collar and pray
		 
			
			Well, at least something is being proposed, to protect the natural wildlife (that is part of the eco-system) from being predated upon.   
In the Emirates, cats are completely feral.  They also breed incredibly, as no-one seems the least concerned.  They roam freely, eat out of dustbins, and at outdoor restaurants if you take eyes off your plate for a few seconds your food gets snatched by these cats.   
It is disgusting to witness, how these cats are completely out of control!    
Shame, sitting outside one night I watched a mother cat moving her kittens, one by one, running across the garden, scaling a wall with her baby, running back for another one.   Poor skinny mother.   
The ""best"" the government could come up with was to propose building under-ground garbage bins that open electronically - to prevent the cats scavenging.   
Sooooo ..... is it better to ""control"" the situation somewhat? Or to ignore the problem?  And which is the best method?  A quick bullet?  Or slow starvation?  To chip.  To sterilize?  But, control is important.
		     
people mentality is also different and that would explain a lot
		    Key difference: Dogs according to their nature would hunt in packs and kill humans. Cats that are big enough to pose a threat for our lives are of course regulated, no?
		    What? Where I grew up in rural Connecticut, pretty much every dog roamed free, and they didn't form packs and hunt humans.    
The requirement to keep my dog leashed or under my direct control in the woods has nothing to do with protecting humans, it has everything to do with protecting wildlife from being harassed and killed by my dog, something which cats do with impunity. I'm not allowed to let my dog shit and piss wherever it pleases, but in appropriate areas where I then (gladly) have to pick up and dispose of the shit. It's my duty, and rightfully so, to keep my dog away from people who don't like dogs, or just don't want to be around a dog for whatever reason, and I take that very seriously. I can't even imagine turning a blind eye while my dog kills things indiscriminately, shits in someone's vegetable garden, pisses on peoples' belongings, and then gets killed by car or wild animal because I chose to abdicate my responsibility to care for and protect said animal.
		    There was probably plenty of space per dog in Conneticut and the dogs had all owners who feed them well.   
There are places in this world which have unfortunately plenty of hungry stray dogs and I for one do not want to face a pack of them alone.   
I do not want to drag this into a catlover vs. doglover discussion, but it is pretty obvious that there are reasons why dogs are legally treated differently from cats, especially when it comes to liability questions - because dogs are on average much bigger and have caused much more severe accidents than cats. These laws were not made for the pet mop-on-legs that some ladies carry around in the cities, but the more traditional and sizeable Swiss variants. I know somebody who had to put their beloved Bernese dog to sleep as it repeatedly would break free and attack sheep. Sure do cats technically the same, but the chance that somebody sues you for your cat killing a mouse is a magnitude smaller...   
When it comes to the forest - sure, cats will hunt rodents and birds, that's why they will get shot if they roam free deep in a forest. But the number of dog walkers on a weekend a pure stress for any game. You don't need to leash your dog to make sure it does not kill a boar - that's not going to happen unless you have a seriously scary dog... it is to keep the too large number of dogs limited to the hiking routes and make sure that the game has enough space to retreat. I enjoyed watching deer in the Altstetter Wald. Regularly seen them when walking or jogging in the early evenings on weekdays - never seen a sign of them on a weekend.
		    Only it's not in the nature of a cat to allow it's life to be micromanaged the way we do with dogs. saying the problem would be solved if people treated cats like dogs is sort of missing the fundamentals of cat nature.   
Quite besides which, I walk in the forests quite a lot. And I've hardly ever seen a cat there, feral or domesticated. I see cats in suburban back streets. In the forest I see foxes, hedgehogs, deer, boars and such animals but hardly ever cats. People who say cats are decimating wild bids in the forerst obviously don't go the forest very often.   
And yes, cats kill mice in suburban gardens. But those are not natural habitats. They are controlled habitats. Those mice are they because they are eating stuff humans put there (like food or rubbish or things that humans plant in their gardens). So cats (fed and bred by humans) are going into an a garden (artificial habitat controlled by humans) and killing mice (that are only there because of stuff humans do). I really don't see where damage to nature comes into this. It's one man-made thing against another.
		    Cats are perfectly capable of living indoors and being happy, and if you feel that your cat must go outside, then provide your cat with a safe outdoor space where they don't intrude on anyone else and are kept out of harm's way. If you can't provide your cat with such a space or don't want to keep your cat indoors, then maybe you shouldn't own a cat.   
That's why I pick up my dog's shit and train him not to bark and jump, after all, it isn't a safety issue, it ensures that as a respectful pet owner, my choice to own a pet doesn't negatively affect anyone else.   
I see cats in the forest all the time, I run through the woods 3 or 4 times a week, and I live in one of the less densely populated regions of Kt. Zürich. Also, you know full well it isn't an issue of just mice, it's also an issue of lizards, birds, squirrels, and other ""non-pest"" animals that find their natural home in suburban areas. Considering the fast majority of cats roaming around rural areas are owned and well-fed, they take away food from wild animals that need it to survive, food that the cats don't need and food that, when eaten by cats, can spread harmful, sometimes even fatal parasites to humans.
		 
			
			I don't think anyone would advocate treating cats like dogs - but rather that there should be greater responsibility placed on the shoulders of pet cat owner to address the problem of straying and the resulting semi-feral overpopulation and environmental problems.   
Toward that end, I'd like to see a couple simple measures - as much for protection of pet cats as for any other reason:   
 - Chipping would indentify a pet cat - would you not rather require the forester/hunter/finder to have the cat scanned and returned to the owner than to give the finder license to shoot it?   
 - If one chooses to keep one's cat as an outdoor cat, the cat must then be neutered. If I understand the argument correctly, a large part of the problem is unchecked breeding - with the offspring often left to turn semi-feral. Requiring outdoor cats to be neutered is common sense, really.  Keep the pet population in check, and the other environmental issues will eventually resolve themselves.   
When an unchipped cat is found it would then be deemed feral - catch, castrate, release.
		    Ja, well, it seems people then should also respect the Swiss attitude to cats roaming freely?   
I sort-of believe, in my microscopic tunnel vision view of the world in general that Switzerland has been safe-guarding it`s natural wild-life in a pretty organised way, but now things are getting a little bit out of control.   
Eight years ago I never saw anything in the newspapers about pets being dumped at holiday times ....... now it`s in every daily/weekly paper - pleas to please not dump pets, in forests, in cardboard boxes, on high-ways, left in gardens without care.   
A big hoo-ha about cats.  What about other exotic type pets?  Domesticated rabbits dumped in forest?  Little exotic birds are also being found in forests and garden this time of the year - no way to trace if they were dumped or simply flew out the window.   
Someone I know had a ""pet"" Python - it got too large for their apartment, and it was ""given away"" (it had become vicious and was over 2 m long!).  I somehow have the feeling this was dumped in the forest - happy days to come, after it hibernates in winters, and continues to grow!!!!!  Watch ouot for a very big ""log"" that moves when out walking!   
I would say it`s time for EVERY pet to be registered and controlled.
		    Catching a cat is actually not that easy (you need to get quit close...) and require much more time than shooting them. Thus I do not think, that your solution is possible.      Why should straying cats be released again? There is intact a substantial difference between feral cats and house cats. Feral cats are indigenous species and are bigger than house cats.   
In my opinion all outdoor cats should be required to where collar with bells attached, such that they will kill less animals. Pet cats kill animals out of fun, even if they are fed. Thus such a collar could really reduce the impact of the cats on the environment.
		 
			
			There is a significant difference between the words: equally, it does not surprise me that ""The Local"" doesn't know the difference.   
This is intentional inflamatory p1ss poor journalism as usual.   
When a population of anything gets out of control it will eventually do harm to itself and to others.   
Bringing these numbers back under control (selectively) ensures the survival of the species and benefits the surounding environment.     
This is not a news article to say that the Swiss are going to shoot your cat. As others have said, put a collar on your cat.   
Oldhand mentioned earlier that Cats are killed in regional Australia as they threaten the indigineous species. This is true. 
Cats are natural born predators and can wipe out hundreds of species if left uncontrolled.   
The object of ""culling"" a population is not to 'wipe them out'.... that's impossible. 
But to bring the population back under control.   
When 'culling' a population of kangaroo's, you have to decide if they are a threat to themselves and the surrounding animal population. 
To bring the numbers under control it is best to target the weaker smaller bucks and does to preserve the genetic strength of the kangaroo population. 
When the average count is back in line with the remaining vegetation and the numbers have been ""thinned from the bottom"", then the cull stops, and the population is left to recover as climatic conditions improve.     
I don't see 'culling' a stray cat population to preserve the biodiversity of a native forest as being a bad thing.
		    No, this is just Germany. Switzerland is different, thank God.
		 
			
			No, Switzerland isn't different. It is legal for hunters to shoot cats without collars that are a certain number of yards (I think 200) away from buildings, just as they can shoot dogs running through the woods. Just because they can do it, doesn't mean they do, obviously.
		    No, those are wild cats. Feral cats are the descendants of house cats that have returned to a wild lifefstyle.           A bit like the British aristocracy then?
		    There's also very few true wild cats left in Switzerland, around 500, mostly in Jura. You can see some at the wildpark in the Sihlwald, pretty cool animals.    
			
			In today's news:        
			
			... as from today's SPON         
The cause for a 50% death rate in local bird population is due to monoculture and the cultivation of corn.   
No cats mentioned.
		 
			
			The poor man was misquoted, by the newspaper ""Le Matin""                   Are you saying that cats don't have a devastating impact on wildlife? They're by far Europe's most widespread predator. This is an article about the impact of certain farming techniques on wild bird populations, if you'd like to read studies about the impact cats have on wild birds and other small wildlife, I (or google, for that matter) can provide you with hours and hours of fascinating reading material.   
Here's a sample of some cat-related facts:   
A recent study in the UK, for example, showed an estimated 9 million cats, 38 times more than the fox population. Those 9 million cats kill an estimated 92 million small animals, including 29 million birds and 5 million reptiles and amphibians. Cats are responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds. There's absolutely nothing natural about this many predators roaming around, killing things needlessly and spreading disease unchecked.
		    Just to gain some perspectrive on this. Do you have any idea how many farmers there are and how many species they have wiped out in the last 100 years? And they actually get subsidies for doing it.
		    In Italy only a very small part of its population eat them, and they are around a very specific region (Veneto) and the rest of the population is not very happy about it. Have also to say that is mainly the old generation that does it, the new ones are not following through.   
As for the killing, there are other methods to contain a cat population all effective but more time and money consuming. Killing is just the easy way for them but not the best one .
		    Why bother? Take it easy.       All your arguments also apply to humans, anybody up for a good culling? 
I find it strange that we see ourselves as stewards of the planet and at the same time our best effort is to destroy our own environment. 
Just short of 7 billion of us monkeys compared to ca. 200 000 000 housecoats I wonder who damages the environment more?
		 
			
			Step-by-step video!       
Another recipe:     Gato ala Visentina    Se hai deciso di farlo in pentola, occorre prima di tutto che cercate di vedere quello che é più in carne, sperando di trovare uno che non abbia superato i due anni d'eà, e che la sua padrona ti abbia fatto un dispetto qualche tempo fa. 
Un buon mattino prendete il fucile e andate fuori presto, dicendo a casa che andate a prendere un poco d'aria. Meglio sarebbe che il giorno prima ci avesse fatto una bella nevicata, di quelle che rimangono per terra per quindici giorni. 
Appena vedete il gatto in questione, fatte finta di non vederlo; nascondetevi dietro a un angolo, caricate il fucile, e fatte quel che dovete fare. Portatevelo a casa dentro la borsa della spesa; per strada salutate tutti, e a chi vi domanda cosa fatte col fucile, ditegli che andate a tirare a un topo. 
Una volta arrivato a casa, chiudete bene il cancello, andate nell'orto e appendete il gatto su di un palo. Apritegli la pancia come si fa a un coniglio, e tirategli fuori tutte le budella, tenendo da parte il fegato. Tagliategli via la testa e datela al cane. 
Scavate adesso una buca nella neve, mettetevi dentro il gatto e poi copritela di nuovo. Andate in casa, mettete nell frigo il fegato del gatto in una scodella, e andate in gabinetto a lavarvi le mani come Ponzio Pilato; e poi in osteria a bevervi un bicchiere. Nel sabato andate a confessarvi, e domenica andate a prendere la Comunione! 
Lasciate il gatto sotto la neve per otto giorni, stando sempre attento che sia ben coperto e che il cane resti legato alla catena. Dodici ore prima di metterlo in padella, tiratrlo fuori dalla buca; e, quando sará tenero, pelatelo e lavatelo bene, lasciandolo un poco appeso a sgocciolare. 
Fatelo in pezzetti e metteteli in una padella con una cipolla, una carota, un gambo di sedano, uno spicchio o due di aglio, tutto tritato. Tirategli dentro anche due foglie di alloro, qualche grano di pepe e quattro-cinque di ginepro, un pizzico di spezie e quanto sale che basta. Annegatelo nel vino bianco piuttosto secco, e poi mettetelo in una moscarola in cantina a marinarsi per tutta la notte. 
Nel mattino scolate i pezzi di carne dal vino, asciugateli bene, e fateli rosolare in un tegame con un poco d'olio. Quando avranno preso colore, tirateli fuori dall' unto e vuotate fuori quel che resta. Pestate finamente una cipolla, un pugnetto di prezzemolo e un spigolo d'aglio, poi mettete tutto nel tegame con un poco di burro e olio, aggiungendovi delle foglioline di salvia e un rametto di rosmarino. Lasciate sofriggere e poi mettetevi dentro i pezzi del gatto. 
Dopo dieci minuti buttategli sopra anche quattro-cinque pomodori pelati appena aperti, oppure un poco di conserva. Mescolate con il cucciaio di legno, e aggiungetevi un bicchiere di vino bianco e uno di rosso. Metteteci sopra il coperchio e fate cucinare per un ora e mezza o due, bagnando con del brodo se si asciuga troppo. 
Alla fine, uniteci il fegato tritato. Mettete i pezzi di gatto nel piatto, con il suo sugo, e pertateli a tavola accompagnadoli com polenta calda. Ditegli che é coniglio nostrano, allevato a erba e farinaccio, e vedrai che razza di figura che ci farai. Quando avranno ben mangiato e bevuto, servitegli, assieme col grappino, la novità..... 
And another:   · Kg 1,200 di gatto nostrano 
· 2 carote 
· 1 gambo di sedano 
· 2 pomodori maturi 
· 1 ciuffo di prezzemolo 
· farina bianca 
· 1 bicchierino di grappa 
· 1/2 dado per il brodo 
· della cannella in polvere 
· olio 
· 1 foglia di alloro 
· 1 rametto di rosmarino 
· sale e pepe   
Inizia: 
riducendo il gatto a pezzetti, poi lavalo per bene e asciugalo. 
Un suggerimento: 
prima  di cucinare il gatto è consigliabile marinarlo, in un misto di acqua,  erbe aromatiche e ... importante: aceto, vino o limone, che serviranno a  togliere al gatto quel gusto leggermente selvatico che ha e soprattutto  ad ammorbidirne le fibre e le sue parti più stoppacciose. 
Poi passalo nella farina e fallo dorare in una casseruola con qualche cucchiaio di olio. 
Nel frattempo: 
prepara un trito grossolano degli aromi 
- le carote, il sedano, i pomodori, il prezzemolo 
- aggiungi una piccola presa di cannella, l'alloro e il rosmarino tutto.        Tom
		    I was responding to Bucentaure, who seemed to assert that because cats weren't mentioned in this article, they somehow aren't a threat to wild birds.   
I won't even go into comparing the difference in benefit farming brings to the world in comparison to cats, what a ludicrous statement.       Another ludicrous comparison. Cats aren't humans. The logical extension to your argument is that all pet owners are slavers, that butchering and eating a cow is no different than butchering and eating a human, and that we should be able to forcibly sterilize humans just as we do with pets.   
What you also don't understand is that house cats aren't a part of the environment humans are destroying, they are a tool used by (irresponsible) humans to further damage the environment. They're the only animal outside of humans that kill for the heck of it, they deprive wild animals of food and life, and spread disease to humans and other animals, all because people erroneously see cats as an ""easy"" pet, one where they don't have to pay much attention to where it shits, what it kills, where it goes, until one day it gets run over by a car and they wail and cry and blame the driver and the police at the scene instead of blaming themselves for putting the poor animal in that situation in the first place.
		    Soon after this person was not working anymore in the program. Not sure if he is back on any other but it made a lot of people upset.      This sound like you have a personal grudge with cats.  Where I come from there are many cats and they are taken care of in the right way (we also did some work on our own) and they ARE NOT at all such an environmental hazard as you describe them here, actually they are pretty welcome by the farmers around the area, being clean of mice and rats. When you get a pet, any pet, you also must be also a mindful owner. The real problem come when they are abandoned and form uncontrolled colonies. This can be a real hazard, in all regards.
		    Haha, getting rid of mice and rats and birds might be great for the farmer, for but for the environment not so much... That's the very reason why cats have to be either controlled in their population, larger predators reintroduced or stop being fed which all results in a normal, sustainable population.
		    As I said I talked about   and being a  . And mice and rats can be a much higher hazard than cats. Birds can carry disease too. And what about us? We are the biggest ecological and health hazard that ever existed. So what we should do then?  
I think that we should listen a little bit more to good old Paracelsus:  Here he was talking about drugs but it's true for almost everything, nature and people too.   cat population can become hazard,   populations has a great potential to be beneficial.
		    I don't have a personal grudge against cats, I have a personal grudge against irresponsible cat owners, of which there are far too many. If dogs ran amok, killing things and pissing and shitting everywhere I'd be even more annoyed. The problem is, when it comes to dogs, ""the right way"", as you put it, is strictly regulated, whereas ""the right way"" when it comes to cats is entirely subjective. As far as I'm concerned, if any non-cat owner is negatively affected by your decision to own a cat, you're doing it the wrong way. That is to say, if your animal is defecating in someone else's garden, scratching or spraying on someone else's belongings, killing domestic as well as wild animals on other people's property, running across the street (not only putting the cat's life in danger, but also the driver and any passengers), then you're an irresponsible pet owner. I, as a dog owner, afford non-dog owners all of these courtesies and more, I don't understand why expecting the same of cat owners always results in such drama.
		    There wouldn't be so many rats and mice if the farmers didn't feed them by planting crops. There is nothing natural about the large numbers of mice that our farmers are involuntairly breeding in the countryside.
		    I know this is a serious discussion and personally I am against killing stray cats, however did anyone else spot the typo? 
It seems there are not enough dressing gowns to go round  . 
Sorry.          
			
			When I was a kid, we had barn cats that would keep the mice population at bay in the hay barns.  In addition to being family pets, they performed a vital function.   
There were also Feral cats (wild stray domestic felines) that would show up every once in a while.  The strays (especially the Tom cats).  would kill and literally tear apart the domestic animals.  One of my jobs around the farm was to shoot dead any stray cats that came around.     
Anybody who thinks this was wrong has never had to clean up what's left of the family pet (or kittens) after a stray Tom cat has been in the hay loft...   
I don't like the idea of killing anything ""just for sport""  but there are valid reasons for trying to curtail the stray or feral animal population.  Strays carry diseases, kill pets and wreck the food chain for other species.
		    Jeez, are you a Vulcan? Of course my post was ludicrous, it was meant to be, just don't take things too seriously, it just puts things in perspective, that's all. 
On the other hand, by your argument, answer this question. 
Who has more the right to live, one of the last Java rhino's, the hungry villagers that want to eat it or the Chinese horn collector wanting a rhino horn boner? 
As to your argument: ""They're the only animal outside of humans that kill for the heck of it"" Chimps do it, Bonobo's do it, dolphins do it, so do some birds, foxes Orca's, Hyena's there is quite a long list, seems that you get a free ""kill for fun"" app when you have enough synapses to rub together.
		 
			
			I dont have a problem with Cats as pets other than the fact that they kill birds for fun. 
We live in rural location with about 6 miles of parkland roundabout. Two years ago a cat killed a Sparrow Hawk in our garden just for the hell of it. 
If I had a gun I would have shot the cat. 
If the cat needed to eat then fair enough but not to just kill it and leave me to clean up afterwards.
		 
			
			Since I started castrating the ferrel cats population in our neck of the woods along with occasionally feeding those who are still brave enough to come back around - there are far less flying feathers being left on our door step.    
No new kittens born this year in the cat colonies around us either, so on the whole everyone neighborhood seems much happier all in all.
		    How the heck do you catch a ferrel cat and get it to hold still for castration?    
It seems more likely that it would be trying to rip your face off.
		    Live trap it and administer a tranquilizer through the cage bars, wait a bit & proceed from there.  Basically the same procedure as vets use for pets--no maudi is going to just sit there and let them get sliced off without objecting.        What would happen to rodent populations? I am sure there are some government bods working on this.
		 
			
			Google search lead me to this article           It's called loads and loads and loads of patience. I used the typical bate and trap method. My husband refers to it as the ""balls for food program"" not so funny if you are on the receiving end but what else can be done?  The population was getting out of control. Once they are in the trap it's easy to cover them with a blanket to try and help keep them calm for the transport. The vets then use a special technique using a bar to push them up into the corner to help subdue them but I never watched that part. They do it while the cat is still in the cage. My job  was simply to trap them and pick them up after it was all over. The cats are all better off for it and the males stopped fighting.
		    People would quickly get rid of their cats. The other idea at the moment is to neuter them. Farm cats breed like the proverbial rats they are supposed to kill and many of them are rather sickly as a result of overpopulation. There is a valid argument for eliminating stray cats, just as there are good arguments for eliminating unleashed dogs in wooded areas. Both kill wildlife and neither should be allowed to run wild.    
Far too many people buy a cat to keep the neighbor's cats from crapping in their gardens but that does not help the problem, but compound it. I see nothing wrong with eliminating wild cats.
		     
I certainly agree that any outdoor pet cat should be neutered. There is no excuse for allowing uncontrolled breeding. Or any other form of animal owner irresponsibility, for all species.    
--- 
One of the concerns with the killing of stray cats is that it is difficult to identify which cats are ferals and which are pets - meaning that pets are killed along with ferals. Chipping would at least address that.    
---   
But I am curious as to why you think people would rather get rid of   cats than chip them.   
I heard the same comments prior to the introduction of mandatory chipping of dogs - yet the compliance rate is very high, and I don't think I've heard any stories of dogs being dumped because of the chipping requirement.* For the most part, people grumbled but paid the relatively inexpensive cost of chipping and registration and got on with it. And soon came to see the value in chipping, as lost dogs are usually reunited with their owners.   
I would think owners of pet cats, especially those who go outdoors, would see chipping as an additional measure of safety for their pet.   
But maybe I'm looking at this too much from my perspective as a dog owner. Is there resistence to chipping perhaps because cat owners don't bear the same legal responsibility for the actions of the animal?    
Any other cat owners care to comment? What do you see as stopping owners from chipping pet cats?   
---     
* Dogs are still abandoned - that is, handed into shelters - for many other reasons though. There are still lots of homeless dogs, but a stray dog is a rare thing in Switzerland these days. Chipping has done much to lower the incidence of  dumping, as the owner will be found, and fined.
		    I'm not sure, it's just a gut feeling. From my experience with cat owners, they are either very dedeicated and never let their cat out (chipping would be largely unnecessary) or basically hardly ever let the cat in. I think the latter category can't really be considered a pet owner and most likely would not go to the bother of chipping the cat. Dog owners can't and wouldn't do that.   
Dog owners are very different: Their dog is their best friend.
		 
			
			Your gut feeling isn't correct, as far as I am concerned. When we had cats, they could come and go as they pleased through their cat flap (except at night when we kept them inside), but they chose to be inside more than outside. 
If we had a cat now and microchipping was compulsory, there would be no question that we would get it done, actually we would get the cat chipped even if it wasn't compulsory. 
As to cats being a best friend, that is just what my cats were, as well as being my babies.    
			
			chipping semi-feral farm cats would not be easy I think, so I'm not sure there would be much compliance.    
Killing cats is the typical idea of bird-crazed biologists. There was a guy here who shot every cat that entered his garden because they disturbed the biotope.    
Spaying is better imho, this way if it's a genuine mistake and the cat was just a domestic cat, no harm is done.  
Sounds pricey though.
		    Some of the rescues I liase with in other countries who practice CCR (catch, castrate, release) to reduce the feral cat and dog population will chip the animal while castrating. Then if the animal is caught a second time the chip data includes that the animal is castrated/spayed. (With females it is not always obvious.) The cost of a chip is pennies, the animal has already been sedated, and it saves the expense of a second op.   
In countries where resources to chip/read chips are not available, tattooing or ear notching the animal is often done in lieu of chipping - again, a visible sign that the animal has already been castrated.   
But I'm mostly thinking of mandatory chipping of outdoor   cats, for their own protection as a way to distinguish them from ferals. (And I agree - all cats who go outdoors should be castrated/spayed.)     
The issue of ferals is complicated as there is no owner to take responsibility or pay the costs.
		 
			
			This discussion brings a favourite book about a stray feline to mind, Jenny, by Paul Gallico. Anyone who appreciates cats for the intriguing critters they are should read it.
		 
			
			I'm sure thge Swiss will do the right thing and just eat them:       
			
			Having cats chipped and requiring a cat tax, particularly as they run around outside and presumably also relieve themselves outside, seems reasonable. It seems a little strange that dog owners have to pay a tax and cat owners do not. A chip would also be advantageous for cat owners as when their cat is found, they can be more easily traced back ""home"".
		 
			
			There's an old, sickly stray that hangs around my complex and has a tendency to attack people who walk past. Unfortunately, a lot of the residents like this cat but not enough to actually adopt it, so it just menaces pedestrians. If I called animal services, the neighbours would probably hate me, but it's drawn blood before with its attacks. While I don't think killing all strays is a solution, this particular stray and others like it should probably be put down due to its condition.
		       
Please call the Tierrettungsdienst:       
If the cat is ill it needs veterinary attention. The rescue folks and the vet will assess the situation and do the best for the cat. These are   good people.
		    Thanks for the link, Meloncollie, I will see what they tell me!
		 
			
			I can't believe that the Swiss would make such a law. I've seen their progression the past 7 years, and this doesn't seem like a direction that the Swiss would take. It just looks too bad.

			Two council workers in Switzerland could be in for an unexpected windfall after finding gold ingots worth 124,000 francs ($126,000) behind a bush, it was reported on Thursday.             
			
			Wow, that could buy them a decent bicycle. Maybe not a top end Swiss quality one, but a decent one all the same.
		 
			
			oh, is that where I left them    
			
			the bar in the photo is at least 5kg, , biggest bar found was 100g.   
another fail!
		 
			
			""number of gold bars weighing 50-100 grams each, some 2.5 kilograms in total""   
""But with no markings on the ingots""   
 yes clearly no markings  and nothing larger than 100grams.           
			
			I though that it was the streets of London that were supposed to be paved with gold?   
Maybe its time to go crawling through the bushes of Zurich.
		 
			
			would UBS know where their bars were first sold to?  the Poliz must be watching the site for drug bust - surely someone would come looking for it? it's not something you drop out of you backpack without noticing while you eat an apple   
			
			I found a golden bush in a Swiss bar once ......                                 
....... she was a natural blond.
		    London streets used to be paved with Val-de-Travers asphalt, not gold   
			
			What is it in the last couple years people finding bars of gold under bushes?
		              It's the same old story being resurrected from the archives...
		 
			
			So my perception of Switzerland wasn't far from truth. The streets paved in gold with some ingots to be found in the bushes        
*Phones local council...*
		 
			
			I was given 25 gold bars recently for my daughter..   
I'm well pissed off about it.     
Turns out I could have sold her for at least 50.     
Actually, I'm really pleased for them.     
Now all they have to do is go to   and post 'em to me for a jolly good price.
		 
			
			I heard a story of a golden calf  and a burning bush ,some nut was taking to the bush .Strange things happening       No, confidentially is no one priority in CH, gold usually paid for as a cash transaction so there is no record, even when the gold is held for a client.
		 
			
			...why,ooh why couldn't it be poor poor me finding just one?!! I've been a good human being;and always good to others like my long gone parents taught me...
		    Seek employment in local council... Everything possible    
			
			How would you prove it's your gold?
		 
			
			Maybe we should all go look in the bushes around Mendrisio:          Please tell me at least one of those council workers thought to carve their initials in the ingots before they turned them over to authorities.        This made me chuckle... the price of bikes in this country boggles the mind sometimes!   "	21	Workers find gold bars in Swiss bushes	10861

			Prosecutors on Thursday said they arrested the owner of Swiss football club Neuchatel Xamax, Chechen businessman Bulat Chagaev, after the team filed for bankruptcy.         
			
			Can anyone update me on the status of Neuchatel Xamax? I've not been able to find any info (via a Google search) more recent than 2012.   
Merci!
		 
			
			They play and do well  in the Promotion League.                        I used to be a season ticket holder there until they went bankrupt.    
They went under in the middle of the 2011-12 season - played the last game before the Christmas break (a home draw against Basel) but didn't come back for the second part of the season.    
They re-formed in the local amateur leagues, merged with one of the bigger local amateur clubs and seem to be doing well, although I have lost track somewhat. The combination of only being a recent supporter (so not really having it in my blood) and moving away from the area was a bit too much to keep me hooked.
		 
			
			This Sunday at the       home stadium.       
			
			Many thanks for all those links! One more question: how many levels is the Promotion League below the top division?
		 
			
			Next is   First and Second place of Super League can  .             
			
			Swiss football has quite a sophisticated youth development system coordinated by the national association. Xamax was at the time of their downfall responsible for one of the 13 top-level youth organisations in the country supported by the national association and covering the area of the cantons Neuchâtel and Fribourg.    
When Xamax inc. went bankrupt, the bankruptcy judge agreed to keep the youth organisation out of the bankruptcy estate, so this part continued existing with the support of local Xamax-afficionados and the national association. The Under-21 team was at that time playing in 2.Liga Interregional becoming in the same year the 5th level with the introduction of the new national 3rd tier, the Promotion League.    
So, this Under-21 team is the basis of the new Xamax. The majority of the team are still today young players from their own youth organisation. But already from the beginning of the new Xamax some really good and experienced Challenge League (2nd tier)-players from the region (mostly Biel) could be added to the team.    
So, Xamax moved up to the 1.Liga (4th level) in the first season and at the same time merged with the local FC Serrières already active in the 1.Liga (and rather a good team there). From a purely sport point of view the merger was not really necessary, but they think it's better for sponsoring purposes to reduce local competition. So Xamax became again the nr.1 football club in the city after only one year.   
They managed also the promotion from 1.Liga the following year, and currently, Neuchâtel Xamax FCS is even in Promotion League on the first place after 17 out of 30 games with 4 points ahead of Rapperswil-Jona (the other team that moved up with them from 1.Liga this summer). Only the Promotion League champion is promoted at the end of the season to Challenge League.     
So, they have good chances to move up to Challenge League. Afterwards, it will be vital to not repeat the mistakes of the past. They had allowed for Chagaev to take over their club because their ambitions were too high-flying and not realistic in the first place.    
The situation has changed since their haydays in the 80-ies. Nowadays, the place of a club like Xamax is between the lower half of Super League and the upper half of Challenge League. They have the potential to return to Super League, but need to be aware that every now and then, they can drop down to Challenge League and they need to refrain from unrealistic adventures trying to fool reality. FC Aarau is a good example for Xamax, a club with very similar possibilites, but more realistic expectations during the recent decade.

			An infant girl was placed in a 'baby hatch' at a hospital in Einsiedeln in canton Schwyz at about 5pm on Monday evening.            ( UN CROC ) wants them banned, at least in Europe.   
Bern opened one recently and  .                           
			
			It's a tough way to start life. I feel very sorry for the baby and also the mother.   
But I think that it is a good idea to have these 'baby hatches'.   
I just hope that they are not used too much.     ,           I agree.  This is a fine line to walk.  It is good that society has a mechanism to help ensure that our most helpless members don't fall through the cracks.  On the other hand, I hope this does not become an enabler for people having children for whom they are not prepared.
		    As we all know, shit happens...  We can understand the emotional hurricane that someone must go through when in that someone's shoes.  If in that position, it would be an escape route for many young parents to live a half-normal life. Knowing that the child you carried for nine months has a chance... could be the assurance that makes or breaks someone.   
It would be good to see these escape routes left open, without prosecution.  Without them, it could mean two lives are lost. 
JC
		 
			
			It is sad but I guess these baby hatches are a necessary evil. On the other hand, Swiss authorities should focus on getting these children a good home instead of making adoption so ridiculously difficult that it discourages people       I doubt it would. I cannot imagine anyone using babyboxes as as form of uhm, afterpill. It's way too hard for the mom to dispose her own child after you give birth, to just do it so lightly. It might prevent her from killing the child or herself.     
So good this option is here, we have had it back home for a couple of years, all kids got adopted within a few months.
		 
			
			Given that only 7 mothers have felt the need to use the Babyfenster in 11 years, I certainly wouldn't call the Babyfenster an enabler.    
Last February a (healthy) baby was placed in the window in Einsiedlen; that same week another baby was found dead, abandoned in a dump, in the Bern area. That the mother of the second baby felt she had no other choice is reason enough for me to support the Babyfenster concept.   
Yes, I would hope society could better support women and children so that a woman would not feel the need to give up a baby. But we have to be prepared for reality; the Babyfenster offers a safe anonymous alternative for extreme cases.   
Btw:         Strange me, I always thought that it's difficult to adopt children because government feels the obligation on getting a good home for them.
		 
			
			One ( Babyklappe ) in Valais is being mulled as well          They just want to make sure they are not liable for placing children under risk, which is understandable. Not placing children because said parents speak too many languages is plain idiotic. What am I talking about? My own experience    
			
			bless those little angels..   
There are many adults who long for babies but can not have them, I hope those adults can be matched up with these babies.   
the gift of a child is the greatest gift in the world.
		    Really? I was quite happy with an Xbox and Ski's for Christmas, have no idea what I would of done with a kid, wouldnt of been a great gift for me.    
			
			It is definitely a tough topic to judge if you are not in that situation.   
I agree that Switzerland should be more flexible on adoption possibilities. There are children who need a proper/stable home but the regulations here are too strict and many don't even start the process.   
Abandoning on the street is worse than anything else....   
I do not believe it is means of ""morning after"" translated into ""9mo after"" but if it is possible to save a life and not ruin 2 or more, why not?
		    There are still more than enough proper/stable homes to adopt these children. Look at the numbers of people willing to adopt and children available for adoption. Absolutely no problem here.    
There is no sense in having hundreds of future parents and only a few dozend of kids to adopt.
		     
Not if you didnt order one.
		 
			
			I read in 20 minutes this morning that a 9th baby has been found in the 'baby hatch' in Einsiedeln.    
I really feel for the baby and its mother, and in fact this issue has been so much in my mind that I'm writing a novel at the moment exploring the consequences of this action (mainly from the mother's point of view).
		 
			
			FYI, the hospital in Zollikerberg ZH has just announced a Babyfenster:       
			
			What's the point in offering a babyfenster if everytime somebody actually uses it there is this immense uproar in the media and people trying to locate the parent. 
That way I'd rather use the order window at McDonalds.
		 
			
			Just in case the parent is in a vulnerable situation I suppose.          I have never heard of attempts to locate the parent.
		    I would hardly describe a short paragraph in the free paper as an 'immense uproar'. Nor is there any suggestion they are trying to locate the parent. AFAIK there is a letter in the hatch informing mothers / fathers of possible options and that's it.
		 
			
			From the babyfenster.ch website, the legal situation:       
Placing a baby in the baby window has no consequences under criminal law:   
A mother who lays her baby in a baby window is not guilty of abandonment within the meaning of Art. 127 of the Swiss Penal Code (StGB) or of violating the parental duty of care and upbringing within the meaning of Art. 219 StGB.   
No search for the mother is conducted:   
The approval of a parent according to Art. 265c of the Swiss Civil Code (ZGB) can be waived if their whereabouts are unknown. This is deemed to be the case if the whereabouts are not known to the guardianship authority or the foster parents and cannot be determined after possible inquiries appropriate to the situation have been made. If the parents have not made a suitable arrangement for the care of the child and knew or had to have known that the child left behind would be considered for later adoption, then the whereabouts of the parents do not need to be found, especially if the parents express through their behaviour that they waive such investigations about their whereabouts and do not want to be consulted regarding decisions about the fate of their child (Hegnauer in Berne Comments, N. 15 on Art. 265c ZGB).   
The obligation to provide support is waived:   
The obligation of the biological parents to provide support lasts until the adoption of the child. As a rule, support contributions are waived for foster parents who later wish to adopt the child. If the parents remain anonymous, then they cannot be held accountable for providing support during the short period of time before the child is given into the care of the foster parents.   
The guardianship authorities organise the adoption:   
The arrival of a child in a baby window is immediately reported to the local guardianship authority. Children of anonymous parents are considered foundlings. They are placed under guardianship and initially supported by the municipality in which they were found. A foster home must be found and the adoption process can be initiated. If the parents are known, their approval must be obtained.     
The parents can reclaim up to at least one year after:   
 The parents are entitled to claim back the child at least until an adoption order is enforced. Adoption can be made after one year at the earliest. Swiss Aid for Mother and Child provides the required financial and social assistance so that life with the child can be successful.

			I hope they don't succeed in banning these baby hatches. All life is precious and is to be protected. I recently saw a video of a baby that was thrown into the river inside a bag and the men who saved it could here it's fading whimpers. These baby hatches avoid cases like that and give children a chance in life. Beyond that they are a solution that does not add strain to the social system since the babies are then adopted by parents who desperately need children. May there be more solutions like this for the world's problems
		 
			
			Does Switzerland have a decent foster care system?
		     
Doesn't seem so:    
			
			I just noticed there is a babyfenster in Bern, in the hochhaus building at the Lindenhofspital. I don't know if I've missed it before or if it's relatively new.

			All Swiss households bar the very poorest must soon pay for a TV and radio license even if they claim not to own a television or radio, the country's parliament decided on Tuesday.                the forum for Billag and you will find many useful threads.
		    Damn.    
Ever since Lufthansa took over, Swiss has been doing the most stupid things.
		    Great, then they can shut down the whole Billag administration...it's obsolent... ...and hopefully the fee's will be decreased!    
			
			According to this article in the Tagi, the reduction might not be much at all. And, at the moment the Bundesrat is recommending keeping Billag:           
I for one cannot understand the rational of keeping Billag and it's ensuing administrative costs if we all have to pay. I can (almost) live with the annoyance of paying for something I do not use - afterall, I already pay for many things from which I'll never benefit  - but it's paying the salaries of a   to collect a public tax irks me no end.    
I'd really like to see Billag done away with and replaced with a simple per-household tax.
		 
			
			wait...each person will have to pay circa 400 chf for Billag? Now its 462 per HOUSEHOLD. They would have to reduce it to about 200 per household otherwise we have a tax increase
		 
			
			Hi.. I know this is a late response, but please can someone tell me how a person gets billed for a TV licence?? And what happens if you do not own a TV or subscribe to cable ? 
Thanks in advance..
		       
The search bar is top-right - you aren't the first foreigner in Switzerland    
			
			This is interesting news. I am sorry, this new tax is additional to the Billag's one?
		    The details are still being worked out, but no, it should replace Billag (although it may be collected in a similar manner through an independent authority).
		    So they are replacing Billag with something else that is essentially identical to Billag, except it is now mandatory?  Billag by another name is still Billag...     
...and the jokes will continue.
		 
			
			It should be removed and required to be included in all internet plans and collected by the ISPs.
		 
			
			Billag just issued me a betreibung, despite me telling them twice we have already paid under a different name than mine. Feckers!
		    Free toilet paper?  Might be a little coarse...
		    Can't ignore it, it's now payable to Basel Stadt. I'll be able to challenge it, but it's a pain in the arse and I have to traipse into town before work.
		    Send them an invoice for wasting your time. And when they don't pay, send them one back.
		 
			
			Welcome to the Forum, good first post!
		 
			
			Not good.... other countries doent have this tax... to much of taxation .. Not good..

			I just wonder what he's selling.   
Profile says ""I am working for long term in Zurich"", yet here   says ""I am looking for a job in IT in Zurich, What would be an average package in zurich in IT industry , is 80,000 a good package as i have heard that zurich is a costly city.""
		    Some people happen to find television to be the lowest form of entertainment and a brain suck.   
I don't like TV, and I have never paid for cable TV services or had a tv because of it.   
There are things like television news, infotainment, which I find ethically corrupt. A program used to instill emotional reaction in people with very little selective information. I mean it's the same with news sources, but really, you can't get the story from one source. You have to read 3 or 4 sources before you lose the slant the authors are giving. When watching the teli though, the questioning part of the brain seems to shut down, and suddenly it's all gospel (which explains the sunday morning church shows).   
Anyhow, I wish there was a way to fund radio content and not TV content because I don't support television as a medium. I know that makes me seem like I'm from the 1930s, but there it is.
		    To borrow Sean Connery's unique numbering system:   
a) What makes you think radio news is any less biased? 
2) There is a way. They call it Billag.
		    169.15 per annum.   
but   
If you have a computer or smart phone or tablet with Internet access you pay everything.....          People people don't listen to Radio as passively as they watch tv. I've read enough about marketing to people via tv to know that watching tv makes us less active in questioning what we're told. If they can do this in ads, of course they can push any story in the news or on a sitcom.   
example:    
""The snack advertising had powerful effects on men and restrained eaters; with both groups consuming approximately 1 SD more after exposure to snack ads versus nutrition ads or no food ads. Female unrestrained eaters, however, ate similar amounts across all conditions.""   
They wouldn't let us only pay only the radio fee because we had high-speed internet and computers. At least that was their rational. We have no cable tv or any membership-based streaming tv channels. Though, it's not like we don't use youtube.
		    Yeah, Billag would say that, wouldn't they? From that link you provided to the Billag website: ""Every household in Switzerland is legally obliged to pay the radio and television fee"". Now that's a straight-out lie. Presumably they can get away with it because that statement is not written in one of the official languages of Switzerland (but in one that many immigrants to Switzerland speak). In the German, French and Italian versions there's no claim that ""every household"" is legally obliged to pay anything, let alone both fees.   
We're going 'round in circles again. The TV licence fee is payable only if you have the means to receive TV and a subscription to watch it! Source: buried deep in the Billag website (links from umpteen posts in  , mostly from adrianlondon).      Nonsense. Passive listening to the radio is commonplace. Normal, even. And advertising on the radio works just as effectively (and subliminally) as on TV.      They're lying again.
		 
			
			Preface: I listen to the radio a lot, and I've been always been paying for that service. But I don't watch TV, and never paid, and won't unless it becomes compulsory.   
Billag just sent me the 3rd (or 4th?) reminder to fill out their online form. On the front page they say that (bold is theirs)   Households capable of receiving tv programs are liable to pay. That's an outright lie (see part b) below).   
By filling out their online form I'd basically tell them I have ADSL connection (they get my IP and thus are told my ISP, which in turn tells them where to request further info). I would indeed be obliged to inform them if I received/consumed tv, but there's no obligation to tell them that I don't and thus there's no need for me to even react to their letter.    
Those who do decide to fill out the form should only do so from their office, or absent that possibility should have a friend fill it out for them.   
Conditions under which you're obliged to pay for your TV (translated from the german letters' backside): 
a) Have a working tv set that is connected or could be connected (in reasonably short time), plus a tv signal being provided to you. It doesn't matter if you actually watch tv or not, or by which means you receive the signal, the ability of doing so is what counts 
b) tv capable device (PC, Mac, smartphone, etc) AND broadband connection (cable, xDSL or similar) AND tv-capable software AND either for-pay subscription or free subscription to receive TV programs.   
Notice that b) doesn't apply if you don't have any subscription. Thus if you don't watch tv at all, or watch tv on your PC (e.g  ) but without subscription, you're not liable to pay tv. Youtube doesn't count either - in fact, nothing freely avaibly over the net (absent some kind of subscription) has any bearing.      Simply pay for radio only, not for tv. I've been doing exactly that for close to 30 years, and counting.
		 
			
			Billag has always been merely a tax but not perceived like that. As soon as you have a tv or radio or any device that can reproduce audio or video you have to pay. I don't know anyone that doesn't have such a device but I know some that avoid paying the fee. 
I don't agree with the idea of Billag overall, but given the low taxation of this country if you pay an additional 400 per year per household that wouldn't make much of a difference neither increase the total tax burden a lot. We just need to put the topic into perspective...
		    No you don't.    
It's been written enough times on here so I'm not going to write it yet again.
		    Wrong.  Yawn.
		    Interesting that you say that. I haven't seen the letter of which you speak but they told me (several times) that if you own a TV or have one in your appartment you have to pay. I always wondered what the or bit meant, and seeing i do own a TV but it's in the UK in my Dad's house. They just repeated in a loader and slower voice, ""if you own it, you pay"". That's when I laughed and slammed the door on them. And now it turns out they were lying.
		 
			
			A question: Billag is paid by household, right?   
For example, I and my spouse we live together, we have two flats in two different cantons, but we only have to pay Billag once, right?
		 
			
			Interesting question- no idea about the answer but i would think you would have to pay for both addresses (your location says you have 3   )- we certainly have to pay our TV licence for our flat in the UK, even though we are rarely there      It's an interesting question and one that I can't give a definitive answer to but the Billag site indicates that you don't have to pay for a second 'holiday' home as long as you don't rent it out to third parties.       
Maybe this would apply in your situation? The only way to find out for sure us to ask them.   
It's different from the UK where you have to pay the licence fee for a second home if you have receiving equipment there. But as per normal it's useless to make comparisons with other countries as everywhere has different rules.
		    I'd say it depends.    
If you share one common household, and the 2nd apartment is used for sleepovers or similar, I think you need to pay only once. However, should you use the 2nd apartment for some kind of commercial use such as rent it out, I have no idea.   
If, on the other hand, you have different addresses you are considered to have different households and thus you have to pay twice.
		 
			
			What a relief! I leave from Switzerland soon.
		    Yes, it doesn't matter how many TVs or flats you have.

10	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/142704-mafia-members-moving-switzerland.html	" 
			
			At least four suspected members of Italy's major mafia organisations are thoughts to be resident in Switzerland.         
			
			I learned from ""20 Minuten"" that US Persons are prohibited from doing business with the Camorra mafia. Fortunately, US Persons may still do business with other Italian mafia groups such as Ndrangheta, Cosa Nostra, and Sacra Corona Unita.   
As all Italian mafia members seem to wear sunglasses and look alike, how can a US Person tell which are Camorra and which are members of other mafia groups? I searched the internet but couldn't find a Camorra membership list? I was thinking to write the Camorra but, heck, the US Treasury's ""List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons"" only lists the Camorra's address as Naples, Campagnia, Italy. Strike that idea.    
I was thinking to ask the guy who runs the local gelateria whether he is a member of the Camorra but somehow that might not be such a good idea. To be safe and not inadvertently do business with the Camorra, I suppose US Persons should just avoid all Italian-run gelaterias, trattorias, pizzerias and so on. No more pizzas for US Persons, best to switch to kebabs.          Shoot!   
They're on to me already!   
And I thought the anonymity of doing business through this forum was fool-proof.   
Oh well!   
Time to move my bank accounts to Glasgow.      Can't be cooincidence that your join date is March 2012, same as this thread.
		    In some Swiss newspapers there was also something about Mafia and its years long businesses in CH, quite recently. Same old, same old.  
This is old, but it sums up the Mafia in Switzerland thing pretty well.        
			
			It seems that the US Navy sometimes rents homes in Naples from the Camorra. Of course, that shouldn't make US Persons any less vigilant in determining who their gelato vendor really is:

NAPLES, Italy  Naples anti-mafia squad  backed by the finance  police  paid a surprise visit late last month to the U.S. Navys  housing office with a court order for the records for six off-base homes  leased to U.S. personnel. 
 For years, the anti-mafia squad and the Guardia di Finanza have been  investigating homes reportedly owned by Naples Camorra mafia crime  families, Italian officials said. 
 Then in September, Italian authorities sequestered 40 homes in the  Camorra strongholds of Casal di Principe and San Cipriano dAversa and  placed them on a three-year ""block"" for the collection of rent,  according to the Naples daily newspaper Il Mattino.  , and it was those six homes  that were listed in the court order, according to Navy spokesman Lt.  Paul Macapagal. 
 Jalynn Pontes and her husband, Petty Officer 2nd Class Rafael Flores,  live in another home that was raided, but not sequestered, that day. 
 Pontes said they returned from work that day to find a metal shutter  broken on the front door of their Casal di Principe home. The lights  were on, and their small dog, Valentino, was hiding.""          I thought as far as the Mafia was concerned, anybody's money was good. This has something to do with FATCA, right?
		 
			
			I don't know why this should be such big news. As I've experienced things here  the Swiss mafia seem to be the ones running Kanton Schwyz - the italian accent.
		    But join dates can be misleading.
		     
So can dodgy looks guys wearing black suits, no ties alighting from limousines and carrying violin cases.      Big news is not, but I am always surprised at how lightly this problem is taken by most people...wonder why. Is mass media good business for Mafia, also?
		 
			
			100000s of small businesses have been set up for at least half a century all over the world to facilitate money movement...
		    100'000s of Italians,. mainly from the South, in the 1950ies and 60ies immigrated into Switzerland, and many of them became CH citizens. Some of them of course may have been Mafia members and more have Mafiosi among their relatives     
I simply expect all the ex-Siciliani and ex-Calabresi to respect the law and to do their duties. Lots of their Secondos and Tricondos have done and do Military Service here     
******************************************      
Add to this that also FIAT FINANZA and other sections of the upper side of Italy have residence in Switzerland  ...  the linkage is centuries old.
		 
			
			The biggest Mafia in CH are multinationals and Commodity Traders like Nestle, Glencore, Novartis, mercuria, ameropa, roche...and Not to forget the US counterparts such as Coca Cola, JP Morgan, monsanto and others. Funny enough These Crooks are being protected by Police when Holding their annual get together in Davos. Instead the Media which is Part of this crooked System Makes us believe that some harmless chubby italians are the biggest Threat around...don't believe everything you read...   
By the Way what Happened to the Investigation of the murdered UK/iraqi Family im Annecy almost 2 years ago...Good Night and good luck      About ""their small dog, Valentino, was hiding."" Somehow reminds me of the joke about ""How do you know a Frenchman visited you?*.  Apologies to the French and any other distressed minorities.
		     
--  Annecy is NOT (yet) in Switzerland 
--  you can accuse big corporations of mafia-like methods, but this is not the topic here 
--  the organisations mentioned  are NOT harmless at all

12	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/130000-central-bank-posts-gains-high-gold-prices.html	" 
			
			The Swiss central bank said on Monday that high gold prices helped to lift  its nine-month profits to 5.8 billion francs ($6.7 billion) despite  massive losses on some of its foreign currency positions.             
			
			The situation is now reversed, losses on gold, gains on currency,       
			
			The beauty of a diversified portfolio       Soon we will see more losses on gold & huge losses on currency       All depends on whether there will be another wave of money quitting the Eurozone and moving over to Switzerland. The SNB may be forced to purchase either Euro or as in the past Eurobonds and company shares in the Eurozone-  Possibly even Yens and Dollars and whatever.  The job of the SNB basically is not to make profits but to keep the economy running.  They may well need the profits gained now for future operations.    
Why they sold gold and made losses is something I cannot tell you, but I am sure that those in charge know why. My guess is that there was simply too much gold in their cellars   
""More losses on gold"" ??   As above, the question is WHY they are selling gold at a time when the value of gold is down
		    Very simple, they realise it's way overpriced on historical terms and 500 or less is more than likely in the next 10 years, so you sell whilst there is still a greater fool!
		    In that case, it is rather a disastrous matter as the SNB has far too much gold. As they in this case have no alternative to selling fast, considerable losses  (at least ""book-losses"", as a lot of the stuff was bought decades ago) are unavoidable.    
I am wondering rather who the buyers are ?
		    'Little people' who missed the boat & think because it fell it's a great bargain. 
I suspect the SNB's average buy price is under $40, or 172 CHF . I am sure they held more gold in 1970 than today.
		    You of course are right.  The Gold Reserves of the SNB until a decade or two ago were still as in the times when the Gold Reserves were regarded as a requirement to maintain a currency. But the Gold held by the SNB is still very substantial. And the SNB as a result to an agreement with Saudi Arabia and the five exUSSR Central Asian Republics still is the SalesAgent for surplus gold from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
		    Paradoxically that would be nearly impossible since the CHF is now pegged to a maximum rate, so the SNB itself makes sure it can gain from its currencies portfolio but not lose (it loses when currencies converted to CHF decrease their value). Of course it's possible that the CHF appreciates against the USD, that would mean the EUR too appreciates against all the major world currencies in which the SNB has invested (mainly USD, GBP, JPY) but that's rather difficult and in any case it wouldn't lose a cent from its EUR portfolio, which is still the largest by far.      huh? these are unrealized gains/losses; they don't need to sell the gold to register a loss if the market price falls from one quarter to the other.
		 
			
			The peg is not guaranteed for ever, could end anytime , always when least expected.
		    The peg is guaranteed forever if the BNS wants to: Opposite to a more ""normal"" peg where a central bank tries to oppose a devaluation tendency of a currency, the BNS needs to oppose the appreciation of the CHF and therefore it has unlimited ammunition since all it needs to do is print as many francs as needed, which do not really impact the country's inflation since those go outside and it keeps the EUR and USD (see link for the actual distribution:  ) in its vaults.   
Therefore if a risk of appreciation of the franc against the EUR persists, it just needs to keep guaranteeing that ""peg"". Right now the EUR is appreciating so one day or another the BNS will drop that policy, but only if the risk of seeing the CHF getting under 1.20 is nil, since otherwise it would face gigantic losses; it's not yet clear what would happen in that case, but theoretically even a central bank can sustain a maximum of losses since it also has a capital base.
		    About "" 
Roughly 50% euro, 25% USD and then the rest
		    Never assume risk of nil...........
		    The only reason they would stop printing money is inflation going crazy (20-30% per annum). And so far, we are nowhere near that.
		    There is ALWAYS a risk of Nil.....   
Oh sorry, missed the point       Absolutely so. The PEG is maintained as long as the CHF threatens to get up too far. As soon as the Euro gets stronger again and up to realistic levels the PEG will become history
		    The peg will be maintained until somebody decides it's a bad idea or gets fired. 
Realistic levels are probably 0.75 euro..........
		    It is neither a bad nor a good idea. it is not an idea but the only way through
		     
I would say the risk of the Euro not even surviving ten more years or the US defaulting on it's debt/losing it's petrodollar reserve status between now and ten years is substantially higher than the risk of gold losing 2/3rds of it's value between now and 10 years...   
And even if you would still have a third of the value left... fiat currencies drop to absolute zero value after a while with a 100% 'succes' rate of this happening so far.
		    So once all the fiat currencies drop to 0, who will buy your gold & with what?
		     
Historically fiat currencies didn't all drop to zero at the same time. That being said it may be a different story now as we are living in the rather unique situation that   fiat currencies have no backing.    
(You could argue that the USD still has some sort of backing in the petrodollar I guess but it seems like a very insecure backing to me)   
I would imagine we will see a complete reset of the monetary system in our lifetime and hopefully we will move back to sound money principles where money is backed by a commodity rather than debt, because that is what our current currencies represent... debt. Without debt we have no currency.    
And to answer your initial question. I am rather confident that you will still be able to get resources & goods for your gold when fiat currencies die.    
Because that is what you actually want not? The fiat currencies are just an intermediate in the transaction.. As an example you could take a look at how Iran is exchanging oil for gold nowadays.
		 
			
			If Euro is going to be more affected by south europe, it is going to be a nightmare for the Swiss National bank to support the currency   
Let's hope Eurozone gets out of recession.
		    More important than the monetary side is the markets.  Much of the Swiss exports go to countries in Europe.    
THIS is the reason why the SNB over the past 10 years but ""corporate values"" all over Europe, in order to help those countries, of course to help them to remain useful markets.     
To turn it around, the German economy in the past 3 years has made a remarkable recovery, and Germany is as large as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece together. The economy in countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands is at least in an acceptable shape, and the French economy not as bad as some ""specialists"" had forecast.
		    For France, I can't say about the economy as the reports are contradicting, and french government and institutions lie A LOT! 
(just like when the government lied about Tchernobyl and they stated that the nuclear cloud did not cross the french borders)   
But I can say that the french people are feeling it very hard. So I do think the economy is not good especially when growth is estimated to less than 0.2%. 
France require a 2 to 3% growth if it wants to at least include the new people arriving on the market (not including unemployed)
		    That the growth-rate of the French economy is insufficient is as old as Methusalem     
Already Mr Napoleone Buonaparte complained about this    
And French people complained about feeling it very hard long before the French Revolution   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
and here the recipe to re-arrange Europe       
			
			SNB would likely make big gains on EURO peg, or go bankrupt.  
There seems no way out of it, at least at the moment. 
But, they helped to save the euro! Good guys.
		     
The SNB can print money so will never be bankrupt .
		    not strictly true. e.g. following scenario:   
they can have foreign denominated liabilities and if they print too much, CHF becomes worthless and they can print as much as they want of worthless currency and still not be able to settle their liabilities.   
also, even if you are unconstrained in law in the amount of money printing (i.e no debt ceiling, no constitutional limits etc.) you may be constrained by practical limits where printing more money actually degrades your financial standing by devaluing the value of your CHF holdings.
		 
			
			of course they could print (theoretically) in unlimited quantities! But CHF would be worth like a Zimbabwean dollar. Also inflation would likely go through the roof. So most likely they are better off to take it like a big kid, and admit the loss if such a scenario happens.   
Anyway, most countries are devaluating their currencies nowadays anyway.
		    So you think the Swiss who have been printing for some time have not damaged the value of the currency.....Zimbabwe all the way.
		    Not yet, but it could bite them back. There seems still higher demand for CHF from investors and savers who park their money in Swiss banks, because of higher uncertainly surrounding many European economies and QE3 in the US. So CHF is still a safe heaven, compared to Euro and CHF. Once that is gone and money starts flowing out, CHF will likely fall quiet heavily and inflation will rise.
		    I meant to say USD
		    The intent is to make the CHF less worthy (more worthless). The last time in such a situation, they DID print money (more than now) which resulted in inflation. This is why they this time invest, not only in other currencies and national bonds but even in private corporations.  I heard that Nokia becomes increasingly ""state owned""  by being owned in parts by Switzerland     .  The SNB is now shareholder in motorcar manufacturers, instruments producers, etc,  all over Europe.  Basically to stabilize the CHF (downwards) but also to make profits in the longer term.
		    But the falling exchange rate of the CHF would help the export industry and the inbound tourism, the two mainstays of the Swiss economy
		    Is there any hard evidence that exporters have been badly hit, or tourism is sharply down. Certainly not true in the watch industry or in Verbier.
		    I suspect it is just big business crying to the govt for support.
		    Exactly, nothing to worry about, the CHF has been strong before & it never caused an issue. As salaries & general overheads don't really increase each year here, it's easy to cost save by sacking a few employees, and giving them some work on zero hour contracts when necessary & let the RAV pick up the difference.
		    According to Nick Hayek and other industrialists there is more than sufficient proof. In fact, the PEG has solved the problem to some extent. Tourism and industry clearly were and to some extent are hit by the still fairly high exchange rate.  What is wanted is to have the EURO at CHF 1.40. The markets are very exchange-rate sensitive
		    Nobody asked the government for ""support"" but to take the steps necessary to defend the national economy.  The government which in the past intervened when a rather useless but big bank was on the way to become sold with billions, but forgot the real economy for some years. Until Nick Hayek used his clout sucessfully
		    Quite to the contrary, the too high exchange rate already in the past created huge problem. Last time, Fritz Leutwyler printed money which resulted in inflation. This time, the SNB diversified their methods, and this proved fairly successful.    
You remind me of a joke of Benyamin Netanyahu who complained repeatedly in the past that the historic memory of many people only goes back to the breakfast coffee        We have no idea if it will be successful , the SNB has printed a huge amount of money & bought euros at 1.20, when the could have paid 1.04       It has been clearly successful up to now. The SNB has no choice than  to be successful.  What I have no idea about however is how much additonal money was printed.  I suppose that your assumption that a lot of additional money was printed most likely is correct. To keep the exchange rate of a currency down, you HAVE TO increase the volume of money. As speculators did and do and will buy up CHF, the SNB has to print enough to stabilize things. This was refreshingly clearly explained by Nick Hayek when he started to put the necessary pressure onto the SNB   
And, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot fix the exchange-rate at 1.20 and do purchases at an exchange-rate you just killed off.
		 
			
			From today's FT   
The Swiss National Bank has confirmed that it racked up a SFr9.1bn loss in 2013, as the sliding gold price knocked more than SFr15bn off the valuation of its gold holdings. (All 1,040 tonnes).   
The bank had pre-released its results in January, so Friday's announcement comes as no surprise.   
The SNB said that the price of gold, at SFr34,195 per kilogram, was 30 per cent lower than the SFr48,815 seen at the end of 2012.   
It's a big swing from 2012's SFr6bn profit, with the gold price move wiping out a SFr3.4bn gain from the sale of its stake in the so-called stabilisation fund, or ""StabFund,"" set up during the financial crisis to help deal with domestic lender UBS's toxic assets, and a SFr3.1bn profit from its foreign exchange positions.

			The Christian Democratic Party has tabled a motion to introduce specially built villages for asylum-seekers.         
			
			I have the feeling some of my neighbours hold this view.   
In our vlllage we have a small house which is used to house asylum seekers. 
Last month the previous occupants were moved out and now there are some women with children living there. They are from Ethiopia and Eritrea.   
The women are very shy, they seem to understand more English than German.  
The oldest child is 5, a really friendly boy who loves our dogs. He showed his younger brother how to approach a dog. (the children are taught this in school).   
There are a ton of kids living on our street yet with the exception of one, no one plays with him. I saw a couple of kids teasing him a few weeks ago and I told them off. He has a scooter which has pink on it. He doesn't care. He is happy to have a scooter though he told me it would be cool to have a bicycle.    
Today I was outside gardening and this boy was happy to keep me company. He wanted to help. There was no school today and I think he was bored and lonely. I probably should have let him sweep and maybe bought him an ice cream or something. I am sure giving him money would be frowned upon.   
I have spoken to the social worker who helps them integrate. She is Swiss and she told me, it is very difficult for them because of local attitudes. She obviously didn't consider me to be a local.   
			
			This is not a new idea .There was a tibeten village ,many many moons back      The ""local attitudes"" ARE tiring. Most of my friends in schooltimes were of ""Mediterranean"" or ""Semi-Mediterranean"" origin.    
Back to the 5 year old boy.  When he comes around, arrange that somebody closeby gets some ice-creams and arrives ""by chance"", and THEN you can say  ""oh there are two left"" ......................
		 
			
			In most parts of the world, Asylum seeker villages would be called refugee camps, or worse...
		 
			
			your first attitude is good but the mother would see her child disturbing you, in my opinion meet the mother, tell her you want to teach him some German or french, and then you can give him an ice cream or what ever you want,
		    I nominate Geneva!
		 
			
			I think they should call it Ghettoikon.
		 
			
			Mrs Doolittle, im curious...were you born in Switzerland or Canada? I only ask as your profile says you have dual citizenship.    
In any case Switzerland needs more people like you.    
Hell, the whole damned world needs more people like you.
		    I second that. Talk to the mother, she will most likely be VERY grateful for an offer like that.
		 
			
			hey there Ms. Dolittle I wish you were my neighbor or my manager 
you have a lovely attitude
		    With authentic mud huts?  Idiots!  Needs integration not isolationism. CHRISTIAN?? Not in my definition?
		    They are asylum seekers, aren't they? This means their request can be rejected. According to you it would be christian to integrate people into a society just to chuck them out after months or years? Interesting definition you got there.

			Update,                I am NOT a doctor. I do NOT have inside knowledge. I do NOT like conspiracy theories.    
But I remember my Godfather whom I visited five months before his end. And then saw the same kind of body movements of Mr Abdel-Rauf el-Qudwa (nom-de-guerre Yassir Arafat) and it was the same.  To me simply  . That Israelis speak about AIDS and Palestinians about poisoning and that the ""official"" thing speaks about heart etc is not surprising
		 
			
			The Swiss found traces of Polonium on his clothes: this looks like a good reason to dig him up and test his body. Arafat was not liked by many people, including several Arab countries, so let's keep an open mind on this one.    
And on the previous assassination in London,           True. Among his adversaries were Israel most of all, but also Syria. And Syria was, via el-Saika, directly INSIDE the PLO. el-Saika, just like el-Fatah, the PFLP, the PDFLP and the PLA is one of the members of the PLO. But el-Saika is dominated by the Syrian Mukhaberat. The relations of Arafat with General Mubarak were always quite good and those with King Hussein bin Talal, once on below zero, over the years had gradually improved. So that to me, IF there was a poisoning action it was either Israel or Syria.
		 
			
			Could be the Palestinians as well, he stole huge amounts of money from the Palestinian Authority and there was/still is huge corruption within these organisations and it is rumoured he had made off with around $1.3 billion.
		   ???????       I really do need new glasses.      Yassir Arafat financed the el-Fatah out of his private family enterprise. The PLO is just the umbrella organisation of most Palestinian organisations with the exception of Hamas. But I do not believe that somebody inside elFatah or somebody of the rival organisations inside the PLO or Hamas did it. The sort of stuff hints to somebody out of the high-tech people
		 
			
			Thanks for sharing the info. Very Useful.
		       
Experts at the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne,  Switzerland, conducted tests on samples taken from Yasser Arafat's  exhumed body in November 2012.          
& for the conspiracy theorists, Syria is close to the Russians who are already suspected of using Polonium; it is not the sort of product you can buy in your corner shop.     
Nasty stuff Polonium & difficult to handle; investigators need to look at people who had contact with Arafat & themselves soon became very ill or died.  I doubt Arafat would have allowed contact with anyone who visited him wearing a lead suit     
			
			So, in other words, the Syrians may have offed him, Israel will get the blame as always.
		 
			
			It is a pity he died: in the old days everyone had a common enemy...
		    What do you mean? They sell it here. You can easily buy Polonium and chips and you're right, it's nasty stuff.
		    It also works the other way around       He was supposed to have died of a blood disorder.      Happened to watch this recently:    
Only one security service admitted to knocking people off in multifarious ways (37:29).
		    Israel may have offed him while Syria may get the blame.  The likelyhood however is on the Israelis anyway. While I stay with my impression, and that is that he died of Parkinson's. The time-frames, the body-language, everything fits exactly   
It however may be that the Israelis found Parkinson's to be too slow  .....  and the Israelis have the high-tech and the top medicine to do the job
		 
			
			Why don't we wait and see what the Palestinian, French and Russian teams have to say.  Providing the Palestinian Authority publish them of course.  Which is doubtful imho if they contradict the Swiss one which suggests he was poisoned.   
The man was 75 and much more likely to die of disease or age related problems than that someone would decide to poison him after he'd been in power for +30 years.       It was the P.A. which right from the start hinted towards poisoning, so that the new findings may confirm their notions   
I nevertheless agree with you, that age related problems had their role.  Parkinson's usuallly IS an illness coming up at high age.
		    Why would the Israelis want to off him anyway? 
He had been relatively quiet for a long time plus after he was offed they would simply just bring another ""leader"" with similar ideas out of storage.     
It is not like there was some great peacemaker or a friend of the Israelis waiting in the wings to take over. Mahmoud Abbas is/was just another out of the same mould as Arafat - both rumoured to have embezzled billions.
		    The Israelis for decades primarily acted against moderates and people ""relatively quiet"" as those people were bad for the ""public relations"" of Israel   
Ahmed Abdel Rauf el-Qudwa (aka Yassir Arafat  =  Yassir being the name of his religion teacher in Alexandria and Arafat the mountain above Mekka) started el-Fatah in 1964 by investing some 30 millions of British Pounds. He kept the organisation alive by diverting elQudwa millions (Arab Bank in Jordan for example) into it.  No, the P.A./PLO did not have billions around anyway neither had el-Fatah.   
The rumours against Mahmoud Abbas, the man who, with approval of Arafat, started the Palestinian peace program seriously, were put up by some radicals like the Hamas and some western journalists   
Back to Arafat. His father was a billionaire and business tycoon and had only TWO sons. So you can figure.  HOWEVER, both Arafat and Abbas found it difficult to keep internal corruption at bay, particularily from members of the same clan. While it is clear that the el-Qudwa are part of the el-Hussein clan, I strongly suppose that the Abbas are ""remote"" members of the same clan, even if Mahmoud Abbas denies any such link   
Mahmoud Abbas btw. was the one who in the 80ies got a ""peace plan"" in Arabic, English and German from chaps in the environment of the Zürich University, and used the plan. Willy Brandt and Shimon Perez chose the English language version (Europe compatible language) to proceed. Realities in Israel-mainland, East Jerusalem and the two Palestines very much base on this plan
		 
			
			Surely he couldn't have been poisoned...when   got poloniumed all his hair fell out and he died a slow and painful death.   
Anyhow, it the comic books are to be believed, a dose of radiation that big should have given the dude some superpower or special ability.
		     
Ah the Byzantine processes of ME politics.            What if Arafat simply visited one of Irans nuclear facilities, or something similiar, and it wasnt properly shielded.
		     
Given his age (75) and his less than healthy look, you probably wouldn't need to give him a huge dose to finish him off. Just enough to ""help things along"". That way the problem would show up as some other issue and not be obvious. The only issue would be one of timing. You could not be in a hurry.
		    But Polonium 210 isn't that easy to come by. Surely if they were going to do something like this than Ricin or a similar poison would have done the trick? At lot less hassle and much easier to implement.
		    W.W. ftw.       ""Simply"" ???   The Iranians would not have allowed him to get closer than 30 kilometers to ANY of those facilities      ..... as the elQudwa /el-Husseini Clan was and is strictly SUNNI, and pan-Arab nationalist, and so strictly on ""the other side""
		    THIS exactly is why Israel is in the focus of considerations. As Israel is THE ""high-tech valley"" of the Middle East, with dozens of companies active in nuclear and military sciences. And all this on an admirably high standard. You may be aware of the point that Jewish scientists in the USA worked with Polonium 210 years before the rest of the world knew anything about that stuff. In short, to come by Polonium for the Israeli government would have been and of course still is very very easy
		 
			
			Only about 100 grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.
		    Excellent post, thanks

			Education officials in Zurich have issued a new directive restricting access to international schools, effectively removing the alternative for children who live in Switzerland on a permanent basis.             
			
			Just read the article; 
The Local - Zurich cuts access to international schools       Although I do not know the Education Counselor's motivation, I am personally glad to see it. The international schools hold too much power! They are amazing, if your child fits their desired profile for their registrants, but a nightmare, if not. As long as your child is young, and able, a switch to the local school in German, French or Italian, may be easy. But many teens find themselves expelled or denied entrance. Without the local language, or a diploma, these adolescents can fall into a catastrophic free-fall. They don't even have the requirements for the lowest level of job or apprenticeship.  In the end, the initial interest of parents  to ""give"" their children an advantage, becomes a HUGE disadvantage.  
Best to remember; the international schools are businesses for profit, will promise you the moon, when their enrollment is down and will not hesitate to put your child on the street, even if you have paid them a small fortune over the years. The public schools have an obligation to society and your children. This is important information to consider, before buying into their system.      I just wish they (the public schools) would actually fulfil their obligation and not base all their decisions, re-structuring, closing of schools, firing of teachers on numbers that seem to be reported in incorrect statistics.   
And that they would stick to a curriculum that has validity beyond one year.   
It's really no surprise to me that private schools are booming.
		    They are also booming for one thing, though, and that is an influx of expats who leave after some years.    
There is always enough arguments to criticize both public and international schools. Both systems, you accept some advantages and you have to let go of some dreams.    
I am a huge advocate of public schooling here, yet that article sounds fishy, too. If say 60-70% graduates move back to their home lands, plus some carry on abroad, that small percentage that is equipped with good level schooling, but incompatible with the local system, they have to go through the same process as all of us who move here and have to patch up in order to be compatible with the system. It would be interesting having the stats about local/international graduates, where they continue, what degree, if hey manage to find apprentisage, etc. Also, failure is a relative term. There are local kids after local schools that also have to change career completely, despite having finished some apprentisage and having the license, etc.
		 
			
			I'm not sure I understand why such a restriction is necessary. What about expats with much older children, e.g. mid-to-late teens, who may be on a long term contract but don't want to simply drop their kid into a local swiss school?    
And does this include bi-lingual schools? What about the schools who offer before and after school care, i.e. tageschule, which makes it much easier for parents to work without hiring a full-time nanny?    
One would think that expats paying local taxes for the school but sending their kid to a private school would be left harmless in the boon to the local school budget per child.
		    Actually the   schools have to respect the same curriculum.   schools are both private   follow another curriculum. (IB for example).
		 
			
			This is a tough one as I support international schools and believe all children should have access to a bilingual education - especially in our modern times when multilingualism is becoming the norm and necessary for future opportunities. And the earlier children are exposed to a foreign language, the easier.   
But I think there needs to be some regulation here, but that's difficult since these are private institutions. I can see the nightmare resulting from Swiss children spending their formative years at such a school and then transitioning to the public system later on without a good grasp of the language. There's no predicting the future of Swiss or expat families so perhaps the state can have a list of international schools that meet public school requirements and offer those instead of banning altogether.
		    As far as I understand from the much more informative article in the NZZ, those teens would not fall under the restriction.      No, only the four   schools.      As far as I can tell, this is   directed at expats. On the contrary, expats will probably find it easier to get a place for their kids wehn the arrive druing the school year.
		    The billingual schools are not touched.
		 
			
			100% true and they are so damn expensive
		 
			
			This was somewhat discussed on another tread - maybe the mods can merge.          Found the NZZ article!  Here it is if anyone else wants to have a look:     
According to them (I'll just hit the highlights) this is a return to something like the pre-1998 state of affairs, when the five non-German-speaking schools in the canton were only allowed to take children whose parents had worked abroad.   
The new rule is said to be that children resident in canton Zürich may attend international schools (= non-German-speaking AND not following the cantonal curriculum) only if one of the following applies: 
(1) parents live only temporarily in the canton, OR 
(2) parents live in the canton but can 'represent convincingly' that they intend to move to a non-German-speaking country 
(3) the children are completing a school track ( ) begun in a non-German-speaking canton or country.   
Bilingual schools, and private schools adhering to the cantonal curriculum, would not be affected. New expats arriving with already-school-age children would not be affected. Children already studying in international schools would not be affected.   
The target is local parents who are placing their kids in international schools for the language immersion, or the IB diploma, or the networking with expat kids, or whyever they do it (I'm not too sure.)  SIS Zürich and the International School of Winterthur were name-checked as having serious concentrations of these 'not internationally mobile' parents.
		    Exactly, and there are plenty of private schools out there, so portraying International Schools as the only alternative to the state system is being a bit over-simplistic.
		    Sometimes kids go to International Schools for all the wrong reasons.   
An ex boss of mine initially came to CH on a temporary placement, and the company picked up the bill for putting his three kids into Intenational School. That was of course a very comfortable situation for him financially. Gradually, it became clear that his placement was going to be permanent and that he wasn't going home at all. He managed to keep his children in that school though because he saw they were happy there and he didn't want to subject them to the shock of transferring them to a state school system. So basically despite having lived most of their lives in CH they couldn't manage more than very basic German which meant they couldn't really be independent but were always realiant on people doing stuff for them. HR threatened him several times and said they would stop the payments and advised him to transfer the kids but he refused and used his old-boy connections to make sure the money continued to flow. Finally, once out of school, they fell right through the system and have been unable to get an apprenticeship or university placement and have been living off Dad's charity since. Personally I blame the school for that because they could have seen it coming but obviouisly preferred to keep them as milk cows rather than to nudge them in a direction that would have benefitted them. All three kids were autistic unfortunately and should really have been in an environment specialised in that and able to make the most of their potential.
		 
			
			I don't get, I would have assumed the international schools teach in English but also teach the native language? I have friends who attended ISs in countries like Sweden, Denmark, and Germany and they're all perfectly fluent in their native languages, plus English, plus usually one or two other languages.
		    Teach it as a class, sure.  They don't teach other classes   the medium of the local language though, so kids miss out huge swathes of subject vocabulary.    
And while their Swiss German will be just fine (you're talking about native Swiss kids who go to IS, right?) they won't be very good at writing correctly in Standard German, since most of the German classes they take will be targeted to international kids, much too basic a level for native speakers.
		    I personally am not the biggest fan of the international schools probably because I can't afford them, but also, the kids friends are spread out all over the Canton rather than down the street, and this makes play dates, etc. more difficult.   
That being said, my German husband went to an international school growing up in Germany as of 1st grade and he has no problems with his native language, and is of course, like a native speaker in English as well.  He then studied in England because at that time he would have had to spend an extra year getting his Abitur in Germany before going to German universities.  He is a fan of the multicultural atmosphere of the international schools and the IB is a very high standard curriculum, I believe.  Just my 2 cents, or rather, rappen       They teach it, as in, it's on the curriculum. But with many of the pupils just being there for short stints of maybe two years or less, and there being a continuous intake of kids with no or only very basic language skills who will hold the class back, the language teaching is not going to be up to scratch. Also, Intenational Schools have a ""community"" philosphy, as in kids and their parents being encouraged to engage in community activities outside of tuition hours. Kids hang around with other kids from the same school and there is little exposure to local culture and language, which would be very beneficial to actually learn it.
		   I dont have children but I always heard that international schools usually offer a more flexible (and long) programmes at the school, than the 9-12AM Swiss schools   This could be a problem for both working parents, even if they want to educate their children in Swiss language       Native speakers are in a distinct class called language A. The fact that it is the only class taught as mother tongue does make a difference, though. There is nevertheless nothing in the way for succeeding well a bilingual diploma with two literature courses. Or students crash, that's also possible.       You contradict yourself - if the curriculum is so great, why did the universities not accept your husband without him retaking the abitur? The German Abitur and the Swiss Matura are easily accepted everywhere... but if you have some non-standard private school thing, the universities will check carefully if you fullfill the Abitur requirements. He probably didn't meet them. Nothing changed since then and it can still hit today some US kids if they decided to not have ""enough"" maths or languages or any other field in their courses at high school when they apply to a German university. Yes, I met some who had to do some ""preperatory year"" before they were allowed to study in Germany. In most cases was this indeed necessary.   
It took a week when I got into Oberstufe till my Gymnasium computed what courses they offered from year 11 to 13 to make sure everyone had a schedule that matched the requirements of the ""general"" Abitur. I'd want every kid to make international experiences, but for the money spend on those institutions I think I'd rather send my kids to a local school and spend the same money on some great language courses abroad during the summer vacation, student exchanges like a year in the US and from the prices I have heard you have still enough cash left to send them to Harvard after their Swiss Matura. It's accepted there.
		 
			
			First of all, the International system is academically way above the American one up to high school. So experiences with US high school students trying to get into German universities are just a different topic. Interesting and true what you say, but different.   
From what I remember, the problem with the match International-German system is that some subjects from the IB system do not correspond to the German ones. Fair enough from the Germans to cut the line there. Academic level is yet again independent of the actual problem, even if I am not sure the IB course Business is worth anything by any standards.    
Furthermore, one can not set aside the politics in the matter. There is no reason why a public system would not impose its standards to the private ones rather the other way around. It takes some time for IB to adapt to all kind of different public systems. Of course, they can't adapt perfectly to all public systems, so they set their priorities (UK and US) and do their best with the rest, even if it does not fit well.    
There are specific cultural assets that can't be cattered for internationally even by the best will. I remember only a couple of example I am sure about, but there are surely more: From a French perspective, everybody must have philosophy, the level of Maths in Russia and Corea is far above the rest of the world, Italians insist on latin etc.    
The recognition of European Matura/Abitur/Alevels is a political decision and nobody looked carefully into the details of each countrie's curriculum otherwise, nobody would have recognized anything. That counts for a huge part of the story. Now related to a private standard, you can imagine that the European countries don't treat IB as a country but just as the private organisation it is. Not the same treatment, politically.
		    Because that was the way it was in 1988 when my husband graduated...and  in 1989 when his brother did.  The older brother opted to stay in  Germany and do the abitur  route. When my husband  joined our research group as a postdoc, he was only 25 years old -  already completed his PhD.  Don't think that would have been possible in  the German system.  Not saying that is essential, but in the German  system, it wasn't uncommon for people to be in their mid-30s before  finishing their PhD.    
My husband certainly had enough math and science to meet the Abitur - I  don't know why they didn't accept it then, but they didn't.        since when?        Believe me, there are enough in the US who don't graduate with all the required math or science and have to take these once at college/university.           you might have enough cash left over, but will they get in    
			
			By the way, I checked for you: The IB is now recognized in Germany as equal to Abitur if certains subject combinations are respected. Even the French now accept it too with their own restrictions. A Student just have to be careful to put up the subjects together according to the future country of choice. But it's the same with entry requirements in UK universities, they have their own wish list too.  list becoming  list from what I've heard.
		    Erm... that was my point, wasn't it? An US high school diploma is also accepted if the subjects are the right ones and you didn't graduate based on sports and music.
		 
			
			It is official.   
Zürich bans local from International Schools             There was a time, the US high schoolers needed one year university before they were allowed entering a German university. At least when I was in Göttingen. Is this rule overruled by another rule? I have no info about this since mid-90ies, sorry. But my IB infos are from last week on the phone with a colleague.
		    In Germany are universities very free to make up their own rules. Back then as much as today. They have very few strict laws to follow - for example do they have to accept an Abitur, no matter from which part of Germany it is from (some claim that the education standards vary massively.) 
First of all is the education system widely a Bundesland - ""cantonal"" for the Swiss - matter, so there are huge differences between Hamburg an Munich and second do universities have far fetching rights to decide on science and education on their own.  
There is a federal services, the DAAD, that can ""translate"" a foreign education to the German system. If they say that your diploma is good I believe all universities will follow (same for your Bachelor if you want to make a masters). On the reverse does a rejection from them not necessarily mean that you cannot study in Germany. 
Rule of thumb:  
a) The Southern states are more strict than the North 
b) Research universities will be more picky than polytechnics/ applied universities (""Fachhochschulen"") 
c) Some schools and subjects are constantly ""overbooked"", others have a hard time to fill the classrooms. Guess who is more flexible to let you in...   
Especially Fachhochschulen are typically more flexible as you do not need an Abitur to study there - you can be allowed into a course based on 16 years of school and a matching apprenticeship or even if you did not finish Gymnasium (I am sure this has all changed since I was at school, but I went for 13 years till the Abitur - if I had dropped out after 12 with a record that would not have forced me to repeat a class, I could have applied for a FH)...   
So if you do have a foreign high school diploma and one school says that you do not have enough maths in it to consider it on the same level as an Abitur they are probably right - but you could still be accepted by some other school that thinks that maths is not that important for the course you chose (especially if the school is desperate for some more students to keep their funding up and running...).
		 
			
			OK, the DAAD website explains in German the conditions.    
For Zurich, I find it generally interesting to get behind the obvious debate about freedom of choice: What makes the International schools so attractive to local famillies and were there something they were fleeing from in cantonal school ?    
In Basel, I've seen famillies paying two or three years middle school just so that the children speak very good english and then come back to the cantonal system because they propably want a best fit to local university or have a set plan for professional education the Swiss way.  
But I have also seen something less of a good news: students not accepted in Gymnasium and failing the entry requirements go international when parents can aford it in order to follow a gymnasium path and force their way to university. I don´t know if it works well, and frankly I wish it does, but seen from a cantonal perspective, it is a way around the education system undermining the alternative to gymnasium. In other words, some local politicians see a threat : on one hand, the three paths system and on the other hand, the one size fits all approach of IB. Local parents apparently all wanting their kiddies in gymnasium, they don't accept the local system. Instead of reforming or informing or dealing with their own voters' idea about education, the cantonal authorities targuet the international system.    
It's like treating the symptom rather than the cause of an illness.
		 
			
			would be interesting if every ex-pat family in the canton stopped by to register their children for local Swiss schools.  just a thought.
		 
			
			Foreigners have more choices and rights compared to locals!
		 
			
			Black Sheep Rule!       
			
			The international schools are apparently putting their heads together to come up with a compromise that Zurich's education department will accept, so keep your eyes peeled for more news on that. They're having a meeting this week I believe.
		 
			
			So what is a kid who's been going to US schools all his life supposed to do if suddenly one of his parents gets a chance to work in Zurich, and he hasn't learned any German? Was he supposed to make it his life's ambition to learn German, just so he could attend Swiss school one day? What does he do now? Remain in his crappy US public school because the cantonal government has decided he doesn't ""deserve"" a good school like ZIS, let alone an IB or a European university education in which he may or may not be interested?   
Could we focus on someone besides the overachievers (talking about the parents) and stage moms and dads? Regular people like me who, if they are doing their duty as parents, ensure the kid gets a high-school diploma that actually means something? Who choose ZIS because of the kind of education it offers on its own, never mind the higher education to which it supposedly offers a fast track? Could it be that the school actually is aware of the value of the education it confers, rather than simply wanting to hold on to its paying customers?   
Not to mention the fact that instruction at the international schools is in my son's native tongue. His strength in English creative writing will surely thrive in a Swiss school, won't it? Even if instruction in another language had better currency, I would still choose native English instruction for him (just not in a US public school   ).   
There is an unspoken assumption in this thread that all you need to do is plug your child in to the right socket and he/she will emerge ready to tackle an English-language education anywhere in the world. Not so ... if the non-native English I've come across here in Switzerland is any indication, it will take a lot more than enrollment at an international high school to get a child an education at one of those prestigious universities. And note that I say ""education,"" not ""degree."" Come on. There's more involved here than a product with a higher price. Every parent needs to find the way that suits his or her child best - rather than throwing money at the child and hoping some of it sticks. And sometimes that way is an international school.
		     
Reading the whole thread might be a usefull starting point. The canton of Zürich does NOT restrict access to international schools in such cases, the title is somewhat misleading.
		 
			
			Hi All: 
Just my 2 cents: 
My two kids are going to public school, they speak german, swiss-german and the older one, english and french... We are VERY satisfied with the contents (my wife is Maths teacher)....and by the way we are saving a fortune by not sending them to private schools. 
Best regards,        Steady on!   The answer is that the new law wouldn't apply to this kid, as he is completing a   (school track/program/career) begun elsewhere.   
The only two groups affected by this will be   parents who want to send their kids to international schools, and expats moving here with younger (pre-school-age) children.  It's clearly targeted at the former and not the latter.  Nobody knows yet exactly what sort of documentation will be required to 'prove' that you aren't in Switzerland permanently, but the fact there   such an exemption at all shows that this is a measure aimed at Swiss parents, not expats.     
Again, under the new law as it now stands (as others have said, further compromises may be in the offing):     
			
			Apparently the reason that international schools are appealing to local Swiss families is not so much the quality of the education, but the extra hours of child care they offer.   
Children stay at school for lunch and can attend after school clubs.    
Much easier for working mothers to fit their careers around.       
Expatriate pupils, who could be banned from international schools by new canton Zurich rules, are being targeted by schools teaching both Swiss and foreign curricula. 
Such bilingual establishments could provide the answer for many foreign workers who will soon be forced to educate their children in the local school system in Zurich. Canton Zurich has insisted on the measure to force better integration of the foreign population.           
			
			To add to the comments about language, here's my observations from going to an IB school, for 13 years.   
1) The local language can easily be taken very unseriously. There were kids in my class who knew they'd never, ever, need to speak Danish again. I don't think I saw anyone who got to a conversational level. People who spoke the local language did so because they knew people who did or had an alternative environment. For instance I had local friends and hung around my parents' business, so I kept my skills up. The teachers were still competent and conscientious, though. You'd still learn what you needed to know, and questions were easily answered (grammar, history, etc).   
2) The IB has an A and a B language. The A language is a literature course. If you're not fluent, don't do it. The B language is a language course (grammar, reading). If you happen to speak two languages fluently, you can get a free 7 points by doing the B course. (Amazingly, some fluent speakers didn't! Don't ask me why.) But basically if you are fluent in two languages, that reduces your IB course to a 5 course diploma. Back in the day they even allowed people to take one of the B exams a year early.   
If you're wondering what those kids in Danish class would do for language B, they'd do a traditional third language, eg French or German. (Ie take the compulsory Danish course until you got to the IB years and then dump it for French/German.)
		    Bilinguals are not meant to be in the language B course but take two languages A and get the bilingual diploma. If the school does not take the recommendations of the organization they signed for, that's a different story. Maybe they didn't read the part about ethics.
		    I think it's a bit ridiculous to ask someone to do the same thing in two languages. If you're more focused on sciences for instance, you'd be burdened with reading quite a large pile of literature books. And why should they have to? Because they happen to be good at another language?   
At the end of the day, it's up to the students what they want to learn. You're saying it's unethical to not take the hardest possible course?
		    You don't do twice the same thing as it's not twice the same language. Nothing wrong with getting your both languages at an adult level. It's not about commenting texts, it's not about knowing specific phases of literary history. It's about getting your languages up to a good academic level. And you do that in a course in mother tongue, not in foreign language (transfer to A-language, B-language international school jargon).  
If you want to speak and write your second language like a teenager when you are 20, fine by me. But you won't be as bilingual as you think you are.    
And Danish is not that hard to learn in the first place.    
			
			I've taught many 'so-called' bilingual children in the UK - and most of them, although quite fluent orally, had very poor grammar and formal vocabulary, and couldn't cope at all with expressing themselves in debating issues and writing essays, as clearly required by the UK A'Level syllabus.    
Of course when I went to Uni as an adult in the UK, because I had a Swiss Baccalaureat, I had to have an intensive interview to demonstrate that my English was of an adequate standard to cope with the content of the course (not much chance of asking them to teach me in French I can assure you), both orally and in writing. And of course adequate for teaching later-on.
		    Yeah, it would be terrible to have the language level of a 19 year old when you're 20.    
But seriously, it's not hard to be bilingual even without doing a lit course. So you may not know what the relevance of Johannes V Jensen was. Or George Eliot. Big deal. If you can read books and write text that other people can understand (not to mention speak), that's knowing a language.
		    I am afraid that your word doesn't win against my teaching career experience. Sorry. But you don't have to believe me either.  
If you are happy with your level in your languages, fine by me. But let other people the judge of your actual level.        That's just funny. Thanks.
		    My teachers think I'm fluent (if you're in the IB system, you might have met them). Nobody has ever told me I wasn't fluent in those two languages. Ok, I'm not writing a novel any time soon, but we're talking fluency, not mastery.   
I'd have thought it somewhat obvious that taking a higher level is going to develop someone more, but you have to admit people can be fluent without doing so.      Well, here's your chance to teach then...
		    You're starting to get it. Good.
		    Didn't think you were up for it. Those who can...
		    Indeed, well pointed out, in my case due to my spoken French accent not being commensurate with my clear knowledge of the language (I can conjugate, and correctly use, pretty much any French verb and any tense).   
Actually, it was a toss up between those (especially from Paris or Geneva) who though that it was fake (NOT!), and those who liked it (other Swiss, Vaucluse), in fact a friend's daughter once told me (a French teacher from Vaucluse) that she could still hear in my voice that I had learned it there!    
But my accent still sucks!    
And I don't care!

			I will never understand why nearly every thread on the EF that deals with languages always ends up in the same place, or at least within the margin of error.       
as for the original issue, the international schools are in some cases used by extremely wealthy Swiss (and to a lesser extent German) parents as an alternative to gymnasium.  and, candidly, in many cases not having those kids in the international schools would be doing a favor to the rest of the student population at those schools.
		 
			
			I fully agree. No restriction should be necessary. Everybody should be free to decide. I do support the International schools and strongly believe that multilingual education is important especially for bilingual children.
		     
Janka, I haven't read all of this thread, but it seems to have deviated from the beginning. However, your ""support of international schools and bilingual education"" statement was, to me, amusing.    
When we arrived to CH, our neighbors sent their 3 children to public school, and we sent our 3 to Zurich International School. Today, their children speak, ,  perfect French, German,  and English. Our daughter managed to pick up the languages orally, though she cannot properly write them and  our sons are completely handicapped locallly, as their German is insufficient!    
The international schools need to improve their foreign language departments, or they can change their name to    
			
			Wow that surprised me.... hard to believe....I  worked many years as a teacher at International school and still am the ""part of the group"" in some way... )    
Many schools are different in the approach and also teachers are different. Did you try to change the teacher within the school?
		    I hear about 3 AND 3 = a total of 6 .  And so find it difficult to believe in the teachers being the reason. I believe however that the teachers in public school have to accept realities of life, while the ones in the ""international"" schools can celebrate ""English"".  What can be read above explains why German speaking Swiss abroad often prefer, if having the choice, the German schools over the ""international"" schools.
		    Perhaps those three children are exceptionally gifted or things are changing now. In my experience at the ETH, I have rarely worked with a Swiss student whose English proficiency was even close to fluent, especially in writing. I can't judge their French, but they generally switch to English when speaking with French colleagues, so I suspect they are more comfortable in English.
		    Susan -how many years were they in the schools in CH?  IIRC, you spent time in Portugal and South America as well?  I know my nieces and newphews go to one in Germany and 2 of them are in the bilingual path where some of the classes are in German and English.  But it was a concern of mine (apart from the fact that we didn't have that much disposable cash) that the kids wouldn't be as proficient in the local language if they went to an international school.     
I guess in general the purpose of the international school is to maintain English instruction for people who move around the world, and not to support locals going to school all throughout their career.  I know my BIL has said the school in Germany isn't that interested in having local kids... Anyways, it is an interesting debate...for me the costs just couldn't be justified
		    Let's apologize on behalf of Switzerland, but this nation apparently has a confusing effect on you     Because      defies common sense    ETH is a technical university filled with students who never had to use either French or English in practice. And whose stronger side most likely is the mathematical and technical side. I am sure that the matter looks differently already in case of the university. And people who are to conclude their apprenticeship at KV commercial school had to use both English and French, mostly in writing but also on the phone, during a good part of their apprenticeships
		    And what relatives did they have ?  And where did they spend their holidays ?   I some three years ago at a secondary school class reunion, when praising teacher Mr R.M.  got a laughing reply from a girl / lady who long ago became teacher herself telling me that R.M. loved my oral French. I stated that my French in those times was not so superior and that I did not understand more of the text than the others --- Back came   .  Well, Dr Dr R.M. had realized that I from my French speaking relatives knew how French had to sound.  Dr Dr R.M. also knew that with English speaking relatives and on holidays in Italy, me was the Mr BlaBla who had to do the talking as my older brother was not in a mood to talk ""Ausländisch"" ever        Yep, I am not a morning person.  Good on you for picking up on that.  Now let me clarify-these cream of the crop Swiss students generally write very poorly in English, even though Susan57 claims that the schools here teach them to write perfectly.   
Because  they are at the ETH in the basic sciences, they've been taught in English since year three of University.  They have written a Master's thesis in English.  They absolutely need to use English ""in practice,"" as in daily.   
Basically, I think it is ridiculous to assume or even expect that a student who is taught primarily in German will have perfect English skills, as Susan57 suggests, just as the International schools can't be expected to teach primarily in English and pump out fluent German speakers with excellent German writing skills.
		    How many schools in the Uk, US and english speaking countries produce perfect english students either - not many as most english people have nfi about the grammar of their own language.   
This argument that being in a certain school system produces better language skills etc, when at the end it doesnt matter. When I went through school the teachers had no idea what they were teaching so pity help the students   
At the end of the day its about fully rounded education and everyone should be able to chose where they send their kids. Those swiss that are sending there kids to international schools do it for a reason usually because they are not happy with the local schools
		 
			
			If you go back, I wasn't the one claiming that any school produced perfect English speakers/writers.    Or is Switzerland confusing us both today?   
Aain, merely questioning that any school, Swiss or otherwise, consistently produces students ""perfectly"" able to read and speak three languages, as Susan57 claims.
		    Personally I couldn't give two hoots about my English grandma, it's my German grandma that worries me the most.
		    Yes trust me the teacher CAN be a reason. I teach music and piano and I have received many students who were about to ""quit"" the piano forever. I could write many stories about the inappropriate approach and destroying the gift or a ""little treasure"" inside the child. Sometimes I wonder why the person studied to ""become a teacher"".... If you love teaching  you do it from the heart but if you do it  for ""monthly income"" only then the child can suffer.... Sorry to say it but this is the reality in many cases...
		    When did this start?   
Everyone I've ever worked with from ETHZ (and that means most people I've ever worked with) did their studies, and thesis, in German.   
Tom
		 
			
			It is current policy for D-Biol, at least since 2006 (link below). That's my department, so I am most familiar with that. However, I also know some physics lecturers and profs who teach starting from the upper bachelors courses, and they also lecture in English.   
As mentioned, many upper level courses for bachelors students are in English (though some are also in German and sometimes an option is given, depending on the proficiency of the lecturer) (Link below).   
I have read a good number of recent masters and PhD theses from D-BIOL, and they've always been in English (even from German and Swiss students).  However, I couldn't find anything that specified the language either way. 
The PhD thesis has a duplicate abstract in German, from the examples I have seen.  I can ask some of the students about the rules, if you like-it is probably in the material they get after admission.   
What is clear is that the language of instruction at masters level is listed as English, not German/English.  Also, the web site for the PhD program, Life Science Zurich, states that the language of instruction is ""English throughout.""   
Chemistry, math, physics, mechanical engineering are also listed as having English instruction at the masters level, but architecture, for example, is in German. Presumably this is also true at the PhD level, but I can ask over at physics and chemistry, if you're really curious.   
As an aside, this makes sense, because the major journals for these subjects are also almost universally in English.  Obviously, for other subjects, this may not be true (architecture, medicine, etc.)           
			
			Alas, don't know anybody in biology from ETHZ, just engineering.   
Tom
		 
			
			I don't consider engineering a basic science, but rather an applied science. And I say that with respect...   
However, mechanical, environmental, process, micro and nanosystems, nuclear, robotics, biomedical, energy science, neural systems, biotechnology, computer science, computational biology and computer science are all engineering programs listed as having English as the instruction language at the masters level.   
I don't know the thesis languages for these, though.  Nor do I have any idea about the history of these departments.           
Above link is quite interesting. First they write that for enrollement you need a C1 level in the language of instruction.   
On the bottom they write that they consider a Swiss Matura as a proof of C1 in both English and German ... right        
The three children, in my example, are the results of an English speaking Canadian mom,  French ETH professor father and a Swiss education. They arrived to Switzerland, in 2001, at the same time as us. They were about 9, 11 and 13 years old. Their parents did not consider the international school and they were simply placed in Swiss schools. Personally, I thought they were crazy and unkind, at the moment. Yet, the years have disproved me.    
Obviously, it was not the Swiss education which made them fluent, in all three languages, as they had the benefit of their educated parents. Although I agree there are amazing teachers at the International Schools ( Janko is certainly one of them), I believe the nomadic lifestyle of children (following their parents) can leave the children within an English bubble.    
In my opinion, it would behoove the International Schools to make more effort to integrate / expose their students to locals cultures/ languages. Our children attended five int'l schools, in four countries, which were  ( more or less) small ghettos of English speaking students.    
Unless you know your children shall return to an English speaking country, for their university studies or adult lives, they are at a disadvantage to the students of multilingial educations.   
In my humble opinion...of course...
		    Okay, that makes more sense. I am hoping that my kids are fluent in English (father and mother both fluent) and German (father fluent in German) but am prepared to spend a lot of time working on their English skills at home while sending them to the local school.  I also hope that they return to the US for college, mostly because I had a really good experience there and like the liberal arts approach to education.  Of course, that will be their choice.
		    This is true, but I don't think it's a fault of school. Any school. If local integration is a primary priority for parents, kids even in international schools will always find a way to: learn local languages, immerse in culture, find their ways to communities and participate. Schools can only do so much, and if they are supposed to cater to nomadic careers to put kids on their feet,  , then loading kids with yet another task (albeit important, it certainly is for me, so I get you, I have only considered a private school for my child, never an international one). I do think international schools do well, for what their aim seems to be. Trying to play a role between, a mediator, between nomadic parents and local life, would be too much to ask. The int. schools that are in the area are already participating quite a lot, offer kids some fab extra curriculars, for example, to have them spread around a local terrain. They will stick to their academic priorities, if a local language is not one of them, it's up to the parents provide the back up, and not let kids exist in an enclave, not sensitive to what is happening around them in a local setting.    
I do agree and have made the same choice, that unless one plans to return to an anglophone environment or have kids move onto an international university, then the local schools seems to be the best way to push local language. But, that might be simply just by more immersing and survival push. The other languages that kids pick up, while in public schools might be again because their parents are smart and foster interest, or arrange opportunities. It's hard to draw some general statements.      
On top, not all parents do know exactly what the future holds though. Quite a few of them will come here and hope for the best, not wanting to move after 2-3 years but not knowing if job will last, so they put their kids into an international school, work pays, and then if the they are able to stay longer they do not feel like uprooting kids and putting in local schools, since the kids are already comfortable. I understand them. I also believe comfort is not the best motive for life.   
I am a teacher but, or maybe because of that, I do not wait for school to initiate. If one wants a multilingual child, then home schooling after regular school is the norm, or hiring a tutor to support, or having other strategies that are discussed in our multilingual kids threads.
		 
			
			This is a recurring theme with Zurich education officials and they have their fair share of motives to issue this restrictions, however, every child should be treated based on the unique circumstances of his/her particular life context. Local schools are doing a great job with the integration and offer a full array of services and extra curricular activities that will help foreign kids to quickly integrate, make friends and lead happy, healthy lives here in Switzerland. Swiss teachers are very well trained, very balanced and love their jobs. If foreign parents would be aware of all the advantages that local schools offer the battle for places in International schools will be over! The Kantons are doing a great job with the education but they might have a PR problem    
			
			thank you for your info useful
		    The teachers differ. The first secondary school teacher in charge with languages taught us a rather theoretical French, the language he had learnt when studying at the Sorbonne Paris, which gave a good basis but could not be used in practice. The next one DISliked French and so in French was rather mediocre, but was an excellent and inspiring English teacher. In KV commercial school, the French teacher was superb.  The English teacher was a boring person, but a competent teacher.    
The Canton of Zürich, within less than 3 decades, has invested millions to upgrade the linguistical capabilities of the teachers and now feared that they, exactly the better ones of course,  might follow students to the international schools. THIS was the reason why they so harshly went through.

			Switzerland on Friday announced fresh sanctions on Syria, saying that it would impose an embargo on the import, sales and transport of Syrian oil and oil products.         
			
			The situation in Syria is deteriorating quickly. reports of human rights abuse, torture, summary executions, trials of mustard gas attack, involvement of Iranian republican guards...            Whenever something bad happens in the world, blame Iran.
		 
			
			And Switzerland gets so much oil from Syria.  Isn't switzerland neutral?
		     Neutrality isn't easy, it forces one to compromise alot. And in Syria's case, I'd say even neutral countries should boycott Syria's regime, and the bloody rebels until those buggers stop shooting and start talking.
		 
			
			Does Switzerland usually participate in boycotts like these?
		    Why not, when it's all hot air? Switzerland hasn't imported oil from Syria since 2005.   
Next, there'll be an embargo on Syrian ice cream and kangaroo pelts.
		    yeah sometimes, see Iran. And Libya, but we had a personal grudge with qaddafi.  
But it's done also because  those countries might try to use switzerland to buy restricted products from other countries, and this would make switzerland look bad if all the NATO & EU & US allies are applying the sanctions.    
Besides, being neutral doesn't mean not taking a moral stand. It's a difficult path to walk but there is an equilibrium somehow, found at the cost of lots of compromises.
		     Yeah, sometimes, it depends on the foreign politics, and whether they feel they have a moral obligation to participate in a boycott. But they don't automatically boycott someone just because the yanks and the europeans do so.
		 
			
			Hi - this is my first post. I think that the sanctions will not work - Iran will just supply what we block
		 
			
			Of course they won't, sanctions hardly ever work, the thing with sanctions is that they usually affect those people that have nothing or little to do with the reasons that the sanctions were enacted in the first place.

		    It has been suggested that potential clients who have no car go for a mobility subscription. 
I don't have mobility (and no intention of ever visiting the place.), but I certainly wouldn't want to have to use a shared car that people previously had sex with a street-hooker in. That is just so...gross. 
I wonder how long it takes before mobility updates their AUP....
		 
			
			Hmmm, i see a business opportunity here.   
Can one chauffeur willing customers whom do not have mode of transport?   
Free porn and easy money, can't be bad.       Isn't that called dogging?       No, no, as this would not be a public place as such.   
Restricted dogging perhaps.       Very restricted if you've only got a mini; or is that getting too personal?       Ha, more an estate, sporting markings such as ""wide load"" and ""long vehicle""       And if you get a fat bird:

its the pictures showing the positions which make it so funny

They either propose the new installation to be scrapped and demolished, or else they can propose that such projects (whatever definition) are to be decided by the Cantonal government and the Cantonal electorate and NOT by the cities of Zürich and Winterthur. In the clear knowledge that the Canton by average is centrist, while the two cities by average are left-of-centre. The Canton of Zürich however has lots of Cities of more than 20'000 inhabitants who are eager to maintain and increase their municipal independence. Another problem for the SVP is that many political rightwingers are ""Social Progressives""
		 
			
			As the sex stalls have been ""Up and running"" for a week now, I don't think anyone is going to successfully vote them away now.

So, do people come with some amount of their own money?  I suppose maybe they are also given a ticket for public transport as well as housing?  But still, I wonder how people manage here at 5 CHF a day...although she does have a cell phone and all, so it must not be too bad.     
Really, I am just curious!
		    They get pocket money according to the size of the family. A family of four get between CHF 32.00 (when living in a centre) and CHF 38.00 (when living in a flat) a day. The costs of living like rent, insurances, clothing and food are paid separately
		 
			
			No bread? ""Let them eat cake"".
		    Asylum seekers are just that - they seek asylum as they feel threatened at home for various reasons - war or persecution from authoritatrian governments for things that are covered through the human rights... Given the countries most people come from can one expect that they on averag do not have a lot of own money to bring. (But obviously could a millionaire be asking for political asylum as well... )    No. And they are not able to afford to pay for it with the 5 CHF they get... Which is why they are often caught taking the tram illegally without ticket - which in turn then produces those statistics of the many criminal asylum seekers. (I fully understand that there is no human right for public transport and can equally understand that ZVV is not a charity... but I cannot understand that the Swiss prefer to hire cops to chase the fare dodgers instead of finding a solution to get them tickets...)   
I do not think refugees need to get paid at all - if they have access to everything they need to have a life in dignity while waiting for the asylum approval. The pocket money is an easy way to reduce bureaucracy - in that way does nobody need to source a tootbrush or the like for them. I think 5 CHF a day for personal things is already on the very low side - I really do not see how the Swiss can cut it without giving out supplies then in a material form... which will for sure not lower the costs giving the salaries even the lower level employees who surely would have to oversee the process might cost - otherwise some criminal refugee could nick a second tootbrush and sell it on...
		    This is indeed a problem for the Gemeindes.  Once the refugees are allowed to live here permanently, they often exist off the welfare programs of the local communities.
		 
			
			Can I ask for asylum from paying US taxes?
		 
			
			I think a clear distinction should be made between asylum seekers who collaborate with authorities and can prove their claim and illegal immigrants who are here for economic reasons. The first should be integrated into society with full efforts of the state and society, the latter deported or detained until they leave willingly. And concerning economic migrants, no truly poor person can make it out of the country, let alone pay 5'-10'000 USD for the crossover to Europe. Once clear guidelines are established across Europe there will be much less crime regarding this on both sides of the Mediterranean sea.
		    No cop is hired to chase ticketless passengers. Police is called when ticketless passengers are unable to prove their identity when they get fined by the transport agents. Also you don't commit a criminal offense when you ride without ticket. It is an administrative fine. So nobody increase the crime statistics by not paying a bus/train ticket you increase it by committing burglary or selling drugs. I can hardly think people do so because they can't pay public transportation.   
If Swiss authorities provided free public transportation to asylum seekers I can imagine the reaction of the tax payers. Why not provide free public transportation to everybody then ?  Cost maybe ?
		    Actually they are paid the tickets if they have a reason to take a train or a bus. But they have to pay it from the CHF 8.00 pocket money if they take public transport just for fun. BTW, SBB stated this week, that they catch 780 ticketless passengers a day.
		    Which means they can't all be asylum seekers.
		    Slightly off topic but according to the SBB's average daily passenger numbers from 2011 that means that only 0.08% passengers are fare dodgers. Of course that only takes into those that are caught, but still not bad at all for a transport system where it's relatively easy to dodge fares.
		 
			
			not so sure about having a transport ticket, often on the early morning weekend trains out of basel a lot of africans are requested to show tickets before the train departs, quite a few had a letter from the geminde and it was accepted by the inspector.
		    Ok, today they are called ""Securitrans"" - up to some years ago were they called ""Bahnpolizei"". Either way, the gentlemen are hired to catch fare dodgers.      I guess you are not really experienced with fare dodging then - me neither... but I know that it is indeed a crime and not an administrative fine - especially when you do so repeatedly. So yes, you can end up at court for it and yes, you can get a criminal record for it - and yes, a refugee can end up in the ""criminal refugees"" statistics for not spending his 5 CHF on a ticket - which would not bring him far anyway...  
Source? Obviously the Strafgesetzbuch:    
The argument that SBB does not catch a lot is of course not logical - they most likely dodge the bus or tram fare from their shelter to the next supermarket and the like - not the IC to the opposite side of the country...
		    There are two systems around. Tickets paid by the centre or confirmation letter of the Gemeinde
		    And how long does it take for the authorities to establish who's entitled to asylum and who's not? Maybe that's a problem too. A few years process is draining public funds..
		    Sorry, that is not correct. I have never ever seen them do anything other than stand around looking ""to make your journey more secure"". Not a single time has any of them checked any tickets - that's what the inspectors are there for.
		 
			
			We are (almost all I believe) foreigners. We (almost all) contribute to this country, usually more than we get back. I don't mind that, piece left for me is still generous enough for me to stay and having time of my life.  
These asylum seekers, it's not an easy topic. Many sad stories. Problem is, not many actually need protection. As said, amounts to get here from Africa, Asia are usually 5-digit USD equivalents, and you need to be really rich there (or be utterly stupid and get to huge debt) to go for this ride. 
And Switzerland is tiny spec of dust. It cannot embrace all people from whole world (and Switzerland has quite a special status, many people want to get exactly here, not just generally Europe). So with current global economic conditions, either flow is throttled quite intensively, or problem gets worse.  
Mentioned Mongolians - I seriously doubt they are here for anything else than money. There are no persecutions of minorities there, and the state is more or less democracy. So unless they are criminals back home, this is economic migration. And same applies for many, many others.  
If this would be up to me (and it is not, correctly), I would accept only truly endangered people, that can prove they would face execution or torture based on political/racial/ethnic membership. You know, north korea, few african states (really just few), and that's probably it. Rest of them, they could live back home, in worse condition than here, but perfectly manageable (as they did before coming here).
		    There, fixed that for you ....
		 
			
			One has to make a distinction between Refugees ( all refugees were once asylum seekers ) and aslyum seekers ( seeking refugee status ).   
Asylum seekers are typically hosted in major reception centers runs by the Federal Govt. called CERA ( in FR I believe ). At this time, they are given the N permit to identify themselves. The N permit does does not fall under Schengen rules but allows ""work"" after 3 months in 5 areas ( cleaning, farming, restaurant helpers etc. ).         s, a single person is paid CHF21 a week ( ie CHF3 a day ) with three meals and a hostel like bed provided. A private firm manages security ( Securitas contractors ).   
This goes on until 2 months ( legal limit to hold them at Federal Centers ).   
Then they are distributed to various willing Cantons ( Phase II ) at Reception Centers ( Durchgangszentrum ) until final detemrination of their status, if not already determined ( NEE / NEM ).   
It is unlikely for anyone to get their Refugee status at the CERA ( as the CH policy is to thoroughly investigate before granting status and they have limited resources ).     , residency might be as short as 6 months or as long as 3 years, mean is 18 months.   
In Stadt Zürich, the for-profit   takes care of all residents by way of a long established contract. They provide in-house language lessons, no meals, just a hostel like bedding with a shared kitchen and other facilities.   
Pending an outcome, a single person is paid roughly CHF220 a month. Outcome is usually after a long interrogation in Bern, the HQ of the BfM. Not everyone gets an interview, and those who do not, get an NEE / NEM based on the written and signed notes taken from an initial interview of half hour at the CERA.   
Transport ticket ( ZVV transferable monthly Abo about 6 tickets per 100 residents ) is given to those who have a valid reason to travel within ZH, to visit a doctor, dentist, attend local programs etc. Again, travel to outside the Canton or local zone is private and if not, a special arrangement can be made for the ticket.   
So normally, they ought not to be caught without a ticket unless it is for a private trip beyond their means.   
Outside Stadt Zürich, there are the for-profit  , private firms who negotiate with the Sozialamt of the Gemeinde / Stadt, or the   of the Gemeinde / Stadt who are responsible for the aslyum seekers, not refugees. Most Gemeindes do not contract ORS until overwhelmed by the numbers.   
Again, tickets are provided, but this time lokalnetz personalised ZVV ones since most if not all needs are found within the local zone. Anything beyond the lokalnetz has to be borne by the asylum seeker unless the trip is officially sanctioned e.g. an interview in Bern.       
Phase III is for recognised Refugees ( B permits - Schengen Okayed ) or those who cannot be sent back ( F permits -not Schengen Okayed but with work rights in the Canton ) within a year. Both of these have welfare benefits close to that of a Swiss citizen.    
Recognised refugees who cannot find a room or other place to stay within 6 months of obtaining their status are charged CHF420 a month for their bed. All other ""benefits"" at the center is taken away and are fully payable as they now come under Sozialamt or ORS.            
Rejection codes for asylum seekers are called   ( no willing to co-operate by giving the identity for example Non-entré en matière ) or NEM ( basically meaning that it is abusive, frivolous or otherwise an abuse of process ). These are normally granted at the CERA level or latest at the Phase II, which I believe is what this news report and topic is about. Beyond that, they are called   ie no longer having valid permission to be on Swiss soil.   
Removal:      did a short film:       
Social assistance statistics ( DE ):       
			
			I herad on the news this morning that the lower house had approved this move. 
It will mean that asylum seekers are only entitled to emergency assistance. I think they said 8chf per day and a bed for the night but it was only 6am and I was still half asleep.
		 
			
			From  :      This will affect the Familiennachzug opportunity.                     
The &bdquo;Bahnpolizei&ldquo; was reorganized after an effective campaign of the Police trade union over the title police. The service was divided between &ldquo;Securitrans&rdquo; a joint venture between &ldquo;Securitas&rdquo; and the SBB to handle a security presence in the train station. A railway police was created in order to keep the title and because a XIX century law gave the SBB some police powers in regards of railway. The police officers of the Railway Police are trained in two intercantonal police academies (NE and LU). They are in charge of the enforcement of the law in the railway system but have to handover the most serious case to the competent police forces (usually a cantonal one). The control of ticket is not their primary task.   
I was wrong concerning the qualification of the fine as you mention the&rdquo;obtaining a service without paying&rdquo; article (which is mentioned in the stickers in buses for instance), my bad.I do have actually a lot of experience about ticket dodgers&hellip;. as a sworn police officer for about 10 years (ok did not do that in since 10 years, so I might be rusty). In the hundred checks I did for the public transportation that never popped up probably because it is only if the transporter is pressing charges. As long the charges are not pressed, police will not report anything to justice.   
The federal office for statistics do not provide a separate report for this particular offense. I am skeptical that ticket dodgers represent the main issue of reported crimes.
		 
			
			The video shown is of course made with a negative spin, from 6:00 showing the restraints etc, its similar but isnt actually what is used.   
I have never seen the use of a wheelchair.   
The deportees are transported to the plane by a van, they sit in the van like every other passenger (police included) and walk up the steps escorted by 2 or 3 police men or women and moved to the allocated seats.   
If the person is violent then they maybe carried up the steps into the aircraft.    
The reason for the boxing helmet is to prevent headbutts and also to prevent harming themselves by hitting against a wall or parts of the plane.   
If the person is behaved then the helmet is removed and all restraints are loosened and they have a lot of movement. If the person is violent then for peoples safety the restrains are kept on.   
If the deportee wishes to go to the toilet they can at any time, but escorted obviously.    
yes 1 person did die whilst being transported to the plane, he had been on hunger strike for a number of weeks as protest but i assume there was also an underlying medical condition that led to his unfortunate passing.   
It should be noted that forced removal is the last step. The person is given 2 chances to leave.   
1, they are given a flight ticket and are given the opportunity to go to the airport by themsleves.   
2, if they do not do the above they are escorted to the airport and also escorted on the flight.   
3, if they fail to do the above such as leaving the hostel etc or make such a scene that they are removed from the flights, they will be removed using a special flight.
		     15 CHF at Saturn... ...yeah those asylum seekers are having a blast! How I envy them...
		    ...didn't know Switzerland got that bad...what happened to you poor girl? couldnt afford a LV bag?    
			
			tapiro lee - as you groaned i of course assume you know something about the subject... please do comment, i would to hear your experiences of the deportation process.
		    I wasn't suggesting they were having a blast.  I am just trying to figure out how the system works.  Obviously, the 5 CHF per person this family gets a day is a very small amount and I don't see how they can live on it, so I was wondering if possibly some have money that they bring with them to pay for extras.
		    It's pocket money as I wrote here:     This means that a family of four gets around CHF 1'000 for personal items like fags, chewing gum and so on.  
I know quite a few Swiss families you can only dream of such a sum to spend for nicknacks.
		    CHF52.50 per week for pocket money sounds like a dose of fairness and dignity for those who came from terrible places and managed to get out alive. I'm pretty sure genuine asylum seekers would be glad to get a job and pay it back if they get the chance. Denigrating it to chewing gum and baccy seems unfair. If you're on the Social as a Swiss person you also get a bit more than you absolutely need.    
How much is a tram ticket without the half tax card?
		    That's true, asylum seekers get according to SKOS exactly 30% less. And I think a small advantage for Swiss living on social benefits in their own country can't be that wrong. Once more I am not talking about the essentials of life, neither about bus tickets. This is all paid if justified. Years ago asylum seekers weren't allowed to move beyond a certain radius of their centre or flat. However, I don't know if this rule is still to follow.
		     
Until recently, Switzerland was one of very few countries that accepted asylum requests through their foreign missions.   
PS: Tomorrow is        
			
			there is an expo at basel marktplatz tomorrow i believe.
		    Maybe that's just me, but: If people have to run away from some politically motivated violence - do you really need to make them waive the flags of those regimes? A flag normally represents more than just the piece of soil you are from... (which is why they change so often in third world countries.)
		    It also represent your culture, your roots and who you are. Not just only a repressive regime.
		    Thought exactly the same. Let's all wave the flags of the countries that suppressed us so much we took asylum elsewhere.. what about waving the flag of the recipient country instead?    
			
			one quick question, i have a Permit N and if i want to change canton what are the probabilities? it says i can have a written request? does it only apply for marriage or do they take other reasons too? thank you for posting this accurate post
		 
			
			I think 2 important things have not been mentioned here. First the first sentence of the article 
""The current emergency aid provisions enable asylum seekers who have had their applications rejected...""    
So obviously we are not talking about people that had a valid (from governments standpoint) reason to seek asylum. They are mostly economic refugees. Secondly this has got attention because some journalist wrote rightfully that they get more financial help than people that worked all their life here, are  retired and are unfortunate enough to have to live off welfare. This has been perceived as unjust and is now being discussed.    
By the way: Hi guys, I'm the newbie here. Swiss, living in rurual Thurgovie and working for one of the big US IT companies as Architect/Consultant/Project Manager.
		 
			
			I was told of a report in 20min assylum seekers were put to work clearing sections of forest and were paid approx 7chf per day....
		    Thats correct    
The underlying reason why asylum seekers normally may not work for money is that this supports those seeking asylum for economic reasons.

23	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/146499-swiss-bank-wegelin-fights-us-summons.html	" 
			
			Swiss bank Wegelin, accused by US authorities of conspiring to help clients escape tax payments, has once again refused to appear before a US court claiming on Wednesday the summons was ""invalid.""                   
			
			Any word on why they chose to reverse course and just plead and pay (and go completely out of business)? Seems really strange.
		    Spend a lot of money fighting something that they're likely to lose given the Swiss government's tendency to do whatever the Americans want lately, while at the same time losing the ability to invest in American markets (e.g. their public FATCA stance), or... pay a small fine and take the rest of the money and run.   
Seems like a smart, if regrettable, decision to me.
		    All the non-US business of Wegelin has been sold to Reiffeisen quite some time ago. Wegelin only kept the US customer with the purpose to deal with the allegation. If I rembember correctly than the partners of Wegelin are privately liable. Thus they may have an interest in settling the matter.
		 
			
			A general sort of prediction for 2013 concerning banks:   
With so many banks in trouble this year could be the year when internationally - and in Switzerland - a number of big banks have Lehman-style crashes?  
Rumours are still circulating that thousands of tons of customers' gold have been removed from allocated accounts in various countries and were last seen heading east.    
According to Jim Willie:         I would guess the reason for settling like this is described in some confidential clauses in the settlement agreement; for example, protection from prosecution (this is an example, I assume no such clauses exist).
		    care to give some further explanation of this for us laypeople not so familiar with these matters?
		    Well people buy gold bullion (the actual physical stuff) from a bank & the bank offers to store it for them at a nominal price in their secure vaults.   
The story is that these banks then sell the gold bullion (the actual physical stuff) & replace it with paper IOUs saying ""when you ask for your gold back then we promise to give you your gold bullion (the actual physical stuff)""   
The problem is that people buy the actual physical stuff because they do not trust pieces of paper and/or the organisations standing behind the promises written on these papesr.  Consequently the gold owners would get quite miffed if they found out about this non-approved substitution.
		    Well, UBS paid their fine and got the charges dropped as part of the agreement so unless there's something else we don't know I would have thought they could do the same.  However, according to the article they deliberately went after the clients that other Swiss banks had been dropping or refusing because of possible tax evasion so maybe the US wouldn't cut a deal because of that.
		    To give an 'explanation' is a difficult task and would largely be guessing on my part. Let's just say I have been following the gold scene (as a layperson) for some years and of recent there have been more and more stories about ""allocated gold"" being misappropriated. Obviously the people reporting this scandal often don't want to be named. I admit this puts such comments in the ""rumours"" league.  
One person who has spoken openly about the ""allocated gold"" scandal is Egon von Greyerz but he is the owner of a Swiss gold investment company so one could also say that is merely his way of promoting gold sales.
		    That ""tendency"" is based on the knowledge that whatever the Americans want is based on the USA constitution, which is the same as the one of Switzerland.
		 
			
			sad to see the oldest swiss bank go because of a law created during the american civil war, which has only been recently enforced because the us is losing all their money. sad indeed.
		 
			
			not sure most of the world agrees...
		    The Swiss constitution is definitely not the same as the American one.

24	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/137172-zurich-bans-minors-sex-trade.html	" 
			
			Wide open prostitution is coming to an end in Zurich after the city council  approved measures to ban minors under the age of 18 from plying the sex  trade.             
			
			And they stopped it only now?????
		    No mate. 9 months ago.
		 
			
			This has been discussed before, but as a Swiss, I was very ashamed that prostitution in Switzerland was legal from 16   
About time!
		    Only in Zurich.   
Tom
		 
			
			Shamefully and sadly true - let's hope humanity will prevail and this will soon be the case all over Switzerland. How anybody can condone prostitution being valid at 16, beggars belief.   
How anybody who has teenage daughters can - is uttlerly beyond comprehension.
		 
			
			Apparently 9 voted against it!!   
Pretty sick
		 
			
			Lawyers gotta be happy about this!       My thoughts exactly.   
One really has to ask what the social cost of open prostitution amounts to.   
I've never had a single prostitute as a client who didn't suffer serious psychological damage from the act. Not a single one. This is a dehumanizing practice.
		 
			
			Just another titbit: I just learned (I think) that as per local law a 14-year old girl could star in a porno if the male star is up to 17-years old. I haven't done much research but a Swiss colleague told me this is true. Strange! 
Like I said I haven't done much research maybe I'm getting something wrong.
		    So you can well imagine the effect on a 16 year old      The question is really, what is the social cost of keeping prostitution illegal? Underground brothels run by gangs where women are beaten and forced to work as slaves, where the law works against them and not for them and where the women become human shields for the men in the background.   
Whether you agree or disagree with prostitution, it has been shown in New Zealand that since it was legalised there the women working in the industry are, on the whole, better off than they were when it was illegal.   
Now, under-age prostitution should never have been   in the first place, and the fact that it was is shameful, since there is no way to benefit the girl or boy.
		 
			
			Check you last sentence, please - is that what you meant to write?   
'Under-aged' means different things in different countries, and here in CH, prostitution is legal at 16 (well, bravo Zurich for putting a stop to this locally).
		     
Corrected, thanks! Yes, I meant to say it never should have been legal.   
True that under age sex means different things. Am I to understand, though, that the age of consent here is higher? Or can 16 year olds generally consent to have sex?
		 
			
			16 for both. I have no problem with sex at 16 (I did, no pressure, no regrets)- but I do have a big problem with prostitution at 16.
		 
			
			The law is simple, really.   
It is legal for 16 year olds to have sex.   
It is legal to accept money for sex.   
Therefore, it is legal for 16 year olds to accept money for sex.   
Tom
		    fixed that for you.       So the Local is implying that minors over the age of 18 will still be permitted?   
What exactly does The Local think ""minors"" are?   
People who work down a coal mine?   
Maybe the Local could divert some of its advertising revenue to buy a dictionary.   
And use it as well.      I hope Rasha Hammad hangs her head in shame when she realises what a bunch of time wasters she's been talking to rather than doing her job.   
Somebody also please explain to the The Local about the square brackets on its keyboard.      Is that too difficult?
		 
			
			why above 18 is acceptable and between 16-18 is not good?
		 
			
			Because at 18 you are an adult   it does not make it 'good' but at least it is better than 16!
		 
			
			I'm presuming that the BBC's retired DJ Travel Section is busy on the phone to a call center in India to try and re-arrange flights to Bratislava instead of Zürich for their Christmas outing.    
			
			I dont get it.   
So, you can work at 16, you can have sex at 16, and selling sex is not illegal. But you can't sell sex at 16? Sounds like a classic case of discrimation to me.   
Is this not effectively saying a 16 year old is not old/mature enough to make the decision to sell sex, but is old enough to have it and work in other jobs the state deems more acceptable. Which then begs the quesiton, are prostitutes outcasts from society? Are they not on equal footing to the rest of us?
		    Can a 16 year old sell alcohol in a bar?  Or be a tram driver?
		 
			
			Or even buy alcohol (apart from beer or wine)?   
If people can't see the difference between having sex and selling sex as a 16 year old I dispair. I cannot thing of a single mother or father of a 16 year old who could not clearly understand that.
		 
			
			Who wants to have sex with a minor?  All fat and dirty and covered in coal dust.
		    What goes on in a mine, stays in a mine. 33 Chileans and one tube of lube is a story of improvisation and filth .....
		    I think as bars sell spirits, and in this country spirits must be purchased by persons 18 or over I think, probably not. I have no idea on the latter, I assume the legal age to obtain a driving licence is 17? So perhaps it makes sense that they cant drive a tram, given the lives they are responsible for, but I have no idea.   
Can a 16 year old have sex legally? I think they can. So not sure how the examples compare as yours is based on incidents a 16 year old can not legally obtain or perform, whereas a 16 year old can legally have sex.       I can see the difference, but I dont think anyone can judge the situation, and I believe it is a bit hypocritical to be honest.    
Lets be straight, any parent will despair at their child selling their body at all, whether that be at 16 or 18 or in their 20s. They would of wanted better things for their child then that and may need to look in the mirror themselves if that is the case. I am currently childless, but I cant imagine saying ""hell you are not selling yourself at 16, at least wait until you are 25""   
That said, if a 16 year old wants to, they will. If they cant legally do so in a legal establishment, they will do so at their own risk. I think the legal route would be more responsible for the country in regard to safety and welfare rather than dwelling on the moral aspects of the whole issue.
		 
			
			18 for driving actually.   
A 16 year old having sex in a consensual relationship is just not comparable, really. Most kids who prostitute themselves are doing so to get to drugs they've been introduced to by pimps. And many are brought over from abroad and kept in a form of slavery, their passport taken away, etc.
		    Ok, so makes my point even clearer.      That may well be the case, if a little speculation, but the alternative only forces this issue further underground no?
		    So you think if minors were prohibited from hiring prostitutes too then that'd be fairer?  I can live with that.
		 
			
			So what else are they supposed to when the pit closes?   
Cheers, 
Nick
		    Well in the context of sex 16 is not a minor
		 
			
			Can you state any country where prostitution is legal at 16, apart from Switzerland? It is certainly the only one in Europe.   
Quote from a journalist doing some research recently:       
			
			I thought they got outed in October.   
Cheers, 
Nick          Actually, I had read that it was for want of LV bags and such (at least among the Swiss doing so, the foreigners just jumped on the band-wagon).   
Tom
		    The BBC must be pretty smart being able to judge people's linguistical skills from behind the windscreen of a moving car.   
A pity they were less skilled at spotting in-your-face paedophilia on senior levels withion their own ranks.   
And as for escort agencies adveritising under-age girls. who can be so naive as to fall for that? Even in the US there is a chain of strip joints called ""Barely Legal"", owned by no less than Larry Flint. But I'm sure that when the police turn up to inspect they'll find they're all perfectly legal. Women have lied about their age ever since the invention of the calendar. This is just really poor journalism.
		    But this is OK for people over 18?
		    The whole story about pimps befriending under-age girls, giving them drugs, and then using them as prostitutes once they're hooked is quite old but there has been a lot of taboo around it. In the UK for example a certain ethnic group was often accused of doing that and no one would mention it in public for fear of being called racist. But this taboo has been softening lately.
		    this is age discrimination!       This is absolutely correct.  
Especially in and around Zurich there aren't a lot of girls in that age group who don't at least know somebody who sells their body for some more pocket money once in a while. Scary, disgusting but true.
		            I am curious, what is the minimum legal age for client who wants to use the services of a prostitute?
		    I still don't understand why 16 year olds are allowed to smoke when the human brain is so susceptible to addiction at that young an age.      I think the idea might be that a 16 year old is simply not mature enough to make a decision that may cause long-term health consequences (condoms are not 100% effective), and possibly also emotional consequences... after all, the frontal lobe isn't fully developed until your 20s or so.
		    while marijuana was and still is not.
		    18. I think they can ask for ID at these joints.
		    You're right about condoms not being 100% effective - many different STD's other than AID out there; not including just general diseases that can be transmitted via contact. 
Let's leave tobacco and pot out of this  :P
		 
			
			IMO prostitution is not right or good in any age.. 16,18,28... - still shameful and disgusting. Honestly I did not even know it was legal at all until now ! Talk about that being legal since 16..
		    It's a huge business in CH & huge taxes are collected, why make it illegal & kill the goose that lays the golden egg?
		    If prostitutes were illegal only crooks would have prostitutes.
		 
			
			prostitution is illegal in the us and the client gets sued. thus demand-suppy side, prices fall...   
with few exceptions, no woman would be willing to prostitute for a living. it is a shame for everybody that they have to sell their bodies.
		    Somebody seems very unaware of a large, wealthy, rewarding, pornographic industry it seems.
		     I don't see your logic at all. It's not 100% illegal in the USA, but sodomy and oral sex is in some states. Even between married heteros.   
And what is prostitution? Is it any more righteous for a woman to marry herself to someone she does not love, but the hope that this man she in some cases has to basically serve, will bring her out of her part of the world and substantial financial gain?    
When to do clients of prostitutes in the USA get sued? When really ever?    
Is it a shame? I have met girls that have slept with guys for LV bags. And for a lot less, and they thought of it as ""guys can do it"", and get nothing for it.    
I have known women that get paid to work as Domina's, and they love it. The sex trade these days is not purely women being put into something that would not want to do. When it is not slavery, or addiction, it is about survival and independence.
		     
USH =  United States of Hypocrisy
		    Domina's don't have sex with their clients, but charge more!   They are NOT prostitutes.
		    Their pizza   expensive, even for Switzerland.
		 
			
			I know two girls who started at sixteen. One is still at it, 15 years later but having to do more and more things for less and less money. She looks older than her 31 years and past thirty is apparently old in that trade. She never finished her education, didn't learn any trade other than lying on her back, has a cocaine problem...    
The other is struggling to put her life back together, she only did it for a few months but it meant that she abandoned her apprenticeship and has no formal training either. She jumps from job to job but someone always recognises her and tells her boss. She wanted to become a policewoman but because she got flagged as a prostitute during a check from vice, she has a tarnished reputation on paper (kein einwandfreier Leumund), so many jobs are closed to her. Most girls don't make payments into pension schemes and pay only the minimum of AHV, which creates even bigger problems later on.    
I think the minimum age should be 19, as that is the earliest point at which you will finish an apprenticeship or Gymnasium.
		     While I am aware of that, it still falls into the category of a sex worker. As it is not a total ""hands off"" occupation.
		    Bullshit on both arguments:  
1. Situation in the US  
If something is illegal it never ever gets cheaper - it always ends up more expensive as there is more risk involved. Just look at the prohibition or the obviously lost war on drugs in the US. I never seen more hookers than in Vegas - where prostitution is in principle legal, but all the women in the hotels work illegally... did not look like anyone was that scared to get sued.   
2. No Swiss woman would possibly need to sell her body. I cannot rule it out for all the woman imported from poor countries - but no Swiss national will starve if she does not prostitute herself. The vast majority is attracted by the fast money and yes, it was a trend of the last years that more and more teenage girls had ""label sex"" to afford the designer clothes they wanted. I find it strange that especially the people who at any other opportunity scream ""freedom"" seem to be offended at any freedom that does not match their moral values. Pretty much like in the homosexual marriage debate...   
I do not think that a law will help much - by outlawing teenage prostitution will it not go away. It will just be better hidden and the girls will be scared to go to the cops if they get abused as they will not want to report themselves for their illegal work.
		 
			
			It's simple: leave the prostitutes alone, but cut the knackers off their clients.
		    I'm sure that wouldn't slow some of them down...
		    And look forward to having to pay more tax, no thank you.
		    How much does a pair of garden shears cost?   
Anyway, they could recoup the costs by inviting a paying crowd. Could be quite a popular spectacle: The Decodding of the Cad.    
			
			Prostitution has already been regulated and restricted in the times of the Assyrians, Babyloneans and Romans and nothing changed. Mr Napoleone Buonaparte (Emperor Napoleon I), the realist he was, took care that the prostitutes were never too far away from the troops        In other words, at 16 one cannot buy alcohol but he or she can prostitute?
		     But they can buy alcohol...      I am sorry, I mean spirits, not beer.
		     So beer can't get me drunk?
		    To be honest, beer is more like water than alcohol to me. Sorry for the mistake .
		     When I get pulled by the police next time after a night out, I am going to print up a copy of this and give it over as an excuse. If it does not work, I will tell them about prostitutes being able to be 16 in Zurich.

25	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/150391-asylum-seekers-should-shot-svp-politician.html	" 
			
			A far-right politician from the Swiss People's Party (SVP) is expected to resign on Monday after it emerged that he had called on Facebook for asylum seekers to be shot.            The SVP, Switzerland's largest political party, is seeking to distance itself from Mosimann, who previously worked as a bodyguard for party strongman Christoph Blocher.   
Blocher needs a bodyguard?  I wonder why?
		 
			
			They need some Australian politicians in here! That way the asylum seekers will be safe and sound  On an island, in the Pacific, not actually in the country......       
			
			i believe you forgot to mention we should be put in  ""concentration camp"" as: ""a guarded compound for the detention or  imprisonment of aliens, members of ethnic minorities, political  opponents, civilians etc typically under harsh conditions. and before we get shot we should be tortured and our organs be sold in the open market, that would solve the problem right? 
 Stop treat us like the ........... in the second world war
		    Something is very wrong here, how much more bile needs to come out of his gutter trap before they take action?
		 
			
			Perhapd because many think the same   
I was at a debate locally, with all the candidates for the second vote for the Cantonal Government- and some of the UDC candidates sitting behind me said exactly the same when Asylum seekers where mentioned   
			
			The thread is a year old, but I have not seen much improvement in their rhetorics in the meantime, to be honest.
		 
			
			Come on, he meant a vaccination shot. The SVP is a loving and caring party.    
Irony off: The wave of criminality, whatever the reasons are, does make politics very difficult at the moment because people, as moderate and open to the world as they might be, really get pissed off. The tone has changed a little bit in Basel around me in the last five years. Perhaps not around you, just one perception here. Anyway, right or wrong, the perceived danger of criminality determines a lot of decision making at the moment.    
It reminds me of the anti-europe attitude in Danmark in the late 90ies. They made reforms and changes that have nothing to do with Europe and everybody was happy again, but the anti-europe attitude staid. Here, it's not anti-EU, it's anti-something-else but the group psychology behind it looks the same to me.
		 
			
			I don't think it really is criminality itself but more the manner it gets reported here, which is hard to influence. When legislature improves, then reporting improves, then people's opinion adjust accordingly. It's a chain reaction, sad that people and their opinions depend on low quality media so much.
		 
			
			MC, the increase in criminality in border areas is sadly not a myth or just a case of unfair reporting. But it is more linked to the Arab Spring and the influx in nearby France of immigrants from those countries- who would actually not qualify as Asylum seekers- and who have no possibility of working and turn to crime in desperation. So NOT linked to Asylum seekers generally.
		    If police aren't equipped with adequate legislature, it will never change. I wonder if there is a political will to change the situation. In our area, commune has taken stuff into its hands, seems to work, no need to stir racial conflict.    
Poor reporting, using strategies and rhetorics that are outright banned in other countries and have been for ever, will not improve the situation, will just feed the xenophobic hatred.    
Making sure police can act, will change situation.
		 
			
			Lausanne is not right on the border. Here and the whole of the Jura bordering France- small groups come at night, do the deed and rush over the border again. There are police and customs patrols constantly, but 1000s of small rural road over the mountains, which the criminals know very well. I abhor the tactics of the UDC/SVP - and yet can see that denial of criminality increase does not help, and in fact plays right into their hands, sadly.       
         La police cantonale jurassienne présente le bilan 2012 en matière de criminalité. 
    Le nombre d´affaires judiciaires a augmenté de 13.3% entre 2011 et  2012. La situation générale en matière de criminalité a donc évolué  négativement par rapport à 2011. La raison de ce changement découle de  l´augmentation des plaintes enregistrées en matière de vols (+32%).  Cette augmentation s´explique en grande partie par l´effet dit du  ""printemps arabe"", des requérants d´asile tunisiens et algériens  commettant un grand nombre de délits en série et en récidive... La police cantonale poursuivra ses  actions dans la prévention ciblée et l´identification des auteurs  d´infractions graves, tels les brigandages, les infractions contre  l´intégrité physique et les cambriolages. Ces infractions qui ont un  fort impact sur le sentiment de sécurité des Jurassiennes et des  Jurassiens sont une priorité.
		 
			
			Cops are present, but that's probably the only thing they are allowed to do. Their hands seem to be tied. And it is not only crime situ in bordering regions, just imagine calling a cop at 2 am that the club opposite of your house is too noisy. They cannot do anything, unless people start shooting each other there. I think things will improve, the legislature just needs to be pushed through faster, communes given autonomy to have their own preventative measures. Leaving it up to bad media stirring intolerance or SVP campaigning like little hitlerjungends, is a joke.
		 
			
			We are not talking about a bit of noise, but burglaries here. And the cops and customs officers do have the power to act, and often do. But with gangs coming over regularly and repeatedly over the border for cash and grab- with 1000s of small rural and mountain roads over the border, it is a very difficult task.
		 
			
			Over the border grab and run, happens all over the Europe, unfortunately so. German borders, Austrian, etc. It was bound to come here, too. The cops over here in our area, weren't until recently authorized to do much. The situation has improved massively, for example, when community police started a new policy on drug dealing,etc. There needs to be an upgrade of strategy, evidently. Whatever criminality and however it is reasoned and explained, will not stop by itself, nor by making population hostile, due to an aggressive media or political campaigning. People need to wisen up, too, when they go on holidays and leave houses unattended, house sitting, stepping up security at homes, not letting anyone know when they are at home, when at work, etc. Media should stress how to protect oneself, not where the criminals are from. Time changes, I know it is crap and we all miss when one didn't have to lock our door at all. Try walking in Prague over the Charles Bridge, with your backpack actually on your back, not your front. They will get even your half eaten sandwich.
		     
.....       
Lausanne so is just a few kilometers from the border
		 
			
			Not far, as you say. But many areas are right on the border- and are more at risk.   
Of course people have to wisen up - but for people who have for centuries been able to leave the door open without any problem - it is causing resentment- as change is happening so fast. And of course the 'wrong' people get the blame- as I explained, asylum seekers here in CH are NOT the current problem.   
So education and positive information is paramount - but ignoring the issues and being in denial is not helpful.
		    I totally agree with you.
		    Here in Zürich we left the door open from the morning into late evening into the late 1960ies and the change was very much CH-internal. When I went to military service in 72 it was normal for all of us on Sunday evening to deposit our rifle at the start-point of the relevant ""Perron"". We knew the number and so what. Really bad was the time when terrorism became a real problem in WestGermany
		"	18	Asylum seekers should be shot: SVP politician	4620
26	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/141524-swiss-edge-closer-gay-adoption.html	" 
			
			Switzerland's upper house of parliament, the Council of States, decided on Wednesday by 21 votes to 19 to give same-sex couples the right to adopt children.         
			
			An update:   
The Swiss parliament has voted to allow gay couples to adopt children. However, the motion passed in the House of Representatives on Thursday was not so liberal as the original version approved by the Senate.   
The Senate had approved a motion granting adoption rights regardless of marital status or sexual orientation, as long as the arrangement was the best option for the child in question.    
In Switzerland, gay couples in a registered partnership are not allowed to adopt children. However, Swiss law permits a single gay man or lesbian woman to do so. This peculiar situation – which essentially punishes couples who have made a formal legal commitment to each other – is what sparked gay rights’ groups to ask legislators to amend the law.   
In Switzerland it is estimated that there are several thousand children growing up in homes headed by same-sex couples.       
and also:          Sooo..ostensibly, one half of a gay couple adopts a child from, say, Ukraine, brings the child back to Switzerland, whereby the other half then formally adopts the child making the union and parenthood legit for everyone?   
Sounds like a lot of paperwork.  Which is very....Swiss.     
			
			Adoption of a child in Ukraine, especially by a single(at least as it appears to be on the territory of Ukraine =)) male is already a lot of paperwork and not limited to paperwork itself, so legalizing such parental rights in Switzerland after achieved them in Ukraine will be just another bit of whole. And probably less than 1/3 of total.
		    Lot of paperwork... very Swiss??? You should really try and live in other countries and do the comparison yourself.   
Back to topic: Do you really think the law makers are that stupid? I won't tell you that I am a lawyer, but :   
- single may adopt abroad 
- gay partner may adopt partner's own child 
hence gay partner may NOT adopt adopted child abroad.   
The key? The definition of ""partner's own child"". A lawyer would help us, hence not me.
		 
			
			becomes interesting... what is exactly the definition of ""partner's own child"" 
what if one have real own child with DNA test proved paternity and his name on birth certificate of the child?   
i'm aware that e.g. surrogacy is completely out of law in Switzerland and if any suspicion rise Swiss authorities may not grant a child to entry the country, but there were already precedents when such children were brought from Georgia for instance. And yes that was publicly criticized those days.
		    ""Partner's own child"": Parents are the ones who are legally registred as parents. DNA doesn't have anything to do with it from a legal perspective.   
Most important is really that now you can legally adopt your partners child. That covers most of the cases and is important, not for the parents but for the child. Adoption rights have to cover the childs need. Adopting is not a human right.   
Granting adoption rights to gay couples is not urgent. Most gay couples don't want children so the number of affected people is really low.    
In my opinion we should grant the rights to everyone who is able to afford and comfort a child. I guess this will take another 10 to 20 years in this country. But the whole thing is not as much of drama as some people want make you believe.
		          Yes, please don't explain. Just put a fu****** smiley.
		          Unless you have some insights into the gay or adoption community that you're hiding from all of us, or that entire post is missing a footnote, I have no idea how you can say that adoption isn't 'urgent' or that gay couples don't want kids.  I have a colleague who is actively looking for a transfer to Brussels because her IVF that her and her partner need (who she married to, but it's not recognized here) need isn't covered by their insurance because they are gay.  That's only one example (and it's very distressing for them, as you can imagine), but part of the huge push for gay marriage is exactly to be able to get adoption, fertility treatments, insurance and inheritace (all 'family' privelleges) recognized.  Waiting 10-20 years isn't really helpful, no matter how un-urgent you feel the situation is.
		    Because that was exactly the position of many gay organization in Switzerland during the process to legalize gay partnership. I myself only know gay couples who live with the child of their partner, all the others don't want kids. I just statet that MOST gay couples don't want children.      We are talking about adoption, not IVF.       As I mentioned before I would give all the rights to everyone right away. But we live in the real world. I don't know how long you followed the political discussions about this topic. Adoption was clearly excluded from the whole complex of gay partnership legalization because we have a strong conservative base here and would have risked to loose everything.   
With the stepchild adoptation an important step was done. In fact this was done for the benefit of the kids not the parents.    
If the whole thing was as dramatic the gay organization can try to setup a ""Volksabstimmung"". In the meantime it's pragmatism til society has changed to accept other forms of life. But as you have seen lately with the ""Kinderkrippen""-Initiative sometimes it's hard to convince the people from the german speaking conservative part of Switzerland (excluding the cities).
		    I actually have no idea, but I can imagine that they don't tell just anybody about it.  
Furthermore: the number of people concerned has nothing to do with rights and laws. One makes laws and give rights and define duties for everybody as a matter of principle, the number of people actually making use of the law is no concern of the law makers.
		    How it should be and the political reality are two pair of shoes. I wish it would be like you describe.
		 
			
			If your message above is to be understood as ""There are far too few votes for a politician to be gained so that they don't care"", then in deed, we totally agree. The perceived disagreement must be just a misunderstanding, no?
		    No, there are many politician who care about these rights. But in the process of legislation you will have to fight the opposition. First in the parliament and then probably amongst the eligible voters. You will go for what is possible and realistic in the moment. Stepchild adoption was not an alternative a few years ago, now it is and the law was set to cover it; pragmatism.
		    AFAIK, basic insurance here doesn't cover IVF regardless of whether you're gay or straight. Some of the add-on insurances might. I would think that's true in other countries as well, as IVF is considered optional and not medically necessary treatment. Would the insurance companies pay for IVF treatments for a single woman, no partner of either gender, if she wanted to conceive on her own? Again I don't think so.   
But back to adoption, which is what this thread is about. I see no problem with a gay couple adopting, provided they meet all the same legal requirements as a straight couple.   
@ prof - Are you sure that DNA doesn't enter into the equation? In the case of a separation of any couple that adopted, I can see the courts favoring the biological parent rather than the adoptive parent (again, regardless of whether it was a same-sex couple or not).
		    Yes, for custody/parental care.When you separate you are still a legal parent.
		    To clarify:  One had uterine cancer and had her eggs frozen and that's what they want to use for the treatment.  But getting her partner pregnant with them is being refused on the gounds that they are gay.  Yes, it's not medically necessary, but getting pregnant isn't a 'right' either.  My neighbour is a single mom who decided to go at it alone and her IUI was covered with donor sperm.        Can you send me links?
		 
			
			I've got a problem with all this stuff.   
I don't necessarily want to adopt a gay. I don't have any space for pets either.
		    Straight people don't need to adopt gays... they   gay children.
		    Are you quite sure about that? I mean, you sound so certain?
		    Can't find it as that was about ten years ago on Pink Cross and the archive is younger.
		 
			
			Who remembers the referendum debates? Wasn't there something about having to treat legally the partnership law and the family law separately in the first place? Or was it just about reducing the risk of the counter-initiative to be accepted?  
I don't remember.
		 
			
			Great news to me.
		 
			
			Just wanted to throw this opinion into the mix. One could argue that if a homosexual couple want to live their lives together, then they're obviously making a conscious decision that there aren't going to be any kids. Gay adoption might be considered ""over equality"". Gay marriage doesn't have to mean gay adoption.   
Discuss.
		    You logic is faulty because you can apply your premise to a heterosexual couple where both members are sterile.
		    Yes, but that's either an unfortunate medical situation, or out of choice. The subject is whether gay couples are legally allowed to adopt children.
		    In that case I guess the question is ""Why not?"" where the answer doesn't involve century-old fairy tales. Basically, what's the pretext for keeping the kids they wouldn't be allowed to adopt orphans? Would that be a better overall result for the world?
		    Yes, but you need a sperm and an egg to produce a child. Couples of the same sex can ""never"" do this. So the premise is should they be allowed to try and live as ""heterosexuals by proxy"" by adopting?
		    The final result remains a destiny dictated by nature, such as two heterosexuals whose reproductive systems didn't form in the correct way to allow them to have kids. If two people are a legal civil couple and are emotionally and pragmatically prepared for parenthood, who are we to tell them that they should have been content with their lot and keep that right away from them? Would you go to an orphanage, look those kids in the eyes, and tell them that fewer of them than possible will end up in homes because we find the idea of two mothers or two fathers icky and didn't give them a shot. It's not like straight couples always do such a bang-up job.
		     What rights? By joining into a homosexual union they gave up the ""right"" to reproduce naturally. The point is should they be allowed to adopt children after giving up this right and try to live as heterosexuals? And where do you get all this icky stuff?....that's in your own head! This is not an emotional issue for me, I'm just stating the facts as I see them. I never stated whether I agree or disagree with it.
		    Thankfully, one of the perks of adoption is that it allows people to become parents without having created the child through natural means. And to give an orphaned child a home. The screening process for a couple to adopt a child goes far beyond whether they're physically able to have kids or not, it's not the end all be all.
		    Giving up the right???   
It is not like someone choose to be gay. You are or you are not. You are born this way. So why should a gay woman have to marry a man to be able to have a child and make everyone miserable for not living an happy and healthy life by being honest and complete with herself?    
Why should it be a choice? Why being forced to marry someone you are not attracted to for the desire to be a parent? Why renouncing to an happy and healthy relationship with someone you love and are attracted to because there is only one way to have a child?    
Same sex couple shouldn't be forced to renounce of the joy to have kids if this is what they want.    
The first time I met a friend of mine in Switzerland who also met my daughter, I could see how great he was with her. I asked him if he had kids or if he wanted to have some, he told me he was gay. My answer was so what?    
Your sexual attraction to one or the other sex shouldn't be an obstacle to parenthood.
		     I'm not making a choice for anyone; however, if you want to put it that way, you are making a choice for them as well. IMHO, adoptive children have a right to a mother and father. Unfortunately, they have no say in the matter and who will make the choice for them? This is opening up a can of worms which I have decided to close.
		     Look, I understand the political correctness stance so I am not going to carry on with this issue. I won't get into the whole thing of whether they ""chose to be homosexual"" or not and this is not what this thread is about anyways. So I will stay out of it because I can see where this is going. Answering  ...is the easy way out.   is not an answer it is an excuse. It's as if nothing we do has any consequence. Your child gets in a bad fight, do you think  ? Carry on...I'm out! Well, not in that way...LOL
		    So what?    
So what if you are gay? It doesn't make you less capable to love and raise a child.
		 
			
			Actually, I do have some worries about gay child adoption- not because I have a problem with gays being able to be the most loving and best parents- but because of other people's attitudes. It's hard enough being an adoptee- without having to fight the battles of the adoptive parents against prejudiced and nasty people. And yet - I also think that loving parents must be a much better alternative to a life in social care. I have mixed feelings but not at all because of all this c*a* about the bits and bolts of heterosexual biology!
		    You could say the same of interracial/interfaith marriages, mixed race adoptions, and a thousand other things....avoiding doing a good thing because you're worried about inflaming bigots is a terrible reason imho.
		    Disagree.   
For some at least, it's certainly a choice.   
Tom
		    Fair enough as far as personal opinion is concerned, but countries in which singles can adopt alone have a different juridical understanding of parenthood and they have the last word as far as law is concerned on their territory. Changing the law in such countries means voting for the parties that want such a change. In the waiting time, the law stands as it is in such countries and that is worth respecting too, as said countries are not exactly antidemocratic hells.
		    Cool. And?
		    I am not worried about inflaming bigots - they can burn in hell as far as I am concerned - but I am concerned about the possible effect on the children. 
But yes, on balance, I am leaning your way.
		    Explain?
		    Perhaps, for some at least, to engage in homosexuality activities is a choice. But the love I have for my partner, and the attraction I have felt towards the same-sex since I can remember, is not. I have nothing to prove, but I wait for the day when a scientific study, something like homosexuality developing epigenetically, leaves all of this ""choice"" business in the past.     
As for the article, I was stunned when I originally found out a gay couple in Switzerland could not adopt, but could register their partnership. I am glad to see this is being reformed, for my future or not.
		 
			
			To me it's very simple. It all boils down to the question ""should all humans have the same rights?""   
Hell yes. I don't care whether the human in question is gay or straight, pink or blue, male or female.    
			
			Kid's need a home and to belong. Good people adopt/foster. I reckon it's on par with the luck of the draw where and to whom we are born.
		    Odile, here's a video from a few years ago (not directly relevant to the thread topic, but definitely relevant to your concern):       
			
			Yes, I remember this wonderful young man and his testimony. He seems hugely strong, confident, balanced and sensitive. Not sure however all children would be able to cope so well.   
We know 2 couples who adopted children from South America - and they all 4 say they were so naive to think love was enough to overcome all.
		 
			
			Us gay men can raise kids just the same as anyone else          I have adopted siblings from South America as well, and my parents were also somewhat naive in that way, so I am very aware of the potential challenges in this context. However, I think that these problems have more to do with past traumas, resilience and adaptation to changing family dynamics, than with the sexual orientation of the parents.   
Also, people who decide to go that route don't ""just"" adopt - they have to go through a stressful, sometimes long process of going through screening, having outsiders scrutinize their life choices, home visits, loads of paperwork and red tape, and lots of waiting. Anyways, I don't want to derail the thread. Just wanted to say that adoption can be hard work for anyone involved - gay or straight, young or old - but can also lead to happy endings.    
J.Marple perfectly summed up my feelings about the original topic, and it's great that some countries have a more open-minded view of a family unit.
		    I have known several people who have had long-term relationships (10)+ years with one sex, then long term with the other, then long term with the other, etc.   
Tom
		    Yes, it is called bisexual. Again, it is not a choice to have attraction to someone regardless of the sex. My friend didn't choose to fall in love with a girl or a guy, it just happened.
		    No, bisexual would be interest in both sexes at the same time, in these cases they were only interested in those of one sex at a time, it just changed from time to time.   
Tom
		     Bisexual has a more wide ranging definition than what you're limiting it to, but assuming we go with your point, what does this have to do with adoption.
		    No, bisexuality means having attraction for both gender in the same time. IT doesn't mean having a double relationship with both gender at the SAME time. One can happily have a fulfilling relationship with a man and when things breaks and relationship is over, one can find the love in someone of the same sex. It is not like someone is going out and look for it. Having an attraction for both sex just double the chance to find a partner regardless of the gender.
		    Who would CHOOSE to be gay?  Who would choose to have to come out to their parents and family (last I heard, straight people don't have to ""come out""), to be discriminated against, to be threatened with their life in certain countries and have to go serious legal gymnastics to adopt a child (moreseo than a hetero couple)?  Who chooses this??  You can't be one of the last remaining dinosaurs who seriously thinks someone wakes up one morning and goes, ""Hey!  Sun is shining and last night was a full moon.  Great time to be gay!  Can't wait to tell my mom!""
		    Not just that, bisexual people also have a hard time with people who think they can't make their mind or are playing, or seek attention, etc. many just don't understand someone who can be attracted to both gender. Many also believe one who is attracted to both gender has more chances to cheat because never fully happy with one gender.    
			
			A bisexual girl I know insists that us homosexuals/heterosexuals are less evolved.    
For me on the other hand there was never any question, I've only been attracted to same sex since I can remember. 
Now, I'm ready to believe that you may know people whose sexual preferences changed every time there was a new prime minister in the UK, but I don't understand what it has to do with my right to adopt (which I'm not interested to do anyway, but I happen to know many great people who would, correct: will, be great adoptive parents)
		    I know folks like this too, but it was largely an issue of societal pressure. They started in long-term heterosexual relationships, had kids, etc. because that was expected. As societal norms shifted, they felt okay to do what they always felt was right in their hearts, which was to have a same-sex relationship. I don't know any that went back to hetero after same-sex, but that's just my limited world view.
		 
			
			Well aren't we all just getting along great? Except that there is a difference people. I think we can all agree that heteros have the ability to create their own children and that Planet Earth will therefore be relying upon their continued breeding habits to sustain human life. That is the way humans have been created by nurturing a family scenario. Kids need a mom, not just for breast feeding at an early age, but also to share motherly instincts and the warmth only mom can give. They also need a father, lesser so than a mother, if you take a look at single parent families, but a father figure to be respected and loved as the traditional family figurehead (yeah, equality may happen one day).    
So where does this leave a gay couple seeking kids for adoption or fostering? Well, one mother or father short of a full house IMO. And before you all chant ""dinosaur"", I respect every single person's right to indulge in any kind of relationship they like, same sex, opposite sex or a mixture, I could care less. But adopting children as a gay couple? Nope, I'd vote against it.
		 
			
			Even if we go with your theory of a primordial necessity for a male and female presence in the household (which isn't really supported, and study after study shows that children from same-sex households, while facing challenges, end up just as adjusted as other children), you discount the presence of family members of various sexes in the immediate family. I mean, how many of us were basically raised by our grandmothers? You've moved the goalposts from basic biological capability to this and it's still full of holes. You're entitled to your opinion, of course, and we'll see how people decide to vote when the time comes.
		    No-one I know.   
Tom
		 
			
			Same-sex adoption is one of the few topics where I say ""sorry, but the issue is so complex and doesn't involve me so I choose to not voice an opinion"".    
I think one's sexuality is loose from one's ability to function as a good, caring parent and role model for a child. I'm sure there's some great closeted gay/bisex parents out there who go on to raise well balanced children.   
Are un-adopted children better off being raised in an orphanage as compared to being adopted by a same-sex couple? Probably not, and I'm not sure there are studies to substantiate/validate claims one way or the other.   
For now, I'm simply not knowledgeable enough in this matter to support and defend an opinion. I actually don't care enough to HAVE an opinion in this case.
		    The question is more or less irrelevant. Why?   
1. Because of the numbers: There are far more people willing to adopt   than children in orphanages.  The number of children given up for adoption lies around 30 a year in Switzerland. There is absolutely no pressure to expand the circle of people who can adopt.   
2. The same goes for International adoptation, still there are more people willing to adopt. Priority is to adopt local. Everybody still has the pictures in head of orphanages in the eastern part of Europe from th 80's and 90's. This has changed a lot as in this countries now you have a growing a middle class who is willing to adopt. International adoption is the last solution.  
Also with international adoption you will have to play by the rules of two countries. Even if you would be allowed to adopt in Switzerland as a gay couple you can't in most other countries.     
The ones left over in the orphanages are mostly older (10+) and/or have a medical or mental condition. They already come with a history.   
Other problems with international adoption brush child trafficking.
		    They have medical or mental conditions like the ones mentioned here?       
These guys adopted a few kids that nobody wanted to adopt because they had been marked as difficult. And one of them had a ""mental"" issue.  
A huge respect is the least they deserve.
		 
			
			Adoption is difficult under any circumstances.  If a gay couple wants to adopt and meets all the requirements, I'm all for it.  In a loving family, the child will feel secure and loved.  Unfortunately, it's the bigots (adults or children) that make the child feel insecure and freakish who have the greater negative effect on the child.
		    So - you don't believe in co-parenting?   
And for what it,s worth, we have an intern now who grew up with a single dad (mother died when she was 2) and she's just as kind and nurturing as anyone else.  My father worked in the mines up North and was gone for long stretches and and there was NO question in our house (my mum) who was boss, even when he came home!  My mother was raised by her oldest sister and barely knew her own parents.   
Families come in all sorts of shapes, sizes and formats.  Not everyone plays on traditional gender stereotypes when they parent and not everyone is suited to either.  You can read the AAPs statement on the issue of gay adoption here:     
If you want me to send you some of the studies they site, I can.  My favourite is the one about how kids of gay couples are more likely to be straight than kids of hetero couples.
		     Stop trying to reinvent the wheel please...         
			
			I feel sorry for the gay couples who will now have to fend off the  
""When are you having kids?"" 
questions that the childless hetros have face on a regular basis.   
""Don't you want them? They passed a law now for people like you.""
		    Are you sure that these pictures are in the past? Due to the recent law forbidding adoptions of Russian children by the US citizens the topic of the conditions in Russian orphanages and situation with adoption in Russia in general was actively discussed in Russian-speaking Internet earlier this year. And the details are shocking.    
As you remarked in your post the local families mostly want younger children (much younger than 10, in fact, because after 10 years in Russian* orphanage any child would have at least a mental trauma) and healthy. But as the children in orphanages are mostly born from alcohol and/or drugs addict parents, many of the children in orphanages have medical and mental conditions. Considering the attitude of the Russian society to handicapped and HIV-positive and very little (if any) help from the state to such families, raising a child with mental or medical conditions in Russia is heroism and an everyday fight with the system. So I can understand why local families are mostly not eager to adopt such children.   
* I used the word ""Russian"" for simplicity, but actually I mean not only Russia, but some other ex-USSR countries as well. The laws could be slightly different in these countries, but the general situation with adoptions and orphanages is rather similar.
		    Thanks very much for this idealization of the heterosexual family. The reality has been different for some time now... The gays don't have to be the scape goat of an evolution of heterosexual marriage, sexuality and procreation that they have nothing to do with.
		    It's an issue that affects, possibly, the whole of society, so it   involve you.   
I've a solution to missing either a mum or a dad - have two (gay) couples adopt. Two mums and two dads.    
I remember watching ""World's strictest parents"", where a gay couple took in a disruptive child. Really, it was only one of them that interacted with the girl. I've seldom seen such compassion and love as from that man. It totally changed my view on adoption by gay couples, so long as it done (as with heterosexual or single parent adoption) for the right reasons - the welfare of the child.   
I still maintain that best is mum and dad,   (and I think anyone arguing against that is spouting PC BS). But having one dad, or one mum, or two dads or two mums is far far better than having no parent at all.
		    Personal Computer Balance Sheet?       The name of this TV show looked interesting to me, so decided to learn more about it, and found out that the gay couple which you probably mean (Series 3 Episode 1) at that moment had 5 children (3 adopted and 2 fostered). Wow! No wonder that they know how to deal with children.       OK, let me re-phrase: it doesn't involve/affect me enough to care about.

			Nestlé, Credit Suisse and Google are the best companies to work for in Switzerland, according to a survey by Sweden's Universum Communications.             
			
			I know this is an old post, but what Nestlé's workplace safety record like in Switzerland?  The reason I ask is they (or a company they own) have been recently prosecuted for some fairly serious workplace safety violations US (fatality at a plant in MA), UK (fatality or serious injury involving a palleting machine, I forget) and France (fatality or serious injury, I forget) as well...
		 
			
			Workplace safety? What's that?   - 
Having worked both in the UK and Switzerland I have to say here it is only a vague concept; employees are supposed to look after themselves and are free to leave if they feel unsafe.    
This being said I know Nestle well and I can tell you they take safety very very seriously, far more than the Swiss average. Of course here companies are only very rarely prosecuted for safety issue, because the laws are done to protect the interests of the companies (which fund the main political parties except SP/PS and the Greens), but those of the people.
		    My brother's firm take work place safety very seriously. They even chain the fire extinguisher's to stop them being stolen.   i didn't believe him until he sent me this..          How dumb is this..... In case of a fire.   
			
			Yes, Nestle does take safety at heart, at least in Switzerland, as they review statistics, and there is a 0 accident approach. I know best the office environment, where the talk is walked - now the factories may be a different affair.  
As per quality workplace, yes, it is a good place to work, with a lot of opportunities... if you get them or not, would depend on how politically correct you are willing to be.       Exactly, makes the work place less safe if you can't extinguish a fire!
		 
			
			UK accident            
in both the above fatal accidents the Nestlé employees had failed to follow safety procedures. Nestlé was fined, but was the company guilty  responsible?
		 
			
			In this accident in the US at a Nestle subsidiary, some (or several) company officials should have been sent to prison for a couple decades...            These chains are specially made alloys which are stronger than steel but melts like butter when they encounter high heat. Hence they must be a good method to deter thieves.          Wonderful, so now I can access the extinguisher only AFTER it gets hot enough to melt metal?  IMHO, I'd be long gone and the place on its way to ashes before I'd try that...
		    Apologies for my feeble attempt at a sarcastic joke.       Psst..     I found it funny.   
Don't tell anyone else though.
		 
			
			I heard from a friend who worked at Nestle that you can't (as in its forbidden) to go up and down stairs without holding on to the rail!
		    There are a few posters reminding you it's safer to use the handrail when using stairs, that's all.  It's caring for your employees.
		    Well actually that is more or less the norm in most chemical companies...to prevent ""industrial accidents""    
			
			When I was working in the UK I once had to attend a 'training' on how to safely transport hot beverages around the office    
			
			In the UK I had to attend a glass safety course because I worked with a computer screen, and ""you have to know what to do if it breaks"".       This is standard safety protocol. The risk of falling down the stairs is drastically reduced when holding the railing. Costs involved with lost man-hours due to injury are in-turn reduced.    
When I worked at Nestle, an outsider might have found it quite odd, the level of safety and redundant safety rules and implementations, but they are a trivial cost compared to down time.   
When us Six-Sigma nerds were reinventing the plant into a 'world class manufacturing facility'. There was a ton of resistance. I remember the 'no-jewelry debate with many refusing to remove wedding rings. One picture of a ring-related injury and there were no more complaints.
		 
			
			Its not just a few posters for the handrail. I was visiting Nestlé recently and told in no uncertain terms to hold on to the handrail whilst going down the stairs.
		 
			
			Nestlé  -  nanny for its employees but doesn't really care about the wildlife killed in Indonesia for its palm oil!
		    Not hiring stupid people should drastically reduce accidents as well. Seriously, I would never work for a company that treats me like a little kid.
		    Ideally yes, unfortunately a good majority of the people in the world are stupid. One must only look at the sheer number of people in emergency wards with sprained ankles or breaks from falling. Most cases, if working, is a case where money is being spent and reduced work-productivity is being received.    
I wouldn't call it treating works as children as much as educating them for safe practices and accident prevention and reduction. In a factory setting, one can never be sure of what might accidentally be on the surface of the stairs (or ones shoes). Even with the mandatory use of steel-toed/slip resistance footware even people on the far opposite of 'stupid' miss a stair in the odd occasion.    
It's not a big deal once you being. I now hold rails instinctively whenever I'm traveling in the vertical direction. It has been beneficial on numerous occasions, namely in Zurich HB, when the stairs or escalator is a bit wet, it can be extremely slippery.
		    Looks like the Greenpeace Kit Kat campaign worked and Nestlé have committed to stop using products that come from rainforest destruction.       
			
			Would have expected Google to be first...
		    Yes they did fully three years ago.

			All Swiss train police will carry guns from October 1st after the Swiss Federal Railway (SBB) said it wants to take preventative action against an alleged increase in the willingness of passengers to use violence.         
			
			Looks like as of Jan 01/2013,  municipal administrative police (aka Police Locale) will be allowed to carry firearms on a case by case basis for defensive purposes where there is a demonstrated need and there is approval by both the Cantonal Police and the municipality.   
On a similar note, Police Locale en Fribourg will be permitted to enforce some moving traffic violations.           
			
			Hmm..firing a gun in an enclosed train carriage with lots of passengers in it. Great idea.   
Cheers, 
Nick
		 
			
			I read this title, and the first thing I thought was that the Swiss police have been carrying guns all this time without any training...  Gotta love The Local.
		 
			
			Should stop all the whining threads about being   for not having a (valid) ticket.
		    You're too optimistic.
		 
			
			What's the big deal.  Police in other countries (including transit cops) have all been carrying guns for years.  Also, After 09-11, there's a good chance that your flight crew is packing as well...
		    Its because they have guns.  Anytime you bring a gun to the conversation, the pucker factor goes up...
		    If you fire a gun in a plane there is a good chance of bringing the plane down ! How will that help the other passengers ?
		 
			
			How do they define violence in Switzerland?    
Did someone throw a paper clip?
		     
they have  low load low velocity rounds, enough to take out a would be assailant but not enough to puncture the fuselage
		     
arming of ticket inspectors reminds me of this...          The fuselage is already ""punctured"" in about a zillion places.  Airplanes aren't even close to being air tight.  A pressurized plane simply pumps air into the pressure vessel faster than it's leaking out.  shooting a hole in an airplane won't cause it to crash.  Shooting a hole in a pilot might, which is why they are locked in the cockpit and authorized to carry firearms at their discretion (depending on the country).
		    It'd never happen in Britain, would it?        Depends if you look foreign enough and when chased by a dozen cops with firearms telling you to stop you keep running.
		    This is more than a year old!    
Tom
		    Almost true, myth busters proved that you can shoot holes in a pressurized aircraft and nothing happens. 
What they did not do however was to shoot holes in a aircraft traveling at just under the speed of sound or over, hit in the wrong place from inside out the slipstream can peel the skin back like a banana, theoretically.
		    very true but the rivets and assembly process create an airtight seal, the drains and other vents also have restrictors to minimise air loss.    
the pressure is controlled by the outflow valves allowing less out than that getting forced in.    
if someone takes a window out whilst playing wild bill  hickok there will be an explosive decompression which isnt pretty.   
dumping even just a few PSI at ground level forms fog in the cabin and severe ear popping.   
most airlines have security staff onboard anyway, some are armed some are not.
		    You're preachin' to the choir my friend        
99.9% of the choir here cant sing....     
			
			You guys now Jamie and Adam? Known for blowing things up and busting myths.    involving an airplane, a window, and a gun.          I understand what you're saying, but in reality, most airplanes aren't going just under the speed of sound.  Mach .7 is in the ballpark for most jets, and even the fast ones like the 747 or Cessna's Citation X are running quite a bit slower than their maximum capability (mach .92-ish) for a significant portion of each flight.     
I guess that this is a sore point for me because I've spent most of my life in the aerospace business in one way or another, and it bugs me when I see things portrayed in the cinema, TV or by the ""news"" that is flat out wrong. This happens a lot, by the way.    
p.s. I love myth busters, by the way.
		 
			
			seen a loooong time ago,   the gun test was flawed, they should have fired at different angles to see differing results.   
i dont believe  the pressure reading shown as being the cabin pressure either
		 
			
			The angle issue is what got me thinking, also depending on the round you may get distortion that either makes a bigger hole than the round itself or you could get a shot gun effect if the round has passed through something else before hitting the skin. 
As you know that with most aircraft that fly at a subsequent portion of the speed of sound some parts of the plane actually are exposed to a supersonic airflow. Don't want to be on on board if something fails there.   
Then again it is just my theory, planes seem to be tougher than Hollywood would like us to believe, however does anybody remember the Boeing 737 Cabriolet?     
This is the reason that older 737's are reinforced around the section behind the cockpit.
		    They're not being trained to use them. They're being trained to carry them.        In Britain the whole train system would grind to a standstill due to the wrong type of bullets.
		     
it seems they used enough...          Since the topic was along the same lines (SBB Police becoming armed and ""some"" local administrative police in Kt.  becoming armed), I didn't want to start a new thread.   
I think I forgot to mention Fribourg in the first post...

Sufi's are the heretics of Islam and don't really qualify as Muslim. It might be a regional thing, but my father spent his early childhood in a christian evangelical town in Iran and there were Christian Sufis there too. He later met Jewish Sufis when he was an adult, but i'm guessing this is similar to the ""Jews for Jesus"" groups-- hybrid fringe religious groups.

			A 28-year-old man, known only as Daniel H, goes on trial next week for the murder in 2009 of the 16-year-old au-pair, Lucie Trezzini.             
			
			You know, I kind of saw this conclusion coming, but if luring a sixteen year old girl into an apartment and then sexually attacking her before killing her doesn't get you a genuine life sentence in Switzerland, what sort of added twist do you need to enhance the crime with to really get life? All irony aside, this was as about as bad a crime as one can commit, the twenty year sentence will possibly mean a fifteen year stretch. Anyone care to put a microphone in front of the Trezzini family members and ask them how they feel when the guilty party is released back into society?   
Shakes head and wonders if I'm on the right planet. Sickening for anyone with kids or just their hearts in the right place.
		 
			
			I remember seeing the missing posters around Baden, and the utter shock when her body was found. 
I hope he does get locked away for life, surely no court could give him less. 
Hopefully the other inmates will make sure he regrets the moment he decided to murder this poor girl so that he could go back to prison. 
My heart goes out to her family.
		 
			
			Well he got 20 years        
			
			Remember Werner Ferrari?  He got a lifetime sentence but he murdered five children.     
Let's hope that when Daniel's parole comes up, there'll be a public outcry and he'll be kept in prison or given a lobotomy.         
			
			Read about the sentencing Thursday and for once was relieved that the verdict was life, meaning life as much as Swiss law allows.   
Justice is relative, much as there is no good,or bad, just perception, but this sentence at least brings some kind of perspective into this slaying. Lucie, a beautiful young girl, never had the chance to shine as a woman and that remains a tragedy at the center of this horrific crime.
		 
			
			One article said his reasoning for killing Lucie was to get himself back to prison.   
He obviously had it too good in jail the first time.
		 
			
			Following his reasoning, he might ""want to go back to prison"" after 20 years in jail by killing again another innocent person?    
The Swiss Criminal justice system is a fail, they are sooo strict on people regarding really stupid things like parking but to properly judge a murderer is a total fail.

			The Swiss government has decided separated parents should automatically have joint custody of their children except in cases involving the specific protection of the child.             
			
			Does anyone know when this change is to be passed and made law? The article only states that they want to do it, it does not say when it becomes the law of the land.
		         
No idea if implemented.
		    Link to my post responding to this query in a separate thread:       
			
			I agree it should be allowed, from birth i helped raise 3 children and 3 grand children the only thing i could not do was breast feed the babies, but watch over them, change nappies, bath, creams, burp, everything, and guess what?...i am not alone,many men do this. 
put them to sleep, read stories, wake them bath them take them to school gfo watch them participate in whatever.....
		 
			
			I think the word ""custody"" is a bit misleading.  They don't use that in the UK anymore.     
My daughters father and I have joint ""parental responsibility"", but, she lives with me but he has access rights. This has it's good and bad points.   We weren't married, however, for him to have joint parental responsibility, I had to name him on the birth certificate.   
I have to seek his permission if I wish to change jurisdiction for instance, and I had to get his permission to live here.       
So, that is probably what they want to achieve here.   
He likes to have equal rights, but also doesn't cough up a bean to cover his part of his ""parental responsibility"" hey ho....another story.  My daughter has a Daddy that's interested and see's her on a regular basis that's the most important thing.
		    Thats what it is, if he cant afford his parenting responsibilties, in monetary value, thats another case but access to the kids should never be denied, unless the kids life is at danger when alone with either of the parent  then under supervision of another adult.
		    ...another brilliant idea...   
			
			One step closer to becoming law and being applied retroactively.             
			
			They do this in England now too, my sister has just been through court in order to get 4 extra hours so she can call herself the ""main carer"" important when it comes to health care visitors, school etc etc. In theory its a nice idea, the child gets equal time with both parents. In reality though its not so great (at least in my sisters experience).   
I think this can work if the parents get on and they live close to each other. However where the break up has been bad and left a lot of scars (as in my sisters case) what has happened is that there is no consistency in parenting (approach to potty training, bed times, disapline) my sister finds it hard to get my nephew into a routine as the dad does not work (well done uk benefits) and so lets little one stay up late and sleep in.   
Even though the split is essentially 50/50 its done on nights whoever has the extra night can claim child benefits and support from the other parent (at least in the UK), for school which ever parent has the most week days gets to choose the school placement (not always the one with the extra night).   
It prevents either parent being free to accept job options, move to new areas etc and little one is having a really hard time being shoved piller to post and has no sense of home or stability.   
Thats our experience anyway. I've read on net mums some good ones, all I know is its rare it works (lots of studies done to show its detrimental to the child) and it only ususally works if its a choice by the parents, if its enforced it generally does more harm then good.

			A trader at Swiss bank UBS pleaded not guilty on Monday to losing $2.25 billion in fraudulent trades in London, clearing the way for a trial later this year.               
Kweku Adoboli, 32, of Whitechapel, east London, exceeded his trading  limits at UBS in a bid to get a bigger bonus and boost his ego, the  court was told. 
         He denies two charges each of false accounting and fraud between October 2008 and last September. 
         His actions saw the Swiss bank's share price fall 10%, around £2.8bn ($4.5bn), and also threatened their existence. 
         Opening its case, the prosecution said Kweku Adoboli exceeded  his trading limits and invented fictitious deals to cover his tracks.        "	1	UBS trader pleads not guilty to 'rogue trading'	2008

			Hollywood superstar George Clooney is returning to Geneva this summer to  raise money from wealthy American expats for Barack Obama's  presidential re-election campaign.             
			
			Yes please.
		 
			
			I'd go but he doesn't like meeting up with his ex-girlfriends.
		 
			
			Hmmmm... 1000 for a reception and 20000 for a dinner. Nobody is worth that much.    
Now, if they throw in a locker room pass for an All Blacks game i would reconsider
		 
			
			At the very first glance, I read ""clown to visit...."" 
oh well..   
			
			My invitation seems to have gotten lost in the Post...because all expats are wealthy, right?       First dibs on your invite             Arh.....it is Friday after all !
		 
			
			Is it just me or he seems to be saying ""Shut up!"" to the first gentleman?     I think it's just me          how could GC resist?  seems like a crime in and of itself!!! but then again, there is that whole Canadian thing       What's the point? By the time August comes, with all the US / Swiss tatart unfolding, no poor Ameriacn will be allowed to be in possession of a bank account to pay the entry fee!
		 
			
			I can sleep with him for free ya know?
		    Not his type....damaged goods      that's why he has a villa in Como I guess
		 
			
			Yayyy there's a thread on this!    
I'm actually coming over from Atlanta to go to the event.  I'm a volunteer fundriaser for the campaign (nothing official. I actually just do this for fun!).    
I'd LOVE to help any interested US Citizens get tickets (also would love to meet up with anybody who will be there and is interested-- I'll be traveling solo. Used miles to book my plane ticket on a whim b/c I LOVE Switzerland, and it's George Clooney!).     
Anyway, a few people said they wanted invites (and I'm guessing there are more on here who may).  Here's a link to be able to get a ticket (you must be a US Citizen to buy a ticket):     https://my.barackobama.com/GenevaAug...ustom1=3123320    
If anybody has any questions about the event let me know.  If I don't know the answer I can get it for you.     
			
			Weren't tickets like 15K a piece?
		 
			
			The dinner is but there are two events that day.  The reception is only $1k US... Here's a bit more on the options for you!     
The first receptions reception at a hot location in the center of Geneva (they aren't making the location public quite yet, but I have the inside scoop and it's a super cool spot!). There will be about 150 people there, George Clooney will speak, the event is going to be very intimate and the company is going to be incredible. (This is the $1,000/person option)   
At this reception there is also going to be a photo reception where you'll be able to get a great photo of you and George. (You need to purchase the ""photo reception"" ticket to get into this. The photo reception ticket includes the main reception) (This is the $5,000/person option)     
The second event is going to be much smaller. It is a dinner with George Clooney at a private residence in Geneva. (If you buy the tickets to the dinner you also get into the larger reception and will also get your photo with George).  This is what you heard is $15,000/person.
		 
			
			Haha I say the company is going to be incredible because I'll be at the reception  . And I'm assuming people who will be there will be super cool!
		 
			
			George sold out eh?...Bound to eventually happen I guess, even to the best of them
		    Haha, well he was hosting events for Obama in '08 too, so it didn't JUST happen...    
			
			I bet he will also be shooting a new Nespresso commercial while in Switzerland.   
Can I come in my Romney t-shirt ?
		     
HAHAHA! Welllll from what I understand they were considering either a 'business' or 'cocktail' attire dresscode, but I'd bet if you donate enough to get a ticket that they won't turn you away  , even in a Romney t-shirt (you may want to wear it under a dress shirt, just to be safe though. haha).  Here, try it and let me know how it goes  ):  https://my.barackobama.com/GenevaAug...ustom1=3123320       So did Matt Damon but it didn't take 4 years for him to figure out it was all a rouse       Yeah yeah, can't please everyone (and not all movie stars stay perfect forever  ).     
Just thought of something.  If anybody who DOES want to go to the event wants an email with all of the details and the 'official' pretty invite in it so you don't have to find the link in this thread when you're ready to get your tix, you can put your email address in at my website and it will email one right back to you:      
It will have all my contact info too so we don't have to have public convos if you have any questions.           
			
			Great to see the world's greatest democracy needs to raise funds in the most undemocratic ""the more you pay, the better your fellow fundraiser's social status"". George Washington probably had something else in mind back in 1776.
		    It's not ""the"" democracy raising funds, it's a politician trying to get re-elected ;-)   
As for Washington, I bet he had to use a little persuasive power as well to be elected head of the colonial army.
		    I realize that, but it's more than a little obscene that the amounts of money required by any US candidate would feed any small African nation for well for a year. The capital wasted (in my mind) on greasing the old wheels of electoral power in the USA is not the icon I'd associate with a great democracy. Buying your votes takes on a whole new meaning in the USA.
		 
			
			If I could just touch the hem of his garment, I would be made Holy too...       
			
			I watched Ocean's 12 last night.  Does that count for anything?
		    I guess it works as far as how much I fancy him.
		    My friend fell asleep in the cinema when we went to watch that.
		 
			
			Blimey - got to admire GC's dedication.  
Suffering an evening of rich ex-pats gibbering inane shite at him. That's one diary appointment of his I don't envy.    
			
			Just wanted to give everyone a heads up-- tickets are selling pretty quickly now that we're into August and only a couple weeks off from the event. If you want to come, I'd get tickets soon before they're all gone.  ~ Nicole          Hey, this is great timing actually, because all the Swiss banks are   because of the US foreign policy on banking. I guess all US citizens can just transfer whatever money is left in their bank accounts directly to the politicians who made the laws. Then you don't have to worry about finding a bank who will accept you, AND you get a free dinner and picture out of the deal as well, SWEET    
			
			My better half tells me how much she likes Clooney, because there's something tender about him...   
At $15k a photo op, I realise she meant legal tender...
		    The worlds greatest democracy is one interpretation, given they are more into telling the world and its own people how to run their lifes its more like a dictatorship then a democracy now.
		 
			
			I wonder if he'll do another Rolex commercial while he's here.       $5k for a photo op at the reception -- the $15k is for the private dinner.   And there's a $1k entry point too if you don't need a pic.
		     
Meanwhile, back in the real world...
		 
			
			maybe my judgement is wrong, but didn't under recent US govt the laws for US expats got more tight? banks cancelling their accounts, no help with double taxation... anybody having 15k for dinner with some movie guy I consider rich, and many of these people are here also because of taxes.  
Well maybe it's just me, but I see no point in raising self-confidence or need to feel important to be seen around/have photo with somebody well known. 
(don't take me wrong, I like this guy and most of his movies, just don't get the fuss around it, or need to contribute to dirty politics, no matter who appears to steer the wheel)
		    Yup, your understanding is wrong. Recent changes had to do with foreign financial institutions, not expats.
		    Oh, only $5K if I need a pic - that's good.  But why oh why would I need a pic with George Clooney?  And if I did, all you really need is a photoshop job done...how much is that software these days?   
He does seem like a swell guy, though       I don't know why they want to give me 5k to have a picture with him, I can do a lot more to him for free....       
			
			This year my 5K goes to my accountant and tax advisor, in order to keep compliant with FATCA, FBAR and all the other headaches of being an American resident overseas.   
So sorry, I won't be spending that money on a photo opportunity.    
If the campaign is soliciting support from Americans expats, why are they silent on the issue that is of utmost concern for many of us?
		    And if you read Isaacbrocksociety.ca, they (Obama campaign) recently closed down nearly all dialoge with americans abroad.    
AmericansabroadforObama.org website is gone   
Facebook page americansabroadforObama is shut down   
And a Americans Abroad for Obama twitter page technically still exists but doesn't really allow for a dialog, and what was re-posted from there was getting quite ugly.

			Swiss police have issued an international arrest warrant for Shivan Mohamed, a 21-year-old Iraqi thought to have stabbed two brothers in Zurich on Sunday morning.         
			
			Where to start?   
If you carry a knife you are of course looking for trouble. If you have it you will use it if the situation is presented.   
maybe self defence that got out of control?   
Why did he feel the need to carry one in the first place? Possibly being targeted by some one?   
That artical is the first Ive seen of this incident. Feel so sorry for both families!
		    Please use the politically correct term and refer to them as African Americans.
		    Nice to see that the EF has kept its sense of humour even though one man died and the other is still in hospital.
		    This is Switzerland, pretty much EVERYBODY carries a knife!    
Tom
		    Exactly since it became obvious that he acted in self-defence they got into action. Because it became apparent that the chap most likely is in panic. And so it is urgent to stop him before he does something even worse.
		     Iraq in africa      The two brothers are from Kosovo.
		     Non white,non swiss,non christien,non odisiem ,non european,non blond      now you've got me interested.   
I had to google it.          If they think he's innocent, they wouldn't issue an arrest warrant though? They would issue an appeal for him to come forward.
		      We're terribly sorry, but you've both failed humor 101. Please feel free to enroll again in the next term.   
Signed 
The Director of Academics 
Clown College      Acting in self defense does not necessarily make him innocent. As I understand it, he could still be held responsible for the man's death.
		 
			
			At least the Swiss reporting on this incident has been true to form - every article I've read so far has managed to deal with the nationality of both victim and offender by the end of the second sentence.
		    Oh goody. This again.   
They do that with the Swiss, too - it just doesn't get the expat community up in arms the same way.       They do it in Canada too and no one gets his knickers in a twist.
		    But they didn't mention race, skin colour, religion, political affiliation or sexual orientation.     
Imagin the outcrz if thez had said   
""Transexual black Mormon Iraqui SVP member stabs two members of Kosovo's Chinese minority (who were also Sikhs)""
		 
			
			No one said anything about being up in arms or about getting any knickers into a twist. I just don't see how it's relevant to the story as a whole.    
In the same way I don't see how it's relevant it is to have the suspect's life story plastered across the pages of Blick in direct comparison to the victim. We now know that an Iraqi Kurd (who hasn't yet been found guilty in court) was terrible in school and dropped out of an apprenticeship whilst his Kosovan victim's dream was to one day become Swiss. Nice work.
		 
			
			Ok yes.. Swiss carry knifes. . . duh    
One night in a pub in Basel the cigarettes promotion people were in... we got a flick knife type thing from them.    
Couldnt believe it!! Hello drunken fool... heres a knife. Have a great night    
When i say ""Drunken Fool""... of course i dont mean myself       I suppose you could argue that cigarettes kill more people than knives, so maybe you should ask why the knife distributors are also selling cigarettes.
		    I was shocked by this crime and didn't understand the dynamics of the situation ... my German is not good enough to follow all the details in the news.   
Did they pick up a fight at the disco or was it something more premeditated coming from a past quarrel? In any case I would be very interested to see how they prevent better this kind of situations. It is a clear security flaw that a guy enters to a disco hiding a knife. Making the security staff liable for such crimes might improve the situation as they will care more to prevent this.   
I feel extremely sorry for the two families too.
		 
			
			Here we go... It's all kicking off in CH...    
Next up; Gun Crime and ASBO's!    
			
			Are cigarettes now offensive weapons?   
Stand back or I light this and raise your chances of developing cancer due to secondary smoke in about 20 years time!   
Any assailant would just <automoderated> their pants and run away.   
Cheers, 
Nick         
			
			Well, personally id prefer to be attacked with a smoke rather than a knife!!       Not workable and no one would ever sign up to do the job if that were the case. Anyway, why should the doorman be liable for someone else carrying a knife and using it?    
However, if the security team were trained better they would have put one of the parties from the fight inside out onto the street not both of them. I understand that they go for the cheap option for security rather than using proper professionals. Bad move Kaufleuten, reputation is everything.
		     
Hm im not so sure. the bouncers in my home town are great.. Search peope, can read the crowd... Brill.    
Problem is, there are guys who come to the nightclubs but before arriving... and this is the honest truth... hide weapons behind walls, in hedges... So when it kicks off and they are thrown outside they are prepared!   
ASKING FOR TROUBLE!!
		    If they werent thrown outside together then the problem would have been avoided altogether.
		 
			
			Absolutely not!! For example. . .  we have one night club that has two places to exit from. if you stand at the cornor you can see where the other person comes out.    
If the other person is not thrown out then the one who was just waits! They can wait accross the street if they cant wait beside the nightclub theres no hassel. The buncers cant stop them! And the police cant do much if he isnt ""drunk and disorderly"" ... or creating any trouble. Plus... well they are busy.    
Also i have seen many many times people hiding in alllyways waiting for the other person. Although thats a little off topic.
		    - 
Sorry, I usually carry two or three and sometimes even four pocket knifes and NEVER look for trouble. And never was targetted up to now. Would I use one of the knifes in self-defence ?  Possibly yes. And while against violence, if defending myself, I would have no hesitations.          - 
and so are European Europeans  (so sorry, ""were"" in one case)        - 
This is general norm and has been so for a while now. If you now want to convert it into an Arab-European or a Semitic-IndoEuropean thing, go ahead      - 
äehmmm,  of course not     but with the knife you could open a bottle or cut open a package of food      - 
but you cannot open bottles or tins or open letters or packages or cut a Cervelat for grilling with a cigarette     
			
			OK, if your going camping fine. No problem.   
Should you carry a knife on a night out? NO. Why would you? Its stupid.  
Also, if you are going grocery shopping? Why carry a knife.    
Carrying a knife can put other peoples lifes in danger. Im not saying YOU are putting others in danger... but a simple row in the street could turn fatal very quick.   
Knife crime is on the up... carrying a knife on the streets is daft.
		    To open a bottle of beer or wine, for example.  Also, it contains a toothpick, very useful after dinner.  Also, if you go to a festa, and want something better than the plastic crap they normally give out.   
Tom
		    And here I thought it was ..... something else.        Drink cans, Or use a lighter to open bottles, or use a bottle opener, use a key to open it, use a wall, buy a twisty top, ask for a tooth pick or use your nails... eat soup! There!! All your knife carrying problems sollved!
		     Or just carry a multipurpose tool that includes toothpick, tweezers, screwdrivers, corkscrew etc. - and a very useful sharp thingy that you can use for a variety of tasks from dead heading roses to whittling pieces of wood into amusing shapes. Apparently Victorinox make a load of them.   
Some knives are pretty much only useful as weapons - but most of them are not.   
Irrational prejudice against weapons and self defence is possibly one of the conditions that allows a growth of violence in certain sectors of society - alongside ridiculously soft treatment of criminals and a refusal to let anybody take responsibility for their actions.
		    FTFY!   
Tom 
..
		    You apparently are mistaken. I do NOT ""carry"" two or three knifes on a night out. I simply have them with me all day round, and do not see any reason to leave them at home.    
Grocery shopping ?  And what if you want to open a bottle or a tin etc ?  The pocket knife comes in very well indeed !    
No, a simple row on the street is not to turn out fatal very quick, but rather not at all. I started to have my pocket-knife with me back in about 1960 !  and nothing ever happened, and this in spite of me being a rather impulsive person   
""knife crime on the up"" ?  This may well be. Just as other crimes
		    Right, flying on commercial flights nowadays is like doing male skin strip, as you have to put the knife into the checked in luggage !         
Ok, camping you need to open a tin.. i get that. Walking around town you do not!   
I am not saying YOU would hurt someone. I am saying someone could get hurt. Every day you hear of people being stabbed- If fools see its ok to carry a knife they will alse carry one and why not?         
And who do you think you are Macgyver? What do you think will happen when your out buying Undies?
		    Indeed, until 11 years ago I always carried a Swiss knife and a Leatherman on me when flying, now I have to check them!    
Tom
		    You do if you want to pop into a shop and pick up something for a lunch in the park!   
Tom
		    Ok you know everything, the rest of us are idiots with homicidal tendencies who can't be trusted to act like responsible human beings and we must be protected from our mental incompetence. Thank you Mummy, can we wear long trousers today or should we go back to shorts?
		    I was thinking of this thread yesterday at the local playground where I had a tupperware box full of fruit and a pocket knife wrapped in some kitchen paper.  I tend not to cut fruit at home because in the hot weather it goes a bit manky by the time we want to eat it so I carry a knife to cut it or peel it when we need it.   
In the past I've also used the tweezers to remove splinters from my son's finger and the bottle opener for a cheeky beer (or 5) on a hot day by the lake with other parents.   
To date, after all this time, I can honestly say that carrying a pocket knife has never attracted trouble, nor have I stabbed anyone (although the local ""yoof"" with their enormous speakers-on-wheels might become a test subject for me...)       Someone could get hurt because you're driving a car, or because you turn your head and don't see the little old lady you walk into, or because you spilled your coke and someone slipped.   
Life is dangerous; why should your irrational fears govern other people's behaviors?
		     
Im glad you realise that    
I just belive people shouldnt carry knifes thats it! Simples! Switzerland is an unique country, poeple can get on the tram with a machine guns but thats a different conversation!!     
.... and NO SHORTS... your Knees are too Knobbly for public display! :P
		     
My knees are knocked, not knobbly.   
But you miss the point,along with lots of theoretical minded goody two shoes. A knife is not a weapon in and of itself.   
I grew up and lived in some pretty violent areas, if anybody was dumb enough to pull a knife as a weapon he'd better damn well know ho to use it - because he was likely to find the full length of the blade shoved where the sun don't normally shine. Knives have become a fad nowadays and there is reluctance to apply the right educational therapy to those who misuse them.   
Funnily enough - the report that started this debate is far from conclusive, but implied that the fugitive pulled his knife (probably not a Victorinox Picknicker) in self defence because the suspicion was that the two brothers intended beating him up.   
Maybe if he hadn't been armed he'd have been left with his brains spread over the pavement.   
Whatever the merits of the case, in my view a knife is a pretty useless weapon for self defence - for close work a Browning 9mm is much better and any thief, mugger, rapist and most murderers deserve about 9mm of sympathy delivered to the back of the head - then bill their families for the price of the round and cleaning of the weapon. And I am only being slightly jocular here.   
America might well have gone too far down the road of making arms available to the unsuitable / this side of the pond we're way too far in the opposite direction.
		 
			
			The sort of knives most people carry are tools not weapons. Yes, they can, like many objects, be used as a weapons. If we got rid of all objects that are potentialy weapons we wouldn't have much left. Why not cut off peoples hands while we are at it - just in case they clench a fist someday?    
As I've said in another thread our grandfathers likely had a penknife in their pocket as surely as they wore trousers. I use my knife pretty much every day. It helps me open letters boxes, cut food (an open those pesky birchermuesli packages where the selotape comes off suddenly and it spills on everything) and last week; reinsert a bicycle chains and shave (not on the same day, I cleaned off the oil)  because I saw in the mirror that I had't done a good job in my morning rush and was about to meet the Amtschef    
If you want to demonise knives that's merely your loss as long as you don't stigmatise others due to your own fear.
		 
			
			A pencil is a deadly weapon, well documented how to use it to kill. So is a rolled up newspaper if used in the right way (I can't do that trick). So is the palm of the hand - the first nasty trick punch most people get taught but not one to try.   
So please check your pencils, newspapers and palms at the door before going out in public.   
A belt can also be used as a deadly weapon so it would be an idea if we all stopped wearing tem - that way we'd be too busy holding our trousers up with our hands to do any damage!!!!!!!!!!
		    Ah, but you could still trip somebody from behind!
		    Good catch,   
Not so easy to do if you have your legs tied toegther with your belt though. From now on no pencils, definitely no newspapers (I googled that and it's far too dangerous - check out the Millwall Brick), palms of hands to be surgically removed or fitted with permanent foam and belts tied around ankles to limit movement of legs to a maximum of 35 cm.   
Glad we fixed that, the World's a much safer place - but how the heck am I going to get on my motorbike or drive a car?    
No need, that way road traffic accidents will also be prevented too you fool.   
This is where I shamble off into the distance, twitching spasmodically, chuckling insanely, mumbling to myself and sharpening my axe...................
		    It has started...
		    To carry your pocket knife(s) with you is basic. Without, you are naked    
To get on the tram with your semi-automatic gun was / is your duty, not just a right. But a right it of course is       
*************************       Is Mr Macgyver a citizen of Switzerland ?     
What does ""buying Undies"" mean ???  If it referes to pocket knifes do  not forget that every souvenir shop has them on offer !   And every  Swiss knows that the man next most likely also has one or two.  So what   
***     
Add to this that owning weapons is completely legal in Switzerland. I mean most weapons, as there ARE restrictions. And you in case of firearms and ammunition of course get registered---  and every purchase gets registered as well.   When going to do your ""duty-shooting"" (not in uniform, but fulfilling a military demand) you present your service-booklet and your shooting-booklet
		 
			
			Bit of common sense here knife fans.   
No one needs to be carrying a non foldable blade any more than about 2 inches.  No one is suggesting banning Swiss Army knives, they are suggesting banning what are essentially hunting weapons that will only be used during altercations.   
If you need a 7 inch blade to peel your apple at lunchtime, you're doing it wrong.
		     Don`t forget the meteors
		 
			
			common sense is only common because of the lack of it. I'm looking to find how to cance my membership of this band of head bangers
		    Common sense would have been to read the T&Cs before you signed up...
		    I'll try and keep this short...   
That's quite a span between 2 inches and 7. Most of my blades are around 3 inch and are regarded as gentleman's folders or EDC (every day carry) knives. In essence you may have a point even if your measures are way off.    
 My point was, that knives are tools not weapons. I add further that they are works of art and expressions of lifestyle. Is the question of need really the crux? Do people need a car larger than a Smart? Most don't really need one at all, at least in CH with the public transport system. Do people need high calorie and high fat foods? Do we need nuclear power plants and do we need to consume such massive amounts of power?  ... or maybe I should not restrict the argument to products that appear to cause harm directly ... do we need art or should we stop spending tax money on it? Do we need pets despite the costs, the trouble, the potential diseases? All of these could be restricted through legislation and it's not hard to see why doing so could make sense on a superficial level. Indeed there are enough folk out their who can be swayed by seemingly logical arguments taken out of context of our values and seen out of sync and connection, as opposed to systemically.   
In the face of real risks restrictions are, of course, absolutely necessary. But (any) freedoms should not be restricted flippantly. To legislate away part of our culture, which knives are, (I would even say they they connect us to ourselves and our humanity on several levels but doubt saying that will have the effect I desire) only appears acceptable (at his brief moment in time) because knives are increasingly demonised. That in itself is should be reason to second guess such seemingly sensible but inherently destructive measures.
		     There is not such as thing common sense content-wise, only things that seem obvious to ourselves and that we agree or don't agree on. The issues lie invariably deeper as would be the case here.
		    Willful ignorance.   
No one should or needs to carry a dangerous weapon on their person during their day to day business in public.  Guns, knives etc should be used at home or designated sport zones only.   
The difference between them and a car for example, is that they are designed to cause harm.  It is the difference between having golf clubs or a knuckle duster in the boot of your car.
		    The Knives of which I speak are not built as weapons. They are golf clubs and not knuckle dusters. You insist on seeing them seeing them that way and seem unwilling to discuss this despite my having pointed it out. Plainly you are hardly in the position to accuse me of confirmation bias. so do we discuss the issue at hand or shall we revert to name calling (however subtle)?
		    I always thought size didn't matter?        I am not sure to which style knives you are referring, a 3 inch blade is probably about the reasonable limit of carrying, but obviously at that length already have the potential to pierce the heart or a lung, etc.  I would make that the absolute maximum length.   
I'm from Scotland where carrying offensive weapons has been made a serious crime with a mandatory 6 month jail term / hefty fine.  This is in part due to the breakdown of society and the ubiquity of the feral and feckless youth on street corners, drinking and looking for aggro.   
This is where the European and American (which is more or less how this thread appears to be split) opinions differ.  I would say that it is a benefit to society to prevent the nastier elements of it from having access to lethal weapons, even if it means the responsible people don't have it either.   
You wouldn't sell average joe on the street a vat of smallpox, or a flamethrower, as they are blatantly designed as offensive weapons, and to my mind guns and shall we say, large knives, come into this category as well.  You can play Rambo in your own space, play normal member of a respectful society in our joint space.
		    When I travel by train, I often carry non-folding a knife with a 7"" blade (also made by Victorinox).    
And a cutting board, dried sausage, and a bottle of wine.    
Tom
		    If you cut it beforehand...      Frilly apron, too?       It's better if freshly cut.   
Same for cheeses.   
Tom
		    Surely the cheese needs time to breathe!  Won't someone think about the Chiltern?  (   )   
On this note, some people at work (the management who used a certain agency) got gifted a 'charcuterie box' with cheese and chorizo type stuff which also contained a 5 inch foldable knife for cutting it, incredible.   
Next year I hope they get me a selection of nuts with a sledgehammer.
		 
			
			There's nothing worse than someone cutting the cheese in a railway carriage...             I was once seated in front of a guy (in a train) who packed out what must have been at least 200g of Gruyere - and munched through it.  No bread.  No need for a knife...
		    No argument there (in principle and without splitting hairs i.e. getting side tracked over the agricultural use of flamethrowers. I think we agree on allowing hay forks barns).      I agree here on principle too, as long as you don't go calling anyone that makes you feel vaguely uncomfortable a Rambo i.e. as long as we are talking real dangers. ""Unjust rambo-isation of others"" is one thing I'm arguing against here.  I wouldn't use my 9 inch camp knife in the Stadtpark to cut bread & cheese because people might be unduly alarmed. But I'm glad I can do so with my utility folder without raising any eyebrows i.e. the tool is perceived as no more unusual than my laptop and I'm seen as a normal guy having lunch.    
It does appears we differ, in what we perceive as a dangerous. I'm glad you are talking ""large knives"" here and not just ""knives"".  There's probably little point in discussing in more detail which particular type and length of knife is acceptable. I've read up on the knife laws of several european countries because I visit these places. They differ greatly and even if one agrees with the premise they found upon, the logic behind what is and isn't seen as dangerous is highly debatable. Anyway, we'd probably end up pitching the kid with boy scout knife spending time whittling away out of doors and learning to use knives responsibly against the disorientated and troubled youth who wants slice up the guy who looked at his girlfriend.      This may well be the case and perhaps causes issues to be mixed. Some people are condoning banning carrying any kind of knife. Others would like to take their assault rifle to the local restaurant. Unless one clearly assigns each statement to each user (which I admittedly don't take the time to do) the more extreme positions can blur over the grays in-between. I cringe inwardly when I hear a redneck talking of his god-given right to carry guns, but I'm aware my position on knives can be perceived as of that category. Having said that this issue is not merely academic to me.
		    Ok, Rambo was for comic effect, but he is about the only person who really needs to carry a bowie knife, I'll let Crocodile Dundee off as well.   
There is obviously no harm in a Scout when properly supervised (as I was when I was in it) learning how to use a knife for whittling etc, and obviously he has to get it there and home in his parents' car, so I think that should obvioiusly be permissable.   
But from my personal viewpoint, we have to draw a line somewhere.  Transporting a knife in a car between A and B (and the same with a gun to be fair) is fine, however, there has to be a distinction between that and tooling up for your trip to the local supermarket/bar/club.     
The problem is, that when there is the potential for people to get overexcited (i.e. when they've had a drink), a lot of people make stupid decisions in the heat of the moment, and end up using that knife they have brought and that is ALWAYS going to lead to serious injury to themselves or someone else.   
In the 'good old' days, people got a bit drunk, got chucked out of the club, and had a scrap, which got separated by bouncers / public when someone was hurt - the price you had to pay for shooting your mouth to the wrong person.  Everything got settled in about 30 seconds to a minute and someone got a black eye and lost a bit of pride, not great, but not fatal.   
Two relatively evenly matched (and somewhat drink impaired) adults can certainly hurt each other quite badly with their fists, but what %age of drunken fist fights end up in a death/serious injury?  What %age of knife/gun fights end up in a death/serious injury?   
The issue is two fellas fighting each other with their hands is likely to last a few minutes, during which time there is a high liklihood that someone breaks it up before things get too serious.  With a gun/knife, a fight is over as soon as someone uses the weapon and the consequences are nearly always fatal.   
Essentially, if you take a gun or knife with you anywhere in public, you are increasing both your own and other people's chance of being killed.  I think that should be discouraged.
		    maybe we could formalise and legalise 30 second brawling to settle disputes. could be good for society!
		    As we say in Scotland:   
'a square go's a fair go'
		 
			
			Thank you StirB. You have managed to put into words what i could not.   
I realise i was like speaking to a wall.    
I do understand the point for carrying a swiss army knife but its the word knife that puts me off.    
For me when i hear knife i think weapon not letter opener. Ignorance on my side I know.   
I remember an incident that happened last year. Involving a friends 10yr old son..  
He was being badly bullied in school (swiss school). The parents spoke to the school and parents of the other children, the parents and school were of the opinion the children needed to sort it out amongst themselves as its all part of growing up.  
So the father walked the boy to and from school & lunch every day. Anyways, one evening at a concert by the school the boy was outside and the group of bullies decided to throw rocks at him.... he took a knife out of his pocket and threw it. Thankfully he just missed one of the other kids. . .  
So, that ended up in a brawl witht the parents and police called .. statements.. pressing charges.. etc- 
I asked him why he brought the knife to school, he told me it was for protection plus he always brings it!!
		    I wonder if that's entirely fair? I believe I tried to understand viewpoints that contradicted my own. Seems I didn't do a good job of communicating that though    
			
			One of the things that I find admirable about Switzerland is (what I see as) their approach to guns and knives. Thanks to compulsory military service, young men (frequently the instigators/victims of violence) are taught weaponcraft and thus view guns as deadly  to be used (for killing foe or doe) with respect and all appropriate due caution (and not as some sort of penis substitute/extension/macho enhancer).   
Likewise with knives, the Swiss regard them as tools and to be used appropriately. But in the UK (for one) knives have indeed become demonised.    Knife crime   a serious problem in the UK, but I doubt that Victorinox's finest Swiss Army knives make a significant contribution to knife crime in the Gorbals.     This is undoubtably what fuels the violence (regardless of weapon used). Something, fortunately, that Switzerland - so far - has managed to avoid. The reason such a stabbing makes the news in CH is because of its relative rarity.   
Ultimately it is down to being responsible for your own actions, whether you have a 12"" Sabatier in your hand, a sharpened pencil or an electric drill and unfortunately there are too many that aren't (nor, I would argue, are they being made to be responsible for their own actions).   
In Terry Pratchett's latest book ""Snuff"", the character Commander Vimes (a copper) muses on how anything can be turned into a lethal weapon given a little knowledge and a lot of determination. A very valid point, indeed (and the book is well worth a read).
		     
Nope, what i meant is to talk to me was like talking to a wall. Not that when i tried to speak to the group i talked to a wall.

			Police in eastern Switzerland were left scratching their heads on Thursday as a new set of crop circles appeared in a wheat field near Schaffhausen.             
			
			I want to believe.   
But I'm afraid it was the wind.
		 
			
			What's with the screenshot of the youtube video?          And why would the police in Eastern Switzerland be scratching their heads about crop circles in Schaffhausen?  Maybe they were scratching their heads thinking ""why haven't we got crop circles to scratch our heads about in   canton?""
		 
			
			why would they be baffled when it takes 30 seconds to google how crop circles are made.   
actually why would it even concern the police in the first place
		    Because it's criminal damage by some loony.
		 
			
			Maybe some aliens came to visit, parked on a farmer's field when they were immediately accosted by some cranky swiss woman yelling at them that they parked in an illegal spot and they should leave before she called the police.....      Is this another one to report to the American Embassy or the CIA? It could have global repercussions ...    
			
			Personally, I think some farmer might have had a few shandies too many at lunch before starting on a warm afternoon's tractoring and he fell asleep at the wheel.   
Alternatively, you know this is a fake, made by some Swiss locals. Aliens would never make a circle so perfectly...err....circular.          And the Local believes crop circles appeared in Schaffhausen as a result of policemen in the east of CH scratching their heads?   
Maybe new mountains will appear in another canton if the editors of the Local scratch their arse a bit more.
		 
			
			<checks time>16:25</checks time>   
Ah yes, Friday afternoon.
		 
			
			I can see the headlines now:   
""Aliens fly across universe to indulge in recreational topiary.  Then leave.""
		             
			
			The picture above is not the actual crop circle.  Here it is for those who are interested.       
Having visited many crop circles over the years I think it is import to keep an open mind about this phenomenon.  Shame that its quite far away from Zurich or I would have gone to check it out       I do have an open mind about this phenomenon. I am still undecided if they are created by loonies, conspiracy theorists or just vandals.    
One thing I know for sure, they are not created by aliens. One visited me on our farm last night and he assured me that their intelligence is so far advanced that they would not do anything so basic as drawing silly images in fields by mowing or flattening crops.   
Apparently, they try to communicate with us by posting messages on English Forum.
		 
			
			Who said they were created by Aliens? That would be crazy. If a civilisation was so advanced that they could travel across interstellar space then why would they not just come down and communicate with us in a more conventional way?
		    So they are indeed created by loonies.
		    I don't really believe in aliens ... but who ever created this, it's a real nice job, really beautiful.
		 
			
			Some are created by bored students who really need to get a girlfriend, others are made by coordinated teams of individuals who exploit the crop circle phenomenon to make money out of the associated tourism and souvenirs, books, videos etc...  The rest are made by something with an intricate understanding of ancient civilisation, astronomy and sacred geometry amongst other things and these are the ones that deserve further investigation in my opinion.
		    I agree....
		 
			
			Erich Anton Paul von Däniken is Swiss, they should have asked for his expert opinion. Lol.
		    So you too believe they are made by loonies.       Great theory....
		    If wanting to understand more about the nature of the universe is crazy then you can call me a loon if you like

			I think the Local is some kind of social experiment, to see how forum members react to ridiculously obvious information, disguised as news.   
Because really, the cover has been blown.... I mean what else could you come up with..??   
I could  make more exciting news than that, and I live in a 1000 inhabitant village in the middle of nowhere - The Local - where are   based??   
Here's the news from romandie... 
TODAY - the 100year old man of the village tried hitching to the next village because he missed his train. The centenarian of the village usually does his Tuesday grocery shop in neighbouring village, but today, his alarm clock must have let him down as he was left begging for mercy, roadside, waiting for a morning commuter to take him on his way. Reporters say he was waiting for at least 10 minutes (story soon to be continued on THE LOCAL.COM (or whatever the domain...))
		 
			
			Don't knock The Local.  It's from there that I learnt that things can be a bit more expensive here than in bordering countries, and that the reason there aren't any nice beaches is because the country is land locked.   
I'm hoping for an article soon on whether the native language of the Swiss is English or not, because I was having difficulties earlier trying to explain something to a local.
		 
			
			The scary part is that I've actually started to see The Local Crapper articles appearing on other websites I read (such as Slashdot), so its purpose (driving up page hits and thus revenues) is working.   
Naturally, I've taken the time to explain to other readers that the local is not news, that they simply plagiarize and translate content from other unattributed sites. I don't expect to significantly slow their page hit growth, though.

A quick dismissal that the new law has brought Switzerland out of ""third world status"" is a bit short-sighted.
		     If there wouldn't be a market for it, then there would not be laws against it. The fact that this just recently became illegal clearly underlines my aforementioned comment.
		    But now there is a law, do you think that the market will dry up overnight?   
Do you think in countries where the law is already in existence, underage prostitution no longer exists?
		    Certainly not, but at least there are means to battle and prosecute such practices. Once again, Switzerland is stuck behind the cow, whilst many other countries have already abolished such practices. The same goes with the smoking laws, the domestic violence laws etc. Sure one can boast about a ""save"" living  etc. when half of the stuff going down is not reported and the other half is not even considered a crime in this country.
		    The law won't stop it happening. But it might make it easier to do something about it when it gets reported.    
However, the recent cases in the UK have been known for years but the authorities were very slow to move against it. There were also similar reports from Holland. The problem is not so much a lack of laws but a lack of will to address it.
		    May I refer you to another thread where the mob is calling somebody who criticised that a nazi and asking for him to be lynched.
		 
			
			Interesting that no other news sources mention this new law.   
Tom
		    It's the local - check the press clippings from the last few days..
		 
			
			16 is the current age of sexual consent in Switzerland. That will now probably change, i.e. sex between 16 and 18 will only be legal if you don't get paid for it (or pay for it).
		    In most of the USA sex is officially illegal, but escort services are advertising very visibly. Of course it's legal because you don't pay with money, but I'm sure they have other ways of paying. So the whole law is pointless really.
		    Tsk tsk. You said the ""n"" word.  I'm telling       Sorry, but looking at from a marketing perspective: Is the market really looking for underage prostitutes or are the customers in Switzerland simply looking for young girls? In other words: Will they care if the girl is 17 vs 18? And if they are - are they willing to take the risk of breaking the law for that one year age difference? I bet the vast majority is not... they simply went to legal and official brothels where up to now some 16 and 17yr olds worked and from now on it will only be 18 plus... sure, there will be some illegal prostitution. There always has been and there always will be - but this does not mean that there should not be laws in place to protect underage girls.   
Here in Singapore did we lately have a case where the cops found out that a girl worked as a prostitute before she turned 18: They managed to get the customer files from her employer and some really high level gentlemen face some very serious charges now - including a Swiss manager of a certain Swiss bank with three letters. Lets see if the Swiss will extradict him...
		 
			
			Will there be a final sale period before the law comes into effect?
		    She (or her employer) kept files on her customers? 
Are you sure she wasn't a lawyer or something? 
Hourly rates of both professions are similar and they both screw customers so I can see where the confusion may come from.
		 
			
			Maybe she was but was to embarrassed to admit it so she lied and pretend she had an honest job?
		    Is the brothel legal? Shouldn't the onus then be on the brothel to only provide legal prostitutes?   
Are clients now expected to request id from ""service providers""? What if you are shown fake id?   
I mean its great to try and stop this but it just seems upside down.    
Not that it affects me, honest    
			
			Whatever next? Saudis marrying women over 21?
		    with this kind of argument, why make anything illegal???    
sorry, try again...
		    Fixed that for you, lovely...    
			
			In Switzerland arent the 16 year old ones just apprentices anyway?
		    ....that didn't change anything, efficiently? please, what is the reference? 
so sex with children should be allowed because that are no ""efficient"" ways to stop it? Please, that is one of the most stupid argument I have ever heard...   
...making a law against buying sex from a minor makes a strong statement that it's not acceptable, prostitution is an underground business as it is...so, having it legal will NOT make it better ...sorry...it's totally mental allowing a 16 year old to sell sex...she is only a child...
		    If you bothered to read up the rest of the thread you will see that it is in response to LiB's post that Switzerland was a third world country because it had only just brought this law in.   
My question to him was did he seriously believe that the countries he counted as ""first world"" that had this law already in existence had really stamped out every last bit of underage prostitution but I guess you didn't read that far up.   
I guess today's ""wrong end of the stick"" award belongs to you...    
At no point was I condoning underage prostitution.  Please feel free to quote me if you feel I did...
		    Amazing is that the rightwingers including the SVP now supported a move to  >>  ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse <<    Nice   
Bad however is that this move pushes a serious number of 16 years olds and 17 years olds into illegality at best and into crime at worst   
To any man at above 45 years of age the question ""do you see the difference between a girl of 17 and a girl of 19  ??   
Alright, let's have the hypocrites have their way     
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°  °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°       NOT funny at all, but simply due to the fact that the usually anti-EU  right-wingers suddenly felt pressed to support an E.U. position   
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°  °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°  °°°°°°°°°°°°        NO but because people of 16plus no longer are children. In many states  of the USA, the minimum age to drive a car is just 16. In Switzerland, a  17 years old can make purchases, sign contract, and for example buy a  car.  It means that the 16years age limit did make sense, does make  sense and will make sense.  People above 16 years can leave their  parents, according to existing laws. All this means that the power of  the parents have their limits.
		    I know that it is sometimes hard to tell the difference between a lawyer and a prostitute, but I am pretty sure one usuall cannot have a law degree with 17... I was frankly surprised as well, but it seems that high end escorts are apparently accepting credit cards. And no, I have no idea if they carry one of those payment terminals on them... but there were exact records... It did not only hit this UBS banker but all in all 48 men including head teachers and very rich and influential local gentlemen. This might be his luck, as they cannot jail one guy for years and let others off easily for the exact same thing in the same case... (I am all for protecting kids, but this girl was apparently actively hiding her age in order to be able to make a lot of money - quite the opposite of the direction of the discussion here...)
		 
			
			If it's your kid on the streets selling their body, there's no age that's going to make you feel any better about the situation.
		     Why, of course not, Switzerland was only supporting the dreams of underaged gals of becoming prostitutes...       call me old-fashioned but isn't everything that's illegal by definition a crime?      
What I want to know is whether youth unemployment will go up because if this? Think of the national stats!!!!
		 
			
			so will hookers be required to wear ID badges with their names and age?
		    I know this is an absolute tangent here, but I disagree with that. You get these child geniuses sometimes who go to university when they're 12 or something. So it is entirely plausible they could be fully qualified when they're 17. Secondly, do you actually need to have a full degree to practice law? I'm not sure of the precise situation, but guess trainees are permitted to perform certain tasks for customers and bill the hours.
		    Is this a Freudian slip?      Sex with 16 year olds is still allowed, it's just that paying for it isn't.    
So, a nice dinner, some nice wine, a diamond bracelet, that's allowed!    
Tom
		    Yes.   
It would be better not to concentrate on the prostitution angle, but just looks at the sex aspect. Any man who is in his 40s or so and seeking sex with a 16 year old is creepy, whether he pays for it or she just does it because she likes him, or because of something that's halfway between the two. It's still wrong.   
Just extend the definition of paedophilia to 18 and the other problems no longer need to be addressed individually. Looking at prostitution in isolation is barking up the wrong tree in my opinion.
		    keep telling yourself that    
once again, is it so hard to understand, that even though it will not in a short term make things better, it will in a long term...making a law against prostitution of children (<18y) is a strong indication that it is NOT OK to buy sex from a child...   
it's absurd that there is even a discussion about it... 
the only reason is that there must be a public interest of buying sex from a child...
		    Will your next step be extending the definiton of murder to include assault? Wouldn't it be much easier if we would not have to distinguish between the two?   
A forty year old men having sex with a seventeen year old has absolutly nothing to do with pedophilia, as a pedophile is clearly defined as somone who is interested in children  .
		    There are different form of paedophilia. Not long ago Roman Polanski was accused of paedophilia for having had sex with a 14-year old. So I don't think the onset of puberty is the cut-off point from a legal perspective, or from an ethical perspective either. I find it untenable that something is okay if its for free and is also okay in return for a shopping spree for designer clothes but is wrong when money changes hands (which is very difficult to prove anyway). Is it the money that is objectionable here, or the fact that 16 year olds are being exploited by 40 year olds? If that was your daughter, would you feel any better knowing she wasn't being payed in cash? I think it's some of those who are seeking to make that distinction who are seeking to leave a loophole so exploitation can continue. I would say, if you're caught with an underage girl, you're busted, no matter what your excuse. Why on Earth is anybody defending the right of 40 year olds to have sex with 16 year olds?
		    Firstly, Roman Polanski was charged with sexual abuse and unlawful sex with a minor (and with a 13 year old), not pedophilia. Pedophilia is not a crime, it is a disorder, and you can't just change the definition of said disorder, which is people who have a sexual attraction to prepubescent children, Were you to theoretically change this definition as you suggest, essentially every heterosexual male would be considered a pedophile overnight. You can debate the morality all you want and the legality all you want, but an attraction to post-pubescent individuals isn't pedophilia.
		 
			
			We're in an ethical minefield here. Moralising about who 16 year olds can and cannot shag is a bit Puritan. And Raising the age of consent to 18 is likely to have adverse consequences on sexual health, much like the abstinence drive in US schools does apparently.     
Increased instances of blindness among 16-17 year old lads too.
		 
			
			The definition of pedophilia is actually quite clear see for example the Encyclopaedia Britannica:       
The fact that the yellow press is using the term pedophilia differently does not change it's definition. But it is a fact that ""Roman Polanski accused of pedophilia"" makes a catchier headline as ""Roman Polanski accused of having sex with an underage girl""
		    The point is that the age of consent in CH is 16, therefore 16 is not underage.   
Also,   are even lower (Spain is 13, for example).   
""Spain sets its age of consent  at 13, and the rest of the countries have an age of consent between 14  and 17, except Turkey and Malta, which have the highest age limit, set  at 18""   
So where do you draw the line, 21, 30, 40?  And why?   
And what about people (men or women) having sex with younger men?   
Tom
		    I think 16 is about right.  Having (consensual) sex in a relationship between two peers (is that the right word or is that a bit ""textbook""?) is a lot different to someone paying a 16 year old for a meaningless shag.   
When I was 16, it was all about boys, make up and teenage angst.  Most 16 year old girls are still just kids in their heads, although they think they are all grown up and anyone over 25 is seen as so old they are nearly dead.   
You shouldn't be doing that kind of thing if you are not able to see at that point how it might screw you up later in life.
		    If the age difference between the two is less than three years, there is actually no age limit at all. So a eighteen year old sleeping with a fifteen year old can is ok, providing their birthdays are no more than three years apart.
		    You pay with money but you don't pay for sex, you pay for ""escort service"" and if you like each other and have optional sex afterwards that has nothing to do with it  Should also work with 16 year olds as age of consent is 16 in about 20 US states as well (17 in NY)...
		    Swiss law makes a difference between 
-  Uebertretung / Missachtung 
-  Vergehen 
-  Verbrechen   
Ask your family lawyer for further details     
			
			I don't think that underage prostitution was ever legal in Switzerland, which the caption kind of suggests.
		    Underage prostitution between 16 and 18 has been and still is legal in Switzerland.
		    Girls between 16 and 17 can however not be involved in any underage prostitution, as the age of consent is 16. It would only be underage prostitution, if the girl involved is younger than 16, which allays was forbidden by Swiss law.   
According to your argument there would be much underage drinking of people between 16 and 21 going on in Switzerland, too ...
		 
			
			""age of majority"" should the be age limit, i.e. 18, anything else is mental...   
definitions here:     
also definition of child:     ...   
so everybody who is pro child prostitution raise a hand...   
disturbing how many are trying to justify this...
		 
			
			I'm not a fan of prostitution and support this specific ban, albeit for my own reasons due to concern for the workers going into a sucky career.    
But I do support legslised prostitution overall as the lesser if two scenarios. I get the impression that the Swiss (/'european') model where it's legalized is less prone to exploitation than say in UK where it's mostly 'underground'.    
As for ""child"" at 18, I do think it's shallow to use that here to villify those who are are against the ban. When in UK I drove at 17 i wasnt a ""child driver"". When I did a Saturday job at school I was not ""child labour"".
		    nobody is saying that 16 year old prostitutes are ""child prostitutes"" either...I think you missed the point...and comparing driving a car with having a girl getting screwed by old sweaty fart for money, that's quite low...try again
		    I think you just did in your last post when you said "" .""
		    I meant, nobody is calling a 16 year old prostitute a ""child prostitute""...although they are children.
		 
			
			Again, I shall ask those who do not object to 16 year olds selling their bodies, how they would react to their 16 year old daughters, sisters, friends - doing so?    
I try to remember me at 16, and my daughters- and I shudder (and yet all of us were very happily sexually active by then). Having sex at 16- in all 3 of our cases with a great partner, is fine for many - selling your body to all and sundry, ugly, dirty, violent, whatever - IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT.   
My first lover was 25 and I was 15 - so he could have got into trouble. Very unfairly as I was very mature and fully aware, responsible and ... willing- and it was a wonderful and very empowering experience.
		    I haven't read one post where anyone is condoning prostitution at 16.  What I have seen are some posts questioning the practicalities of implementing of such a law and the fact that it doesn't actually stop the problem.  Certain members have then responded to those comments putting a twist on it that the poster must mean they are fully in agreement with paid-for sex with a 16 year old.   
It's easy for some to hide behind sensationalistic and emotive outbursts that drown out any sensible discussion.
		    I would expect such cynical attitudes coming from men' side, but honestly, some comments here made me shrug.. 
Going into prostitution business at 16 or earlier  is a terrible thing caused by multiple psycho-social factors, and it is a social disease, unless some think those teenagers do that...for fun. Or for pleasure, or, even sillier hypothesis, out of some cultural difference...  
Again, really surprises me people would still argue such evidence.
		    How do you think they would react if she was 18? The 16-18 gap in Switzerland is a complicated matter and making it personal won't magically make people see your side of the argument, as a woman selling her body is an emotional issue at  age. I'm sure most people wouldn't want for women to have to do it at all, but begrudgingly have to accept that having it be legal is better for society at large than having it be illegal and pushed underground.   
To be fair, I don't think there's anything wrong with the new 18+ law and agree with it, but I can see both sides of the argument. Once age of consent is one thing, it's kind of hard to enforce it, as prostitution can take many forms. This is not the first time we've had one of these threads and despite being ambivalent on the matter, I find arguments like this really irritating because they seemingly ignore the gravity of the situation once a woman hits 18, but a 16, 17 year-old selling her body is treated like the end of the world that one would have to be a heartless supporter of evil to allow to happen. It's not so clear cut, and definite gray area, which is why the discussion exists.   
I'd rather we talk about how enforceable a discrepancy between age of consent and legal age to work the streets is, the causes behind prostitution that make women choose that path in life, and how to make it not such a black eye on society at large. People are different, with different levels of maturity and strength of character. I'm sure there are women who would react more maturely to such a life choice at 16 than others at 20. Trust me, I can understand where you're coming from, but appeals to emotion like this one only give the impression that ""16, 17 = bad, 18+ = all bets are off"".
		     
My comment relates to an earlier thread on the same subject, where some people clearly stated they thought 16 was appropriate age for prostitution 
I'd also agree that 18 is too young too - but as it is 'adult' age, there is clearly a difference.
		    I doubt people were   of it outright, what I remember from previous threads is similar to what we see here, not support but legitimate questioning of how enforceable a discrepancy between age of consent and legal age for prostitution is. Of course, that always turns into ""What what whaaaaaaaaaaaat? You think there are should be 16 year old prostitutes?!?!?"" and any chance of a logical discussion gets tossed out the window.   
I agree with the law, but only out of hope that it will do good. Unfortunately, one only needs a cursory knowledge of the legal system (age of consent being different) and the complexity of human beings (who is more mature at 17 or 19, who are we to judge?) that the logical part of me accepts that its effect will be mostly a symbolic one. I wish solving the prostitution problem was as simple as making it off-limits for the first two years of consent. And saying that there is a ""clear"" difference because 18 is an ""adult"" age (as if the faery of magic adulthood makes it so) just goes further to show how you're not willing to deal with the complexity of the situation and ask the difficult questions about the matter of prostitution at large. How far do pieces of paper and laws truly go in protecting these women? Being vehemently against it at 16 and 17 is an easy win for those looking to satisfy their self-righteous indignation, I guess. I only wish the larger moral dilemma was that simple.
		    if the law makes a 16 year old to think twice about doing it because she knows it is illegal then it isn't ""worth it"" and the Johns know that it is illegal they will also think twice, definitely a win-win situation for the children, and it will of course a very strong message to the society.   
In the long term it will of course have an impact but this alone will not completely solve the problem, but you don't gain anything by having it legal.   
I know that if you want to work as a porn actress in Switzerland your parents have to sign a paper, yeah I know, one of the most bizarre thing I have ever heard of, do anyone knows if it is the same with prostitution?
		 
			
			those against the ban, is it due to:   
A.) 16 years old children should have the right to prostitute themselves    
OR   
B.) The Johns should have the right to have sex for money with children?
		    or C)  Look for an alternative that might be more effective?   
Making your posts as emotive and inflammatory as possible won't really gain you support, you know.  Effectively you are trying to paint people who are discussing the merits/efficacy of the ban as pro-child abuse just to make headway with your own argument.   
It's already been established that outright banning 16 year old prostitutes is not water tight as it sends it to a more murky base of the underworld.   
For the record, nobody on here is in agreement with ""Johns"" having sex with children.   
Now, can we move on and discuss this a bit more subjectively and without all the theatrics?
		 
			
			Thread over, everybody should read Russkov's posts and shut up. Myself included.
		 
			
			'Theatrics'??? I can assure you if one of my daughters was prostituting themselves at 16 - 'theatrics' would not have been the word of choice. How can prostitution at the age of 16 NOT lead to strong feelings of despair?      Yes, but (and my post was directed at Osueco's comments) ""strong feelings of despair"" often don't make a good base for a constructive argument, do they?  Can you imagine politicians running about wringing their hands accusing each other of being in favour of child abuse just because one of them wants to discuss the current policy to make it more effective?   
I think the one thing that you and Osueco fail to realise is that nobody on this thread (and I'm not referring to other threads that you may or may not have read) is actually condoning 16 year olds prostituting themselves.  Instead we get hysterical and emotive responses at each attempt to discuss it which is effectively wrecking the thread and any meaningful input.   
It's now has descended into Daily Mail style hysteria so until it gets back on an even keel I'm out.  Odile, I have to say I'm pretty surprised at your input because I normally have you pegged as someone who manages to keep hysteria and over-emotion off your posts.
		    I believe it is. Makes me wonders what sort of parents would sign such a document.
		    It's not my ""crusade"" you know, I am just stating facts...   
and so far nobody has stated any valid reason why there should not be a ban..e.g. it won't drive it to the underworld in Switzerland because it's already   legal profession...we should protect our children, don't let them go whoring on the streets...   
so what is the alternative, let me hear...
		    Well it's an emotional subject what do you expect?    
Nobody on this forum is an expert regarding what laws are efficient or not, we have no idea what will happen if child prostitution is banned in Switzerland, I do believe that's one of the thing that you start with and take it from there, there is no magic formula, but a ban is signalling that this country do not accept child prostitution....   
The whole prostitution business is damn ugly, and it should not be the start of a child's way into the adulthood...
		 
			
			Not easy to keep emotions (not hysteria imho) out of discussing child abuse - which is what it is. As said, in a previous thread on the subject some did try to justify prostitution being legal at 16, quite clearly. Do you have teenage daughters Sandgrounder? Mine are both in their late 40s - but I can remember them aged 16 as it was yesterday. Being a 16 year old can be hard enough!
		    Given that the point of the thread was to link to a story stating Switzerland has actually really banned prostitution for under 18s and given that nobody on this particular thread is condoning 16 year old prostitutes, it does make me wonder exactly why you are so hysterical about the whole thing.   
I think the point of the discussion was to explore whether an outright ban is actually effective given that in other countries it hasn't actually solved the problem.   
If the ban is getting it partially right and is so far only the best solution of any given alternative then so be it.  I'm just a little surprised that people on here seem to think that once something has become illegal it stops it 100%.  I know I can be a bit naive but even I'm not that green.    
I'd rather embrace the reality of it and try to fix it from there than be stuck in some kind of delusion that if something's been banned it stops it 100% but each to their own.       Wouldn't it be better to post on that particular thread, though?    
			
			I have (message too short).
		    The problem is drawing the line between what constitutes consensual sex, and prostitution.   
Tom
		    16 to 20 years olds are teenagers, but children they according to the law are NOT.  People up from 16 years of age can sign contracts, etc etc. Sure, it goes step by step. With 16 plus you can purchase beer and wine, with 18 plus spirits and you can drive cars and you can vote, with 20 you are regarded as ""grown up"".    
Alright, but also hypocrites do not have eternal life
		    I have written many times that i dont believe that this will solve the problem 100%...and I dont believe nobody thinks so, I dont know where you got that idea from, but the first ""easy"" thing to do...
		    Actually the ages 13...19 are teenagers  
In switzerland 18 is the age of majority, below 18 they are children, anyway i dont understand your reasoning...  what do you want to say, what do child prostitution has to do with driving a car or buy beer?
		    Nobody said that it would be easy    
There is always grey areas, and there will always be in all kind of illegal activities, I see the ban in a more pro-active way...
		 
			
			No ban:   
A man can have sex and pay for it from a 16 years old teenager. 
It is legal.   
With a ban:   
A man may have sex and pay for it from a 16 years old teenager. 
It is illegal and he would be prosecuted.   
It will stop some doing it, it won't stop some doing it.   
I still think the ban would do a difference in the buyers mind, somehow. But I also believe it wont change anything on the sex traffiquing.
		    I don't know if you aren't taking a too simplistic view. If a man gets busted for having sex with a 16 year old, he can plead he thought she was 18. He's hardly going to go to prison for that. Probably he can get off with a lightish fine. And he's not going to get busted every time.   
On the other hand, the girl may now be able to work in a brothel where as a minimum there is some sort of security that protects her from abuse and rape and somebody can intervene if there's a dispute and where the cash she's earned is safe so she doesn't have to worry about somebody stealing it. The brothel owner doesn't want to be caught doing anything illegal so he's going to throw her out because she's under 18 and she'll be working the streets without any of that protection.    
Maybe it would have been better to have a stepwise incease in the age so as to discourage new girls from entering that profession but protecting those who are already there and who are hardly likely to stop now that they've grown used to the quick money.   
And then while you're at it, why stop at 18? I'd stepwise raise the age to 23 or so, as by that age I guess many girls will be sufficiently mature to know what they're doing. In Holland there are plans to do exactly this, also because this would assure they complete their education/apprenticeships and thus have a trade they can return to which would make it easier for them to drop out later.
		    My post was showing simplistic facts but with obvious lack of simple solutions and results.
		    Only for paying her, not for the sex.

			Useless, The Local can't even get it right to serve the best bits...   
Excerpt from Tages Anzeiger, only slightly out of context: 
""Die Schweiz hat keine Nazivergangenheit. Wir waren immun."" 
(Switzerland has no Nazi past. We were immune. - sorry doesn't translate properly I think..)   
S'what I thought too before I grew up...
		 
			
			I can see The Local is learning from the best with such    
			
			Presumably the cut-off point for how far back they go in your personal history will be just before Blocher's family moved to CH?
		    Remarkable how few pictures are available showing Nazi groups parading around Zurich.    
Yet they exist.
		 
			
			Searching for Wilhelm Gustloff will lead to   and  .                      Next time you're in Zug, do pop into Metalli shopping mall and take a look at the security guards. Booted skinheads that might as well have SS tattooed on their neanderthal brows.
		    I found the next comment from both the journalist and her quite enteraining as well:   
SVP: Switzerland has no Nazi past. We were immune.   
Journalist: Not quite. The jewish stamp for example was a Swiss invention.   
SVP: Again: In my motion it is just about statistically collecting data of both categories. And then went on to repeat what she said what the motion is for.   
I really enjoy when politicians make BS claims and journalists call them out on it.
		    The lady stated ""only served to distract from the fact that new citizens were over-represented in crime statistics""   
There is actually no evidence of this because these statistics are not collected; it is a complete fabrication by the lady in question
		 
			
			Here is a general rule: any time something is published in the tabloid The Local about what some SVP figure did or said, it would be wise to visit the original source instead of trusting The Local's coverage.  Such trust is misplaced.   
Here is the actual quote from the  :      This actual statement, rather than the tabloid mis-translation, is rooted in fact.  Either Swiss are either extremely law abiding compared to immigrants or they are much more skilled at talking their way out of criminal charges than the immigrants.     
			
			Title is stupid though. The guy who banned Minarets didnt kill anyone. Would have been better to have the title read: ""Minaret ban mastermind rejects Saudi Arabian tag""....... The term Nazi, despite having funny and dramatic connotations in America, is quiet offensive in Europe because Nazis murdered allot.    
He didnt kill anyone. He simply decided to play the Saudi Game of outlawing competing religions.
		    Yes but it is comparing 1st generation foreigners against 3rd generation foreigners. It says nothing about how naturalised Swiss are compared to 'real Swiss' whatever that is.      Zuger I agree the Nazi accusation is a very strong one. I just wanted to point out though that she's not being called that because of the minaret ban, rather because of her motion to start differentiating between 'real Swiss' and the naturalised Swiss. This has drawn comparisons to the Germans being categorised by being Aryan or non-Aryan by the Nazis.       
Now while the Nazi tag may be harsh, I do feel legitimate concerns should be raised about this plan. Runderwo claimed that statistic supported the SVP's claims. Well it could be argued that it does exactly the opposite. I couldn't find any stats for it so I could be wrong but I'm assuming most naturalisations are from 1st generation foreigners and second generation foreign children. This stat says it's not them who we should worry about though rather when the kids grow up and their children and grand children which kind of puts us back at square one. How long should we document who is a 'real Swiss' and who is a 'paper Swiss'?   
I also think differentiating between two classes of Swiss also slows integration and identification with the country and also one should be concerned of the politics which the SVP could start when they've got numbers. To get things rolling there as already been preliminary suggestions that the country should have a Swiss passport on probation for 5 years for newly naturalised Swiss.....
		    Did you actually read the article you linked to?   
I quote "" immigrants from  ,   and   had a significantly lower crime rate than Swiss citizens"" 
Can you explain in 3 sentences how this aligns with your generic statement ""Swiss are either extremely law abiding compared to immigrants or...""   
Aslo where do you get your statement that criminiality in second or 3rd generation incomers is higher than first generation . 
There is nothing on this in the article you quote; where did you get this fact?   
Anyway the figures you quote are completely distorted by the inclusion of foreign crime visitors who are not resident here. 
In both 2010 & 2011 there were more ""Foreign nationals without residence"" held in prison for pre-trial than the total of the Swiss, foreigners with residence & aslyum seekers held for the same reason.        Second & third generation commit more crimes than the first... is she meaning Blocher        New rule: If ""you"" need a comparison with Saudi Arabia as a starting point for justifying your actions, ""you"" might want to rethink what you are doing.      Or the Justice system is institutionally racist. It's not a, er, black or white issue.
		 
			
			I was just telling the main breeding female in our household how I hate these Nazi tags as she ironed my brown shirts and sent all the blond kids off to Kindergarten early this morning. Then I sat down to watch my favorite movie ""When Aryan met Sally"" ....    
			
			People like svp and their equivalents elsewhere seem to mistake cause and effect when they seek to use crime statistics. We all knew that already, it's human nature we can tell when someone is being selective on what they say about a topic. The more interesting statistics would be correlations between immigration and income, and then correlations between income and crime. Like many countries, Switzerland should be thanking immigrants for doing the lower paid crapper jobs.
		    That should be  , I believe ...   
The Portugese now do what the Italians have done before and there are no doubt folk from other nations willing to step up when they become affluent and pickier. Switzerland is no different than any other western European nation, we just don't have the hordes from a collapsed colony (sounds like a medical condition).
		    So let's just collect those statistics and prove her wrong.
		    Huge administration cost in time & money just to correct one liar! 
Your taxes nor mine...      
I am sure such money could be put to better uses like improving integration.
		    I think crapper was correct; when was the last time you met a local cleaning the toilets?
		    Well from the official Swiss Govt. statistics I quoted;  
 ""  Germany France Austria ""   
We could reduce the crime rate by importing more Germans, French & Austrians & exporting the Swiss criminals          Uh-oh, I smell double standards! When it's about crime there are only locals and foreigners, but when it comes to cleaning toilets suddenly we differentiate between naturalized Swiss (a large majority of the Swiss cleaning ladies) and locals?       Nope, but we could reduce the crime rate by giving preferential access to Visas and the job market for countries whose immigrants cause less trouble (we're talking about a factor of 5-10 depending on the crime by the way) and who accept repatriations of their criminals.    
No amount of political correctness can hide the fact that there are vastly different crime figures between nationalities (naturalized or not does not really seem to matter - it's the country of origin that does matter)   
Poverty i.e. economic status is also not a sufficient factor to explain these differences. Sri Lankans are often cited as well integrated because they have a relatively low crime and unemployment/social security rate despite the fact that formal education is often low and that they work in lots of manual, low-paid jobs.    
Oh and before you ask me for sources you might want to check the last 10 threads on the same topic where I cited them.       I think you shouldn't bother at all with so much political corectness. Just reject everyone who is not from Germany, france, Austria and Sri Lanka.   
P.S. How many Sri Lankans have access to Switzerland so we can draw a conclusion that they are less prone than other nationalities to commit crime and poverty is not related to crime at all?  Yeah, I thought so. Half thought arguments, in a good'ol Nazi style.
		    First of all, you might find it amusing to call my post Nazi style, I do not share that sentiment. Do remove that post at once.    
Secondly, there is a difference between host and parent country crime rates of different nationalities, I was talking about the crime rate in Switzerland (host country), not of the parent country of course, hence your comment makes little sense.    
And contrary to your suggestion the vast majority of immigrants from the majority of countries cause little problems, it's a minority that is responsible for the bulk of crime.
		    Nope 
The bulk of crime is not caused by immigrants it is caused by foreign people who are here illegally; the so-called crime tourists who come here solely to live off the proceeds of crime. 
Immigrants are defined as people who are here legally.   
You can see the relevant link to the Bundesamt für Statistik in my earlier post in this thread showing more crime tourists in Swiss jails than the combined total of Swiss people, immigrants & aslyum seekers in jail.   
Interested to know how your proposal ""preferential access to Visas and the job market for countries whose immigrants cause less trouble"" will resolve a problem that is caused by people who are here illegally, i.e. without Visas so are not immigrants.
		    exactly...it's just a pity that     are put together with immigrants and asylum seekers...I just wish that SVP and morons who says that foreigners take up the majority of the Swiss prisons could learn to read statistics....I guess it's too hard       No, it just seems too hard for some on this forum. There is a difference between detention and prison. I don't think I need to elaborate, all the rest has been cited a hundred times on here. There is a difference between local Swiss and resident foreigners, and this difference really depends on the nationality of the foreigner.
		    No, it is not too hard.   
The truth would not enable the SVP to continue their campaign....
		    Yes indeed, the French, Germans & Austrians are less criminal than the Swiss - they should be encouraged regardless of what the lovely Frau Rickli writes         Not many pictures, but a lot of ""literature"" about the topic, like this one    "	33	Minaret ban mastermind rejects Nazi tag	2280

			Voters in Liechtenstein on Sunday rejected a move to limit the powers of the royal family in a controversial referendum seeking to abolish the ruling prince's right to veto legislation.         
			
			Hah, take that democracy!
		    Arguably the best form of Democracy.     
			
			I just find it amusing that a few weeks ago Liechtensteiners were seemingly outraged at the thought of one man overturning a ruling on abortion, and now they apparently love the idea, or his money - I am just not sure which.
		    Maybe this should be moved to ""Living in Liechtenstein""    
			
			I can't believe they say ""royal"". Is it correct English to say royal family when the monarch is a Prince? 
Maybe I'm being overly German in my semantics... but still, it sounds really negligent to me in a newspaper, it be online, it be a bad one.
		 
			
			We ain't got no kings o' princes in my neck o' the woods, but I think that royalty is the right word...
		     It's totally correct. Since when has the title ""prince"" not been a royal title? Unless he's a pop singer that is!!
		     I hope you don't teach English      You don't have a word for fürstlich/princier    
Genuine question, LeLocal's threads are useless, I might as well work on my English. Don't worry, I've always said openly that I suck at English, it's my fifth language and I only use it here. My life doesn't need English. Pure open-mindedness from my side.
		 
			
			Since I became a citzen here a year ago I actually voted for the Prince too. I didn't like the idea of the Government always trying to take away all his powers. After all if it wasn't for him or his family there wouldn't be a Liechtenstein. They have no problem using him or his Castle for tourism. I've met him and his son and talked to them just like anyone else, they're both really nice and friendly. But try to talk with anyone in the Government and see how they act.
		    This must be the no. 1 candidate for a ""Pointless Referendum of the Year 2012"" award, given that the Prince had told the ( ) people that He would veto the proposed changes to His veto rights, were the referendum to succeed.
		    No chance for that  
But what I teach makes me aware of the fact that royal is the adjective to roy, old writing of roi, from latin regal- and rex. Meaning: king.  
In my mind: no king = no royal.  
Monarch and king are not synonym, the word principality exists from prince, so I was wondering how the corresponding adjective could be missing. My surprise is reinforced by the fact that this adjective exists in French, and English often takes it and makes it its own. Hence my question.
		    I may be mistaken, but I thought he said, that he will not use his veto power against this proposel, but if the people were to vote to limit his powers, he would then step down as prince?
		    And take his ball with him presumably
		     Be it a Prinipality or a Kingdom, it's still Royal!
		    Fine by me, it's your language. Obviously, the link between ""king"" and ""royal"" is absent in English, perhaps ancient English people didn't like latin  . The word was taken but lost a part of it's semantics in the new language. It was a good opportunity to ask, though.  
I often notice that use of words is far less accurate in English than in German. Fact of life, I don't mind. You must experience that the other way around: lots of detail semantics to deal with when learning German.   "	16	Liechtenstein votes to keep royal veto	1106

			Quote from the Wiki article History of Suicide:   
""In general, the pagan world, both Roman and Greek, had a relaxed attitude towards the whole concept of suicide, a practice that was only outlawed with the advent of the Christians, who condemned it at the   in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the  , the Church had drawn-out discussions on the edge where the search for   was suicidal, as in the case of  . Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. For instance,  's   is interpreted by some as a long argument in favor of suicide as divinely appointed opportunity.""   
It's clear that the taboo against suicide comes from the early Church's desire to be different from the other religions of the time and has since become enshrined as law in many places around the world due to the Church's influence.  But that is no reason to cling to these laws nowadays.     
I feel for you Odile regarding your mother's situation and am glad I'm living in a country that will allow me to make the choice if it ever comes to that.  I am agnostic so claim no knowledge of God, if he/she/they exist, but to prolong a human life regardless of the ""quality"" of that life is, to me, a crime and shouldn't be allowed.  For me it is a personal choice; if you're religious and feel it is taboo then that is fine, but if I feel differently why should the law forbid it.   
The Swiss seem to have worked out a good method to make sure people do really want to do this.  No decision is taken lightly or quickly, time is taken to make absolutely sure there is no coercion and IS the decision of the person involved.  I hope this law is eventually extended to other cantons.   
Argent, there are several instances of suicide in the Bible (along with murders of course), Samson being the most famous.
		     And where exactly does it say in the Bible that we should allow people who have zero quality of life to suffer longer?
		 
			
			I do not agree with suicide but argent...come on...get real. Like one of the members said...not everyone on this forum believes in God and there will be some that believe in God and would accept suicide under certain circumstances. Stop groaning...stop bullying...stop forcing your beliefs by groaning and, generally speaking, a bad attitude. Nobody has a problem with what you believe in but with your crusade style of arguing. Respect the others and use some other teachings from the Bible that could be actually useful. Remove your unnecessary groans, share you beliefs and respect people no matter what... 
Just saying...      When was I bullying you or expressing bad attitude, can you give me any samples?

			The law against assisted suicide in Canada has just been judge anti-constitutional by the supreme court. I trully hope we will come to where CH is n this matter.   
My grand father suffered badly from Parkinson's disease. It was horrible to see him like this and for him to have all his head and losing basic fonction was humiliating. The man was a strong personage and he couldn't bare the pain anymore.    
When he had enough, he found the help in his doctor. I hope I'll have someone too who will help me finish it with dignity if I find myself in a painful end.
		 
			
			I think this is a great idea, and is *exactly* the sort of thing humanity should be doing, and should have been doing a long time ago. Personally, I'm hoping this is universally adopted through the world, and isn't derailled by petty religious dogma.   
Afterall, we see fit to put down our pets when their life is in terminal decline or quality of life has dropped to unacceptable levels, yet we don't extend the same compasion to ourselves? The irony being that our pets can't (verbally) communicate their wishes, whereas a human being can communicate their rational decision about how and when to die.
		 
			
			The answers to all one's questions:  Cruising with God          According to your profile you live in Valais, so the Vaud law doesn't concern you.
		    The bible is only a very rough reference guide for those who are lost and can't find their way and need a prop.   
Just because someone once wrote something down, that was then repeated and then translated, doesn't make it wholly true.   
It is fast becoming out-dated to to the point of obsolete due to over- and mis-interpretation of religious fools and bigots.   
In time it is slowly becoming a work of fiction and less of fact - but still a few interesting nuggets to be gleamed, and some good moralistic stories .... much like Aesop's Fables.   
Remember .... all that glistens, is not silver.
		     
Which bit shall i refer to?

			Assisted death kind of happens anyway wherever there is modern palliative care.  The palliative care my father was given was a cocktail of drugs for heavy pain relief, stuff to stop him being sick, stuff to keep his fluid levels down, etc.  I was surprised how fast the end came once they started this final treatment and the nurse in charge said that on such a weakened body, the treatment to curb the suffering actually brings the end a lot quicker.   
The bible was written at a time when people didn't suffer for long if they had some kind of debilitating illness which was at that time untreatable.  Nowadays we can artificially keep people alive throughout a painful and undignified condition which should have killed them perhaps within a maximum of a couple of years of its onset but keeps them lingering for decades.  Sufferers should have a right to choose a dignified end and I applaud Vaud for its progression in this way.
		      Sadly Sandgrounder, in the UK since the terrible Dr Shipman case, GPs supporting terminal patients at home have been much more reluctant to give larger doses of morphine, etc, in terminal cases (as was always the case for a very long time)  as coroners have been much more careful in assessing the factors hastening death - for fear of being found 'guilty' or sued by the family.  Tragic.
		    In my dad's case (in a UK hospital), in the last 6 or so hours of life he was on a pump which administered the drugs automatically.  It seemed pretty standard practice and I'm glad they did it.  If they had held off on the morphine it may have prolonged his life, what, another 3, 4 or 5 hours but he would have been in unspeakable agony.
		    a non-registered protestant?       wait... wait... wait...   
i say the sky is orange with red dots. i proclaim this to be fact and therefore whenever the sky is spoken about going forward, it is to be believed and trusted as I have now written it in this thread to be true        
			
			Refer Duck Tales
		    The Bible is full of long-therm sufferers, including the prophet Jeremiach, King David, Job, including those healed by Jesus in the New Testament. Refer particularly to the Book of Job. He suffered almost all his adult life but he DECIDED to survive. 
If someone is a Christian, they know that they belong to God and the suicide is a breach of the Sixth Commandment: ""You shall not murder"". The Christians are responsible to guard what was entrusted to them, in this case their lives.    
If somebody doesn't believe in God, it is his own responsibility and he already has the other ""master"". As Bob Dylan sang:           
			
			Just because people dont know the Bible by heart that doesnt mean they are not Christians
		    If someone doesn't believe in God then they can't possibly believe in the Devil, can they?   
As an atheist why should my right to die be judged by people who believe in something I don't believe exists?  Nobody would be forced into an assisted suicide so obviously religious beliefs would be respected.  The point is that people should be given the choice.   
I'd rather look at hard facts than Bob Dylan lyrics and a 2000 year old book but I guess I'm just weird like that...       What do you mean?      Oh, I believe it's full of sufferers. I suffer just reading your posts about it, I can only imagine how bad it must have been to live it.   
You must be talking about after these fellas enter the fires of hell, though - otherwise, I don't see what 100'000 BTUs has to do with anything.     If you don't get it, look up ""therms"" in Google      Exactly. You think. That means you have an opinion about something. Great. We think that is a great idea. Religion has nothing to do with it. Its just a matter of opinion. Some people like it, some dont. Simples.
		 
			
			I fail to see how one group's beliefs should dictate what an individual can do with his or her own body. If the Christians (Protestant, Catholic, whatever) or any other group object, I have a really simple solution:   
Don't do it.   
Otherwise, what business is it of yours?
		    You've been watching those meerkat adverts again!    
The commandment is ""Thou shalt not kill"", which can be a different thing to murder, and it's about number 12 or 13 in the list because there are actually a lot more than 10 if you read Exodus Chapters 20 and 21.  Christianity just seems to quote a few and ignore the rest of them.
		    Even the knowledge of the Bible, although recommended, not necessarily leads to Heaven. Either good works. Even going to the church doesn't make you a Christian. 
Obedience to God makes you a Christian. It is extremely difficult but fruitful after all anguish. Imho, the abandonment saddens God and the suicide is an abandonment, isn't?
		    Exactly! In your opinion. I understand your opinion, and can respect if you didn't want to have assisted suicide should you find yourself in unbearable, terminal pain.   
However, I fail to see how your opinion (and that of those who share it) should matter one jot on anyone else's choices. If you and yours can prevent the change of law by democratic means, so be it - but the argument of 'it makes God sad' isn't exactly reasonable when trying to legislate an individual's freedom to do as they see fit with their own body, and choose to die with dignity.   
Shouldn't each person be free to make God happy or sad as they see fit? Isn't that the foundation of this whole pesky free will thing, and with it the theological origin of sin?
		    Thou shalt not murder is the preferred phrasing of capital punishment advocates, as they define judicial execution as righteous killing and not murder.
		 
			
			Argent, it's people like you who make me want to spout streams of venomous, offensive, blasphemous comments. I then have to remind myself that not all religious people are like you and I should respect their beliefs as they respect mine.
		 
			
			[QUOTE=Occasional_Canadian;1586846]Exactly! In your opinion. QUOTE] 
How do you know that is my opinion?
		 
			
			[QUOTE=Argent;1586851]   You said it. IMHO means In My Humble Opinion.
		    You don't have to read my comments and you don't have to insult me.
		    Sorry, you must have been off sick when they let the secret out about Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Bernie Madoff and the Bible. They were all imaginary tales to keep naïve people entertained and occupied whilst the rest of us got on with our real lives.   
Bless you and your beliefs though. Very quaint.
		     No. Please tell me it's not true that there isn't an Easter Bunny or Santa    
			
			[QUOTE=Occasional_Canadian;1586852]   What I wrote came after prayers, spiritual struggle, reading the Bible, listening to the other Christians and non-Christians, etc.  
My ancient mate for a school commited suicide 3 years ago. I wasn't in touch with him for many years, I already lived abroad but when I found out about his suicide, I had a lot of regrets that I didin't find time to speak to him. His choice is irreversible.
		 
			
			[QUOTE=Argent;1586864]   Yes. Your opinion. I full believe you formed it through all of what you say, but nonetheless it is your opinion, though in my opinion you are none to humble about it.   
I'm sorry about your friend, as I am sorry about those of mine who made the same choice. The regrets that we the survivors may hold can be strong and painful, but they in no way change the fact that the choice of others is not ours to make.
		 
			
			My dad's favourite and wonderful sister committed suicide in her 40s. I have only found out recently why. She was born in a staunch Catholic family, and was herself a very good Christian. She knew from when she was very young that she was gay, and 'fought' this with all her sincere faith, denying herself her needs, both emotional and sexual- as she didn't want to be a sinner.   
In the end, she just found herself so isolated and tortured, and saw no other way that to end her life. When she found out that the Priest who had instilled that fear and shame into her all her life, had been having an affair with his maid, she totally flipped and found herself in a mental hospital. She was terrified, and 'knew', as the fear had been instilled into her from a very young age, that she would go to 'hell'. So tragic, such a waste of a wonderful and talented person. The fear ruined her life, and finally killed her.   
Edit. BTW I never met her, she died in the late 40s, a couple of years before I was born. The reason I only found out the reasons why she committed suicide (which I didn't know either) was because of the shame this left in the family - the stigma, even for my dad who loved her very much. I met a cousin who lives in NY a few years ago, and she told me the whole story - promising me not to tell my dad, aged 94 at the time, as she knew it would upset him.
		    I'm not being disrespectful, but that should really be a movie or book script. If humans could believe that their thoughts and desires are theirs and theirs alone we could put all these religious hypocrites and naysayers out of action.   
I support freewill and accept the fact that we are all potential putty in the influence of peers that we possibly show too much respect to.
		 
			
			I try to not get pleasure from other's unhappiness, but seeing religious people be outraged at their beliefs losing influence over the world... mmm mmm mmm, schadenfreude tastes  .
		 
			
			Might as well rock the boat slightly,   
If there was NO religion, the world would be a more peaceful place. Just saying
		    Such a great story almost seems wasted on this thread, doesn't it. It deserves a better class of religious troll.
		    The bible says also that the world was created in 7 days. I personally believe the monkeys story, more credible.
		    And there's the other extreme. Sorry, wrong. You have good and bad people across all spectrums of belief. Religion was largely a helpful, even necessary force, at a certain point in time. Not anymore, but blanket statements like it should be banned outright don't do our side of the debate any favours.
		    Majority of wars fought; religion.    
Majority of Suicide Bombers; religion   
How did the 'Upper Class' control the rest of the populace? Religion   
I could go on, but I won't.
		     
Nah, it's all about power and ego trips, which brings us back to assisted suicide.  Put aside power, forget about ego and you'll have is love and/or compassion, which is needed for the topic.
		    For example, myself, I am not religious. Religion is a human tradition added to the church at it has nothing to do with the faith. You won't be saved by the rosaries, prayers to all saints, to Mary, athough there is no need to neglect her role in the birth of Jesus: she accepted God's will.  
All people, including me, we are sinners et even good works won't lead us to Heaven. Good works should be fruits of faith.  
Only Jesus Christ saves.  
If there is a pastor or priest who truly believes in God, they won't hurt an ill person in a nursing home. Their prayers can bring a relief to ill people. The problem arises when there is a pastor or priest who abuse the vulnerable people. Jesus named them ""the wolves in sheep's clothing"" (Gospel of Matthew 7:15). Not only they can hurt a vulnerable person but they also set a bad example to the people seeking God.
		    And look how many groans and red bubbles the author (the Local) of the post has.       Yes he does. He walks on water and swims on land.
		    You don't have to read my comments either.   
I see Nia has taken a disliking to me. Shame, I was so hoping we could be friends.
		    ...... but Rooney scores from the rebound.
		    I understand your sentiment, and to some extent I admire on a personal level the faith you seem to have in your beliefs. This is a good thing in my opinion - to have faith in one's beliefs, whatever they may be.    
However, where I cannot and will never find agreement on is how do you reconcile your right to have your beliefs with the right of others to have different beliefs? Do you think that your right to live a believer life, seeking your God, even being strongly opposed to suicide, etc. should in any way infringe on the right of someone else to think and live differently? Please don't tell me ""because my God is the real one"" - heard that before from lots of people in different/opposed faiths, and we just had to agree to disagree there (otherwise it wouldn't have ended up well).    
It is fair for anyone to have an opinion, and in this case, the opinion of the majority was expressed through means of voting by the people in Canton Vaud. Argent, if you sincerely believe that you are right, and that assisted suicide is morally wrong to you, then don't do it, ever. Same for a myriad of other issues. However, please don't assume that, because   you're right, others share your views or should be deprived of legally available means to satisfy their beliefs according to their own opinion.    
For the record - not that it should matter in any case, but I mention it for the sake of context - I am a believer. However, I am an even stronger believer on the preminence of the rule of law over any faith considerations with respect to a country's governance, and on top of that I have a very low tolerance span for people trying to proselytize me.
		    Why being sarcastic? Wasn't I on your ignore list?
		 
			
			On BBC news tonight, the plea of a man 'locked'in' after a massive stroke some years back asks for UK law to be changed so that the misery of his life can be ended, without his family to be charged with murder if they help him. And a few years back, Debbie Purdy, in the end stage of a debilitating disease that would and finally did, kill her by slow suffocation. Tragic.   
And of course, Terry Pratchett the famous author, who is suffering from a rare form of Alzheimers. And so many others - who, in Switzerland, could legally ask for help to die peacefully in their own home and bed, surrounded by their family.   
Not very good at putting links here, but could somebody find and post his plea, read at the Dimbleby Lecture last year by Tony Robinson (Baldrick of Black Adder) please - makes humble listening.   
It is often said that Switzerland is way behind in many social concepts, but for once, they are way ahead and show true compassion. And another groan from Nia I suppose, oh dear.
		    tmi !!!!!!
		 
			
			I have tried very hard not to groan Nia, but in this case I will just have to, in the memory of my wonderful and beloved dad (who died aged 96, and would be 100 in August) and sister. A bit of respect please.
		    You have reverted back to your cult, thank god.
		 
			
			Time to leave this thread. A shame not more members had the guts to stand up to this bigotry and insults. As said Nia, this is not new in Switzerland - assisted suicide has been legal here for more than 60 years. The new democratic law is about the right to be assisted in an OAP home or other institution, irrespective of Charters to the contrary. You either accept Swiss Law, or you don't - in which case maybe it may be better to return to your own and its laws, for your own sake and sanity.   
Do groan again- you are welcome.
		    Yes they do, but only insult me in private!
		    Not even the tooth fairy??      For someone who is not religious, you sure seem to use religion a lot in your examples      You call it cult. We call it evolution. Do you seriously believe that the world was created in 7 days?    
			
			My great great aunt moved in with my family when I was around 10 years old. My youngest brother, the 11th child, had (has) Downs. My dad's parents also lived in the same house, in an apt my parents built on the top floor.    
I grew up watching my mom taking care of my elderly grandparents who didn't have a dime in the world. My aunt, who was lovely, was also penniless, never married, no kids. We all experienced the true meaning of family and charity as we served and loved each other. Was it easy? No, especially not for my mom. Was it worth it? Of course it was.    
Some of my favorite memories are coming home from school and running upstairs to talk to my grandma and my aunt about boys, high school drama, sports... even shopping. I loved them dearly. As my aunt grew too old and frail to move out of bed, we would visit her in her bedroom. Often, my youngest brother would sleep next to her, having crawled into her bed in the middle of the night.    
The two of them, my grandma and my aunt, were HILARIOUS. Especially as the dementia started setting in. Sounds terrible, I know, but it was so funny.  
 Soon, the aunt fell and broke her hip, things went down hill fast. She needed   
24 hr care and my mom just couldn't do it anymore. She went into a care facility, we visited her as much as we could. She died about 1 year later.    
My grandma died when I was a mother myself. The winding down years were hard on her, on my parents, on all of us. We learned from her strength, faith and courage. These kinds of lessons are priceless.   
I loved having those two women in my life, even during the hard years. Life is supposed to be hard, that's how we learn and grow.    
People will have different opinions of assisted suicide, it will be discussed probably forever. I'm so so so glad my grandma and aunt chose life and chose to share those last years with those of us who loved them most.
		    Well, according to her profile, she also believes she is an African Queen!       You couldn't resist checking out my profile, could you... ? Hotness
		    Well why are you asking me? Ask the cult follower(nil) an imposter, religion opportunist!
		    Actually, no... I was just trying to figure out if you're really a midget (sorry, I mean ""little person"") or if you just look like one in your profile photo.
		 
			
			My mother-in-law has chosen to have an assisted suicide tomorrow evening after a relatively short fight against inoperable stomach, liver and bowel cancel. She is 68 years old. She and I spent some time together on Monday to say our goodbyes. We shared a few tears (mainly mine) and a few laughs (mainly hers, laughing at me crying) When I eventually left, she gave me a smile; a gentle, peaceful smile. I've always believed a person should have the right to choose a dignified, assisted death. That perfect smile laid to rest ANY last few doubts I might have had.
		    How is that so?
		    Take your pick. What has my look got to with anything?
		    You yourself wrote: ""Couldn't resist looking at my profile. Hotness"" -- (referring to yourself as being ""hot"").   
And then you ask what your looks have to do with anything?   
I actually took more interest in the fact that you refer to yourself as being an African Queen...   
When I read that, it just kind of all came together and your posts started to make sense.    
			
			One of the most cruel and difficult things for a dying person is when no one will discuss death frankly with him or her. Sometimes it's easier to shove a Bible in front of someone rather than to discuss the end of life. But we all have to face it. Those of us who are lucky will just keel over. Those of us who aren't had better think about what our preferences are.    
I believe that palliative care - the area of medicine devoted to pain control, comfort, symptom control - is poorly understood and under utilized in most places, and in Switzerland especially. I think we need to involve palliative care earlier than we do.    
As someone who's  been diagnosed with cancer and is at some risk of recurrence - I do think about assisted suicide from time to time. For me, I'd first go the route of palliative care. Although I would not prolong a life where pain could not be controlled.    
I have a friend who decided to end her life (with medical assistance) when her cancer became too painful and debilitating. She was a bright, intelligent woman, and I believe that for her, it was the best choice. If there is a hell, I wouldn't expect to find her there, and neither would I find her doctors there.    
Dan, I hope your mil has a peaceful time. It's hard for all of you, but you've faced it, you support and love her. It's all you can do.
		 
			
			Not sure about lack of palliative care here in CH. In Neuchatel Canton we have a wonderful palliative care centre, La Chrysalide, where one of my good friends works- the care is absolutely top notch in all aspects and I am full of admiration for those guys.                   
Thanks for the link. Might be more an issue in the German speaking part - or it might be among people with cancer in the German speaking part. Several women I know who've had breast cancer have discussed this, and a new oncologist in Basel specializes in palliative care. The idea is that it's not just for end of life - there's a lot about symptom control that just makes a huge difference in quality of life.
		    I didn't see it on TV but is this is the story?          Yep .... quite sad really - especially as he's unlikely to get the court ruling that he (and his family) requires.

			Thanks for the link about the Tony Nicklinson case. Tragic. I do wonder what would be the response is a Swiss resident and Exit member hosted him and his family for a few weeks, so he could become a member and ask for release by Exit?   
Would you be able to post the link of the Terry Pratchett/Tony Robinson very moving Dimbleby lecture on his reasons for assisted suicide to be made legal in the UK? Very humbling.
		 
			
			Here's the Richard Dimbleby Lecture ""Shaking hands with death"", spoken by Tony Robinson     
And here's the documentary, ""Choosing to die""     
I have to admit, I do have quite a soft spot for that old man and his stories - countless hours of good (and almost clean) entertainment         I thought that was a bus...      Unless this has changed, Exit will only take on members that are residents of Switzerland, unlike Dignitas.   
Adding to that, it is quite a burden to have to leave ""home"" to be able to die somewhere far away. I am not even sure if their relatives can accompany them (due to UK law, if I remember right - not sure about other countries)?
		    where's that confounded bus? or was that a bridge?!
		    Not quite right. You have to be either a resident of Switzerland or a Swiss citizen.  
I don't understand this discussion anyway.  
As Swiss I am given the choice whether I want to end my life myself or not. Prior to this I have to agree with the conditions, which are explained here:  
I understand that there are various reasons against this. I accept this without any problems. What I can't accept are people who want to impose their conviction on me. It's simply not their business.
		    Thank you so much for posting this.
		    There is a song called African Queen          To be honest, I miss her already.
		 
			
			There's got to be some irony about being forcefully banned on an assisted suicide thread.
		 
			
			There were some good rants on this thread!  Also a couple of sad stories (Odile and Danofthedead) and an uplifting one (208beaner).  And excellent humour from the Prof and Assassin.  Perfect lazy afternoon reading!   
I'm all for euthanasia, and chose that as one of my topic for final oral exams at university.  The worry for me is having safeguards so this is not 'abused'.  Incidentally, the second topic for this subject's oral exam was drugs.  If there's no harm to anyone else, what's the problem?
		 
			
			Let's keep drugs use out of this thread- a totally different topic.     
Exit have just come back to me after I asked the hypothetical question about a friend wanting to come and live with me in order to become an Exit member and ask for Exit assistance, from abroad.  They confirmed that said person would have to be fully registered with the Authorities as resident in CH and not just visiting- and that the process would take about 3 months.   
Is there anybody on here on is legally qualified to try and clarify the legal aspects of this, as well as inheritance laws? I actually have 2 UK friends who have asked me if they could do this if ever life throws something really ghastly at them and they couldn't get help in the UK (like Debbie Purdy and Tony Nicklinson) - both in rude health at the moment, thank goodness.   
I've just re-watched the Terry Pratchett lecture/plea (thanks Herd82) - and he is so spot on. I however felt very uncomfortable with the documentary about Dignitas. The case was very poorly chosen, as the man was not in terrible pain and totally dependent- and even Exit would probably NOT have helped him at that early stage. A very poor 'advertisement' for the needs of assisted death (a much better term as Sir Pratchett says), unfortunately.
		 
			
			Odile, you might get a few answers by reading browsing the site of the federal department of justice and police.       
			
			I do sometimes wonder though where Exit draws the line.   
My husband's niece was only aged 30 when she made use of their services.   
She was not physically ill or in pain but physcologically ill, having been in a foster family and various homes since the age of 3 because her mother had schizophrenia and father totally negligent.   
As a child she was very lively and was developing normally, managed an apprenticeship after which she had a sort of breakdown and became ill (although not schizophrenia inherited from her mother).   
We were completely aghast and taken aback that she had been accepted as a candidate for Exit and had actually gone through with the suicide plan which she didn't tell us about beforehand.   
The question arises then about psychiatric illnesses and the death wish and do feel that more regulation is needed in this area.
		 
			
			I find this very difficult to believe that Exit would be involve in this, at all! Waiting for Odile.
		    Well, yes.  We found it difficult to believe as well, but it is unfortunately true.
		 
			
			Here is the text Exit has published on their homepage.   
Das Bundesgericht gesteht jedermann zu, eine Begleitung beim Freitod in Anspruch zu nehmen. 
Freitodhilfe darf gewährt werden, wenn die sterbewillige Person Rein rechtlich dürfen also auch junge gesunde Menschen begleitet werden.   
EXIT weiss aber um die hohe Verantwortung und hat sich deshalb mit Statuten und internen Richtlinien selber stark eingeschränkt. Zudem hält sich EXIT freiwillig in der ganzen Schweiz an die Sorgfaltskriterien, die in einer bilateralen Vereinbarung mit dem Standortkanton Zürich ausgehandelt worden sind.   
EXIT begleitet einzig Menschen

			Thinking back now there was a programme on TV 2-3 years ago where the TV team accompanied a physcologically ill man in the weeks before he went ahead with his planned suicide with Exit.     
He'd been a successful businessman until in his mid 30s when he suddenly developed bi-polar disease.  He lost his business and became reliant on friends for accommodation.  Over the years he'd had periods of relative stability, then again periods where he completelyl""lost the plot"" and ended up in physciatric hospitals.   
He felt he didn't want to go on living like this and in his saner moments decided to end it all with Exit.  The TV accompanied him on his last visits to friends and family and showed him going to his last destination in a rented room somewhere.   
I also thought this was totally unnecessary and was surprised that Exit accepted this man as a candidate.   
Perhaps though if someone is really determined to kill themselves they will find a way and maybe Exit thinks this way out is better than someone throwing themselves under a  train.
		    Well, at this point, I totally disagree with it. The guy was mentally sick, he was bi-polar. This is not something one can't control. There is great meds on the market who help thousands of people with this sickness. It is not a disease or a sickness that one have no hope to get better, no chances to fonction and be a fully member of the society with full capacity.    
Society gave up on him, he didn't get the help he should had have. He got the wrong help if this is what happened.    
Sad.
		    You're making an assumption that he didn't get treatment, that may not have been the case.  I haven't seen the programme so I don't know if he did or not.  But even if he did have treatment available it doesn't always mean people want to use it.  Isn't that what this discussion is all about?  We know people can be kept alive hooked up to dozens of machines and tubes for years, but that doesn't necessarily mean we want to live like that and I can see that being the same for some mental illnesses.  Terry Pratchett has said he wants to make the decision for himself regarding his Alzheimer's and I don't see why other people can't make the same choice regarding other mental illness.  So long as there are procedures in place to make sure it is their decision when in sound mind with no coercion then that is every person's choice.
		    I draw the line of my opinion somewhere else on this topic.
		    It is sad, but we don't really know the whole story. Bi-polar meds are getting better all the time, but the side effects can be difficult and lots of people can't or won't stay on their meds. It's a notoriously difficult disease to treat.  Suicide is pretty high among people who are bi-polar. There may be people for whom the disease is more than they can bear, even with meds.    
With end of life care, a statistic I've often seen is that the desire to commit suicide decreases when treatment for depression and pain control are successful. But I can imagine that for some people the pain from a mental illness is every bit as great as the pain from say, bone cancer, and as difficult to control.    
It's a slippery slope, though, and most of us have a very difficult time accepting ending the life of a physically healthy person with a severe mental illness. Does this differ from ending the life of someone with Alzheimer's who is otherwise healthy?
		     But is he not the ultimate judge?  Although at least his groans are backed by the power of unleashing plagues of locusts or he can just flood the world.
		 
			
			Definitely a tough call of what is considered a good state of life, and what choice the individual or their family (who might have to care for them) in how it will affect their standard of living.   
I know of two cases (30 years apart) in Canada. In the first one, a young child is diagnosed with a rare aggressive cancer. The parents decide to deny Chemo/radiation therapy due to the negative effects and stress on the infant and the overall healthcare system.   
The second case, just recently a preteen requested no chemo/radiation after previous sessions. His parents respected this, but were overruled by the healthcare profession to the point where children's services were involved and the child was placed in protective custody to receive the treatment.   
Not right on topic of assisted suicide, but two sides of similar concepts.
		    You clearly are religious

			The EU has demanded that Switzerland lift restrictions on immigration from eight Central and Eastern European countries.             
Ah so; the EU countries that signed these agreements now say that Switzerland should not implement some of what was agreed & signed by them.  
Typical.
		 
			
			I am afraid that I hold the (possibly jingoistic) view that the EU is a self-perpetuating bureaucracy of Orwellian proportions. It exists to simply expand.   
Actually, the EU are the Borg.   
I don't actually believe any more that the separate EU countries control it so when there is a story like this I simply roll my eyes and know that no single country has anything to do with it.
		 
			
			With a Portugese Maoist in charge of the EC, this was simply even more evidence to the direction and intentions of the EU to non believers.       I originally was heavily against those restrictions, but now, after seeing those reactions, completely support them. Not because I changed my mind but because I detest those EU chaps suddenly no longer accepting treaties they had signed earlier    
			
			One question for those knowleadgeable: may Switzerland impose quotas on labour to EU-10 again (older members)? I mean, is there anywhere in the agreements they have signed this option? Thanks.
		    Yeah, sorry about that...   I hate having to keep excusing for Barroso...        
I believe there are such options but the date for implementing has passed by - speaking from memory so I may be writing crap

			How does that compare to neighbouring countries? 
Any ideas?
		    I do not have figures. But if you imagine a half Greek - half whatever Western European you possibly can imagine the choice. While Greece looked fairly promising a decade ago it now is a place rather to get OUT if having any chance.    
The situation is less drastic in countries like Spain and Portugal. But many people there with dual citizenship with north/central/west European countries will decide to move up-north
		 
			
			Looky here on page 2 (2010).          EU nationals don't require dual citizenship to move to Switzerland or to another EU country.
		 
			
			It takes a longer time to become a Swiss Citizen. Many people stay ""foreign"" for longer compared to neighboring countries.
		    Right you are indeed !  But dual citizenship makes things much easier, not least as people with dual-citizenship tend to have relatives and friends in ""the other country"".
		 
			
			'foreigners' in CH is high as % but would like to see those stats with UN-related/similar people in Geneva excluded for a fairer comparison.
		    If you compare Zürich with Geneva in regard to foreigners, you can DOUBLE the percentage of Kanton Zürich to get  percentage figures of the Canton de Genève.    
Do not forget however that the Kanton Zürich has towns which even have a vast majority of foreigners

			Swiss researchers are working on creating drones that use thermal imaging to detect fawns nestled in fields that are due to be mown by farmers.            Well that will save the euro

			Here's link a little tech. info. for those interested:       
			
			LMFAO!!!! Sure, because ALLLLL farmers can afford to buy drones to help and save bambi's (who destroy their veggie gardens and run out in front of their cars at 5am).......?   
What a bunch of shiit. These guys have one and only one reason for their drones. To sell them to the US government or to sell the patent to a company who already has a contract with a major Military.    
Saving fawns is how they get in practice. Not how they make money.
		     
Actually, drones are becoming very popular outside of military uses, commercial variants may well be just as advanced as the ones the military uses.  The technology is readily available, you could even build your own.  You can get your own little spy drone fairly cheaply, with multiple cameras, altitude control and stabilisation for around 200chf, controled by an iphone app.  They're becoming popular with filmmakers and photographers, hobbyists and yes, farmers, as they become cheaper and cheaper, they're a great way to survey a large amount of land from up high.   
I can't imagine cleaning deer guts out the mower to be the most pleasant experience.

 Posted by stonybrookfarm under  ,        
  	About four years ago and just about this time of year, I was mowing a  very tall pasture when I suddenly heard a loud squealing sound coming  from the bush hog (mower). The high pitched squeal sounded like a  mechanical problem, so I quickly raised the mower, shut down the PTO,  and idled the tractor while looking over my shoulder. What I saw, much  to my dismay, was a tiny little fawn come tumbling out from underneath  the mower as the tractor rolled forward before stopping. Oh, , I  thought, . . . 
 My relationship with death, now well established and occasionally  banal, had barely begun. I didnt want to get off the tractor. I didnt  want to see what I knew could only be gruesome. But, I had no choice, so  I stepped down off the tractor and walked back to where the fawn was  laying in the grass. Again much to my dismay, I saw a battered and  bloody speckled fawn that couldnt have been more than a week old (I  could not have made that estimate then). My dismay, however, was less  about the battered and bloody and more about the fact that the fawn was  still alive. I repeated my f*bomb mantra, this time out loud, as if it  would make some sort of difference. 
 What to do? I wont go into the horrible details of what I saw, but  it was obvious even to me that the fawn was totally ruined. It had to be  put out of its misery, but how? I had no gun. I had no knife. I had  nothing. I stood there paralyzed, welling up with empathetic emotion.  Finally, I decided to go get my neighbor, who I knew had a .22 that we  could use to put the fawn down. Then, just as I was about to walk away, I  noticed that the fawn had stopped breathing. I waited a moment. No more  breaths. I bent down and leaned closer. Nothing. I looked at its eyes.  They were fixed and glassy. I waited again. Nothing. I was certain. The  fawn was dead. 
 So now what? What does one do with a dead fawn? I decided that I  wasnt going to go to the trouble of burying it. I was down near the  edge of the woods, so I picked it up and walked over to the woods, which  is at the very edge of a steep hill, and unceremoniously tossed the  fawn into the woods. I heard it tumble down the hill a bit and then  stop. The thing I remember the most about carrying the fawn is how soft  its fur was. It might have been the softest thing I have ever touched. 
 Leap forward four years to me, mowing tall pastures, again in the height of fawn season. 
 Yesterday after reaching the bottom of the pasture, I made a turn and  started back up the other side. I noticed a shape in the next pasture  out of the corner of my eye, so I looked over. Oh no! I thought. It  was a lone doe deer, grazing. A lone doe means only one thing.  Somewhere, very near, there was a fawn lying silent and still, nestled  deep in the tall grass. 
 These days I am a reluctant, uncertain partner with death.  Nevertheless, the gruesome, violent, painful death of a tiny baby deer  is not something I want to be a part of ever again, so when I saw that  doe all sorts of alarms started going off in my head. 
 As I continued forward, I did two things, I started scanning as  deeply into the grass that would in moments be rolling under the mower  as best I could and I started thinking: The doe is over there. You are  over here. The fawn is probably over there. But, what if it isnt? What  if it is over here? Youll never see it through the grass. Thats what  the spots are for! Youre gonna run it over. But, its probably over  there with the doe. On and on I went as I very nervously drove up the  pasture past the doe. 
 I came back down the other side and made the turn again. Dammit! I  thought. The doe was standing at the pasture fence looking very intently  into   pasture. She was nervous too. Her ears and tail were twitching. The fawn was definitely in my pasture. 
 I had probably two acres left to mow. Thats a lot of tall grass. I couldnt walk it all  well, of course I  , but I wasnt going to. I would just stay vigilantly scanning the grass and take my chances. 
 Just as I was coming up parallel with the doe, I noticed, out of the  corner of my eye because I was staring through the grass ahead of me as  if I had x-ray vision, a line of trampled grass coming up just ahead and  to the right of the tractor. Yes! Thats got to be the does path  away from last nights bed! I looked further up the pasture, and about  ten feet up, at the start of the path, there was a depression in the  grass. 
 I immediately stopped the tractor and shut down the mower. I climbed  off the tractor and walked over towards the bed. The doe, probably only  twenty feet away from me was starting to stamp her front feet. Her head  was high. Her eyes were wide open. He ears pricked forward. Just as I  reached the bed, the fawn leaped to its feet and darted out of the tall  grass into the open mowed section. It ran in the mowed area for about  ten feet, but feeling vulnerable, hopped back into the tall grass and  laid down. 
 I had to get it far away from where I was mowing, so I sped up and  moved into the tall grass and approached the fawn. The doe at this point  was frantic. She ran away from the fence. She ran back toward the  fence. She stamped. She stared. I could see the fawn. Just as I was  about to reach down and snag it by a hind leg, it hopped up again and  started bounding through the tall grass, but the fawn was too young and  the grass too tall. It kept getting hung up, which let me keep up with  it, but I still hadnt had a chance to catch it. Then it just gave up  and stopped bounding. Mid-bound, it just quit, either out of energy or  out of hope. It fell face first into the grass. Its hind end sticking  up. It cried out once, very loudly and then was still. 
 Curious, I looked up to see how the doe responded to the cry because  it was the first sound that the fawn had made. Quite frankly, she  flipped out. In a single bound, from a standing position, she exploded  over the five foot fence and then started tearing around my pasture.  First running towards us and then running away. 
 Not wanting to miss my opportunity, I quickly reached down and  grabbed the fawn around the belly. It screamed. The doe flipped out even  more. I picked the fawn up and tucked it under my arm just as I would  carry one of my lambs. Just like that dead one from four years ago, it  might have been the softest thing I had ever carried. As I walked I  looked at it delicately featured face  so cute. 
 I was walking towards the mother away from where I was mowing, over  to another pasture. The doe ran away, but then, irresistibly controlled  by her maternal instinct, stopped and ran back towards us. Then she  would freak out and run away. As we approached the other fence line, she  again effortlessly leaped over the five foot fence. As I walked the  fawn would scream ever now and then. 
 When I got to the fence, I placed the fawn on the other side of it,  in the tall grass, about fifteen feet from where the doe was. I backed  away, watching. I didnt hear the doe make any sound, but after about  two seconds, the fawn hopped up and quickly snaked its way through the  tall grass over to the doe was standing. 
 The doe put her nose down and then looked up at me. 
 I couldnt see because of the grass, but if fawns are anything like  lambs, that fawn darted between its mothers legs and went straight for  the udder. For lambs, and I imagine for fawns, there is nothing like a  warm drink of milk to soothe rattled nerves. 
 I watched for a minute to make sure they werent going to come back  into my pasture. Then, confident that they werent, I walked back to the  tractor, started it up and got the mower going again. 
 There had been no blood, no gore, and I had gotten to carry the cutest, softest little baby deer you can imagine.            I own a few farms and have built a few farms in Africa. Believe me, there are no farmers who want extra deer on their property. They dont mind wild-life, but deer are destructive and pose a threat to farmers food and to drivers. Thats why you see so many fenced/caged deer in Switzerland.    
When Columbus arrived in North America there were an estimated 1mn deer on the continent. Today there are 20m...! Its not like they are endangered.
		 
			
			I bet hunters would pay more than lentil-eating conservationists
		 
			
			For years now farmers use a thin bar across the mowers maw (there you go, poetry) to shoo deer away, cost's two Euro fifty and don't need chinese rare earths and batteries.

			Well, for countries like Belarus, other Balkan States and other less prosperous European States, joining the EU opens up a lot of opportunity.   
As a country, there might be downsides to it but as an individual, it's pretty much a free ride. Think about it, if you can't find work in Hungary, there's no restrictions on you to find a job elsewhere in Europe. Romanian Gypsies in France anyone?    
Now imagine you're highly educated but hold a non-EU passport. You don't have that right to move anywhere in Europe even though you'll probably bring more value to the host country in the long run.   
And of course, it doesn't make sense for CH to join the EU. It's doing well on its own. Joining the EU is only logical if you're not doing good on your own.

		    Currently Switzerland enjoys better access to the EU market place as a result of the bilateral agreements.  With the refusal of the EU to enter into further bilateral agreements, that advantage will be wiped out and attitudes may change.
		    The experienced master-tactician used the moment. Quite many SVPlers regarded him as too friendly towards left and centre. He knows first of all that the E.U  right at the moment is not really an organisation to join, and he second knows that Switzerland for the foreseeable future should not and cannot try to join the E.U. as those EUers would take any CH application as reason A) to stop all moves to extend the Bilaterals and B) to even cancel already done agreements/treaties.  THIS simply means that Switzerland is NOT to re-launch its application to join in the next 10 to 15 years. And in 10 or 15 years, he no longer will be in the Federal government.   
**************************************************  ********       Don't you know that according to Defence Chief Ueli Maurer, the Swiss Armed Forces are    ?    The German word about this is :      The E.U. is NOT a ""poor men's club"" at all, but a club dominated by some  of the richest countries on the planet.  They only had overlooked that  in a union the richer members have to bail out the poorer ones. Mr  Maurer knows quite precisely well that Switzerland is contributing to  help Greece over various international organisations. And when hearing  figures from Germany do not forget to divide it by 10 if comparing  things to Switzerland.    
Just as many Germans insist on using total figures in regard to refugees  and are rather irritated when getting confronted by per-capita-figures.   
Another point is that ex-Bundesrat Moritz Leuenberger suggested that  Switzerland ought to consider to join the EU.  Not at a very glorious  moment     
**************************************************  *********************       First of all, Switzerland will continue to establish bilateral treaties  with countries around the globe. Second, the E.U. in fact DID NOT refuse  to enter into further bilateral agreements. Those in charge on the E.U.  side indeed tried to pressurize Switzerland into joining the E.U.  But  their countries have embassies and consulates in Switzerland who quite  obviously in the meantime mailed home what would happen in a federal  public vote with a EU-proposal for the immediate future      
Third, when the E.U. has overcome the Greece-problems,  and some serious  but less drastic problems about Cyprus, Spain and Portugal, AS IT WILL,  the E.U. will become more attractive. But I here speak about years and  not days.    
4)  the negative attitudes of some EU commissioners even sent the EU approval rates here into the 3rd cellar   
**************************************************  **********************************
		    Ever heard of Rousseau?         You know why Switzerland is stuck with its neutrality, don't you?
		 
			
			Headline is a troll/fabrication.  Here is the actual interview, where the   states that Maurer has ""ein Leben lang gearbeitet wie ein Irrer."" (worked like a madman/lunatic lifelong).  The interview is well worth the read.       
Swiss franc denominated loans already enjoy the lowest interest rates in all of continental Europe.  Switzerland has zero benefit from joining the EU that it could not accomplish itself (e.g. by legalizing competition to various domestic cartels, making the Zollamt redundant, etc).  Democracy is not exactly an easy prize to win and giving it up for nothing to gain, except some kind of feeling of 'noblesse oblige', is truly a questionable prospect.
		    What kept the Swiss Federation together in those times when Vaud was just a Bernese colony, Geneva an ally of the State of Bern, and the Ticino-territories a tripartite colony of Uri-Schwyz-Unterwalden, was simply the determination NOT to be part of the German Empire. So that the neutrality was THE way to go then. When Vaud became a full canton, just as Neuenburg/Neuchâtel, and Wallis/Valais plus the Ticino, neutrality became necessary in order to keep the Swiss Confederation together. Particularily in view of developments around Switzerland, when the various states in Italy united into the Kingdom of Savoy-Piemonte-Sardinia under Vittorio Emmanuele II and his Premier Count Cavour, and when 10 years later the German states united into the German Empire under Prussian Leadership in 1871.    
I may remind you that EU members Finland, Sweden, Austria and Ireland also are neutral countries. Finland and Austria are bound to neutralitiy by their treaties (Austria 1955) with Russia.
		    The Swiss most definitely did not win at Marignano (1515), after which Switzerland abandoned expansionist policy as a matter of principle.      I'm not sure the Swiss 'response' to Napoleon's occupation deserves to be called a 'loss'  in fact in the end the Swiss Confederacy prevailed with little or no vengeance whatsoever.
		    I'm not with you. Independence does not mean necessarily neutrality.   
Isn't Switzerland a result of war effords, and its neutrality (based on French guarantees) a result of its terrible defeat in the Italian war (btw wasn't Ticino - except Uri's Leventina - common ""colony"" i.e. governed by all cantons except Appenzell?) and a - however useless - try to get rid of the Reisläufer?
		 
			
			You don't have to be a member of the SVP to realize that until the EU gets its currency mess straightened out, it's probably not a good time for ANYBODY (let alone Switzerland) to join. Also because the SVP is right about it not being good for CH to join the EU doesn't mean they're right about everything else. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
		    That's like saying that the United Kingdom was neutral prior to WWII because it had a treaty with Poland.       I'd say that being invaded by a foreign power is a loss in anyone's language -- even if the invasion ultimately resulted in the coherent, stronger confederation we see today. Switzerland isn't the first country to benefit from a little dose of invasion. Britain (and Switzerland) did pretty well from the Roman invasions and arguably, most former Bristish colonies are economically better off than their non-colonial neighbours (even if colonisation resulted in certain other disasters which will take centuries to rectify).
		    - 
Strange is that the Swiss Federation and the various member-states of the Federation were NOT involved in the Battle of Marignano !  And so did NOT lose there      The problem for Switzerland was that Swiss soldiers in the service of different armies were present there on both sides !!    This was the SUPER-SCANDAL of those times
		    Yeah, but it's strange how our neutrality didn't prevent us from participating the NATO-led war in Afganistan for example. Oh, sorry, I forgot, it is not a war it's a security mission.
		    That's not true. At that time Milan was a occupied by the Swiss Confederation (they had installed some puppet government there). Because the Swiss troops where tired from years of war and wanted to go home and enjoy their spoils, a treaty was signed with France, where they agreed that Milan should be given back to France and that the Swiss troops will retreat to Switzerland.  
Following this fresh Swiss troops arrived in Milan who were eager to fight (they wanted to loot), thus the treaty was ignored by the Swiss who staged a surprise attack onto the French.    
It is however true, that the French army to a large part consisted of Swiss mercenaries. On the other hand your comment about the Swiss Confederation not being involved is not entirely false eighter, as the ""Swiss soldiers"" were technically mercenaries in the service of the Duchy of Milan. The Duch of Milan, was however a Swiss puppet, who was installed on his throne by  the Swiss.    
The battle of Marignan had quite some impact on world history, too. After their defeat in northern Italy the Swiss were never again a major military player. But one of the most important things about this battle is the presence of a young chaplain called  
Ulrich Zwingli, who's experience of this battle will make him one of the most important reformers.   
Switzerland was divided by the reformation, and soon there was war between the cantons (that was actually nothing extraordinary and happend quite often, as Switzerland was a very loose confederation). Zwingli himself fought and was killed in battle. His ideas later were adopted by Jean Calvin who led the reformation in Genava.   
In the end it was not so much the battle of Marignan, that led to Swiss neutrality, but the reformation. Because some cantons where catholic and others where reformed, it was impossible for the conferderation to side with any European power, as eighter the Catholics or the Reformed would have disagreed.   
Of course there is some very strong connection between the battle of Marignan and the reformations in Switzerland. Because of the horrors Zwingli had seen at Marignan 
he later as a parish priest and as a reformer was very outspoken about the abolition of Swiss mercenaries in foreign service. A plead which was later adopted by the whole reformation movement in Switzerland.   
This enraged the more rural cantons of Switzerland  as mercenaries were their main source of income, whereas the economy of the bigger cities like Zurich, Bern and Basel did not depend on such incomes (actually it was the nobility in Lucerne and Solothurn, who profited most, as they brokered the contracts with the foreign powers).   
You should not let yourself being deceived by the nationalistic propaganda, about Switzerland being a neutral country founded in 1291. In fact Switzerland wasn't even close to being a country before Napoleon forced the cantons to unite. They certainly were not peacful, as the fought various wars against each other after the battle of Marignan. If it were not for the reformations, you could be sure, that the Swiss Confederation had tried to enlarge it's territory.
		    But I think it is interesting, that Finnland, who was the only European country truly being neutral in the cold war, does no longer keep this strategy. In my opinion this showes how outdated this strategy is.
		    Sweden and Switzerland are the most (and perhaps only true) neutral countries in Europe; their neutrality has been recognized and respected by every world power since 1815 despite being smack in the middle of the most horrible events in human history.   
Ireland has been neutral thanks largely to its geographical position which has shielded and protected it from European Wars.   
Austrian neutrality is something new and more the result of a NATO-Soviet agreement (1955) to remove Austria from the Iron Curtain divide.   
I would challenge Finland's neutrality, as the country was bound by a 1948 treaty with the USSR (so-called Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Agreement). ""Finlandization"" is a more approriate term than ""Neutrality"".
		    As a country there are lots of downsides, especially as a poorer country in the EU you just can't compete with the industrialized ones that are a long way ahead of you. A little bit of protectionism would have been good ...but it's just not possible within EU members, except, for example, when you are Finland and negotiated to keep your high taxes on imported cars even after 15 years after joining EU. The poorer lot was happy (foolishly) to join the club and didn't think much..the same applies to buying land.. 
As an individual it's not a ""free ride"" for everyone. You miss some info re. working rights of EU-2 for instance. There's still a long way to have this opportunity to look for a job everywhere without needing work permit.  
So on one hand you lose jobs at home because of the competition without having the mechanism of protectionist measures, on the other hand you can look for a job elsewhere..accepting probably a lower salary than the locals, of course I am talking now about low skilled jobs.. I wouldn't say it's a good deal, but that's just me. 
PS I don't understand your reference to Romanian gypsies in France....are they taking jobs from the Maroccans/Algerians or what?? As for the highly educated non-EU, there will be always work permits available for this kind of people, as it is today, as it is in CH also. What about a highly educated EU trying to find work in USA or Canada..or, why not, China, India? Don't they need work permits? Of course they would need. I don't see your point. European Union means a lot more than easy migration of workers. Whatever..
		    It's funny how quickly allegiances change. Finland voluntarily sided with (and fought alongside) the Axis powers in World War II, because the Finns feared Soviet Russia more than Nazi Germany. Then their side lost, so three years later they declared their undying love, friendship and cooperation with the aforementioned Soviets.
		    But my point is that wheras Switzerland claimed to be neutral, it was actually quite well integrated into the western block. Officers of other western countries often attended maneuvers of the Swiss armed forces, and  strategically they prepared to be part of the western block. (for example the Swiss artillery consists mainly out of american made self-propelled howitzers, which can only be efficiently used if Switzerland has air superiority, as they are quite difficult to be used out of a hidden position and their advantage of fast movement is voided if there are enemy planes in the sky.) From this you can see, that the Swiss generals assumed, that if they would indeed have to fight, they would be allied with NATO. (There is a quite sarcastic account of this in Dürrenmatts ""short"" story ""Winterkrieg in Tibet"" (winter war in Tibet), in which he describes the life of a Swiss colonel who is sent to Tibet  by the new government to fight (infact it is a war without any parties where everybody just shoots everybody, without any reason) because he cannot fit in with the the new world government which consists out of draft dodger who survived the war, because the were in prison).   
A few years ago the thre was a story in the french speaking magazine l'Hebdo, that in fact there was a secrete treaty between general Guisan (supreme commander of the Swiss armed forces in WWII) and the French Republic, that in case German troops were to enter Switzerland, in order to avoid the Maginot-Line. French armored troops would enter Switzerland immediately, and the western half of the Swiss armed forces were to be put under French command. Maybe I find the article somewhere.   
EDIT: 
I've found the link to the story of hebdot (it is in french)        Probably not readily integrated but easily compatible with the western bloc simply because there would be no guarantee if Switzerland would be able to maintain neutrality in case of a massive war in Europe in the 1950s-1980s, especially if the numerically superior Soviet Army in Europe were able to surround Switzerland.   
This is precisely the reason why the Swiss Army mobilized during both World Wars and I'm not surprised a special deal was struck with France (note that this agreement you mention would only be activated in the event Germany invaded Switzerland, which would immediately render Switzerland a participating belligerent country in World War II).   
Belgium became a neutral country in 1839 and the UK was bound by treaty to defend that country's neutrality by force in 1914.   
Does neutrality require a potential readiness of high militarization? Yes for Switzerland and Sweden, no for Costa Rica (neutral without a military).   
Are there pure neutral countries in the world? Perhaps yes, perhaps no (depends on what you define by neutral). I do think that you can classify the Swiss and Swedes as being the most neutral though, considering their ability to emerge from the middle (geographically) of the most massive conflicts in human history relatively unscratched.
		    There must be a misunderstanding. I NEVER said that independence means neutrality.    
Switzerland had NO defeat in any Italian war, and was not involved there as a country. To say it again, the problem was that Swiss soldiers worked for both countries involved there   
The neutrality became the option for Switzerland when gigantic   developed around it.  Switzerland is the result of people here no longer wanting to be parts of the German Empire (1291-1648) and so the result of a number of secessions   
Ticino was ruled by Uri-Schwyz-Unterwalden, and governed out of the tripartite castel of Bellinzona        
and the Ticino version of the old (real) National Anthem shows to what extent the tripartite ruling fortress has become a source of pride in the Ticino       
The ""Reisläuferei"" was stopped and it was FAR from useless   
France generally was NOT regarded as a guarantor but as a danger. To maintain best relations to Paris however became a tradition for centuries. In spite of ""territories"" in French speaking areas, Switzerland was NOT a breakaway from France but a Confederation of breakaway republics from   which means that the relations with France over the centuries were relatively good
		    Interesting is that the German version gives a different picture         
and shows that the Swiss Confederation was allied with the Duke of Milano. The Swiss Confederation was not yet existing as a country which explains why some Cantons had different positions from other Cantons, and so withdrew their armies.    
Basically a pity that Milano did NOT become another Swiss Canton       and many Swiss still believe that the Hitler didn't invade due to this...yeah       I tried to find the following quote in the original text because I have never heard of a German equivalent of the English language idiom ""lose your marbles""   
he said nobody still in possession of their marbles wants to join the EU. This alliance of states has lost much of its credibility.    
It isn't there and the use of quotes is not consistent with professional journalism.
		    Is this the quote you are looking for?     
			
			Genau. Quick English translation: ""nicht alle Tassen im Schrank haben"" translates directly to ""to not have all the cups in the cupboard"". We have probably dozens of ways of saying this is English:     
			
			A great thread with some excellent posts on Swiss history. Thanks for all sides of the arguments.       I agree. It would have given more balance of power (influence) between the three 'nations' of Switzerland.
		    could not agree more... I think about what Slovakia has gone through and watched how CZ put the breaks on the conversion (thankfully). My MIL (no F - mother in law) worked for 35 years in a local store in Moravia. She earned about 300 CZK a week at the end. I don't think I need to translate how little money that is. The pay scale was the same in Slovakia before the takeover (as I like to call it).  If CZ were to hop on the wagon, they would be in the same situation as Slovakia (retirement money based on local currency salary, but expenses at the Euro level - just an example but hopefully I am making sense it is early.).

			Problems? What problems?          
			
			Cool, another thread on prostitution.
		    Whether the person (or in this case country) have their own issues does not take away from the issue they are pointing out.  It's a bit of a cop out to say, ""Yeah, well you have problems too!""  The US has a million things to work on, but the Swiss have issues too and sometimes it takes an external source to bring them to daylight.  BTW, the US does also have plenty of issues with underage prostitution.
		 
			
			You really think that this is what US does...briging stuff to light? Why don't we have other countries blasting like US does?               Good lord no. The US is a mess....and I'm an American.  And I don't know the truth about underage prostitution in Suisse.  I'm just saying a comment such as ""The U.S. seemingly loves to try to deflect its own problems"" does not make the issue any more or less real.
		 
			
			And in other news: Democratic Rep. Barney Frank admitted a lengthy relationship with a male  hooker who ran a bisexual prostitution service out of Frank's  apartment.    
Frank is the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. You know, the guys who bail out Wall St....
		    Oops.  He must have thought she was 18.
		 
			
			Ha ha!  
 Yes thats the real question. Did he complain before or after he had sex with her?          If he is following the secret service model....he complained after.
		    exactly what I was thinking
		 
			
			At the end of the article, there's a link to another article, highlighting the fact that ""Swiss girls are reaching puberty earlier and earlier"".
		 
			
			This issue always gets me thinking; human sex trafficking is not in the least bit amusing, but it must be difficult for a law on prostitution on minors when the age of consent is 16. For the us to ""blast"" they have to take into account the age is not 18 here and the laws are different. I wonder what the case in Spain is where AOC is considerably lower...
		    You forget that politicians are not out to find and implement satisfactory solutions, but to tinker with the system with the intent of creating the impression of doing something so they can get re-elected.   
Of course prostitution is an especially hot issue as they don't want to effectively outlaw their own secret pleasures.

Of course if you compare Zurich's price level to downtown Saigon, for sure elsewhere life could be cheaper.   
But even if you do not count in general salary level in CH and exchange rate,    
try to find shoes in Italy that cost less than in Switzerland, go to Milan and watch the rental fees for an adequate flat ...   apart from electronics stuff, gasoline, dairy farm products ...
		    Sometimes in life, one has to spend something extra on oneself. 
The poor will always be there. I just had a visitor, who spent A LOT of money, and it felt good that I found a bargain with some shirts. 
It is not every year I spend money on shirts, etc or on myself (a self-professed Mr. Scrooge).   
But yeah, Switzerland is one of the most expensive cities to buy ""normal"" stuff. 
So I wait for sales.   
			
			It's only as expensive as you want it to be...I think we've only ate out three times since we've been here and it's been over a year.  Yes it's expensive!!!
		    Hello welcome to the forum and to CH. 
Where do you hail from?        I do not see your point.        Well, it depends. Regarding clothes it is not more expensive than Italy, e.g.    
However, a cappuccino is charged three times of most non-1st class tourist places in Italy, and a take-away-pizza in ZH Schaffhauser Strasse costs as much as a middle pizza in a Ticino pizzeria.   
OK, and if I want to buy a flat or a house in Küsnacht, probably I'll pay a lot. Thanks, I know that, and if I go to ZH and I wanna be paid ZH so I have to accept that.
		    Switzerland may be small but to reduce it to a city is a bit harsh!

			To an Anglophone, the French spoken in Switzerland may sound much like that used in France, but don't say that to a Parisian.             
			
			When I think of Swiss French I always think of           The man sounds like uncle Jules (jr) who I first met in Hyères-Toulon when he was 98 years old and second when he was 99. On the fist visit, the women (youngish 86 years only) were in downtown and so we walked to the nearest bistro. In the afternoon there were guests from Bordeaux, Paris and Alsace-Lorraine, so that I could experience the varieties of French language first hand, even if I talked with the Alsaciens in German (halfway between dialect and standard) and uncle Jules and me including some pieces of Arabic
		 
			
			As a person from the Swiss-French part of Switzerland, having visited Paris on several occasions, all I can say is that some Parisians behave in an arrogant way towards those not speaking French exactly like their own.   
Dommage (a shame).
		    Real Parisians detest everybody from the ""province"" be they from Nice, Marseille, Grenoble, Lyon, Geneva, Dijon, Nancy, St. Malo, Dinard, Rennes, or Bordeaux    They are the centre of the world.  We for years issued an aviation yearbook and had a nice chap as correspondent for France, in Paris. After a while, I found out that he only cared for the Greater Paris area but regarded ""outer France"" as irrelevant. I then took over ""non-Paris-area-France""  which to me was a lot of work but also a chance to improve my French, even if my ""accent Maghrebine-Suisse"" was not really a ""bestseller"".  But if confronted by the mentality in question you have to get  through it    
			
			I much prefer the anglosaxon positive attitude towards the different accents and varieties of English compared to the Parisian-style snobbishness of what they consider the only way one should speak French.  If they would already stop mocking people's accents (which they even do with native French speakers from a different country), they would maybe get some more respect for the language from non-native speakers as well.
		 
			
			Which Anglo-Saxon attitude, lol? My relatives from London and Surrey do NOT have a very open attitude about Northern accents, I can assure you! My sil and bil, and others in the family would be totally unable, or rather unwilling to understand a strong Scouser or Geordie, let alone a Brummie! (Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham), I can assure you   
BTW there are so many very strong regional accents in France. And here in CH, a trained ear will quickly and clearly identify a Neuchatel from a Vaud, a Fribourg from a Valais or Genevan accent. I live near the Neuchatel / French Franche-Comté border, and the Franche-Comté (dept 25 Pontarlier) is just as strong and slow as Neuchatel, but with a totally different emphasis- hilarious.

			Swiss People's Party politician Toni Brunner has caused uproar with his proposal for the establishment of a special centre for asylum seekers who have broken the law.             
			
			The title fits, but the background is a little different.   
Recently i heard on the radio that soon there will be a vote on a new initiative that a certain Gemeinde want to enforce a few new rules with respect to their housing for the asylum seekers.   
From memory, they want to put bars on the windows of the housing, impose a curfew of 10pm, no longer allow single men to stay there- only men if they have families with them.   
Makes one wonder how bad it must be in the homeland, to want to put up with being treated like a criminal in the new country, without ever having done anything.
		 
			
			They should have setup this up a decade ago. May the damn thing get built and clear our streets of West Africans cocaine dealers YESTERDAY!
		    That's the idea.  Talk to someone who works in the asyl centers and they'll tell you that it's the single men who cause problems, not the family fathers or women.  Of course not all single men cause problems, but too many of them do.  It's like anything else.... a few bad apples spoil it for all.
		    I do hope your sentiments don't encourage anyone to set fire to the centre. This sort of thing happens when such souls are stigmatised and herded under one roof; often under protest by residents, sometimes out of hate by locals. Google around a bit.   
For a Christian country, there are some spectacularly unChristian sentiments whenever it comes to foreigners.   
The Coke dealers are supplying a demand, but don't think about it too much or you'll find the bigger picture unsettling.
		 
			
			given the number of hands sticking out the windows of the immigrant centre /  jail at zurich airport business is good anyway
		    Strange hobby you have there, hanging around jails ....   
Something to do with your failed prison warden application?
		 
			
			nah, that job would be boring
		    I'd never condone arson. I just want the damn law to be applied PROPERLY so these criminals don't revolve in and out of the police stations and jails (when they even make it to those). The problem is they're using a loophole as asylum seekers, which has been allowed to fester so much it's causing massive levels of xenophobia in the towns that suffer them.   
  I wish I could find that quote, but the former head of the immigration office in Bern complained a year or two ago that he wished they could just deport Nigerians directly as 99% were coming over to commit crimes as part of organized gangs from over there. They  have no shortage of volunteers apparently.
		    I wasn't implying you condone anything, but there are consequences to knee jerk demands.    
No shortage of Coke customers too, it seems. Zurich's Langstrasse at 2am is like a trip to backstreet Lagos - or heaven, depending on your night time proclivites - but I don't see fairness in tarring people who do not commit illegal activity with the same brush as common criminals. Some numb nuts confuse asylum with gangsta and it does us no favours forgetting the difference.   
The problem does not go away by herding them off to a Ghetto.   
I say the egg, then the chicken. Or was it the egg mcmuffin then the chicken nuggets?
		          Ha! Ha! ""AaaLaa"" nice one.
		 
			
			A friend of mine is a retired government pilot. His mates would fly about 10 criminals to Nigeria, accompanied by enough security men. When they arrived the Nigerians refused to take them as they were convicted criminals. So the Swiss government plane had to bring them back again. It cost thousands!    
There are only so many jobs available for drug dealers. The rest find jobs on Geneva and Lausanne stations, making a nuisance of themselves. Plenty of posts on EF describing the robberies and thefts.   
So is there any alternative to locking them up? After all they are convicted criminals. Nothing else seems to work does it?
		 
			
			when you say government pilot  i assume you mean soley employed by the government ?  when did he make these flights, must have been a long time ago as a well known airline is normally used for the nigeria flights on a monthly basis.    
other airlines have been used for the monthly flight but the plane didnt come back in a good condition because the police uncuffed everyone before the doors were open   , the military had to go on board to "" gently persuade"" the passengers to exit the plane.   
all paperwork is arranged and acceptance pre agreed although strange things happen
		 
			
			Please note that not ALL Nigerians in Switzerland deal Drugs or are Criminals; there are some educated, honest tax paying Nigerians out there. 
For the record...      Supplying a demand? It's drug, not apples. Its addiction. 
Now for some foreigners, it is easier to go into drugs because of the money.   
On the other hand, I think the locals have the right to be pissed off at a few because the community of those few are not doing much to put them out of service.   
And I am sure someone is going to tell me that Swiss home violence is what explode the charts at the cops'statistics, but this is internal to Swiss and Swiss do act, by electing representative to change that
		    Like the guy who says to his boss: ""All Brazilians are either good prostitutes or good football players"" and the boss said: ""my wife is Brazilian"" and the guy don't bat an eyelid: ""Oh yes, what team does she play for?""
		 
			
			Lol, terrible joke, still a joke nonetheless...
		    No. All single men do!  Men with wives and families automatically become good clean shaven citizens with haircuts and jobs to support their families. They would never beat their wives or kids, steal a bicycle, or poison the neighbours cat.  Somehow that little band of gold makes them cross over into the Land of Loveliness.   
And i would NEVER put ""honest"" and ""tax paying"" in the same sentence!! Thats just absolute rubbish!!!          I am not sure that drugs is so much the problem, as is breaking into cars & houses, petty crime.  For drugs you need contacts and a network. I'd say that the locals were more into this. 
My neighbour swears that since That House has been filled with Those People.. well, there were 20 beak-ins into cars last weekend alone!!   
As for that other stuff. That is something that will never be in the paper, due to the nature of the beast.  But you can see it in their eyes.        Aren't stereotypes fantastic? 
1) don't take the headphones off the blonde, she'll forget to breathe 
2) all blokes are hung like horses 
3) if he's chinese, he must be hard working    
Hate everyone equally, i always say....

p.s. Does not effect me since I buy most goods over the border.

		    Ummm   
Most ladies clothes shops           There are no oppressed natives in the falklands.

There are no Argentinian progoms or bombed enclaves etc etc.
		 
			
			ABSOLUTELY!!!. 
The facts are stated. 
You choose whether you want to buy or not.              .   
Still doesn't explain the lack of correct labeling on goods from North Cyprus, Northern Ireland and North Sinai.   
btw - if Migros still buys Israeli produce made in the Gaza strip, they have a serious problem. From        
			
			If you say ""yes more transparency please"" think about this: you are being asked by your neighbour to remove your shoes when you enter his part of the building. Then he says that your living room is considered his part of the building, and he tells all the other neighbours it's his.  
If you want to have labels at least know what kind of hypocrisy is adopted by Migros when they start with these labels   
 I'm not interested in a big argument, and I'm not replying in order to convince. Just to show you the other side:   
Israel considers some of the territories as Israeli land. Home. Suddenly another nation decides to make certain claims on your home, and they succeed in showing how they are weak and unable to fight the ""big bad Israel"" and they, being the underdog convince companies like Migros to apply these labels   
They should also mark numerous other products - your computer chips, your security software, other software, your water-irrigation smart-systems, some of the materials in your cloths, in your car and the stents in your chest if you are a heart patient   
They should put labels on a large number of pills and drugs manufactured in Israel in ""questionable occupied locations"" as the Palestinians want you to believe   
There is a reason the conflict is still on-going. It's not your conflict and why should you care ... if you care enough to read the labels at least know that they derive from a big one-sided lie   
Oh I almost forgot - Palestinians themselves buy those products they want you to label and be aware of. These products can be bought in many stores in Gaza. Also, Palestinians are working for those manufacturers as workers, because  Israel doesn't care they are Palestinians. If they do their work they  get to work and make a living 
They buy Israeli products from any place because they know it's a better  product in most cases (more quality-assurance, more monitoring etc)   
JD
		 
			
			By all means let's have comprehensive labelling!! 
On ALL products. 
Wish I knew where my fuel originated. 
I would like to make purchasing decisions based on that also.    it were possible.        
			
			What does location have to do with anything?   
If somebody disagrees with Israeli politics, does it make any difference if a product is made in the Gaza strip instead of any other? Boycott or not - entirely.
		 
			
			A non imaginary scenario:    
Factory X is located in west bank, owned by Israeli muslims, employees Jews & palestinians.   
Due to BDS pressure less people buy it's products - factory moves 15 km west.   
Owners & Jewish employees face some disruptions (longer commute, perhaps) - but the palestinians, facing Arab level unemployment will not find another job remotely similar.
		 
			
			good article in german about the topic:          Apartheid-era trade embargoes were pretty tough on South Africans as well at the time but probably helped to end the regime.
		    Could it also be because it's not the Palestinians who decide what is allowed to be imported into Gaza?
		    Bring down democracy and rule of law, end equal rights for israeli arabs?
		    If Embargoes were a useful political tool Zimbabwe would be rid of Mugabe long time ago, and the Iraq was would have not been necessary. plenty of other examples.   
Migros should not have listened to an openly racist organization like BDS.
		    Maybe Gaza's problems are somehow related to the fact that Gaza is ruled by murderous Islamo-fascist regime, who promotes child killing & throwing opponents from high buildings ?
		    Better to be openly racist than to pretend it's not happening, eh?
		    Lets ask the people in the westbank and the falkland,would be interesting  People in Northern Irland voted  to stay in UK
		    A classic BNP/Respect line.
		    An observation:   
You seem to be the only Israelli outside of Israel who really can see things from only one side.   
Most seem to be really embarrassed by their government's actions.   
I guess there must be a lot more of you within Israel otherwise this wouldn't be happening.
		 
			
			I cannot stop laughing about the direction of this thread... Sorry to chime in with a cliched yet classic quote from Clint Eastwood    
"" . Everybody's got one and everyone thinks everyone else's stinks.""   
And that holds very true here... Hahhaha..
		    In one post you managed a personal insult, a lie and a racist accusation - quite an achievement. 
If all israeli factories & farms on the west bank would close tomorrow - would this make the situation better for the arabs in the west bank ?
		 
			
			Do you mean like this:           
			
			GEE! Thanks for this deeply intellectual contribution. 
Do you have an opinion that you'd like to share?       
			
			Not sure of the point of the labelling, other than to divide. Many of the people working in what is considered occupied territories are Bedouin, who work damn hard and earn their money, as well as people who see themselves as Palestinian, those who see themselves as Israeli and some inbetween who are there for the labour.   
If the point of the labelling is to instill reaction and boycott, the cart is before the horse. Does Migros not want you to buy their products?
		    No thanks, I prefer to have not an asshole than have one... 
I have attained enlightenment and hence I do not eat any food and therefore no need for an asshole to egest the digested...          
Pretty much like that.          
or like this:           
or like that:           
Oh, sorry. I guess lots of kids dress up as soldiers.
		 
			
			Yeah. 
I played all the games as a kid. Soldiers, cowboys'n'indians, pirates. 
Innocent days. 
Funny though, that the ONLY kid that does not have a gun (toy or otherwise) gets publicly executed by the IDF!!      Do not forget that this label also is put on Palestinian products exported from the Occupied Territories. It was Israel which forced those companies to label their products as ""Palestine"" .  But Israel labelled products from Occupied East Jerusalem as ""Israeli products"". Now, Migros can decide itself about what is what.
		    The thing is, he wasn't shot by the IDF.
		     . The baby is not dressed up a soldier, but as a suicide bomber.    
Back to the labeling: As Uncle max said - Migros sales are likely to decrease. This won't help anyone, most of all Arabs who have less opportunites.   
Israel has been facing boycots (Arab, communist, opportunist...) for more than 60 years, and is doing quite well.   
How Migros will react to labeling Kosovo/Kosova products ?
		    I say he was    
			
			Well... your denial has just convinced me. Without a doubt!          > North Cyprus is either ""Cyprus"" or ""Turkish Cyprus"" or the ""TRNC"". All three versions are correct   
>  Northern Ireland is clearly ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"" and definitely NOT ""Ireland""   
>  North Sinaï  is clearly Egypt   
>  Gaza ?  I thought that the Israeli settletments there had been given up a while ago ?     
However, Migros possibly is over-estimating the geopolitical interests of their customers !  I also usually look at the product and at the price and generally only at the end (IF) at the exact origin. While I admit recently to have bought a melon ""origine Maroc"" in support  .....,  I usually do not care too much about such nationalisms.  It possibly is, to use the saying of Karl May, simply ""der Streit um die Barthaare des Propheten""        Excatly. Now go and explain it to Migros. take your time.
		    Thanks !  I think they will realize it when they try to find produce of Israeli settlements in Gaza     
			
			Come on guys, we have so many wars around the globe and let us not start a war here in the forums by showing animosity against each other... Calm down...See this and take a chill pill..           Wolly stop thinking   the talk is about ""Occupied territory"" ,west bank is  occupied.Gaza  bye all practical means is also occupied   
			
			Thought you already said you did not have an opinion and that we were all a bunch of assholes? 
Like to kill this discussion?       
			
			Nowhere I said you guys are assholes.. I said I don't have one and something of the sort.. I still prefer to have no opinion one way or the other..   
My humble question is ""In what way is this discussion even remotely constructive?"" We are ending up squeezing each others' throat for nothing.. We are not even in the midst of whatever is happening out there in real world.. And all this verbal duels..They mean nothing whatsoever..           but implied  for having a opinon    
			
			It's just initiated it's own thread: 
Clearly way superior to us mortals!!       
     			 			Hello all, 
Is anyone here interested in philosophy .. from Greek to modern to  post-modern... From Socrates, Epicurus via Plato, Marcus Aurelius,  Spinoza, Descartes, KANT, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein to Derrida... If  yes, then a discussion  thread can be merited..   
Thanks,   
Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum, 
Red Rackham's treasure and here we come 		         
			
			I would prefer you people read my Eastwood quote and the related posts and not twist the words... I had said people with opinions have assholes and so on... And herewith I cease to comment on the issue of assholes since it is as useless as a pair of dog's bollocks dipped in coal tar and served out with a teaspoon full of Worcestershire sauce early in the morning...       
Or like that          How is your post related to this thread ?
		    the difference is remarkable. In Gaza, the Israelis gave up their settlements, but in the West Bank, the Israelis are increasing their settlements. And the Israeli government has long ago declared East Jerusalem to be a part of the ""State of Israel"". THIS is one of the reason why many Palestinians are gradually favouring the ONE-country solution. Arabs in ""Israel-Mainland, East-Jerusalem, West-Bank, Gaza"" will in a not so distant future be ""a-pari"" with the Jews. Do not forget that even Israel-Mainland has cities like Akko which are fully Arabic-speaking and inhabited mainly by Arabs.    
And you now may be asking why many Palestinians who otherwise detest Israel are ready for such un-secured prospects ?  The answer is easy. Most Palestinians know that Israel has a decent and well organised judiciary which IS independent and IS above politics. That Israel internally in heaps of ways IS democratic.    
It is similar with the famous ""right of Palestinian refugees to return"". While relatively rich Israel had to take almost TWO millions (where to exactly ?) the West Bank had to take some ONE million people,  and influx it could never digest !    
Just look at another rubbish. People say that a rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem is not possible without destroying the el-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rocks. This is simply, to put into the words of Peter Scholl-Latour ""another lie around the holy land"". It you get into the Haram-al-Sharif"" you will see that ridiculous forest between the Wailing Wall and the el-Aqda Mosque.  More than enough space for a new temple !
		    I hope migro is not  putting this all on the label       Exactly, this is, not surprisingly, just like the refrain we heard in apartheid South Africa
		    There are no oppressed natives in Northern Cyprus, but Turkish Cypriot, whose existence was rescued and is secured by Turkish troops. Who took control in the mainly Turkish inhabited North. True, many Turkish Cypriots from the South fled to the North and many Greek Cypriots from the North to the South. The Turkish intervention in 1974 was based on the Treaty of Zurich, and Turkey operated as one of the ""guarantee powers"" when the Greek Cypriot military regime, which had toppled President Archbishop Makarios III, wanted to unite Cyprus with Greece. The only territory which even by Turkish definition is GREEK-Cypriot but controlled by the Turkish Army is VAROSHA, the former tourism capital just south of Famagusta/Gazimagusa
		    It IS a difference !  Most countries, at least defacto, have fully accepted and recognized the State of Israel in its 1948-67 borders.    
Most however do NOT accept Jerusalem (even West Jerusalem) as IL-capital 
Most do NOT accept Israeli settlements in the West Bank 
Most do NOT accept the Israeli annexation of Arab East Jerusalem   
So that 
-  Israeli products from ""actual"" Israel 
-  Palestinian products from the West Bank 
-  Palestinian products from East Jerusalem 
-  Palestinian products from the Gaza Territory 
-  Israeli products from WEST Jerusalem 
are all accepted   
Migros is not doing politics and so does and will offer products  
from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, 
but wants to allow interested customers a decision about to buy 
or not
		    Israeli Arabs (Muslim or Christian) will declare a factory of them  on the West Bank as an ""Arab"" factory, and so their products will NOT be regarded as ""produced in Israeli settlements on the West Bank"".
		    You might as well mention that Israeli Arabs have seats in the Knesseth, and that the Israeli judiciary is on the (praiseworthy) records for many decisions in favour of Arabs in Israel/Palestine.       A) The small boy is dressed as a normal boy, no hint to a ""suicide bomber""   
B)  The Republic of Kosovo is fully recognized and officially supported with administration experts by Switzerland.  And of course, as soon as there will be Kosovari products on the market they will be clearly marked accordingly. Not least to attract the vast customer-base of Kosovo-origin.    
B2)  there ARE products from Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and Macedonia on the market here, and they all are precisely marked. Again not least as they will be preferred by people of ...... origin
		    Probably did help to end the regime.   
Were you in South Africa recently?   
Huge ""no-go"" areas in all the major cities. 
Average 50 murders each day. 
Highest rape rate in the world.   
I am no longer sure I did the correct thing in supporting Apartheid-era trade embargoes       I am sure that you DID do the RIGHT thing !  Many of the problems of the today are not coming out the heavens but are the result of bungling problems by the Apartheid regime. And let's not forget that as a result of the regime-change, lots of experience and capable law enforcers had to get out of their service, not for being racists but simply for having been whites.     
Add to this that many murders which took place in South Africa before the change simply were not even reported. To state that South Africa already in the Apartheid time was in a deep mess is hardly an exaggerated assumption.
		    Yeah, you are right. This one will be more related.   
Hope soon EU will ban duty free kosher pork imports from Israel, because it is also not related to fledgling nation.      
And remember: Zionists are Zionists   
They are not Jews.  
 They are not Christians.  
 They are not Muslims.          About ""To state that South Africa already in the Apartheid time was in a deep mess is hardly an exaggerated assumption""  I agree.   
About ""lots of experienced and capable law enforcers had to get out of the service...."" Exactly, this is a result I did not intend or wish for.   
It is easy to support an apparently important cause but nobody tells you what will be the result. 
For example,I supported banning lead in petrol but nobody told me they would replace lead with benzine which is a carcinogen with no known safe limit.   
So what is my point?  It is ""what will be the result of this labelling iniatitive""?  Worst case it will drastically reduce the number of jobs in the areas effected; who does that help & how? 
Anyway my experience is most people here do not read the labels which is why so many supermarkets have goods on the shelves with expired dates.
		      - 
but was/is an  inavoidable result which had to be endured and solved in dozens of  former colonies. And of course not just in law-enforcement but also in  the economy.      - 
lots of people told you about the inevitable  result of such power changes. My brother who was a car-mechanic opposed  the ""leadfree petrol"" thing even before it was started, for a variety  of technical and economic reasons.    
When most French plus  whomever was too closely linked with the ""administration de l'Algérie  Française"" suddenly left the country in 1962/63, problems erupted. And  as Ahmed Ben Bella failed to get things under control, Defence Minister  Houari Boumediène (Makhmoud Barkharouba) took power and pressed severe  changes through including the shifting of forces of the military police  into normal police service, forming there something like the Italian  Carabinieri. He prohibited begging and sent all caught beggars into  working camps in the Southern Atlas.       - 
There will be almost NO effects. As simple as  this. The exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank to  Switzerland are limited. Exports from Arab companies in the West Bank  are not threatened, but might profit from there no longer being a  suspicion against them.
		 
			
			I grew up as a ""White"", even if being titled ""Mulatto"" by lots. But was a bit shocked when realising that I in South Africa would have been registered as a ""coloured"" .  And so of course did not like such a country.    
In regard to South Rhodesia I still remember the famous and arrogant statement of Ian Smith ""there will not be majority rule in Rhodesia in 100 years"".  While Mugabe was the worst choice later, a Htlerian like Ian Smith was even worse       Racist.....Mmmmmm....Right                
			
			This thread is not the Israel-Arab thread, but about selective product labeling, at a stretch: the effect of boycotts.   
I'll repeat the question: Migros made a political decision that will reduce sales & cost jobs for Arabs (and jews) in the west bank. What's the point ?
		 
			
			I was wondering about that BDS, declared above to be ""racist"", and found their WEBsite =       but nothing racist at all. They however call Israel racist. This of course can be disputed, but to call racist whomever opposes Israeli politics goes a bit too far. The BDS is opposed to the occupation of Palestine. This again is not a racist position.    
The Israeli government and its diplomatic service have a long tradition to play the ""racism-card"" as soon as Israel gets criticized in the media or in public anywhere  (even if the criticizm is done by Jewish journalists)
		    Migros did NOT make a political decision but a marketing decision. At Migros, people think that people will rather buy MORE WestBank products when they can be sure that the products in question are not from Israeli settlements.   
I know about Arab West Bank companies exporting to Western Europe. I however don't know how heavy the exports of those Israeli settlements are.    
And now quite frankly, I can tell you what I would do if I was a Jew and  had a company in such a settlement exporting to Europe !  I would try to find an Arab partner who for a nice Baksheesh would ""purchase"" my stuff and export it under his name. Such ventures may not solve the political problem but may pave the way to better personal contacts    
			
			BDS is calling for the destruction of Israel, by having a single, Arab dominated country. calling Israel an Apartheid state is racist.   
There are plenty of occupying, discriminating, violent states in the ME - Israel is hardly the worst offender (not even in the top 5). Focusing on Israel is Racist.   
Thew west bank is a haven of peace and prosperity compared to Western Sahara, Syria & Kurdistan, to name but a few - yet Migros decided to focus on it (and also Gaza, which really shows how our of touch they are).
		    BDF in their WEBsite does NOT call for the destruction of Israel. It however calls for a TOTAL boycott against Israel, which I regard quite bluntly as WRONG. I in the past was opposed to boycotts against Israel (by the Arab League), South Africa (by many people), Libya (by many people), Iran (by Israel + the West.    
Many Palestinians who back in the early 80ies dreamed about the two-state solution, now are in favour of united ""State of Israel / Dawlat al Falastin"" with some federal structures. As they know that the Israel/Palestine of the future will either have an Arab majority or at least an Arab share practically equal to the Jewish share. In spite of many people in West believing that there are ""Jews"" on one side and ""Arabs"" on the other, it is clear that both Jews and Arabs are split into various ""groups""  which differ in quite many ways.  I am against dreams of an ideal world, but people praising modern Switzerland conveniently ""forget"" that modern Switzerland is the result of the relatively short but violent 1847/48 war. The German/French War of 1870/71, and the two World Wars each time threatened to destroy Switzerland but in effect helped to make Switzerland into what it is today. Not a union of Confederates loving each other dearly, but a union of citizens who live in the knowledge that it is the least worse option.     
While the totalitarian regime in Gaza for the time being is one of the worst problems without a solution visible at present. Hamas in typical ""oriental"" fashion believes that if you got elected ONCE, you are elected for eternity.    
Add to this that also Mr Abbas is not exactly pressing for new presidential elections. Hamas knows that the party is to lose its majority and Abbas knows that he is to lose the presidency.
		    Which is racist.
		 
			
			If boycott is racist, what is embargo       Interesting !  So that all who in the past DID call for a boycott of / embargo against South Africa and all those who now call for a boycott of / embargo against  Iran are racists      to me a new definition          .....are you for real??
		    with all due respect to the history and all, you should be allowed to criticize Israel without having to be accused of antisemitism...or?    
(I don't support the labeling though, either you sell it or you don't...another reason I don't shop at Migros... )
		 
			
			Good summary, thanks
		 
			
			Do you mean we should have a system as advocated by Ayn Rand?      BDS is not criticising Israel - it calls for Israel's destruction.    
Iran is not boycotted (private) but under Embargo (a political tool used by governments).   
An Embargo is rarely successful - Cuba & Iran are good examples.
		 
			
			just  what exatly are this produts, i want to see them with my own eyes
		 
			
			Dozens of people including seniors, children, women are slaughtered daily in Syria, and look what you are arguing about.   
Who cares if Migros label goods from the settlements or not. 
If I am not mistaken it is privately held company. They are entitled to do what ever they wish (within the limit of laws...)  
and it is my choice whether I would like to buy there or not, and whether I would like to buy such products or not.
		    I don't agree much on this (didn't check all the site's info, but my first impression of a bleeding squeezed orange on their homepage did suffice, i.e. the old antisemitic stereotype of the greedy jew that does everything - killing and bloodsucking included - for the almighty dough). So or the org is stupid and has no clue about what is racist and antisemitic, or it does it on purpose.        Well, what is really sad is that in 90% unfortunately they are right in their judgement. Horrible misleading misinformation is the least (also in this thread), open antisemitic stereotypes is the norm.    
As a result, honest criticism from inside and from abroad holds a very difficult position.
		 
			
			- 
I heard about this fact in London in 1972, from a Brit who for some decades had lived in South Africa       
- 
The right to vote and elect is granted in the 1848/74 constitution of the Swiss Confederation,  and that as a result of the Napoleonic invasion, Vaud, Aargau, Thurgau and Ticino became full cantons was never a problem       
- 
And WHO decided about whether you were qualified to vote ?  Democracy does not mean to ""give votes out like confetti"" but it means that EVERYBODY is allowed to vote     
- 
What the black population wanted was a black majority government. Yes, many or most in the meantime realised that voting for Mr Mugabe was not a good decision. But what about it !  The Italians voted Mr Berlusconi into office three times     
- 
NO, that people in former Eastern Europe got the right to vote was NOT the reason for the Euro crisis, and Greeks and Italians have had the right to vote for many decades  (since 1945)       
As Winston Churchill said  ""Democracy is the least bad political system""
		    True.   
On its territory. And Israel grants rights to all its citizens - Arabs, Drusi, Jews, Armenian or whoever.   
The problem is what happens in the Westbank, Gaza and in P.A. And sure one could/should improve the situation, regardless of any question about how sick democracy is in quite all Arab countries the UN do not give a damn about.   
True also that KKL's role around 1948 is not always morally a 100% integer, but this does not really infect P.A.'s and the Westbank's situation at all.   
So the link with Cyprus (ethnic cleansing), Apartheid (creation of homelands and a 2-class-society) is misleading in the best case.     
Settlements are not the real problem (even if ownership conversion, land purchase e.g. are mostly dubious); the problem is that - unlike in the State of Israel - Arabs are excluded from settling there.   
Asking for a ""boycot"" infects both, settlers and even more local Arabs, and serves old antisemitic stereotypes in word and fact. So attention with those promoters.        His party got a relative majority and due to coalition the Parliament voted Berlusconi. Same situation with Germany's Merkel, who is far more harmful than Berlusconi ever could be.
		    Migros originally as Migros AG was a privately owned company but then was turned into a co-operative owned by 100'000s of its customers. Votes of the ""Genossenschafter"" over the years made it clear that Genossenschafter & Kunden alike want to know where stuff comes from
		    BDS according to their own statements only wants Israel to act differently. They do not want to ""destroy"" Israel.  You might prove your point if you can.   
So that governments who place embargoes against specific countries are racist as well. Boycotts are started as political tools of private people in order to pressurize countries to change their ways
		    BDS don't want israel to ""act differently"", they want israel to become a state where jews are minority. That MEANS destorying israel. The antisemtic symoblism in their sites alos leave little romm to doubt.   
Embargoes are political tool and, in themselves, not racist. I provided examples which you ignored.
		    Fixed that for you       Indeed, I'm far more concerned if the stuff I buy is OGM or not.   
Tom
		    Great! Will buy more of those.
		    >  I do not find ANY hint that they want Israel to become a state where Jews are minority .... please provide evidence 
> anti.-semitic ?  you know well that the Arabs are more Semitic than the Jews ?  Who are heavily mixed with Germanic people

			In principle, I think the labeling of products to indicate the origin is a good thing, then the consumer can decide whether to buy or not, and so forth.    
I will admit that I find the label ""Occupied Palestinian Territories"" to be more than a label, to me it reads like a clear (political) statement aimed at stirring s*it, but so be it, Migros can do whatever they think it's best for their business.    
Not knowing much about the BDS, who they are, etc., and having read with interest the various opinions on the thread, I clicked   (in French) and I read: ""In the words of Omar Barghouthi, one of the main promoters of BDS,  "".   
Then I go on to Google the guy, and I read that he moved to Israel and enrolled in Tel Aviv University to obtain a MD in Philosophy, all the while conducting an academic boycott campaign against Israel.   
Clown. That's all I have to say. I will be exercising my consumer rights and shop elsewhere if this show goes through.    
P.S. Wolli, I think your idea of Israeli-Arab commercial partnerships is           Quote: Wollishofener      &gt; I do not find ANY hint that they want Israel to become a state where Jews are minority .... please provide evidence...             Yes, criticism from various sides have this kind of result in their claims.  E.g. granting full civil rights (i.e. voting rights) to all Palestinians in a one-state-model could be a problem if that means that up from tomorrow antidemocratic, at least partially antisemitic parties would come to power. Personally I would not be so sure about that, as Israeli Arabs generally are not antidemocratic and Palestinians within the P.A. admins know from their own nasty experience that Arab authorities mostly treat Arabs like trash (and I say that as an admirer of Yassir Arafat; I'm among those who criticize Israel for not granting full citizenship to Westbank inhabitants but I do see its point) and not like citizens at all.  Among those (and I am with them again) who criticise the fate of fleeing civilians driven out of their homeland and/or expulsion i.e. Nakba plus inhuman treatment by all but all the Arab neighbor brother states (only a few changed that way of considering their Palestinian brothers a trash) you can find also people who want to relocate all the refugees' grandchildren, grown up in misery and dictatorship, partially indoctrinated with Hitlerian ideology, to Israel/Palestine again, which is impossible and inacceptable not only for Israel.   An ""anti-zionistic"" criticism blames Israel not only for occupying the Westbank, but for taking the homeland i.e. for existing. So in no way Israeli Jews should have any right at all, neither in whatever settlement, nor in Israel in its actual borders.   So yes, faking to promote Palestinians' i.e. human rights in a context of Israel lacking in democracy is sometimes nothing but an expression of deep antidemocratic and anti-semitic ideology. As the only way for Israel to be a “good democrat” i.e. “a good Jew” would be that one of getting overpowered overnight by some 10 million Arab refugees from abroad Palestine, i.e. its Jewish population have to disappear or to die or both.       Quote: Wollishofener      ... &gt; anti.-semitic ? you know well that the Arabs are more Semitic than the Jews ? Who are heavily mixed with Germanic people ...          True, but - as in many semantic aspects of a language - the original signifier got a shift in its meaning.       Quote: Wollishofener      ... &gt; anti-.... symbolisms ? what exactly ?  ...          E.g. the orange, but not only.  If I seriously want to criticise somebody or something, I would honestly not use any kind of old nasty prejudices against those somebody.  It's more than bad taste, as this is Nazi style pure.  It's not as if somebody depicted a Swiss cheese or chocolate to criticise Switzerland, as in the opposite to that the image of the bloodsucking Jew caused millions of deaths.        -- a hint ? BDS has been saying it for years.  .      Jews are heavily mixed with Germanic people ? tell that the Jews who were forced out by antisemites all over the middle east. The land, property & money that was stolen from them would cover a land much larger than Israel.       now its your turn to prove your point - Did Kennedy embargo cuba because he didn't like cubans ? Was the embargo on Iraq because the west doesn't like   ? please provide examples for racist embargoes (should be easy, if it ""very often"" racist).    
Hang on - The Embargo on Zimbabwe is racist. A   said that.    
Embargo is a very weak political tool, likely to harm the innocent. Boycott is the the more effetive, civilian version.   
I'm off to enjoy some gold labeled       - 
I looked it through and do NOT find any hint about a destruction of Israel, only about urging Israel to accept its 1948-67 borders      - 
you must be aware of how many German Jews were higly decorated Germans in WW-I. And quite many Jews in the Germany of the 1930ies were German patriots and stayed on in spite of all evidence (""Wenn das der Führer wüsste"" ! ).  The taylor of my granddad in Konstanz even in 1935 resisted the appeal of Granddad and his cousin in Zürich to move over to Zürich-Enge. Both almost had to take him by his hairs over to Zürich. Luckily enough, they succeeded before it would have been too late. Time matters. Granddad grew up just 500 meters from the German borders and too many of his ""realGerman"" friend   in the 30ies. Granddad died in 1955 and his taylor almost at the same time. There was not yet the AHV and both had been working almost up to their end.               Kennedy was NOT in favour to embargo Cuba. He only A) had to continue what was the apparent command of the day  and B) had to react to the USSR stationing rockets on that island   
The anti-Iraq embargo was launched and pressed through by the USA  and only adopted by some of its allies, and in the end, due to the intransigence of Mr al-Takriti by the others   
Most embargoes and boycotts are alibi-exercises for those who launch them      - 
the embargo of Zimbabwe is bad. ANY kind of restriction of the regime might be good, IF managing to make a difference between regime and countrx      - 
Maybe, but BOTH ways may hit the wrong people.       Hope it is some good Barkan Cabernet-Sauvignon     
			
			Your reply completely ignored my post: 
1. BDS calls for ""right of return"" of 10,000,000 ""Palesitinians"" to Israel - a de-facto destruction of Israel. 
2. Your rambling story about German Jews has nothing to do with Arab & Muslim rampant Antisemitism. 
3. You did not provide any examples of Racist Embargoes. 
4. The link was for Psagot, not Barkan. There are a lot of wineries to choose from.
		    - 
A) Let's be clear, I if I were an Israeli Jew would insist on two things. A) the Israeli armed forces to retain control,  and B)  Israel-Palestine be split into states/cantons with self-administration like the Cantons in Switzerland, with their own parliaments and governments, and the Federal government being relatively powerless 
B)  There cannot be ""antisemitic parties"" on either side as what Jews and Arabs share is that both are SEMITES. What you have in your mind is ""anti-Jewish""  
B-2)  your argument however makes it clear that the Jews in such a country would and will press for all major federal power to be with the Senate !         - 
up to the present, the WestBank still, at least officially pursues the idea of the two state solution and so refuses to become citizens of the State of Israel           - 
I have been to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Israel, and think that relocating some 3 to 4 mio people to ANY of these countries is completely impossible         - 
YES, Israel became what it is due to the holocaust, which forced the surviving Jews to flee to British Palestine.          - 
Be clear, not only is Israel internally fully democratic, the Israeli judiciary in the past repeatedly has shown its independence from politics and its remarkable objectivity.             1)  alright, in this you are right in so far as even a return of 100'000 is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE.  looks as if those folks have never visited the area they speak about 
2)  Semites can hardly be ""anti-Semitic"". What you however, quite correctly speak about is the widespread ""anti-Jewish"" factor 
3)  No, as A) I regard embargo and boycotts if done on political grounds as silly and stupid 
4)  oh sure, I when in TLV in Nov-94 sampled quite many different wines. They indeed are good.  Amazing is to see the similarity of Israeli and Lebanese wines !  And to see that Beirut, Tel Aviv and Alexandria are the three ""Eastern Peals"" of the Mediterranean.  Regrettable that they due to politics are not on friendly terms.  
4-B)  Impossible to repair ?  A)  Algeria and France after the bloody and traumatic Algerian War of Independence (1951 to 62) gradually, at least more or less, found together again.  B) France and Germany in the post WWII period over the decades also found together.  C) Whenever the Cyprus crisis is not solved, Greece and Turkey are gradually finding together . ---- All these things are not harmony&paradise, but simply overcoming the deadly past 
4-C)  Egyptian wines have nicely improved over the years. But under present circumstances I don't know what will happen, whether Egyptian wine is to go the route of Californian wine under the prohibition of the 1920ies    
--  back to 4 )  ...   interesting is to see that the Lebanese wine industry survived both Israeli invasions and fundamentalist dominance in the Beka'a in an amazing way
		 
			
			For me, Migros should first have a look at its own commerical policies like putting strawberries on the market in February that come from plantations in Spain with poor working conditions (esp. to the migrants from Africa) or asparagus from Mexico....   
my 2 cents       A)  Migros is trying to put into its range as many good things as possible. And NOT purchasing things from Spain and Mexico  would ROB the chance of any employment from people overthere and be negative for people overhere   
Migros helped to overcome the dictates of the ""seasons"" and the dicates of the areas right around here.  .... delMonte pineapples in those tin boxes were the only pineapples available !  Melons were something you got during the two weeks in summer on the Toscana coastline.  On the Toscana coastline you had a choice of a dozen flavours, but back home you had to chose between strawberrry and chocolate. In autumn, people preserved potatoes and apples in the cellar in various ways to have the stuff throughout winter. If your suggestion is to return to to those times it is NO. And if you want to rob the ill-paid workers there their minimal income as you would like ""human rights"" a no again
		 
			
			Of course, you should all be consuming food grown locally, right? What with the Swiss and its swooning expats being so 'green' and all.    
			
			So. We've been to Algeria, France and Germany. Visited some, doubtless, excellent wineries. 
Lots of antiSemitism and racism encountered along the way. 
We've been round and round in circles debating the minutiae of how the Palestinians/Arabs/Muslims are the nasty/evil/bad guys and the Israelis are the eternally persecuted and blameless good guys under relentless attack. 
Mordor vs the Shire. 
Frankly, after many years working in Syria, Jordan and Turkey and trying to objectively observe the situation I do not buy this. 
Concerted obfuscation, stonewalling and outright denial of the facts is rampant, especially from the Israeli side.  
(This is certainly not to say that the Arabs are blameless.) 
The Israelis have constructed a very well integrated system of plausible denial. 
The Diaspora is expertly versed in the game and will flock to the cause at the slighest provocation, imagined or otherwise. 
The propaganda machine is well oiled, extensive and highly practised. 
You've got the M series tanks and the F series aircraft and nuclear weapons. 
The funding from the US is, effectively, unlimited.  
A classic case of the tail wagging the dog. 
You are not in any serious danger of being over-run.  
You have become a very worthy front line testing ground for advanced weapons system at a suitably safe distance from the US.   
I went into Denner yesterday and was tempted to buy a packet of new potatoes until I noticed that the country of origin was Israel. 
I put them back on the shelf. I will continue to do so. You do not get my support. 
Your victimhood is transparent and it does not convince me. 
When Israel stops it's suppression in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza strip,  
cancels all new settlements, dismantles all illegal settlements and withdraws to the 1948 borders I will become a friend of Israel. 
If Israel is prepared to show good faith and begin to show willing to accommodate a just resolution to this impasse then I will certainly be a customer for Israeli products. 
Until then, don't ever count on my, albeit insignificant, support. 
I will campaign against you at any opportunity. 
The plethora of ignored UN resolutions calling for specific action from Israel is long.   
Conversely, from the Palestinian/Arab side you need to curtail all offensive action. 
You have got a cast iron case for your own independent country. 
However, I think you need to bite your tongues and hang on for a little longer, otherwise forever. 
The Palestian cause has been hijacked in many Arab countries that I have worked and is used as an excuse to prop up a tyrannical regime.  
In some Arab countries, the Palestinians are viewed with fear by the conservatives as they have, as a displaced people by necessity, become assertive, highly educated, well travelled and entreprenurial.  
They have become the new Jews. 
Their potentisal influence is seen as a threat to the established order, but at the same time they are convenient rallying point  
for a life and death Arab/Israeli standoff. 
Palestinians (from first hand accounts I've heard) danced with joy in certain areas of New York on hearing of the 9/11 attack. 
Made no friends there. 
Many were active supportes of Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait. 
Made no friends there. 
Sacrifices will have to be made by both sides. 
One alternative to the East Jerusalem problem might be that the the whole city would be completely taken out of Israeli or Arab control. 
It could be some kind of totally independent entity, funded by all, but not controlled by Jew, Arab, Christian or any other religious group. 
It would allow free access to all religious groups.          But not Israel or the West Bank / Gaza?   
Oh well, maybe the rest of the piece addressed the issues raised in an objective fashion, but unfortunately it was tl;dr    
356 rockets have been fired into Israel this year from the fun loving terrorists. So far.    
Down with their potatoes sold at Denner! Down with the Bedouin who pick them! Up the Pontificating!!!
		    Tell us why you think they send rockets?
		    Are you buying Turkish products ?   
btw - what did you do in Syria ? They have yummy Pistachios (sadly not available here)
		    Groan? That's your answer?    
I'll give you an answer. It is awful that people have to use violence to try to make a point, it is terrible that human being die because of it. It is something that should NEVER happen, no matter from which side they are.   
Only psychopath wake up in the morning with the wish to kill someone for the thrill, otherS do it by revenge, desperation, anger, protection, etc.   
Why palestinians terrorists are doing it? Be c they are a bunch of psychopath, all together? Or because of anger, protection, desperation, revenge?    
For what?
		    1948-67 borders? 
... naaaah
		    Off Topic.
		 
			
			So then whats the difference between terrorism and militarism?
		    Because they do not have anything bigger?
		    Ok, I'll bite. They used to send suicide bombers but the wall mostly put an end to that. Ever witnessed a suicide bomber's devestation?    
Terrorists have a choice to engage politically with their adversaries but decide to take an Evil path instead. Do reply, I look forward to it, but maybe in the appropriate thread, eh?
		    An Israeli bulldozer an create quite a bit of devastation as well, you know.          The history behind it that I am talking about. They didn't start bombing for the fun of it, there is a trigger. Even psychopath have a trigger.
		 
			
			Know what??....UR absolute right Mr. Brittas!! 
Spose I should have omitted the first 2 paragraphs!       
			
			On seconds thoughts...Mr. Brittas...Maybe I should have deleted the LAST paragraph instead!

Let me guesss: you will boycott these houses as well and won't buy them, even if you get x10 cumulus points ?
		    Not as much as a suicide bomber on a downtown bus, for rizzle.    
Am surprised how quickly many are not quick to remain impartial to Migros' muddled communication.
		    Really? You are surprised? Please.... A guy with your intelligence is well aware of it.   
If migros took this decision it is just the proof that this topic doesn't leave anyone indifferent.   
Isrealian army does the same thing the terrorists Palestinians do: kill people, kill innocent victims.
		    militarism has an ""a""   
terrorism has an ""o""   
So as different as apples & oranges
		    What do you think the consequences Migros' new idea will have on the people being boycotted? Who exactly will suffer as a result of muddled indignation?    
If sales drop the people affected will be those at the bottom of the pile: the harvesters, packers and hired hands, who are not war mongering Zealots but poor people - often from Arab / Bedouin backgrounds - looking to make an honest wage. They often support extended families with the higher wages they can command working rather than claiming tiny benefits. Having worked with such teams in the past I know how dedicated they are to doing right, working under difficult environmental, social and financial conditions and all the while holding their heads high. They'll be the ones losing their employment.   
Where's your social justice now?    
I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about.   
Comparing a politically governed and highly disciplined military with Terrorists is so crass I'm almost lost for words. If this is the level of the discussion...   
Have a problem with Israel? Complain to your political representative. Draw a referendum, but don't blindly jump on bandwagons thinking you're doing the world a favour.
		    I would like to send this message to Migros.  I'll have to have it translated. 
Thanks !
		 
			
			The Migros with this move are trying to abide by the laws of the Swiss State. 
The Swiss Law says that all fruit and vegtables sold in Switzerland must have a label which shows where they were grown.   
Up until now the West Bank is according to the UNO still not part of Israel. 
So how can the Migros, label these products from the West Bank, without breaking Swiss Law?   
Sorry about coming back to the ""Local thread""   
Salut Zämma
		    Thank you for bringing the tread back to topic.   
1. Migros will not use a semi-neutral ""West Bank"", but ""Occupied Palestinian Territories"" which is both political and wrong (Gaza is not occupied). 
2. The West Bank & Gaza are part of a   with Israel - No certificates of origin are required. It's perfectly legal to label them ""Israel"".
		    Yes, of course. They blow up buses and restaurants, try to make planes explode, kill foreigners in international airports, ...   
... every day planned in detail in IDF's morning briefings.      
Cheers
		 
			
			Wearing a mod hat and in the interests of transparency I've deleted a post from Nil which linked graphic images without an appropriate warning. Preferably we can discuss matters on EF using reasoned argument, experience and measured responses rather than simply showing pictures of mutilated people. That ping pong could go on   and leads us nowhere.   
Please remember to consider the dignity of victims  of atrocities on all sides before exploiting their fate when you can't find the words to communicate otherwise.   
---   
/Mod Hat
		    Nil, I did not say that IDF would be unable to be a perfect war machinery,   
of course it hopefully is, in war.   
Incidents and loss in human lifes is however not the aim of a military campaign unless we are talking military corps.     
One of the differences between IDF and Palestinian terrorism (and I do not write, say or think that all Palestinians are terrorists) is that terrorism aims at undistinctive terror withour any military strategy or need, violence not as a means of ""higher"" pursuit but as an aim itself.   
Meanwhile the ones try to keep losses down, the other aims at increasing it.     
Apart from any aspect of deontology and morality.       
Cheers.
		    Dignity is also to not refuse to admit why and how and from who they were victims and died from.   
Telling me that Palestinians terrorists are worst than a bunch of ""official"" military guys who kill children, women and men randomly with rockets is not comparable is a joke.   
The results are the same!   
Death of innocents victims!
		    You could say the same thing, in this logic, regarding traffic's victims.  
No one really doubts that most victims are innocent.   
The point is not that one.        It is infact important to ask for the why, how and from whom.   
But voyeurism is completely dislinked from that question and truely violates the principle of dignity towards the victims, but also towards a user or ""spectator"".        The ""bunch of official military guys"" do a bad job if they kill children and do not get in serious truble only the children and their families, but themselves, too.   
A terrorist's goal - whatever his maybe also understandible problems could be - is to produce victims.   
Slight difference, I'd say.
		     
Well on further thought I would say that the military often win campaigns that they start. 
Whereas I cannot think of any examples of terrorists achieving their aims; maybe you have some examples?
		 
			
			I hate what the terrorists are doing, but I still didn't have an answer of why they are doing it!    
And why migros is putting stickers of origins on occupied territories products? So that people know where it is from. It is in the hands on the buyers to decide if they want to support this or not.    
When I buy my olive oil from th Palestinian territory, I am aware that I am supporting their economy to develop despite the embargo and difficulties made by Israel.
		 
			
			Irgun and Stern Gang?       
			
			I was quite sure that this case would have been coming up.   
Yes, there are examples in history where terrorism had a certain success, beyond violence itself.   
And - yes again - true also that in remote and recent history not only a few orgs witnessed radicalist tendencies in parts of its supporters, that can sometimes be blamed for pure and real terrorism.
		    One (disputed) example of terrorist success in 70 years.  Makes you wonder why people adopt this terroroism strategy; because they are not very smart to begin with I suppose?          To be pedantic (as you are indeed yourself) is Gaza itself actually mentioned in the article?   
And as the UN itself recognises Occupied Palestinian Territories, why the hell shouldn't Migros, or indeed anyone else?
		 
			
			ANC? 
Viet Cong?        FLN? 
HUJAHADEEN?   
Need more?      Have you.....?          Have you......?    So. Ur a mod when it's convenient to censor another's input, but the 2nd goalkeeper on your favoured side when play runs ur way.??          If sticking to facts, rather then fantasy is pedantic - so be it.   
1. Had you bothered to read the article you would have seen: ""customs union between Israel and the West Bank/Gaza Strip""   
2. Migros made political decision which won't benefit anyone, just like the UN regularly does.
		    HUJAHADEEN???   
Completely failed to achieve anything against the West in the last 11 years   
They ony prevailed against the Red Army due to superior American training & weapons (including - it is claimed - up to 40 Billion US$ of aid); militarism not terrorism.   
FLN?  That was 60 years ago.   
Viet Cong - they were not terrorists; they were the North Vietnam military!  The North Vietnamese Communist Party approved a ""people's war"" on the South at a session in January 1959 and this decision was confirmed by the Politburo in March. 
An example of succesful militarism not terrorism.
		    I notice you've edited your post. Yes and yes to your two questions on my experience. And beyond. You?   
As per moderating transparency, if you feel graphic images of mutilated bodies have something to offer this topic - rather than you know, words - and the moderating was inappropriate, do contact Admin and complain. I'm sure his response will be prompt. On the other hand, you could be just trolling.
		    Not your article. The original one.      I'm sure Migros are honoured to be compared to the U.N.
		    1. look it up. I may be wrong, but it doesn't happen often. 
2. Where's the honor in the UN ? If Migros was as corrupt & dysfunctioning it would have been out of business.
		 
			
			Since I disagree with israel's politics I actively boycott buying any of the products originating there.    
Yes, I'm a label reader.     
I skimmed through this thread and nowhere found a list of products frequently originating in israel or the occupied territories. At the Migros I've found:   
Raisins 
Grapefruit juice 
Pine nuts 
Dates 
Figs 
Fresh herbs like dill, rosemary, mint, basil, thyme, etc. 
Potatoes   
Anything else?
		 
			
			Why does anyone in Europe, not knowing anything about the region but what they see in the news, would boycott products?   
I am quiet shocked at this behavior.  
Of course everyone should have an opinion, but the same people who want to boycott Israel should stop buying their clothes made in China by 10 year old kids, should stop buying at McDonald because american corporation is a militaristic enterprise, stop allowing their country from buying oil from terrorist states etc...   
We can go on for ever. In the end, it seems people will just boycott when their comfort zone is not affected.        An over-dramatization, surely.    It is our choice as consumers where we spend money; no-one needs to justify their reason for boycotting whatever they deem worthy of boycotting.
		    Exactly...as long as their comfort zone is not affected...
		    Nice to see you posting again    
The hue & cry is over Justice: people boycotting whatever in the interests of improving the lot of a certain group often fail to understand the consequences. Where's the social justice in boycotting a producer if it results in the very same people we're trying to help ending up being penalised?   
The Arab Israel debate isn't going to be remedied by not eating Pomelos but by applying pressure to your political representative. It's too big an issue.
		    Some points of relevance  
A)  the org. in question does asks to boycott products from Israeli settlements on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem 
B)  Migros does not ask for any boycott but increases its origin labelling system  
C)  in Switzerland you do NOT have YOUR pol. rep. but due to the proportional system dozens of them (regardless of who you voted for) 
C-2)  Switzerland does NOT have influence on Israel 
D)  the org. mentioned believes that a boycott of size would take place. I believe that they are wrong.  and cannot succeed
		 
			
			Any idea which Migros store sells German submarine spares? Having an awful time getting hold of some bunk bed retaining slip rings for our new Israeli sneaky underwater vessel.
		 
			
			1 month ago, I had lunch at a very nice restaurant.  An Arabic restaurant south or Acre in the North of Israel, owned by a friend of my cousin, I guess you would call him a Palestinian or Israeli Arab.     
He sat with  and joined us at the table, chatted happily, and we with him.  We then filled up the car with petrol from his garage, below his restaurant.  According to world media he is oppressed in this Apartheid Zionist Genocidal state.     
Occupied Territories is a term which is actually a little incorrect, perhaps it is forgotten that we took over the land from Jordanian Occupation in 67, so it should actually be called ""disputed territory"".     
If we are going to start getting all involved in human rights, perhaps you shouldn't buy products from many of the Arabic countries, China (great history and continued human rights violations), and many North African countries.  Why don't people boycott those?  I wonder......?          Just get your significant other half to handcuff you to the bunk bed     
Again.            
So because you disagree with the politicians running a country, you vent your anger towards the farmers of the country??   
I dont get it    
cheers 
SC
		    Rule number one when venting out your empty frustration:   
1) If you can't kick the dog, go for the cat; same kind of deal, four legs, somewhat fluffy and an equally pointless exercise in futility       Yes.   
Tom 
...
		     
Which is why I refrain from starting a Revolution in the U.S.   
1) imagine the line at starbucks in the morning   
2) I would have to be home by 20:00 so I could read my son his bed time story.   
3) It might disrupt happy hour.
		    It's a Duty.          On reflection, the terrorists are not likely all psychopaths; many will be sociopaths, much like the leaders of our beloved corporations. But yeah, if the question was seeking a black or white answer, then yeah.

			The Swiss ambassador to the EU has warned that the union is taking an increasingly aggressive stance against Switzerland amid deteriorating relations between Bern and some its closest allies.         
			
			Look at a map of Europe in 1940 and a map of Europe in 2012: striking similarity.    
The EU is actually the fourth Reich, with only Switzerland, Norway and somehow the UK resisting.    
This is a fascist monster built up by and for Germany, with collaboration from the French.
		 
			
			Switzerland - and hopefully the UK - will have the last laugh when the Euro crashes and the Union crumbles. I just hope the peoples of these nations remember self-sustainability.   
History and current conditions, dictate that this is likely, and only those outside the Euro zone (US has it's own problems and an upcoming election), have half a chance of financial stability.
		 
			
			Must be those pesky Swedes and Finns and Danes!! 
A new Viking onslaught.!! Rape and Pillage!!         
			
			I think it is a typical distraction technique.   
The eurozone is in a terrible mess so the politicians are saying do not look at us - look at those terrible Swiss over there.     
I rarely quote the Bible but they had it right with ""And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye""             Are we talking splinters and planks here?
		    Thick as a plank....     
			
			I think that the North European countries plus Germany will try to save themselves, but maybe they will find that they created a monster which they cannot control, and from which they cannot escape.   
If I were a leader of a European country, I'd start investing heavily in the military and ramping up military training, because it is quite likely that this will end the usual way...
		 
			
			Guess this is a reciprocal agreement!            not to put too fine a point on it, but I suspect that neither the UK nor Switzerland would spend much time laughing if the Euro crashes, particularly not in the short term.  oh, and although the US economy is hardly setting a record pace for growth, it is in fact still ""recovering"" much more quickly than its Euro counterparts, mostly because much less of the US economy is tied to the Asian markets.
		 
			
			Problem is that Switzerland acknowledges European law but doesn't want a common jurisdiction because it would rock the foundation of the Swiss confederation.    
I think that in the end there will be a compromise because the EU and Switzerland need each other but CH will probably loose a couple of brownie points in Brussels.   
This article describes the relationship between the EU and Switzerland in a ""little"" less populist and agitating way (in german):  .
		    Why should Switzerland bow to a foreign entity? Our population has turned down pro-EU membership referendums several times despite the socialists wheeling out their factless arguments why we should. Switzerland isn't just economically strong because we're not in the EU, it's because the government and the people are generally seen as one and putting the nation first. We don't have this ""us and them"" attitude towards politicians here, because we all presumably know a few personally. Taking our own accountability seriously and knowing the consequences is a great way to get out of the current economic slump. Meanwhile in Brussels, they're waiting for the Greeks to see how much more money they'll need after their elections mid-month. Let's hope for Germany's sake that the communist doesn't get elected this time.
		 
			
			- 
The Swiss Federal Consitution guarantees that everyone is equal and born equal and has the same rights, just as in other democracies. ""Socialism"" ?  there are very conservative Cantons, but Cantons like Zürich, Basel and Geneva are at least as ""socialist"" as Bavaria and Rheinland-Pfalz, and the capital cities of these Cantons are rather to the left of München, Ulm, Stuttgart or Mainz.  
- 
alright, the Cantons in Switzerland control finance and taxation. Do not forget that in Switzerland the Union was created by the Cantons and not the other way round. Neither by a victorious power from accross the ocean. I am a staunch defender of true federalism which means that the members of the union control whatever possible      - 
This simply is distorting reality. In the Third Empire, the conquered nations could NOT participate in any decisions. Germans could only ""vote"" for one party. All clubs and associations were under the control of the NSDAP. The chancellor in Berlin did NOT have to care about possible defeats in parts of Germany.    
Add to this, that Switzerland never for two or three centuries was as closely linked to Germany as now. Britain may be, but Switzerland is NOT ""resisting"" but simply trying to maintain its basics.       - 
perfectly true, possibly more in case of Switzerland than in case of Britain. Most of Swiss exports go into the EU-area, most imports are from the EU area, and so, nobody in Switzerland would be laughing.    
Your USA-Europe comparison however is a bit ""critical"" as the USA does NOT depend as much on other world areas than most European countries do. And the vast home-market of the USA is often under-estimated. The USA is not ""autark"", true, but the reliance of the USA economy on outside markets is relatively minor. Just look at the airports. Those of NY/NJ (JFK/LGA/EWR) even together are no match to ATL or to CHI-ORD/MDW, in spite of the international position of the NY/NJ area. And provincial DFW/DAL is heavily ahead of far more cosmopolitan MIA/FLL  ..... yes, to underestimate the internal strength of the USA was THE major mistake of the Imperial leadership of Japan in the late 1941 !    Sadly and amazingly, US-Americans just need a serious kick in the ""worthiest"" to awake to their true potential.   
And what is the result of all this, you may ask ?  Simple. Switzerland, as not being in a position to get it through alone may get into a PEG with the US-Dollar !   This may sound strange right now, but why not. Switzerland did it in the 1940ies, 50ies and 60ies.  Sure, you can argue that realities have changed, which is true. But if you see that the USA-EastAsia axis is becoming the most important thing worldwide, it might make sense       All correct to some extent !  But what many people do NOT see is that most CH-citizens generally putting their Canton first     and not the union. What many people do not see is that you are first a citizen of your Canton and only as a result of this a citizen of the Union.    
And the party in Greece apparently likely to be the winners are NOT ""communists"" but just leftwing socialists. I expect the new Greek Premier to do his first visit to a foreign country to Paris to meet with Mr Hollande, the President newly elected who is likely to lose the parliamentary elections in HIS country. Please be aware that both the Giscardists and the ""Gaullists"" in France are much to the left of the CDU in Germany. Interesting times ahead in France !        I did not say that ""Switzerland (should) bow down to a foreign entity"", my post was neutral and so am I about this issue. If you had cared to look at the link I've added you could have noticed.
		    That could hurt... stuff like CERN greatly depend on EU funding...
		 
			
			EU can't do half as much Swiss bashing in one life time as The Local did in a couple of months of owning this place.
		 
			
			Freedom of speech isn't for me, apparently. Groan ahead.    
			
			I am implying that you are a wonderful genius that should be president or king of something but the world is so unfair, you have to push the groan button yourself. I love you.
		 
			
			I find it hard to believe that the Swiss government believed that there would be no response from the EU over their new immigration restrictions.  Certainly there will be intense pressure for a response within the EU from the nations who will suffer from the quotas, and this is a core piece of EU ideology.     
When you have the economic upper-hand like the EU, you can afford to impose ideological policy; in Switzerland's position, you're left with the pragmatism of trying not to get your arm twisted too hard.    
As in all its dealings involving adopting EU regulations, Switzerland has to make a decision as to the payoff between the cost of implementation versus keeping its major trading partner on favourable terms.  Economically, Switzerland needs the EU more than vice versa, so generally they are forced take the hit in return for the market access they need to survive - the potential cost of non-compliance is just too high.  Switzerland has to pick its fights carefully, in those areas where it would otherwise have most to lose.    
However, I'm not convinced Switzerland have picked their fight very well here - the imposition of the quota on this relatively insignificant group of people has relatively little to gain economically compared to what the EU could impose in revenge.  If they were talking about entirely rewriting their immigration relationship with the EU, then it might have been a fight worth fighting - but at the moment, the Swiss government are probably relieved that currently they are receiving only criticism and not action.
		    You need to look at this from the Swiss point of view.   
1. The Swiss made an agreement with the EU, to which both parties agreed. 
2. In this agreement was a clause. (should more EU8 arrivals come to CH higher than 10% of average last 3 years then action can be taken) 
3. The clause was triggered (because not 10% came but 3 TIMES the average) 
4. The clause has an expiry anyway, so it is time limited   
The issue here isnt 6000 people that arrived, even my cat knows its economically insignificant. The issue is the 'promise' that the Swiss government made with the public when they put a clause into the agreement. Thats why the political LEFT also support it. Its all about the principle.   
Since the EU agreed to this 'clause', what revenge should they have? Next time they should read the document and not sign it. The fact is, the EU doesnt have to read anything because they believe no one will take a stand against them - well this time they made an error and probably wont on the next agreement. The fact that they are already waving their arms around is bad enough.   
Support for the EU in CH is at all time lows, if the EU reacts to something they agreed to, expect that number to fall even more.
		    As I said - unfortunately when you're in the weaker position, you often have to trade off ideological principle for economic pragmatism.   That's exactly what Switzerland (and Norway) has been doing for years through the signing of bilaterals.      The fact is, the EU   take revenge even if they  .  Even though the EU agreed to the wording of that particular clause, there is nothing stopping the EU putting pressure on in other areas until they get what they want in this area.      As long as a fair proportion of those people's jobs depend on Switzerland keeping the EU sweet (as they will for the foreseeable future), the EU couldn't care less what they support.    
The EU only needs political leverage in Switzerland, not public approval.
		    I think you will find that public approval in Switzerland is very important. After all, its public approval that has kept CH out of the EU, at least from full membership.

			Switzerland's parks were at one time notoriously packed with heroin addicts. Lyssandra Sears meets with one of the world's leading drug experts to find out how the Swiss broke with convention and cracked the problem.                This is complete and utter rubbish.  To say that ""Switzerland's parks"" were ""packed with heroin addicts"" simply is a lie !   It was just one park, ""Platzspitz"", the one behind Zch-HB .  The other ones were not affected. Sensation-mongering and distorting realities cannot be the way !        There were ample parks around the country which were indeed packed with addicts....sure it wasn't every park but certainly many were affected.
		 
			
			The ""out of sight, out of political mind"" story surfaces again. The misery of drug abuse never diminishes, it just changes address frequently. A family member worked for one of the organizations supplying methadone and the amount of users has not reduced at all in recent years.
		    I recently noticed a visible increase in drug abusers loitering the streets as well as more random used needles laying around. I guess it going to be the early 90s all over again.
		    That's hardly an argument against the controlled contribution of methadone and heroin. The ""out of sight, out of PUBLIC mind"" issue was 
also brought forward by the junkies at that time as they feared assaults 
as soon as they disappear from the radar.   
So, what did change? 
- Almost no junkie kicks the bucket on the street 
- less people dying because of dirty stuff (percentage of heroin in the sold  
  substances on the street < 20%) 
- less stress in finding money and drugs, therefor less drug related-crime 
- less police forces chasing junkies through the whole city, instead they     
  can focus on more important things 
- less dirt, parks can be used again 
- SVP can't campaign at the cost of the junkies (one of the reasons why 
  the SVP isn't really popular in Zürich City and lost elections for decades)

			The Swiss parliament's upper house, the Council of States, wants to implement laws to ensure foreign workers receive the minimum wage and do not fall victim to 'wage dumping'.         
			
			can somebody explain this to me. if there is a minimum wage in winterthur, why do foreign workers who work there not have to receive this 'minimum wage'?    
			
			There are people who get half the minimum wage.    
Degree recognition. Years of experiences that only count under certain conditions, etc.
		 
			
			Meanwhile Germany is going the  .
		    For sake of discussion, what is your profession or more vague, your field of profession?
		    link does not work
		       
			
			There are no legal minimum wages. There are agreed wage levels for certain jobs, in national agreements between unions and employer associations.    
BUT a contract for a job gets passed about and for example a foreigner arrives here to demolish the Post Finance building in Bern and is paid 5 per hour, but the Post is paying a Swiss contractor nearer CHF 30 per hour. The worker's manager then claims he has a contract signed in Poland and does not come under the national agreement.    
Swiss Post Finance, and other decent companies, do not want to be ripped off and tarred with the slave manager brush, while the fat cats profit on the backs of imported slaves.
		 
			
			Switzerland to not exploit foreign workers? Who built the bridges, the tunnels, the freeways, the bunkers then? This great nation didn't get where it is today with predominantly Swiss folk getting their hands dirty when it had to be done. Paying low wages to hard up foreign laborers was the backbone of this country's economic success story. And don't you forget they didn't moan about it then. So don't come whining on EF how Hansueli across the office is earning more than you and does no work, that ethical horse has been flogged to death decades ago.    
			
			Are you really saying that because slaves were used in the past (and definitely not only in Switzerland) it is OK to continue to do so now? 
Paying under CHF20 is really not acceptable, and paying under 10CHF is slavery and shameful. Punkt Schluss. These loopholes have to be closed asap.
		 
			
			Oh ok. Since someone built a bridge 40 years ago, with money that was worth more in say Italy, today, I shouldn' expect enough to survive here?   
Plus, what they are trying to do isn't really in favor of foreign workers, it's to protect their own.
		 
			
			This is another example of a proposition that makes for good press but which already has safeguards in the current legislation. For non EU workers, your work permit is usually not approved if the salary offered by your employer is ridiculously low. So yeah, they might be sort of on the low end of the scale, but making 1k a month can't really happen if everything is above board.   
The only people this could help are EU citizens- who have the freedom of movement to pick and choose so aren't overly affected past their first job (my husband's (EU) first job smacked of non-Swiss wage dumping, he took it to get his foot in the door then promptly got something that paid the market rate) or trailing spouses, but they already have a second income and can also do the foot-in-the-door route as their permits are tied to the main income.    
JMO of course, and if someone was getting 8 francs an hour, that is because something else in the system wasnt above board with the employer or the permits.  Those are the parts of the law we need to enforce (company HR reporting etc), not some cosmetic minimum wage thingie.
		 
			
			There are ways around that- by 'importing' short-term workers on L permits, for a max of 6 months, feed and water them and give them basic free accommodation. Some get away with paying an awful lot LESS than even the 8CHF. Loopholes need to be closed- to protect those workers, and yes, to protect Swiss workers who cannot possibly compete. We all know that it is impossible to live a normal life here in CH on such a wage.
		    Well said 
I would add another reason, probably even more important: if such loopholes are not closed immediately (and the national council's right-wing said no) then a majority of the Swiss will reject further bilateral agreements with the EU (including me, this time it is NO/NEIN/NON/NO !!!!). Even the left might reject them.    
Then we all lose out but this is another story
		    Do you know an average wage in Bangladesh garment industry ?   
There is always loopholes..and new ones are coming.          For upto 90 days original EU don't even need a permit, just register by day 8 or for some trades before they start to work.
		     I think they meant that it was slave labor as it relates to living in Switzerland. Not as it relates to Bangladesh. Life is probably harder there, but the cost of living compared to what is made, is not possible to exist at 10 CHF an hour, except of course if one can make 10 CHF an hour and get teleported within a half an hour back to Bangladesh. Then it would be relevent.
		 
			
			But if workers from, say, Bangladesh, are brought here on short-term contract, fed, lodged and watered (in very simple basic accommodation), still paid their salary back home PLUS another small (in Swiss terms) sum that they can put aside over the 6 months- than those workers can go back and the money earned here will make a big difference for their family when they return. They have no contact with the outside world, don't go out apart from a quick walk around the factory- so don't 'need' money here - all is saved for return.    
Which is why they accept EXTREMELY low (in Swiss terms) salaries (in one case about 1.50 CHF per hour apparently). The point of the article is that this should no longer be acceptable and that a minimum should be enforced by law.
		    Yes but this is legal here as there is no minimum wage
		    Which is the whole point of the thread.

			A survey has found that the Swiss are even less in favour of joining the EU than they were last year.             
			
			Have to wonder how many people hear Eu and think Euro.
		    On joining EU, it is expected that the country adopts the Euro once all conditions have been met. Denmark and UK are two countries with opt out clauses.   
I think the Swiss know exactly what joining the EU means - not that it matters though, the PIIGS are all Euro AND EU.
		     ...and Sweden    
anyway, each country make a contract with the ""EU"", and most people just listen to SVP propaganda regarding how things will be after joining EU, and most of it is NOT true, like I said, each country can negotiate about the terms...   
...just like now with the bilateral agreements, Switzerland has all the nice things from EU for free       No, Sweden didnt negotiate a formal opt out clause hence why I didnt mention them.    
See here:   and here:       Well I disagree, SVP propaganda regarding the EU is/  totally spot on - its the EU that change contracts all the time and have trouble honouring existing ones (Maastricht, Sovereign bailouts). They also cant stand decisions that go against what the Brussels elite wants i.e. Lisbon treaty  . If you think you can just change and negotiate you are DEAD wrong - thats not the purpose of the EU. Its purpose is economic, social and political integration step by step - hopefully by then it will have fallen apart anyway  .    
Whats happening in the EU today (Chaos  ) together with the anti EU sentiment thats growing within the EU, is proof enough.      In the real world nothing is free. Its a mutual exchange and there have been many things the Swiss have taken already reluctantly i.e arm twisting/threats, vote for this or we will void this, this and this etc etc.       The EU does not have to negotiate with anyone in Europe, they are a $17trill economy. When you are that big, you DONT negotiate but dictate (with subtlety of course  ).   
Edit: I should also point out that CH has a trade DEFICIT with the EU and always had (the swiss buy more from EU than vice versa).

A smattering of 30 disparate economies will not survive an onslaught from the thugs who have usurped resources in Russia/China/India/Brazil.    
It has survived the US ascendancy over the past 4 decades. 
What planet do you live on?  
Most of the EU countries, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, France, UK (more or less despite Thatcherism), Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece and most of the East European members (despite the endemic corruption from the top down) have seen living standards rise substantially over the past decades.   
What metric do you use for the measurement of progress? The number of billionaires?  
How many have risen in Russia, China, Brazil and India over the past few decades? And how much has the quality of life improved for Joe Soap? 
Is this the type of trickle-down-economy you advocate? 
It has never worked and never will (with the possible exception of Switzerland, Singapore and a few exceptions....but ...exceptions prove the rule!!)

			Who works the longest hours??              WHO would love to join the EU right now ?          The E.U. is NOT Europe but just one of the organisations of the European continent.    
The Euro is an excellent idea which however was rather badly managed      - 
When the Bilaterals were started, it was just a way ouf of the EEA debacle. And the man who started it, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, only saw it as a stop-gap solution. It now however is exactly what Switzerland needs. ""Tailor-made"" actually       - 
ideal would be if the Cantons could go separate ways 
-- cantons with full EU membership 
-- cantons with partial EU membership (like Denmark & U.K.) 
-- cantons without EU membership 
-- cantons only using the CHF 
-- cantons using both the CHF and the Euro

		    Reading comprehension for the win. He mentioned the size of the economy as it impacts negotiating power.   
You're obviously very pro EU, unlike many of the Swiss, but calm down with your posts a bit. Lex is presenting a position, you're Internet-screaming your head off. Take it down a notch!
		    Agree with you totally. Maybe the voting population will wake up and realise what a monster the EU has grown to become, although as EU voters have already realised, they can't vote them out any more, they will just keep asking for referendums until they get the right answer (if indeed the ask at all) and have this backed by huge pro-EU propaganda budgets.   
I'm hoping for an end of the Euro and hopefully with that a severe curtailing of the EU.
		 
			
			Ratbag is just being.... himself       He reminds me of someone near to me...     
			
			I really don't understand the negativity towards the EU (the Euro yes). Most (if not every) country in the EU has benefited from it in some way or another. Now I admit that not every country would but that I guess is a reason for not joining in the first place. Have to weigh the pro's and the cons.   
There is a lot of negativity towards the Eu at the moment and that is normal with the catastrophe that the Euro has become. I acknowledge that some people have reservations about how it is run but that's par for the course with any large organisation.      If there is an opt out clause than it is not an obligation to EU membership and thus not mandatory. I'm sure the EU in general would prefer if the Euro was adopted but that's the beauty of democracy, people make their own decisions.      I don't understand your point here in regards to the Lisbon Treaty. The people of the EU (or their elected representatives) ratified the Lisbon Treaty in all member states.      Would you care to expand on this and explain your reasoning. I'm honestly curious what it is about the EU that made it preferable to live elsewhere.      I don't know but who wouldn't want access to a market with 700 million people. I'm sure there are plenty of countries who would still love to join (and I guess will) once things settle down again. While I'm confident the EU (and the Euro) will survive, what shape it's in by the end I'm guessing will be different than what it is now. Just my opinion however and I have nothing to back it up with.      The thing about democracy is that people can just keep saying no and then vote in another crowd during the next elections who don't ask the question. If they no longer ask however and just go ahead and do to it as you seem to be insinuating then indeed the EU has a major problem.    
What advantages are there for the Euro to fall apart for the countries who have adopted it. The Euro in principle is a great idea it's just the implementation which left a lot to be desired in my opinion.    
In regards to the EU and dictating rather than negotiating I don't see the problem (well in general). The EU attempts to look after its own citizens and interests as a priority over others, what country or similar organisations don't? To me it just makes sense.     
For the record (in case you haven't guessed by now  ) I'm very much pro EU however I don't say that everything the EU does is good. It has its flaws but its the job of it's citizens to try to rectify that just as in any other country.
		 
			
			Switzerland joining the EU would be the end of direct democracy (or any democracy, for that matter).   
One reason I became Swiss was so I would be able to do my part to keep Switzerland out of the undemocratic mess that is the EU!    
Tom
		 
			
			What happens next       
			
			Of course there are also practical benefits to independence from a continent-wide political monopoly.  When errors in political calculation are made in that case, they are smaller in scope and easier to escape.  Like the EU, the US is experiencing a coast-to-coast recession and banking crisis because the monetary system and economic policy is planned on a national basis, and the inevitable mistakes of the planners cannot be escaped without crossing the border into a system which is on a different leg of the cycle of correction.   
Even leaving aside the monetary issue, if Switzerland were already a member of the EU and therefore subject to EC regulations on labor, capital, banking, business, and whatever else is to be centrally planned, the distinction in economic outcome for the Swiss people would be heavily muted compared to the present stark difference:          But if the history of the other EU national accessions without referendum is any indicator, whatever the Swiss people think about joining the EU will not be a consideration for the political and business elite when it comes time for them to make their move towards Brussels.  They are aware that mere thoughts and angry rhetoric of the populace can not impede the sale of a nation through a treaty agreement among the ruling classes.   
As a ""dumme Ausländer"" Switzerland's independence from, and intolerance for, political empires is a most fundamentally important and attractive aspect from my own perspective.
		       
people are against the EU because it is anti-democratic and has systematically taken away the political rights of people in their countries and has put in it's place a corrupt bureaucratic elite.       
			
			The EU has its problems and it has it's good things. My opinion, if it matters, is pretty simple. Coming from the US, it is amazing what a good overall life Switzerland affords most of its citizens and residents compared to where I came from. There is a reason why Switzerland is consistently ranked as one of the best places to live. Bern received the honor of being considered the safest metropolitan area in the world and is ranked in the top ten best places to live. Zurich and Geneva are in the top 5. Most people make a good wage, have time with their families and enjoy a good life. It is extraordinarily safe here and the economy and government are stable. The Swiss franc has risen because it is seen as such a safe haven for investors. The whole point I want to make is that we have it good here, so why take a chance. To me the gamble has way more potential problems than what small improvements we would make.
		    How come?        In the contrary to popular belief, Switzerland is no direct democracy, but a parlamentary/consensual one, with a few direct democratic elements. Not many, however, and mostly regarding insignificant and/or failed initiatives about quite trivial aspects of modern life (exception made for Schwarzenbach and a few others maybe). Apart from any discussion about how democratic a simple ""YES"" or ""NO"" for complex issues can be (remember the recent 20% second home question? I was not very convinced, voted ""yes"", but I knew it creates problems in small mountain villages, and now it turns out it's far more complicated than anybody - Weber included - depicted it up from the beginning. E.g., a ""Partially YES with some modification"" as a voting option would have been more democratic).   
Member or not, Switzerland de facto is an EU subject and adapts to all its decisions, without any democratic participation however, as it is not an official full institutional part of it.   
Which is quite sad as that attitude is nothing but a delegation of power towards others.        Well, Switzerland itself lacks in transparent policies and institutions. Not to talk about corruption, ""inciuci""/nepotism and horrifying conflicts of interests on all 3 levels.   I wonder why so many persons from inside and outside don't see that or don't look at it neither.        Well actually in Western Europe this is not so uncommon but quite standard.        I don't want to be mean, but comparing a village (Bern metropolitan  ) to the megacities' banlieues in terms of safety matters does not seem very fair to me.        ... what is generally considered a problem for Switzerland.        Life is quite impossible without risks. And staying out of EU is risky, too. And, again, not everything in CH is working fine.   
But even if it were, measures from yesterday may not be the right answer for today's or tomorrow's problems.
		    >  negativity ?  No, it is just that nobody would like to join the EU right NOW     the question asked is not whether to join the EU is bad as such but whether people want to join right now !   
>  the Euro is one of the best things ever started in Europe, but was badly managed and became the VICTIM of mistakes done by the E.U., like allowing Greece to join the EU, apparently out of that pro-Hellenic sentiment still prevalent in Western Europe    
>  Switzerland cannot join the EU as its agricultural sector could not survive it. The agricultural sector makes up less than 10% of the economy both in regard to finance and workforce but is still relevant in quite many respects. THIS was the reason why the Federal government was in favour of the EEA (European Economic Area) which would have combined EU and EFTA in many areas, and which would have been the best solution for Switzerland, and would have kept EFTA in decent shape.   
>> access to the market ?   Switzerland DOES have full access to the markets of  
>  E.U. 
>  EFTA 
>  Mediterranean Partnership   
>>  AND Switzerland is full member of EU organisations like ECAC (civil aviation) and others  ----  all part of the Bilaterals.                    First of all, it looks as if the Leftist Party (the Greek socialists are only leftist by name) will get some 30% and become the largest party in parliament in Greece. Their leader however is strongly pro EU and pro Euro and so will look out for the quadratisation of the circle and try to combine social issues with EU things. You second can easily say that he will fail but the man starts to impress me and I hope for the best, best for him and best for everybody.   
Third, his real problem will be that he as a determined leftist will have to privatise a heavily state owned national economy.     
3-B)  save and invest, support social programs and slim down the ""state"", draw investments into Greece and organise the whole thing decently...... indeed not an easy task
		 
			
			It would be interesting to see how much this argument would be shifted if the EU was thriving and the PIIGS where not such a hot button right now. It's like a person deciding to spend a ton on money on season tickets for a sports team. When the team sucks, it's easy to say ""hell no"". Ask the same person after they have won a championship and their feelings may be very different.
		 
			
			A governing body's power, be it a government or a corporation, is measured by it's inability and reluctance to deal with individuals.   
This is one of the reasons why I like Switzerland. O.k I accept that the Swiss don't have complete control over all aspects of their life. But having cantons which each are given what is a pretty decent amount of freedom over how they run their show is good. Same goes for Switzerland as a whole compared to EU member states. Added to this is self governance with regular votes.   
The EU, USA and other states of comparable size however IMHO do not possess governing bodies which cater for the individual. Their size has grown so large that they possess budgets which allow them to use propoganda to influence the masses so that they basicaly can do whatever pleases them to do as the number of votes they recieve from these masses gives them a majority vote. Furthermore in many states the political parties decide who they will govern with to ensure a majority come election time. The reality is the parties decide who gets in not the people.   
So having Cantons which don't agree with each other is healthy. It does not always result in a productive result but it keeps each member on a leash. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So the greater the power the greater the corruption. Human nature.   
Of course the unfortunate thing is there are armies which are ruled by screwballs around the world so unfortunately there is a need for armed defence which in turn requires a decent size governing body to rule efficiently. Otherwise there is probably no need for such large govt's and corporations.   
Never ending debate though.
		    Exactly !  Once the EU has overcome the problems about Greece (and Italy and Turkey ?) the mood may change.     
Many Europeans underestimate the importance of Greece as the developments there are followed up by countries like Russia, Armania, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Once the E.U. has shown to be able to solve the Greece problem, those others may realize that also THEIR problems are solveable.
		 
			
			Greece isn't the problem and it's neither part of the problem.   
The problem is Germany and, as a consequence of its selfish nationalist financial policies, a shift from Brussel's low level of cooperation and coordination power (call it centralist power, if you want) towards Berlin.    
A lack of institutionalism in general financial and economic issues of EU.   
No institutions, no real guarantees for the members' economies, no trust from investors, high interest rates or no fresh capital for the ""PIGS"".     
Regarding Greece cheating on Euro-entrance - well besides that everyone cheated, Germany included - what would have been the alternative of Greece not being a Euro or even EU member? Another member like Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltic states or a state like Macedonia or Albania? I don't know if this would really have been the easier and cheaper solution ...          I don't see your point. Why would Swiss institutions be more ""personalized"" or ""individual"" (or are we talking corruption?).          Why would that be different in Switzerland?           It depends on the single argument. I don't think that poor mountain cantons would agree on your statement.          Acton could be right,   
but the problem is that you don't really know where the real power is. And due to low levels of transparency in Switzerland it's rather uncontroled. I don't see that as an advantage.
		 
			
			well i think this really boils down to what the EU is about. if they really want a union and fiscal integration then the rich countries will need to be happy to greatly increase the fiscal transfers, i.e. richer countries such as Germany will have to give money to poorer ones such as Greece.
		    Well, that is a more than valid concern. But isn't that mixing up two questions: 
- is the EU as a concept of a united peaceful Europe a bad thing? 
- is the current implementation not exactly great?   
You can very well be pro-European while not agreeing to the current EU set-up. I am one of those. I love the idea of a truly united Europe - mainly because my grandfather and pretty much every generation before him at some time in his life was forced to fight in a war... but I do not like the bureaucratic monster the politicians created. But you do not have to throw away the entire concept just because the idiots implemented it with a flawed veto right or undemocratic details - one has to fix it, that's all.   
The key is IMHO a completely different problem: In Germany it is the norm to send burned or failed politicians to Brussels. That is an easy way to get rid of them as they will have some job, get good money but are far enough away to not cause any immediate harm or trouble... as long as we treat the EU like a dump for bad politicians - we cannot really complain that the result will be bad policies...   
My personal pet hate proofs my point: This guy is a commisoner, one of the highest jobs in the EU.        
He was voted out of his former office, head of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, after he failed on transport and energy politics. What resort did he get in the EU after the voters showed him that they did not approve his proximity to the nuclear power lobby and politics to keep outdated power plants alive? He is the commisioner for energy now...    
Just one example, but there is a long list of losers working in Brussels. If you did not succed on a national level, how could you possibly get it right in Europe? If the EU was ever supposed to work, we would need the absolute best talent there, not the left-overs...
		    i take issue with this point. the EU is not the only way to have a united peaceful Europe and I would say the EU is not the way to achieve it - if anything, the whole EU project and the Euro saga in particular is more likely to prompt a European war than had we kept to a basic customs/free trade zone and implemented europe wide law on the basis of unanimity.   
so, yes, a peaceful Europe is a good thing, which is why we should dismantle the EU. the EU have put out a lot of propaganda which equates EU to peaceful europe and many have swallowed this.
		    Might be, but the point is that nobody knows what would have happened to Europe (and Switzerland) without the EU. I think that most people at least agree on stating it would not be better.          Imo this is misleading. The Roman Empire did not perish due to its heavy bureaucracy, but rather as a result of lacking in it.   
Brussels does not suffer from too many bureaucratic puppet players or too strong administration, but from a lack in power, as a result of nationalist governments of strong egoistic members like Germany.        The problem is lack in power delegation, not that his English is poor (mine is, too, but who cares?; true however that it's ridiculous that it was Oettinger himself to blame youngsters not to be fluent in English - OK a faux-pas, but without reference to any performance in Brussels at all).        No, you don't need Superman for it but just normal people; what however you do need are valid institutions with real power. But delegation in power matters needs willing and able members that agree on solidarity, cooperation and coordination in the first place, at least as a condition for creating those institutions. Europe unfortunately is still lacking in that.
		    How you wanna do that without an org like the EU?
		 
			
			I do like the idea with EU and the origin idea was that trading countries with good relationship don't go to war with each other (doh), so something like EFTA would have been enough...   
but it is now an uncontrollable monster which has grown way too fast...these are the main reasons why it fails:   
1. Criterias for joining EMU were more or less skipped 
2. The control is close to zero => everybody is cheating 
3. It grew too fast (too many new countries too fast) 
4. Too much focus on minor things   
I believe that the EMU was the biggest mistake...
		    He did not lose ""personal"" elections but his party lost out in parliamentary elections.  It does not necessarily mean that people thought he was a bad B-W prime-minister. Switzerland is not a member of the E.U. but a full member of the Council of Europe, and also has a tradition of ""Sendet den Opa nach Europa""    
Very often, European organisations, due to national party politics, in reality even get the better politicians than the ""home countries""   
A practical example ?  Italy sent good folks to Brussels and RE-elected a clear crook. They should have sent the crook (also known as ""Cavaliere"")  to Brussels and taken back the others     
PS:  Just deleted that piece of ""Stuttgarter-English"" which is comparable to what is in Switzerland the (in-) famous ""Français-Fédéral""
		    wow. it is scary that you see the EU as the only way to acheive such a thing. how about good old fashioned treaties?
		    The treaties are a complicated way to achieve it. Switzerland has gone that way after the multilateral approach was drowned by the Blocherites. It costs a lot, and in case of Switzerland needed a dozen Federal votes, generally WON against the Blocherite resistance. Do not forget that each single treaty not only was done with the E.U. but with every single EU member country    
This means that Switzerland now (2008 to 2015) is implementing what could have been done back in 1995.  So that Switzerland lost two decades and a few billions of CHF .  Imagine that Lego in 1992 planned to move its centre into Switzerland but dropped out after the 1992 vote. Hundreds of ""trans-border"" projects either were not pursued or dropped.  Switzerland now is in the position it could have been 20 years ago, and still, the Blocherites try to torpedo the Bilaterals continuously.    
Why do I nevertheless support the Bilaterals ?  Not least because the EU due to the French influence is clearly too centralist. I therefore for decades supported EFTA, whose concept is far less centralist. But that organisation with only Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as members no longer is a viable option.    
Which means that the E.U. is THE option to go
		 
			
			of course, while we are talking of treaties etc., the real thing I am against is QMV. if we can't get all to agree on something, then, IMO, it shouldn't be forced on everybody.
		    any kind of QMV means that a definite majority and not just a narrow 51% majority is needed, and I regard this as good.
		    simple majority means >50%. qualified majority could be anything above that e.g. 50.000000000000000000001%. in the context of the EU, after the Lisbon Treaty, a qualified majority means 55% of the countries for a Commission proposal.

so actually, it isn't much better than a simple majority in this case. (although for the EU, there are other conditions also to be met, e.g. regarding population etc.)
		    And all that was done by the relatively few people you keep calling call Blocherites?
		    Very good points that indicate why that is not true:          The Blocherites had to accept the votes in favour of the Bilaterals again and again. ALL THIS was done by the majority
		    As right as the man really is, rather unfortunately, the E.U. due to rather deplorable decisions of the past, REALLY IS the only option available.    
Absolutely to the contrary, I look forward to see Turkey, Ukraine and Russia to join the E.U., establishing  a ""Europe from the Atlantic to the Pacific""    
I also might invite Kosovo and Albania to join the Swiss Confederation. This would make Albanian the nr 2 language of Switzerland and most of all bring down the exchange rate of the CHF to a realistic level        So WHO caused all those delays and huge losses? I thought you blamed that group around Blocher. They are so few they can be easily outvoted any time. They were only one reason why the EEA vote of 1992 went down the drain. When they are successful once in a while it's because the issues they bring up are issues of far more people than just them.
		    completely and utterly wrong and untrue.
		     
First of all, the Blocherites are even in political terms 30% of the people and not just a group. And won their anti-EEA battle very narrowly.  Second, the EEA was dropped by  a less then 51% NO. And third, they WERE outvoted lots of times. And as I welcomed the narrow YES in favour of Schengen/Dublin, I have to accept equally narrow votes against my wishes. This is democracy.    
Overall Switzerland possibly is the most PRO-European country on this continent !   as no other country had so many popular votes in favour of European integration as Switzerland !     
And the EEA debacle lead Jean-Pascal Delamuraz into launching the Bilateral process which for Switzerland is far better than the EEA could ever have been. Expensive, complicated and time consuming but possibly the best thing available.
		    but what alternatives are available ?  now available !  please advise
		    30% is a purely hypothetical figure based on the outcome of elections, and it refers to the SVP, of which only a relatively small fraction could be called Blocherites. Blocher is not the SVP, and many SVP members are against Blocher.    
My point is, a person who sometimes votes pro-SVP is not necessarily what you so dearly love to call a Blocherite. That's just a hate term, mainly from the far left. It shows your stance and possibly affects your credibility even in matters where you actually know more than most of us. Please don't expect me to continue this discussion as long as you continue using that kind of derogatory terminology.
		     
Many SVP people are NOT in favour of Mr Blocher and I hope that the SVP will move back to its original position. He over the years drove the party to the far right. I hope that people liike Spuhler and Giezendanner will move it back to the mainstream, but if people like Freddie Heer prevail the party will become even more NSDAP like than  in the recent past
		 
			
			Certainly isn't my   reason, just a bonus
		 
			
			Wow, there are a lot of strong feelings in this thread!   
Personal opinion-- Switzerland has done just fine being on the sidelines, thank you very much.  Other than the run-up in the CHF last year, which the central bank had to invest heavily to reduce, the country remains the envy of many around the world.     
Can't say the same about most of the EU countries who will be changing governments over the next 18 months-- with France already having changed.     
I do agree that it would take a miracle for enough Swiss to agree to join the EU-- the collective democracy makes changes difficult, but in this case it seems to have benefitted the country.

			Popular music streaming service Spotify launched in Switzerland on Wednesday, offering users access to a catalogue of some 15 million songs.                really?           
I guess only in German, for now.
		    Nice to see...
		 
			
			correction in CH as well... there website is not updated properly but if you type spotify.ch it works                  yeah, finally!
		 
			
			I tried to sign up, but you are forced to have a Facebook account to do so. That is ridiculous and I'll avoid Spotify until they change this policy - or maybe forever, because it's just so annoying.   
It's sad that Facebook and its willing minions try to funnel all of our interactions on the web through Facebook.
		 
			
			So because the local owns the website that makes it okay for them to spam us with reposts? If it was anyone else this thread would be merged.           They just recently introduced that policy (when they launched in the US, I think), so it's very hard to believe that they'll get rid of it again anytime soon. Considering that around 30% of the Swiss population are on Facebook, that actually makes sense.
		    Once it is downloaded you can change the software to English in preferences.
		    30% of Swiss population on Facebook, but why exclude the rest? You cannot even have a Spotify login - it must be a Facebook one!   
I'm sure they legally cannot change this policy, due to some agreement with Facebook, but I hope the whole thing fails. Facebook is a danger to the underpinnings of what makes (made?) the web great.
		 
			
			Facebook as fast becoming a de facto ID on the Web. Look what happened to Salman Rushdie, whose account was suspended as he didn't register as his Passport name Ahmed Rushdie. I guess I'm in trouble too as I use a nom de plume/pseudonym.....
		    duh... yes.   
I'm sure you'd like to make the rules on the web site that you set up.  
and pay for ..
		    yes, but really .... how is that a burden? 
sign up for a FB account in 30 sec using a spam email add (you do have one of those, don't you?), and dont post absolutely any information in it.
		    Yeh, I would make the rules...and then not break them.
		    I think a Facebook account requirement for a paid service is something I would not go with. The logical reason might be that Facebook pays Spotify for every new user forced to sign up with them.
		    Spotify is free
		    Not the one I am using. It costs me 10e per month, paid to Spotify for a service with no ads, multiple devices, playlists and offline music. Pretty much perfect service for the money since I really don't want to own the music or the discs it's stored to. I'd rather have all the music I like, available with same playlist in sync, on all devices (PC, Mac, Android, Nokia, iPhone, Ipad) I happen to use.
		    Like I said. Spotify is free.   
Spotify premium and unlimited cost.    
Didn't you just say you wouldn't get spotify because it's linked to facebook? Or have you got an old account from before the integration.
		    OK, so ""Spotify Open"" = Spotify. I can live with that :-)  I've had Spotify for a long time and they haven't forced me to use Facebook login yet and hope they never will.
		 
			
			spotify pays artists for plays. to encourage more plays, it helps to be integrated into a social networking website. what's the big deal about creating a FB account and not doing any activity on it? just sign up and don't friend anyone. you can even make your account invisible to search so that no one can ever find you. other than the email account you signed up with, FB knows nothing about you. and even if you are an active FB users and don't want to share your spotify playlists, you can turn that off.    
i got on spotify last night (the free version) and it's way cool. i may even get the pay version and so that i can use it on my phone.
		    This   on 17.11.2011 is interesting:       
			
			lol.. I just imagined the amount of souls lost to 9gag.... and facebook having to record all of them.
		    FB has an annoying habit of  messing with the privacy settings and will not allow users to use a pseudonym, plus just the idea that you are   to link the accounts, is enough muck and nonsense to turn many away.
		    so i just tried to hit the signup button and i always get the link   and the message

			Switzerland's government needs to do much more to tackle rising racism and xenophobia, a Commissioner from the European Council on Human Rights said in a letter to the Swiss forign ministry.            I believe the issue here is, that it is a systematic racism ingrained in the culture because this counrty has not been exposed to ""real"" immigration issues like others and was always shielded by its international insignificance. For instance, I read an article yesterday evening about the ""funny"" train conductor. It stated that the whole train was laughing except 2 Indians, because they probably didn't understand German. Why would the Indians not be able to understand the language? It could be, that they're actually Swiss but didn't find the jokes funny IMO. This for instance, is not being overly politically correct, but is rather a fine example of racism in connection with culturals attitudes. Again, my sentiments are, that Switzerland is stuck in the 70s because of its lack of international relevance possibly supported by its banking secrecy.
		    How is the Local a newbie? Actually that's quite appropriate, the poster probably doesn't even live in Switzerland, but likes to impose their view of Switzerland from abroad.   
Why doesn't the Local summarise the Swiss Govt response in the intro, in addition to the Human Rights Chief summary?    
Oh I forgot, that would be BALANCED.    
Perhaps ""The Local"" is a deliberate anachronism....   
			
			Reading the actual letter by the commissioner is quite illuminating:     
Nothing about racism ""rife"" in Switzerland instead merely highlighting where in his opinion there could be room for improvement...
		    I think you misunderstand racism. Racism is a level 2 discrimination so for example regardless of your citizenship, you are discriminated against. 
EG the US Citizens good enough to fight in WW2 for the US, but not to vote at home.   
Switzerland hasn't got there yet which the EU doesn't understand.    
Switzerland still has an issue with immigration regardless of race, even immigration from the EU where they've signed a bilateral almost 10 years ago now.   
I'm not saying there is no racism, but the complaint targeted specifically political campaigning, which reflects popular culture. And popular culture is worried about repeating the mass immigration mistakes made elsewhere.   
The article also doesn't say anything about what the complainant is doing inside the EU which is also hardly perfect. You'd think problems in 27 EU countries would keep one busy. But I guess it's easier to go outside and compare. Sound familiar?
		    I would read that with a huge grain of salt. Who says the two Indians were the only ones not to laugh? Did somebody walk through the train and check who was laughing? Did somebody study CCTV coverage of every single person on the train? Or is this a subjective opinion derived from a non-representative observation of one small part of the train? Did anybody count how many foreigners on the train did laugh? If the same happened in the UK, would anybody be insinuating the joke (or teh culture) was racist just because two Indians didn't think it was funny? Where is this heading?
		    I understand the term very well. Politically speaking, Switzerland's stance on racism is very lax, thus for instance the ample posters depicting visible foreigners negatively and that IMO is not ok and should be abolished.
		    Certainly, but why openly publish something like that in the first place? The fact that the author didn't think it was discriminating certainly underlines my aforemention point on culture.
		 
			
			Excuse me, but by Geert Wilders do you really mean THE Geert Wilders who promoted that inflammatory movie about Muslims and Islam that would make KONY 2012 look like a contender for international awards?
		    Yes, one of my favorite decades!    
But they aren't, otherwise there would be no speed limits on the highways and back roads!

			Oh lovely, another racist thread!   
Yes, Switzerland is lagging far behind the rest of the enlightened world!  Possibly this is one of the last countries where people can take walks, even in lonely forests, without being attacked!   It is time for the country to catch a wake-up and learn to be more welcoming to people who don`t like living in their own countries.
		 
			
			Ah yes, but there are good and bad types of offence you see. It's okay to offend the enemies of the ruling consensus (that type of offence is called free speech) but how dare you offend their friends (that type of offence is completely unnacceptable)?         Well that was a mighty stanza; a little misguided I hasten to add, with a right-wing message disguised in left-wing rhetoric.     And also completely wrong historically, Britain actually had a completely open door policy up until 1950; we now currently have one of the most stringent immigration policies going.   I don't believe the Norman French immigrants paid much attention to the Anglo-Saxon culture when they all came over, but they certainly added to it.     Why is it not anybodys 'God given right' to live where one pleases, if we take into consideration the statistical low probability that there is a God/Gods, and the even lower probability that he issues laws, why on earth would he be concerned about where you live, surely there are more important things for him to worry about?     Lack of 'Purity', 'culture' 'Britishness', what the hell does this mean? I have a fair idea, classic terms used by the far right to mean 'not white'.     Immigrants come to our country to improve their lives and add to the economy, in the same way you are in Germany doing the same thing.     I am a citizen of the world not hampered by small-minded parochial attitudes, and I choose to live where I please.      Amen to that. Mmmm..curry.          I agree with the point made above.   
I suppose people can give quite eloquent definitions of racism but in a nut shell being racist means having a negative, irrational and ignorant view of a person or persons in another social or cultural group.   
Good point about the details of the people who laughed and those who didn't. Who is to know if the Indians were the only ones who didn't laugh? And perhaps others joined in with (fake) laughter just out of pier group pressure. But I can say from my first hand knowledge of Indians that when they are not impressed and out numbered they keep quiet and generaly look down. And don't apply European body language analysis to that!   
Probably best to take into consideration that the majority of written articles are not even close to 100% factual. Far from it. Ever read an article of which you had a deep knowledge of and thought how inaccurately it was written? One of my son's friends has a father who writes for The Internation Herald Tribune and also for the major Swiss papers and this guy is one of the most dishonest people I have ever met. When ever he makes a promise to his son the little guy goes ballistic as he knows it is a shallow promise. Just about every reporter now-a-days is given what to print and prints it or doen't get access to further info'. Embedded reporters.   
I have studied racism for only 1 semester at a college (tip of the ice berg) and one of the first things the teacher made clear was that racism is missinterpreted as a definition by the majority of people.   
Kofi Annan once said, and it is a loose quote as I don't remember the exact words. He said why be hostile towards people of different beliefs? Why not treasure the differences between us all (perhaps in much the same way that a English tourist finds pleasure out of a holiday to say India or Asia).   
Perhaps most people are reluctant to change their convienient and comfortable beliefs. Some tourists arrive home and think, yes that was good but boy is it great to get home where everything works the way it should... I say why go back to old ways? Change or become part of the dead wood. I don't want to be a grumpy old man when that time comes!          Ahhh... EF... some things change (?) and some stay the same.   
Here's 99 pages of the same topic from 2007:     
It was a useful thread for driving traffic and growing the members list, so ynot.     
C--yaa!
		    A bit like the OP then?   
If your definition is correct, then it would be racist to consider another person racist, unless you yourself are a racist or approve of racism.   
So by logical extension, the only non-racists in the world are those who deny the existence of racism?   
I see the fundaments of the universe creak and collapse inwards on themselves as the very atoms of the big bang turn around and bite their own tails.
		    I suppose it depends on how far you want to take it. It's healthy to be hard on oneself but only up to a cirtain point, yes? Some people like the idea and philosophy of Buddism and they can also happily go about their lives walking on grass thereby killing worms etc without feeling guilty. Others will sort through the soil and remove all the living creatures (or try to) before laying down say a foundation (Buddist monks do this). What works for one person may not work for another.   
Isn't it a good idea to let others find their own way through life? If someone is racist then why not give them time (especially if they are young) to learn more and become a better person? I suppose we can try to give them advice, but one had better be patient and display empathy when giving advice.   
I think anybody who thinks they are NOT a racist either doesn't know any better or is lying to themselves.       
			
			Switzerland hardly suffers from ''unfettered'' immigration!    
And by the way, I've been an immigrant twice now, and I can tell you that not integrating is  y a symptom of not being welcome or being actually discriminated against by the people of that particular country, and not because you don't   to, trust me.
		    I would disgree with that.   
Switzerland has accepted its status as a multicultural and multilingual country at a much earlier point in history than any other country I can think of. It was until Mitterand came to power that the French government was awkwardly ignoring the very existence of such minority languages and cultures as Breton and Basque. In the UK Welsh did not start gaining any official recognition until about the 1980s and Scottish Gaelic still has no legal recognition today. As recently as post WW2, ethic cleansings in Eastern Europe led to the expulsion of ethnic Germans from places like the Sudetenland and Poland. Even today, Spain and Belgium are struggling to remain united countries due to groups that were oppressed in recent history distrusting the new staus quo and wanting their own countries (and who knows how long Scotland will remain part of the UK?). In comparison, Switzerland has enjoyed a long period of comparative peace between the linguistic and cultural groups in the country. There have not always been sunflowers and rainbows but disputes were mostly solved in an amicable way. To say Switzerland doesn't get multiculturalism is misrepresting history in a big way.
		    I somewhat agree with your point but there is something detrimental to distinguish. Having a country which is multicultural and multilingual vs. facilitating and incorporating people from different backgrounds and corners of the world into society and everyday life. Switzerland might have done a better job in terms of involving all 4 different parts of this country into unity but completely lack behind immigration driven differences. This is clearly displayed in the politically motivated public relations and intitutions. The culture also is not used to the ""huge"" influx of newcomers and thus, has not evolved accordingly as yet IMO.
		    I think you missed my point.   
If a headline screams ""the Swiss are racist"". Is that racist? I mean not just a bit racist because of a lack of introspection, but blatantly racist because it is totally generalising and promoting negative stereotypes?   
If you say, racism is having an ignorant view of another group of people, and at the same time you apply that adjective to a large group of people, the majority of whom you've never met personally. Is that racism?
		 
			
			...racist thought and action says far more about the person they come from than the person they are directed at.  
―  ,    
The dalai Lama once said...""The enemy is, in a way, the real teacher"".   
Racism is our enemy. No doubt about that. But rather than running away from an in depth study of what makes us human why not embrace knowledge and thereby remove at least some of the ignorance that causes us to not see things the way they really are. Isn't that what life is realy about?   to see things and people the way they realy are?          True, I understand the distinction. But don't you think already having the basics of multiculturalism ingrained in the country's culture and workings should make it easier to accept new groups and minorities than you would have in a country that until quite recently believed in a monolithic one language and one culture approach.   
To go back to the example of France. Immigration from North Africa started in the 1950s and 1960s but still today the Maghrebians are poorly integrated and discrimination is rife. The police lack cultural awareness and often aggravate problems rather than solving them. Switzerland hasn't had race riots or unprovoked police shootings of innocent immigrants, and whereas not everybody is happy, people do get along and when you look at second and third generation immigrants who grew up with the system, problems are relatively mild compared to other countries.
		    Okay, then...  since I'm kinda bored.   
There was a Swiss society long before any of us got here.  It had some existing notions of the roles and responsibilities of individuals within that society.  It had an ethos that was taught by example.  Transgressing the ethos could get one ostracized, just as it happens in any human society.   
A foreigner who comes here is not fully aware of this ethos at first.  They can learn it, if they try.  But many are not aware of it.  So they struggle with the sense of not being ""accepted"" by Swiss society.  They'll cry ""foul"" and call it racism.  But there are many people from all over the world, of all kinds of races who come to an understanding of that ethos.  They learn it, and even appreciate it, and get along quite well with the Swiss.   
I'm probably as far removed from the original Swiss race as possible.  But if you were to ask me if the Swiss are racist, I would tell you that the Swiss have ALWAYS been multicultural.  The act of confederating with other tribes is multicultural to the core.  Furthermore, I have seen more blatant and extreme forms of racism from people of my own race and nationality.  Yes, there are Swiss idiots, but should that characterize the Swiss as a bunch of idiots?  Well, THAT would be racism.
		    I would disagree, having a homogenous multicultural society in a secluded country doesn't necessarily have to set a basis of an open-minded approach towards multiculturalism IMO. In addition, the Maghrebians in France seem fairly well integrated as you can see Maghrebis from a different backgrounds in various stages of society. You can observe this by watching French television, where you'll notice people of various background appearing regularly on many channels. The reason why you haven't seen any race riots in Switzerland are because a) immigration from new places started only in recent times and b) there are relatively a small number of people in comparasence to let's say France, who has an abundance of imigrants from former colonies. Just for the thought, how well are Maghrebians integrated in Switzerland?
		 
			
			In order for your argument to make sense, you need to clarify a few points:   
First, I want to understand who qualifies as ''the people'' in a particular country, according to you. Is it just ones born on that particular soil? Or do people with a passport but no geographic or linguistic ties to that country also qualify? Is there maybe a ''gene'' which makes one part of ''the people''? What if two non-integrated immigrants have a child who grows up speaking the country's language and adopts their customs, but doesn't have citizenship? Is that child still just an immigrant?  
Or take a person born and raised in that particular country, but whose mentality and views are in stark contrast with the ''normal'' culture of that country. Is that person still part of the ''people'', even if he strongly opposes and even resents the traditional culture of his country? What if his work ethic isn't so great, and he has a criminal record, and is not very capable? According to you, he has a God-given right to live there, but an immigrant with the same qualifications does not, because this lazy immigrant will threaten the way of life of the lazy local.    
So what makes this lazy local better than the lazy immigrant?? It seems to me that your view of citizenship is very old-fashioned, a ''born here, raised here, die here'' type of thing.    
Second, I want to understand what particular aspect of ''culture'' you think comes under threat by immigrants. Cultures, views, tastes, etc tend to evolve naturally, even without any input from outsiders. In Switzerland for example, lots of young Swiss roll their eyes when local, traditional folk music starts playing. Or, some young Swiss find the traditional foods to be ''too fattening''. That's certainly not because of immigrants.  
So what particular part of culture in any given country do you think is so ''pure'' and ''untouchable'', that it wouldn't have changed naturally by itself due to new generations?  
What exactly constitutes as a threat anyway? The increased availability of new foods, or the increase in different languages spoken on the street? The funny music?    
So, to recap, please explain first   constitutes being one of the people deserving of protection in any given sovereign state, and   you have decided they have the privilege of being the ''chosen ones''.    
And second, please explain   parts of culture you think immigrants threaten that should absolutely not change,   those aspects are then so special, and why wouldn't they have changed on their own, as they have for hundreds of years, in hundreds of countries...
		     I have to disagree on one technical point, Scottish Gaelic has always been a recognized language of Scotland and the primary language of the clans for internal disputes, French being the international language used (up until the treaty of Edinburgh in 1560 French could almost be classed as the second language of Scotland, France and Scotland being traditionally very close allies).   Gaelic was the predominant Language up until the unification of the crowns, in 1600 (while Scotland was still autonomous and only shared their Stewart King with England and her captured states i.e. Wales and Ireland), and still in great use by 1707 (the Union of the crowns) up until 1746 when parliament banned the speaking of Gaelic and wearing of tartan.     Indicating that the British Government recognized the language or else they couldnt have banned it.   It is currently one of the 4 recognized languages of the UK and has always been recognized since the formation of our union.   
			
			I've now read the article and there are a lot of recommendations. There's little recognition of the Swiss position, although some acknowledgement of progress. Perhaps the COE should accept that Switzerland prefers a Bilateral approach where it can adopt the COE conevnetions that aren't in conflict with its own culture. Clearly the COE is based upon a concept of building a Pan-European culture with nation states/cantions reduces to regional significance.
		    Depicting foreigners is not racism. It's something else......a phobia I believe.
		    Nothing wrong with immigrants bringing their culture with them, but with sensitivity and respect for the existing culture they've chosen to move to leading eventually to integration if they want to remain.   
I'm happy to discuss integration issues, but that's a separate topic. In fact there's nothing in the article about cultural suppression. The minarett ban is one thing, but I see that as linked with the proposed limits on popular initiatives. That becomes a constitutional issue, as the COE supports self determination, and now wants to limit this as part of the comments on the popular initiative right in the Swiss constitution.
		    Those are interesting questions deserving some thought. I don't claim to know the answers but it certainly shows the modern world is a lot more compliacted than Ancient Athens where these questions qould have had clear and straight answers.   
Immigration and naturalization imply that a country's makeup may change through processes other than bloodlines. If somebody from outside can be accepted into the community and become a full member (by whatever process) then should there be a reverse process to expel those who are not wanted or don't fit in? Surely if you can vote to grant somebody citizenship, you should also be able to vote for the reverse? I'm not claiming to have the answers here, jsut naming some of the issues that come up. So what happens to somebody you expel and has no other nationailty to revert to? So to avoid that problem, maybe you shouldn't be able to de-naturalise anybody. But if you believe in democracy, shouldn't ""the people"" be able to decide who they allow to join their number and under what conditions (and be allowed to ponder the question at length seeing it's one they cannot reverse)? If you move to a different country, you do so knowing you are a guest and have no right to claim that citizenship but can earn it? In that respect the Swiss Gemeindes that still do vote over citizenship are exemplary as delegating this decison to unnaccountable ""authorities"" may lead to the fulfillment of Bertolt Brecht's prophecy ""The people don't vote as we want so we must change them for new people"".      Interestingly, Switzerland is different here too. I know of quite a few foreigners who yodel or play the alphorn. I once saw a story about a British expat in Spain who became a bullfighter. So immigrants do feel some affinity for ""the culture"" (whatever that is) and either genuinely want to be part of it or feel they are accelerating their integration process by taking part.   
My own take is that you are truly integrated when your local friends consider you one of them and they no longer think ""that English guy did this"" but say ""Andy did this"".
		 
			
			The movie is called ""Fitna"". It is easily available online. 
And the problem I have with inflammatory movie/speeches/opinions is that there is a difference between having an opinion and wanting to discuss and work towards finding a solution that improves the situation for all, and simply giving an empty statement of hate and manipulation like Fitna is. At least that is how I see it.   
And at absolutely no moment I said we should ban inflammatory/offensive/blabla whatever types of movies. As you said, people are not obliged to watch anything. But since immigration/exclusion/integration are important and relevant subjects that will always be around us, I think it is the role of politicians to learn how to listen to concerns, weigh them in, debate in society and make a decision. Not to promote a movie that simply makes the gap even wider.
		    People have to WANT to integrate and work for it themselves. Thats how you feel like you earned something and deserve it, there has to be a responsibility by the person who should be integrating. Integration doesnt just fall out from the sky to hold your hand. Life is not easy for many people, but actually working towards integrating and showing that you earned it goes a lot further than thinking that someone should do it for you.   
Although its necessary that there are tools out there to assist people, I would hardly call not being welcome as 'usual' when it comes to a cause for not integrating.      And before you tell me how experienced you are over anyone else. I speak four different languages myself and have always mixed with plenty of foreigners. I'll tell you my experience, the ones who arnt integrated/ing are the same people who want something for nothing or think thats how the system should work, and thats the problem. A sense of entitlement is whats causing these rifts.
		    Please reconsider your expectations as an immigrant. Local citizens can be discriminated by their fellow citizens too, so this shouldn't affect your integration efforts, as only through integration and perhaps naturalization can you effectively be part of a positive change in your new society.   
Secondly it's not incumbent on any local to welcome you. It's nice if they do, but it's not required of them and shouldn't be expected. How many immigrants did you ""welcome"" when you were living in your own country?   
If you want to discuss the difficulties of integration in Switzerland that's fine. And some communities commit more resources to this than others. But that can apply to services available to local citizens too. Unfortunately ""more money for the foreigners"" presents political difficulties in most societies.
		     
I never said I didn't mix with people, or that I didn't eventually become fully-integrated (at least in the previous country). I also never said integration should just happen or that somebody should do it for me, please don't attach those statements to my post since that is exactly the opposite of how I have behaved in my ''experienced''   life   
I just wanted to point out that many people underestimate just how much (a lot) of immigrants   to integrate and how much effort they put into it, while also underestimating how many barriers to integration there are within their own countries.    
I was referring exactly to those who ''actually worked hard toward integrating'', as you say, but who were met with many obstacles and racism; those people are the ones who become bitter, resentful and unfriendly, not the ones who never wanted to integrate in the first place.    
I don't want to belittle your experience, but saying that ''the ones who arnt integrated/ing are the same people who want something for nothing'' has absolutely not been   experience. (At least the majority of the time)
		 
			
			as an outsider whose native country unfortunately has a long track record of institutionalized racism, I have not found Switzerland to be ""racist"" at all - the Swiss distrust anybody who is non-Swiss, but at least they do so regardless of race or heritage.          as a foreigner, it would certainly be nice to see a more institutionalized approach to integration, including access to language training, etc.  the current ""system"" does little else other than turn ""integration"" and ""assimilation"" into a cottage industry, which can be lucrative for those on the service-provider side of the equation but less than ideal for actually introducing foreigners into a culture.   
I don't think that Switzerland has any obligation, moral or otherwise, to accept immigrants in the first place.  but if the country voluntarily chooses to do so, it may have to pursue a different approach then the one it is currently using.  perhaps part of the problem here is that the country also has a reasonably long history of permitting silo'ed foreign and expat communities, which are interestingly juxtaposed against a very proud and deep Swiss culture and heritage.
		 
			
			I came here speaking a Swiss language (French), but I've never livied in the French speaking part.    
The only Swiss language I've studied here is Rumantsch.    
I've never used English to get by, rather French (both in Zurich in Ticino) until I learned the local lingo.   
Now that I have an Italian-only speaking wife, I was quite surprised to see that so many Swiss up north can speak Italian (but alas, the non-Swiss worker NOT!  ), and the same has been noted by my co-workers on northern visits.   
So, to cut it short, if I go up north, I expect people to understand Swiss German and/or Italian, those who speak only hoch-deutsch don't cut it!

			Its about  ? come on now, say what you mean will you? you want Muslims out of Europe, thats all. We are all friends here, no need to hide your true colors
		 
			
			Do you honestly believe there is another way but bringing your own culture?   
Luckily I know a few Brits who would just cringe when reading this...      Agreed. Finland is FAR more xenophobic (a nice way to say they really hate the furriners) with only 2% of the population not being natives, but never did I see a poster like I did this summer when returning from holiday with the Nazi-style foreign menace stomping all over the flag. It was, at that precise moment, I turned to my husband and said, ""We're leaving, with or without you.""    
On one hand, you can say the overtness is a sort of honesty, but at the same time, when your government has allowed the foreign population to swell as much as it has, one has to wonder WTF? Finland, with its rather rabid anti-immigration policies, has never been so shameless in it's policies. Switzerland is a bit of a tease.      Actually, it's interesting that you say that as an Italian couple who had lived in the US for many years, had children, then moved back to Italy thinking that Europe would be better for their kids...then moved north due to the reality of Rome these days, often complained at how little Italian the Zurchers had command of. That and the Swiss french-speaker who wept at me speaking French to him since he didn't know English or German...and apparently had few friends around these parts. I suspect the idea that folks around the Zurich area speaking more than German is a bit over-exaggerated.
		    - 
the ""culture"" is not the problem as it is the same culture as the one in Bavaria, Baden-Wärttemberg, Alsace, Vorarlberg, Lombardia, Piemonte, Burgundy. The problems are A) that the direct democracy allows people like the Blocherites to push ahead discriminatory law proposals and use racist propaganda in that process. This indeed should be curtailed by insitutional restrictions. B) that the Swiss ""right of speech"" also after the fairly new anti-racism law still allows far too much of the stuff. Many people argue that simply to keep it legally ""under the carpet as in B-W and Bayern does not solve anything, but some improvements are indeed to be hoped for. I on intent speak about Germany. West Germany in 1949, for obvious reasons, had to put some anti-racism and anti-discrimination stuff into its constitution, in order to prevent Neo-Nazism from getting up      - 
As said above, the anti-racism law IS ""mild"" but when getting into restrictions every single paragraph has to be checked in order not to create some negative ""law-monsters"" who then would curtail democratic rights.       - 
I suggest you study remarks of Mr Stoiber of the past 30 years. YES, a leading Bavarian IS relevant here. SVP, CSU and right-wing-sections of the CDU in fact are in permanent and very close contact. And you can hardly do much in the legal way as the pack moves well withing the law limits !      - 
The 70ies was a progressive decade. When looking back, the 90ies and 00s were rather reactionary by comparison      - 
HUGE influx ?   The arrival of Gastarbeiter (mainly Italians, but also numerous Spaniards, Portuguese and Turks) in the 1950ies and 60ies was far more ""huge""  than the arrival of the relatively few newcomers of the recent past, who mostly are well educated and rather rich. Imagine that the office of Turkish Airlines up from 1968  (first flight to ZRH) and the late 1990 picked up arriving immigrants and gave them a crash-course about such vital things as how to use a western  toilets and not to put your finger into the electrical connection  (the man mostly involved, from Istanbul and brought up in a modern world, felt most frustrated -- he still lives in Zürich) 
- 
You may have felt shocked by things like the Minaret-ban or the Ausschaffungs-Initiative, BUT if you compare this stuff with the Schwarzenbach-Initiative which wanted to deport have of all the Italians in here. And if looked very dangerous for quite a while untill it became clear that Mr Schwarzenbach could not succeed. But in the 60ies, far more important was the defacto xenophobism in everyday life. Standing in a line to listen to a record in Jelmoli and hearing one of the customers upfront declaring loudly ""Tschingee hinne astaa"" and out of a sudden findng yourself at the end, together with a Sicily origin mate, was not a world affair and not a matter for the U.N., but really really embarassing (unforgettable, quite in contrast to the idea of those times). Result 30 years later ?  While having been shopping in Jelmoli, not once again in the CD/DVD-etc section.  ---  Imagine that such things happened only too often in those times      You have to realise that the union makes the guidelines about the ""immigration"" but that the ""integration"" is a Cantonal affair.    
The EU man apparently knows all this fairly well. His report is nicely balanced, but correctly asked for necessary improvements and changes. He obviously is in the law business and know sufficiently well that such changes are not easy, not easy to be achieved and not easy to be implemented      ""can speak Italian"" means that people are able to express themselves in basic terms, order a meal, get a room in the hotel, ask for the way to the rail-station BUT it does not mean that many people from Zürich can discuss politics with you in Italian. ""Zurigo"" has a heavy history going back to the 1890ies/1920ies period. Hoch-Deutsch not only is understood but also spoke by most here, but there are (a small minority) those who are too dull to speak it and (a sizeable minority) who are anti-Germany-emotionalized, who do not WANT to speak Standard-German. And realize that things are not as seen by many. I recently got to our shop and our salesman and a customer were talking about this and that. I then looked at the big bag of the customer and asked innocently ""and where is ..... ? ""  and expected to hear  ""20kms east of Olten"" but the reply was ""20km south of Stuttgart"" but we all three spoke dialect  ....   I mentioned the what I call the ""Taunus-Liniie"" and our customer reflected and then said  ""Taunus-Line, än interessanti Idee"" .................      - 
>  the Italian average Zürcher speak of course is limited to a minimum and not suited for discussions 
>  the habit of most (50ies) / many (60ies/70ies) / too many (later) Romands to refuse to speak any kind of German anywhere was accepted by the WWII generation in the 1950ies/60ies/70ies/80ies but no longer is by the POSTwar generation who grew up with the doctrine ""you speak French west of the languageborder"" but refuses to speak French east of that line. The result at times is ugly and regrettable.  
>  no, the idea that folks around Zch is NOT exaggerated, but folks possibly are not up in the language YOU desire. People who went to school after 1965 generally have some command of English (within limits please ! ), some (particularily in the construction industry)  have some basic command of Italian 
> everybody has some, rather rheoretical, command of French ---- but here a warning to the Romands, exactly well educated teachers are Paris educated, which means that their students do not understand the Patois of Fribourg, Jura (region), etc
		    Direct democracy is not the problem. France, Italy and Austria have no or rather limited direct democracy yet they have or had people like Le Pen, Bossi or Haider with their respective and quite popular parties.      Free speech is one of the most important rights in a democracy. Once you start restricting it, you get on a very dangerous and slippery slope.   
Laws on racism should outlaw actual race-based discrimination (e.g. dark-skinned people not being allowed in a club, someone getting fired for being Asian, etc.) but they should never restrict free speech. BTW, the same goes for that blasphemy article that's still on the books in Switzerland.
		 
			
			What is free speech without responsibility? So yes, I agree that free speech should not be restricted but there can be no free speech without responsibility. Is it ok when under the guise of free speech one incites another to defame, hate, commit violence etc. One has to ask if under the guise of 'free speech' I violate anothers right is that ok?  
(an in ideal world) This is where the government should step in and guide us.          Improve their lives? Definitely. Add to the economy? Occasionally.   
As a citizen of the world, I suggest you spend a few years in Sub-Saharan Africa in an effort to fully appreciate how idealistic your viewpoint is. Hopefully, it will become tempered with some experience and practicality.
		    eh yes, maybe because of Finland's history, they don't like to be reminded whose side they were on?
		    And it eventually spiralled into a maniac fear of brown monsters hiding under the bed. You could say it had some success as Germany is just about the only European country without a far right or right-populist party of some size (the NPD and friends are just a joke) but it seems to me the sanity is just on the surface. I've heard some pretty racist discussions in German pubs and know a lot of people are fed up with all the political correctness. I believe all it would take is somebody who can formulate those sentiments eloquently while finding ways around all the laws and he's be a huge electoral success.
		    Well, the posters in question were here in Switzerland...   
But Finland is at least consistent in its immigration policies and the general un-welcome of foreigners, though in much more subtle forms.    
Switzerland, on the other hand, has roughly 20%(?) non-Swiss population and yet sports posters frequently depicting the dark menace that is the immigrant population. It's a bit like eating a whole cake every day for a month and then blaming the cake that your ass is too wide for a pencil skirt.
		     
So it is better if the whole country is consistently racist than to have just a faction/party of the whole society that is racist?
		 
			
			Just to be clear. Switzerland and the Swiss are not racist. They hate all Auslaenders equally.    
Followed closely behind by those from Aargau
		    ...and that's because they can't drive for shyte.       We like the Tamils. They work hard and are quiet.
		     
I don't mean that governments need to provide free language classes, housing, jobs, etc for immigrants to help them integrate; but it is exactly like poptart said - the reputation of Switzerland abroad is that it is a very civilized, wealthy, democratic, international country. Then you come here and certain things, like the SVP posters even being   fly in the face of that reputation. So does the treatment received by   immigrants here from   locals. It's just extremely surprising and many people moving here did not expect that it would be   to penetrate and integrate in this society, not because they don't have money thrown at them from the government, but because of the societal aspects.     
Switzerland is not unique in this by any means, but it is absolutely ''a bit of a tease''...       
			
			Hmmm, I am experiencing something like this from a chap in our building.  My husband is half Greek and the gentleman noticed his name in the lift.  He believes he also has Greek name (he doesn't, he's an Italian).  He came to our apartment (before I moved here) and began to befriend my husband.  He made distasteful comments about 'immigrants' and a local hotel 'full of blacks, you can catch a disease' so we became aware that he had some horrible attitudes.   
Fast forward to now, I walked past him and said a cheery 'buongiorno', he ignored me.  I thought maybe he hadn't heard and repeated, same response.  Okayyy.   
On Tuesday he was stood waiting for the lift, I also needed it but thought I would walk instead.  He was with his dog which gave me a little sniff,  I said 'hello!' and stroked it.  He grabbed it away from me, turning his body from me, and mumbled something.  A lady came out of the lift and he made a big deal of greeting her.  Okayyy.  I carried on up the stairs, he got out at his level and gave me a horrible glare and stomped into his apartment.     
What is this about?  I have never spoken to this guy, never been introduced,  I am not even sure if he knows I am married to his 'Greek friend'.  Why does it matter or not anyway.       
Very unsettling and odd behaviour anyway.     
ETA:  I am White, British, early 30's, completely non-descript looks wise.
		    A)  What that EU man meant was that Swiss laws still allows initiatives to be placed which are discriminatory. Neither Haider nor LePen could launch such initiatives 
B)  anti-racism laws should of course under no circumstances limit free speech, but of course might restrict the right to insult others on racist grounds
		    But they do. I know a university professor who says he is not allowed to publicly say that about 90 % of all tooth decay in primary school pupils occurs in kids from families with a so called migration background. It's a simple statistical fact, but he risks being sued when mentioning it.
		     
I can understand how difficult it could be.   
But I think this whole notion of ""integrating"" is 95% a personal psychological issue.  Nobody wears a badge that says ""Integrated"".  They just walk it and talk it.   
Assuming you know how to practice consideration and are able to reason, you should get a long fine here.  As for the Swiss accepting you, I think you got that all wrong.  The Swiss do not have to accept you.  YOU have to accept the Swiss.  The fact that you are not in jail, or on a list to be deported already indicates that they accept your presence here, or at least tolerate it.     
The integration that needs to happen has less to do with Swiss society, and more to do with your own head.  I suspect one root cause of this ""Alienated Auslander in Switzerland Experience"" is self-confidence.  The   is simply having lots of trouble and discomfort in being themselves, so they blame the Swiss.   
The other 5% of the problem is a social issue.  But I believe this is also brought about by the alien's lack of self-confidence.  Self-confidence exudes and affects how you are perceived, and how people perceive you.  It opens doors, as well as people.  Try practicing it, and you might find that your experience in Switzerland can change, as well as your outlook.
		    Why should anyone want to ban all initiatives that are discriminatory?   
Is not every law discriminatory to those who (for whatever reason) want to break it?    
Environmental laws discriminate against polluting industries (and destroy jobs). Safety regulations discrimate aginst those who want to make a quick buck by selling sub-standard gear. Nevertheless, most of us believe the advantages outweight the disadvantages and wouldn't want to see this discrimination abolished.   
So certain types of discrimination are acceptable if not desired. Other are wrong.   
So who should decide which discrimination is okay and which not?   
A gremium of unelected semi-senile old guys in Brussels and in the UNO?    
Or ""the people""?
		    Can't imagine that.    
German teeth normally are much better than Swiss ones,   
as German tooth control and treatment is/was for free and included in basic health insurance.   
And as Germans are one of the biggest immigrants group in CH, your professor is lying or an idiot.        So you are disproving the existence of a correlation by showing a correlation?
		    But the problem is, who decides what is deemed discriminatory?  You could literally call every initiative discriminatory if you wanted to, you could just shift the line in the sand anywhere you wanted and block initiatives purely on this basis.   
The EU already has a major problem with democracy, I would suggest it would be best to keep them as far away from Switzerlands direct democracy model as possible as they do see it as a direct threat (incompatible) - and one tool that stopped CH joining the EU in the first place (EU initiative).
		       
My point is that there might be a reason for having good teeth, shiny hair, good language skills or whatever, that are not linked with culture, individual behavior, mentaity or race but rather with the system itself. 
If teeth care is excluded from basic insurance, so no wonder that lower income social groups have less good teeth than the other. 
If car insurance and tax cut on horse power is low in CH, for sure the Swiss will drive around with bigger and stronger cars than do Italians. But I wouldn't say that the Swiss spit on nature protection because of that.        Not totally untrue. Let's say that at least in some categories and in communication/PR CH is kind of slow, also as a result of a certain success (if you are fine, we should you change anything?). Which can be a very dangerous thing.
		 
			
			""Discrimination"", ""Racism"", ""Xenophobia"" are all very emotionally and politically charged terms and, unfortunately, because of such it makes it impossible to hold rational discussion of what an influx of non-natives into a country means, what are the pros and cons of such an influx and how that influx can be managed for the benefit of all.   
I see some distressing things that have emerged over the past years (and whilst my remarks are based on the UK, I am sure that they'll resonate elsewhere)   The author Len Deighton made a very insightful observation in one of his books in the sixties (time of the early immigration from the Asian subcontinent into England and of the Civil Rights movement in the US) which goes along the lines of:    . Obviously this reflects that era, but money often underpins discrimination fueled by a fear that ""we"" will ""loose out"" to ""them"" (whichever way that discrimination goes).   
I believe what grates on many, is that instead of requiring immigrants (a minority - no matter from where) to conform to the norms of the society they move into and have the contributions that the immigrant's culture can offer the host society to percolate naturally into the host country, the self-appointed elite insist that the majority must   to accomodate the minority. Which - in the long run - is no good to either party.   
I think fundamentally it all boils down to fairness and mutual acceptance. To use a (light hearted) example by way of illustration, to own a factory where a proportion of the workforce will not for cultural reasons eat peanuts and NOT offer a non-peanut based option in the canteen, is plainly stupid, crass and insensitive; but, by the same token, to ban ALL employees from enjoying peanut butter sandwiches or a satay in the canteen because a minority objects to peanuts is equally stupid, crass and insensitive (and gives rise to resentment amongst the majority).    
In fairness, the majority must accept that not everyone will eat peanut butter and likewise the minority must accept that although they may believe "" "", in the society they are living in the majority do not believe that and the minority must accept it as such.   
But that would be being rational....
		    Indeed. The culture of xenophobia towards anything that isn't Caucasian.
		    You are correct that German dental health appears better than Swiss dental health and most likely attributed to the financial aspect here in CH (i.e. user pays). Although it should be noted that the swiss consume more sugar and use more cigarettes - so that shouldnt surprise anyway. See here:    
Just please, dont call it     , its just paid for in a different way.   
However, Captain Greybeard still has a point since there are many migrant groups here in CH, not just German. He mentioned migrant groups among ' ' populations, therefore excluding Germans (who have great teeth and wouldnt be included  ), still leaves plenty of other migrant groups. In other health statistics im familiar with in other countries, migrant groups are usually over represented and there are heaps of reasons i.e. socio-economic factors, different food consumption habits, genes etc etc.
		          I also used to think that way. Now I wonder why the alienated auslander ""is simply having lots of trouble and discomfort in being themselves"".  
I do not feel discriminated against, but this is because I am such a lovely, charming person.. and modest too..      However, I suspect Captain Greybeard was not referring to the Brits (also a large group of immigrants here), who are said to have no dentists..??
		     
Your advice works fine for a young student from another wealthy country who deals mostly with other young, open-minded students. But integration means being accepted by all (or at least most) members of a society, not just a few.     
I highly doubt ''more confidence'' would've prevented me from being called a ''verdammte Ausländerin'' by an elderly gentleman annoyed with my german skills, or ''eastern european prostitute'' by someone we were trying to rent a room from, or from having a RAV worker roll her eyes in disgust at my marriage based permit, or from recruiting agents who kept trying to make me work in an eastern european Frauenfabrik, or from the elderly woman on the train who chided me for not putting away the Blick am Abend into the paper bin(it wasn't mine, I had just sat down I hadn't even noticed it across from me  ) and saying to her friend after ''ugh, diese öst europische Frauen'', or from other countless irritating snide comments and actions towards me since I've been here.    
I cannot, statistically, be the   experiencing this. And the problem is that I feel lied to. I feel that since these actions and comments have been so insanely prevalent here, that Zürich couldn't possibly be the progressive, international, world-class city I was told it was. How can there be so many rude, maliciously xenophobic people??    
And this is the complaint!! NOT lack of funds for foreigners, not lack of friends, not differences between the new country and the old country, BUT the perceived welcoming outward facade of a country (and not necessarily just Switzerland), and the actual behavior and actions of a country towards foreigners.    
Nobody leaves family, friends, a job voluntarily to go to a country they hate and where they are hated. When individuals make such a life altering decision, they choose their new ''home'' based on what they like, based on what they want out of life, based on what language they want to learn, based on where they want to spend the rest of their lives, usually! That's what I meant when I said that ''trust me, most immigrants want to integrate''. Because most do, they chose to move to a particular country for a reason.   
So no, sorry, integration does have as much to do with the society as it does with the individual. You're trying to blame just one side of it, while at the same time accusing me of being too one-sided. But when one side actively tries to integrate, it falls on the other side to accept it and to let it happen, or to not let it happen. But then if you choose the latter, you can't blame the immigrant for not integrating.    
Therefore I really actually resent your condescending effort to try to explain to me the basics of ''confidence''. You can believe what you want to believe, and indeed our perceptions are shaped by our experiences. But don't try to belittle my experiences by telling me I need more confidence or that it's my fault I am experiencing xenophobia even after I've lived here for 2 years, speak the language, work in the system and actively try to participate in the culture       I dont follow, but its not important. The British number 12th highest as an immigrant group in Switzerland, numbering approx 32-33K.
		     
I didn't mean to offend, seriously, only to point out the importance of your self-confidence in this process.     
Regarding your expectations, your description of being accepted by all or most of society is not even attained by most of the Swiss I know.  Which leads me to think that you are trying too hard.  I certainly don't try that hard.  In fact, of the types of situations you described, I have been know to raise my middle finger at some such people.  But that's just me on a bad day.  When I first got here, I recall such things happening with some frequency. So, no, you are not alone in this learning process of yours.  But the less I cared about it, the less it occurs.  In fact, it rarely even occurs anymore.  And this is without anyone asking me what my immigration status or level of integration is.  So how am I different now from how I was before?  I'm simply more at ease with being here.  I do show that I will not be putting up with their crap when I sense crap heading my way.
		 
			
			Phos (nice to see you, BTW  )   
I understand your POV as well as PantsFace's. I don't think anyone expects to be 100% accepted by 100% of the people. That would be completely unrealistic.   
I honestly don't think it's a matter of self-confidence, or lack thereof. I know people who've been here for a very long time (decades), and while they've done (I think) a bang-up job at integrating (e.g., learning the language, making local friends, adopting the local work ethic, customs, etc.) they still get blindsided every now and then by people who they thought they could trust and, otherwise, wouldn't have a problem with.    
Case in point: I have a former co-worker who immigrated here from Yugoslavia when she was in her early 20s (she is now in her early 60s). She speaks German and Swiss-German fluently, owns a house here, tends her garden religiously, is very ""Swiss"" in many respects and LOVES this country to bits.    
When she decided to apply for Swiss citizenship a few years ago, she shared her news with her Swiss co-workers, and instead of being happy for her, they chided her. One woman said, ""How dare you think you're even good enough to be Swiss! What makes you think you even have the right to apply for or deserve a Swisspass? Well, it doesn't matter what kind of passport you have; we will NEVER accept you because you're a Yugo!"" Another co-worker said to her, ""too bad there aren't more politicians like Blocher to get rid of people like you.""   
All of this hurt her deeply because she worked very closely with these people for years and also socialized with them fairly regularly. She got her passport, but she said she can never get past their hateful words to her. And for what? All because of their own prejudices. She is a decent, hardworking person, not a criminal or a low-life.    
These same women told another colleague, German guy, when he got his Schweizerpass something to the effect of ""Looks like they're giving out citizenship to just anybody now when they should be more careful, since all Germans are shit.""    
I have another friend here, a Swiss woman born to immigrant parents, and raised here, who was mobbed out of her last job. Why? Her colleagues didn't think she was Swiss enough and wanted to get rid of her.   
For me, personally, when I first came here, I was keen to integrate. Sure, I've learned the language (and am continuing with that), have many Swiss friends, have gotten to understand the political system, enjoy many aspects of life in this country, and so on. But now, that desire has diminished, because between the increased anti-foreigner sentiment (which I also understand, in part, and believe is fear-based more than anything) and seeing what happened to my co-worker and others who've related similar experiences to PantsFace, I no longer care whether I'm accepted or not or what people think. I live my life for my own benefit, not for others and just do what I need to to get by. And, frankly, that suits me fine.            I had a similar conversation with some Swiss.  I simply told them I am here to inject some of my genes into their gene pool, because centuries of in-breeding have weakened it. I told them I am doing them a favor.  They laughed, we carried on with our lunch.
		    And really, this sums it up.    
I don't have the particular issues given here, but it still pisses me off to hear these things. (I was born with the red passport and am perhaps on the more ""intimidating demeanour"" side)    
It's a sad representation of what is hopefully the minority, but when you hear it -and I've heard this same story many, many times- you can't help but think how many more are thinking just that and just haven't spoken up, yet. You can't possibly blame people for disliking, and eventually rejecting, such blatantly venomous people! So, what happens? you end up with segregation and foreign sub cultures. The immigrants stick to themselves as they're sick of being preemptively accused of being scum, and the Swiss complain that the foreigners don't integrate - self fulfilling prophesy much?   
I'm sure they're not the majority, but I've definitely had the pleasure of observing a higher concentration of them here than anywhere else I've been - especially away from the larger cities.   
edit: I should qualify - ""here"" is meant as the German speaking region as I've spent very little time in the French, Italian or ancient-roman-babble areas.
		    Not true. It's my profession, and I know the statistics. That professor, who is an old friend and colleague of mine, is 100% right.    
All in all the Swiss have better teeth than the Germans because they have to pay for treatment, hence they take better care of them. It's very simple.    
What's more, because most kinds of periodontal treatment are not covered by German health insurance, many German dentists usually just don't care about that part of dentistry. I've seen incredible things in that field, dentists just allowing jaw bone to deteriorate until the teeth fall out, because saving the bone isn't paid but replacing the teeth is. I once had to fire a German assistant dentist because of that.    
And besides that, as stated by someone else, there are quite a few groups of immigrant. It's not the Germans or Brits that ruin the statistics.    
Now, can we go back to the topic please? My previous post was about freedom of speech and alleged racism, and tooth decay was just a practical example.
		 
			
			Has anyone considered the possibility that, in some cases, it might be only some lack of chemistry? Obviously I'm not talking about the big picture: I still don't know what to think about the Swiss being racist. But the lack of chemistry between two people.   
Example: my ex-next door neighbour and I disliked each other on sight. In fact, she was disliked by most of the neighbourhood, but that's neither here not there. One day we had an argument and she ended it with ""why don't you go back to your country"". And the thing is, I don't think she is racist, since her best friend comes from Hong Kong and can't speak a word of Swiss German.    
My point is, I don't think people are being xenophobic because they dislike me.    
Of course, I'm talking about my little world, not about the big picture.
		 
			
			Lack of chemistry or personality clashes can happen to anyone, anywhere, even between those of the same nationality    
What gives one a heightened sensitivity or perhaps an added dimension of xenophobia is when the lack of chemistry/clash happens in another country (like here) and the individual is another nationality (either a native of said foreign country or some other country) and, when they've run out of arguments and have nothing left to hit you with, they resort to telling you to ""go back to your own country.""              Exactly what I meant (but you explained it better  ).   
I didn't take it as racism, because I really think it wasn't. She was losing the argument and that was what she thought would hurt me the most. By the way, it didn't, it made for a good laugh later.   
I'm just wondering if they are more cases like this, that are peceived as racist but are nothing more than clash of personalities.
		    Apart that my above commentary was not meant to be so serious (that's why I put a smiley),   
I don't think you are right.   
I know many Germans who are shocked about medical standard in Switzerland and about Swiss corny teeth ...         Whatever, my point was that you cannot deduct from a certain phenomenon, even if there seems to be some kind of correlation, a clear reason that is linked to differences in behavior, mentality, race or whatever.   
So in the silly dental care thing.         I think you have a point there, as the addressee of a mean commentary is maybe thought to be somehow sensitive on the ""foreigner's status"",   
people tend to be mean using the xenophobic button also if they aren't xenophobic at all.
		    Actually, this is my perception as well: that the anti-foreigner sentiment is more prevalent and that this sort of behavior happens more in the German-speaking part (this side of the Rösti Graben) than in the Romandie or in Ticino.   
Even the Masseneinwanderung referendum, I believe, has garnered higher support in the German regions of the country.   
Just a small example, I speak French. Whenever I visit the Romandie, I communicate exclusively in French -- in the shops, restaurants, etc. I understand the locals and they understand me. No problems there.   
Here, in Zurich,  however, the language frustrates me to no end. I studied and speak (decent) Hochdeutsch, and it's still a work in progress. But many of the locals I have encountered do not want to speak Hochdeutsch, even though it's clear I don't understand their dialect. (I've also tried speaking French -- in an effort to stick with a national language -- but apart from the older generations of Swiss people, nobody wants to speak French. They'd rather speak English.) Some people have told me outright that they hate Germans and would rather speak English than Hochdeutsch.   
Also, the same former co-workers who ridiculed my Yugoslavian co-worker harassed me because I don't speak Schwyzerdeutsch, and how dare I live in this country and NOT speak Schwyzerdeutsch. They even flat out refused to speak Hochdeutsch with me and told me that they would ONLY speak Schwyzerdeutsch.   WTF???    
English, BTW, was our business language, and I didn't mind making the effort to try to communicate in German as much as possible. But it was not the ""right"" German, apparently. Working with these people was very difficult because of their attitudes, to say the least. I moved on to another company and now work with a team comprised entirely of foreigners.   
I know this all may be painful to read (it's been painful to experience as well) and I am sorry to, again, relate a negative experience, but it is what it is.
		    Thats how ghettos are formed.  But ghettos are not without its own group mind dynamics.  They tend to reinforce their own perception of reality, and create a vicious circle where they will pull each other back into it - the crabs in a bucket syndrome.  But this is all so unnecessary, even here in Switzerland.   
Some would like to think they are helpless and hopeless in the situation, and the only way over it is to be carried out by some sort of collective action, by some movement or some legislation to social engineer society to their favor. But in doing so, they are buying into the helpless and hopeless mindset, and are giving up their personal responsibility.   
I understand taking personal responsibility for oneself can be daunting and difficult.  But there is plenty of freedom in taking it up.  If someone feels they need some sort of collective action to fix their situation, I won't try to stop you from trying.  All I would say is there is a simpler, less costlier, and more immediate way to attain the same thing.  I doubt you will be able to re-engineer Swiss society, and I certainly will not be joining any such ghetto.
		    I don't disagree with you.    
The problem is that   plays little role if you're deemed sub-human from the beginning!   
Bad news though, you already   joined the ""ghetto"" - welcome to EF!      It doesn't matter to me what   deem, what matters to me is what I deem.  But as for the EF ghetto, thanks mam, but I'm just visiting.   
That's my exit.  Good luck!

			Beautiful post...your consensus is quite accurate as well. A part of Britain is called Londonistan due to their uncontrolled immigration. Its turning into a hellhole and they don't know what to do about it.  
Many are jealous of Switzerland. They've held to their sovereignty, and they are doing dam well. Because of this they want to find a way to get Switzerland to join in the demise... ""now it is Switzerland's turn, let us turn Switzerland into a hellhole like we've done our countries, how dare they do so well.""  
Switzerland must stand their ground. This is imperative. Once they start to become politically correct and try to appease those who have only selfish agendas, Switzerland will be in trouble. 
I compare it to someone's home. In someone's home the door is not open for ""anyone"" who wants to walk through, and not just anyone can have a key either. A country has to be careful about who they open their doors to. Just because they knock it does not mean they should be allowed to come in. Is a person being racist because everyone can't have a key to their home, or everyone who knocks on the door is not let in? 
Besides ""racism"" is an American construct. America has always been deemed as a trend setter, and racism is no different.
		    gnau wie es sii sott, with the anti-American tangent, which seems to be a constant with your posts.       
there is, of course, a fair amount of truth to what you're posting, at least as regards Switzerland.  this wonderful and idyllic country has no obligation to open its borders to anybody who is not Swiss.  I have nothing but admiration for the way the country has generally worked to maintain its sense of identity and ""culture"", despite all of the various headwinds that would work against it.  the flip side, however, is that - whether we like it or not (and I am still on the fence) - we live in an increasingly ""global"" world.  and you may not like to admit it, but the vast majority of the Swiss economy - the part that does not remain a self-subsidized and agrarian duopoly - relies almost entirely on that ""global"" economy in terms of jobs and capital.  it does not mean the country has to permit its borders to be flooded with asylum-seekers, but it probably does mean that a shuffle toward a middle-ground might be required.   
as to the EU, the fun is just getting started.  the countries like Italy and Spain who are being squeezed the most by sharing a currency with Germany, et al. are just now awakening to the fact that hundreds of billions of revenue that is earned within their borders is being taxed in Zug, Geneva or Zurich.          Alas, I've never had that experience.   
I have had ""what shall we speak today, Zueiri, Bern, Schrift, or English"", but all of those are fine by me.   
And try as I might, I only get as far as ""high-German with a Swiss accent"" (according to a former girlfriend), which I suppose is better than ""perfect French with a fake American accent"" according to another former girlfriend!   
Tom
		    you better hold on to your wife, then, lest she criticize your Italian accent.          It is painful as it reminds me of the most personally humiliating experience I ever had...I was walking my dog in the 'posh' section of Helsinki, the Finns will know it by the number of Swedish speaking mink coated old ladies, one of whom decided to pet my dog and start talking to me in rapid-fire Finnish which I didn't understand at all since I had only been there for a week at that point. When she finally stopped long enough to get a word in edgewise, I rather shyly said that I didn't speak Finnish...at which point she spat on me and walked off. Yes...spat on me. A mink coated older lady with all the trappings of very unusual wealth in Finland no less. I still love Finland and wish that things were different, that as someone not born in Finland, but who is reasonably fluent in the language at this point to manage fairly well, could live a life on equal footing as an integrated immigrant but with the Timo Soini crowd that isn't likely to happen. It's hard to forget such hatred and humiliation for nothing more than being born outside of a political boundary.   
Europe has an abundance of old folks, old folks who still live like it's us vs everyone else. Unfortunately, they pass their fear and hatred onto the young.
		        Quote: ProsperityJoy      Beautiful post...your consensus is quite accurate as well. A part of Britain is called Londonistan due to their uncontrolled immigration. Its turning into a hellhole and they don't know what to do about it.               As some senior member stated in another thread (and she's absolutely right in this), you cannot really compare London to Switzerland.     Imo the fact that GB has to face some problems (what are bigger than those of the rest of EU) is not due to the foreigners that would have taken over the country, but due to Mrs Thatcher and her lakai Mr Major who ruined public institutions, who had a little too much time to do real harm to the country.          What is this thing about Switzerland that makes many foreigners or even immigrants think or that Switzerland is a paradise where everything has a scent of chocolate, cheese and money or that it is hell where foreigners are treated like in Saudi Arabia.      Maybe CH is just a normal country that did a certain amount of good things, other things however do not work so fine.        No, there's no analogy between the two items ""State/institution"" and ""home"". In my home I don't make my guests pay for anything, and they and I have not to care about society at all at my home.   
Foreigners in Switzerland are not offered free gifts, but they have to earn their money and pay and take social standards as they are like everybody else.
		 
			
			Are you suggesting apathy then? If everyone throughout history displayed apathy to racism, it might just be that the next cab you tried to attract wouldn't have taken you either. ;p
		    Tigresse, we have to accept that many people are stupid, idiots, mentally disturbed, even though not in...papers, not diagnosed. What does your story tell me about those women? They are, most likely, very unhappy women, God knows about their childhood or whatever, who probably hate themselves as much as they hate everybody else, and especially those who seem to have done something with their lives. I wouldn't care about this non-sense. If I cared, I would fall into their trap, I would make them happy, because hurting others makes them feel good about themselves. Never underestimate your capacity of ignoring things..said someone.  If I were your colleague, I would rather cut all the socializing I had with the stupid farts, but then I would just forget they exists..   
The more you try, the less you are likely to ""integrate"". Obey the rules because this is what you would do no matter the place of living, learn the languages because is useful and fun, and live your life for you and for those very few people close to you. Integration is a relative term, reading a survey in the Migros magazine I fould out than 5% of the Swiss who were questioned think that the foreigners are well integrated, about 40% think they are ""about integrated"", and the rest of them are not worth mentioning..   
On the other hand I met what people would call well-integrated immigrants who were even less sympathetic toward the new immigrants. So, it is not always the Swiss, it is the way people are and it has a lot to do with their own misery. I's like on the internet: you have to ignore the trolls!       This isn't the first time that I've seen this reference to Switzerland being stuck in the 70s - maybe a couple of examples from the author(s) would help to explain...?   
Something else: Switzerland must be at the top of the list for the 23% of foreign inhabitants, so we clearly have a different situation than other countries. So, whilst we are talking about Swiss attitudes to this problem is it not true that about 8 years ago we all said' no' to a proposed ceiling of 22%?
		    Europe has an abundance of young folks who are even worse than the old people. You probably have never encountered a gang of Swiss teenagers shouting at you to get out of their country...Last survey I read about integration in Switzerland showed that the most interested persons in answering the questions re. integration of foreigners were people between 16-24 years of age. The results being unfavourable to foreigners make me think that actually, the young lads are even more xenophobic than their grannies, a thing confirmed by my own experiences. Don't think about young as in a young  or people related to academics, the pool is much larger. They have a sense of entitlement which has been cultivated by the parents, out of their own frustrations (what I didn't have my child should have), and as the kids are the new investments of today society. They hear conversations at home but they don't have a filter for their own and rather take everything literally.
		    Sorry...but the foreigners HAVE taken over the country...ie England. It has gotten totally out of control. Even recently they stated that ""they are going to curb integration and let it only those able to work...blah...blah...blah...a bit too late though. Read up on  . It isn't that a country should not allow integration, but they must be careful who they let in. GB had no discretion and now they have a welfare state.   
No place is perfect, but whatever Switzerland is doing, it is working and they don't need a bunch of outsiders trying to tell them how to spoil it.   
You took the analogy waaaaay out of context. It is not about free or not free. The idea is that a country has a right to refuse to not let people inside their borders i.e. home, just as an individual has a right not to let someone in their home. Is your home open to anyone who wants to come in? Do you give everybody a key? You have to use discretion.   
The comparison to GB is for wisdom purposes only: Switzerland does not need to make the same immigration mistakes that GB has. It is a catastrophe and a bit too little too late.    
It's as if the critics want to say: ""Come on Switzerland, really...it doesn't hurt too bad. See we ruined our countries, but look, we are getting through it and you can do the same. Now come on and turn Switzerland into a welfare state, hellhole, believe us the process is not so painful...lol""    
Switzerland must stand their ground...
		     Old people have lived life and they have seen the ups and downs through experience...maybe people can learn from them as well?...
		    WTH are all these posh Swedish women doing in Helsinki? I'm surprised they even bothered to leave Östermalm      
Just goes to show that money doesn't buy open-mindedness and enlightenment. Even the upper classes aren't immune from xenophobia and intolerance.    
[QUOTE=poptart;1527607Europe has an abundance of old folks, old folks who still live like it's us vs everyone else. Unfortunately, they pass their fear and hatred onto the young.[/QUOTE]   
I have no doubts about what you're saying, and would agree it's a problem, but, interestingly, most of the old folks I've met here have been some of the nicest people anywhere. Somehow they've come across as more open-minded, more cosmopolitan and more tolerant of foreigners than many (but not all) of the younger people I've met.    
Of course, I haven't spent much time in the small towns further away from greater Zurich,  so it could be an entirely different story elsewhere.
		    the % figures with respect to the number of foreigners living in Switzerland are often quoted out of context.  a significant number of those ""foreigners"" have been living in Switzerland for 2 and sometimes 3 generations, they have simply never applied for a Swiss passport.  I think, in fact, that roughly 20% of those ""foreigners"" were born in Switzerland.   
the number of ""new immigrants"" coming to Switzerland every year is actually quite small.
		 
			
			This is EXACTLY what I've experienced and concluded as well.    
I think between the bilateral treaties allowing more EU citizens and others to live and work here, as well as global companies setting up shop here and hiring professionals from abroad, young Swiss workers now have to compete with foreigners for jobs, and that raises the bar. I know that many of them are having a harder time getting internships, jobs and undoubtedly blame the foreigners for their plight. Whereas their parents and grandparents did not have to deal with any of this. So they feel anxious and insecure (understandably) about their future, and, in their minds, WE are the problem. Solution: get rid of all of us, and they can have their country back.    
Simple... but not really so. This is one of the consequences of Globalization, and, like it or not, it is here to stay.             Yes, I concluded that these women were not only small-minded and stupid, but mentally disturbed, based on their behavior. They were also busybodies who didn't respect any notion of personal space or privacy, and I had NO interest in being involved with them beyond our interactions in the workplace, and that was another thing that ticked them off. Just because we work together does NOT obligate me to go to lunch with you or socialize with you.       Thanks for your insights. I concluded the exact same thing about integration, and I've taken this exact approach to living my life here. Otherwise, it would be impossible to live here and be happy.      The old joke was that the teeth of Germans cannot be corny, as they are  artificial. Not a joke is that shops in Germany sell a lot of products  for artificial teeth.  THIS may be subject to change, but still was as  stated in the 90ies and later. Public opinion in Switzerland is against  artificial teeth, and you are encouraged to get ahead with your real  teeth, even when they look like a mountain chain          look buddy, you have a lot of immigrants in the UK because you used to have colonies all over the world. your ancestors strapped them of their wealth and freedom, and now its payback time, you need to take care of the poor and uneducated immigrants.  REMEMBER that any native English person born and raised in UK has benefited immensely from the colonial past of the UK, so please stop whining will ya?

Reality check:  Ticino over the years was among the most xenophobe / anti-EU Cantons in federal votes. The most extreme right-wing and extreme xenophobe parties exist in tradiionally LEFT-wing Geneva. The cities of Winterthur, Zürich, Luzern, Basel and Bern refused things like the Minaret-Ban. This shows that it is not a language-border thing but a town-countryside matter. For comparison, Geneva is a city-state and Vaud and Neuchâtel are cantons dominated by small cities and sizeable towns        - 
The various dialects/accents of the Romandie are (still) fairly close to the ruling Parisian French.        - 
WHY do you not understand dialects in Switzerland, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria ?  Sure, the dialects here around differ considerably from Standard-German, but people from Frankfurt understand Züritüütsch as well as Zürcher understand Frankfurterisch. And Texans expect that you understand them as well. Just as do other English-speakers.  
- 
Do not forget that ""German"" is not a single language  but rather a slightly unified conglomerate of German languages  of some Germanic tribes      - 
I just wonder how his Schwizertüütsch sounds !  HIS risk would possibly be that I would switch from Schwizertüütsch to Standard German when speaking with him

**************************************************  *************       I do not believe that the problems in London are due to immigration.  Immigrants rather have helped London, but could not stop the decline of  the Capital of the British Empire. I hope, most English are honest  enough to accept that the problem is home-made   
Immigration in Britain since about 1970 is NOT ""UNlimited"" but lmited,  many limiatations put in place by Mrs Thatcher. Tamils came to  Switzerland out of the misery of civil war on their ""Island in the Sun""  after Britain limited the possibilities of them to immigrate there. I  think, it was quite a good deal for Switzerland. In case of the war-torn  ex-Yugoslavia, it was not half as good
		    A)  even if you deduct the 25% of CH born people from the ""foreigners"" the number per capita is among the top in Europe and much higher than in Germany and several times as high as in Italy 
B)  the number of immigrants at present is really low, and not comparable to the numbers of the 1950ies and 60ies and 70ies.  There is no mass-immigration, except in the skulls of the Blocherites
		    I don't know exactly, but what I understand is that Britain used to be a public welfare state until Maggie Thatcher smashed it. Now in comparisn to other European countries GB is a quite americanized neocon and general living standard in a direct confrontation to F, D, I etc. is far lower.   
My point is that of course in huge cities like London you have social problems (like you have in Paris, Madrid, Marseille, NY or I don't know where else, but very unlike Switzerland, that does not have big cities).   
But London, in the contrary to the rest of the country, is a town with a very high average income,   
so something is wrong with your claim that foreigners had taken over the country ruining it, if most immigrants live in the big cities.   
So Britain's problem is social and institutional instead of cultural and ethnical.        Well, we agree on the point that CH all in all, summa summarum works maybe not great but it works. If it is despite immigration or because of immigration is another point, but it works   immigration as a fact.        A home is a home, a country is a country, and nationality has far little to do with it.   
Anyway CH has a relatively high portion of immigrants, is working not the worst, has also some restriction to non-EU and is not really menaced by social riots or civil war. So I do not see why and where you see a need for an alarm.        But Switzerland has always been a welfare state infact, hasn't it?
		    I don't know the numbers for other Euro countries.  in Switzerland, though, I think the number of ""foreigners"" who would qualify for a Swiss passport if they wanted one generally hovers around 50% of the total ""foreigner"" population.   
it's hard for me to judge as a gringo, of course, since 100% of the citizens of my native country are immigrants, no matter how much some of the folks back in the States try to deny it.          - 
A)  Global companies who set up shop here created thousands of jobs for locals, who otherwise had had to go abroad 
B)  Swiss workers now profit from far more opportunities and better ones than available in the past 
C)  companies still hunt for apprentices as there are more places around than applicants 
D)  nobody is blaming anybody for a ""plight"". The numbers of jobless people are at an all-time low 
E)  Their grandparents had to go abroad, their parents found jobs inside the country, and the young now have it easier than ever  ...  as late as in the 70ies, CH people emigrated to the United Kingdom to find work and career 
F)  If some of them feel insecure and/or anxious, they might check up their own positions.  If in trouble they might check up those EMSchemie subsidiaries right across the border in Austria and Germany !     
Sorry, but you mix-up Blocherite propaganda with actual realities
		    In what way has London declined, and what exactly have immigrants done to stop that supposed decline?   
The biggest problem that I can see in London is the dizzy height to which real estate prices have risen. What have immigrants done to stem that?
		    As a result of the restrictive laws here (long years until being entitled to get CH citizenship, absurdly high costs, etc) only about 25% upto 27% of the non-CH-foreigners are entitled to request citizenship
		    Reality check. Despite her grandstanding to look good in the face of the right wing of her own party, in real numbers Mrs Thatcher let in more immigrants than any previous government.
		    A) I doubt that London HAS declined but it is what Londoners complain about 
B) Immigrants have opened up new companies, new restaurants and brought new things to London  
B2)  it is comparable with Paris. Both Londoners and Parisians busily complain about things getting worse (of course due to those immigrants) while both simply is not the case 
C)  the immigrants by average are younger than the ""natives"" and so pay for the social-rents of the retired 
C2)  I do not like the ex-Yugo accent of speaking CH-German, but who will pay my AHV in a no longer so distant future        Really? How exactly did the children who went down the mines and worked the mills while their fathers went to die as cannon fodder in some pointless wars benefit from colonies? Last time I checked it was only the top couple of percent who benefitted. And those top couple of percent don't live in culturally mixed areas but in pretty parts of the Chilterns.   
And isn't it very racist of you to imply that multiculturalism and immigration should be a punishment for the past?
		    Thankfully, no, but I have experienced 6yo kids shunning my daughter on the playground for not speaking Swiss German. Kids that young aren't born like that; they're taught.
		    I think that she had no other choice. But to yield to the real world. And to accept that Britain like other former colonial powers also had/has some liabilities out of those times. I remember holidays in Northern Cyprus where I spoke locals and realized that practically everybody was a UK passport holder. Unlike their Greek Cyprus counterparts they quite obviously had not developed too much confidence in either ""all-Cyprus"" or ""TK-Cyprus"", It to me is obvious that the situation is obvious in other parts of the British Empire   
I still remember a holiday trip to Morocco when I was two hours too early at Tangiers Airport and then started to fill out the ""fiches d'immigration"" of Moroccans who were happy to meet somebody able to do it. I enquired about the name and simply used MY transliteration -- I asked about the address and heard that it was near the Mosque and so wrote down ""Rue de la Mosque"" .... or that it was right in the centre of town and so wrote down ""Rue du Centre""  ---  I asked about other things like date of birth  ""oh it is somehow in mid 1957"" and so wrote down ""15 juin 1957"". About 100 chaps waved at me smilingly when getting to their plane to Marseille       Pardon me? When did your ""all-time"" begin? For decades, the unemployment rates usually weresoemwhere around 1% or even substantially below, last time in 1990 (0.5%).       Yeah, a few emigrated, while, at the same time, hundreds of thousands had to be imported, some of them to do the jobs the emigrants had left behind plus many others to do the jobs the emigrants hadn't wanted to do. Emigrating was a joice for a few, not a necessity to many.
		    Those Swedish posh women probably belong to the 6% Swedish minority Finland has, Swedish being the second official language.   of them still believe they are part of the old empire and the Finns are some sort of second class peasants, who, without the civilization the Swedes brought, wouldn't be so better off today. Well, it's the old neighbourly rivalry thing (this is from the mouth of my friends)   
Anyways, I totally agree about some old folks here, they are really charming. Open-minded, with a sense of humour and with a surprinsing lust for communicating with about everyone.
		    Well...Finland used to be part of Sweden and....(and Swedish is also an official language in Finland).       Indeed not, but Finland is also a country where only 2% of the population isn't Finnish and they are rather strict about immigration policies. There was a big furor in recent years over the Somalis who were allowed in, who integrated, went to schools, etc. only to never find work after graduating from university.    
With the rise of parties like the SVP and others like them, as the eurocrisis progresses (and, say, immigrant nut jobs going on shooting sprees in France), it certainly has the potential to polarize the natives into doing rash things.      My sample is too small, but I will admit the skinheads did seem to be in abundance.
		    No, I am not mixing anything up. Between the attitudes towards foreigners I've personally witnessed and been on the receiving end of, and what Swiss and other expat friends have told me as well as the efforts by the SVP and their allies to chip away at/ water down the bi-lateral treaties and now this Masseneinwanderung Referendumm, and articles like the one below, the situation speaks for itself.        
It is on the basis of all of the above that I wrote that post.
		    I sometimes have to wonder where you get your data from. Between 1980 to 1990,  , the   unemployment rate was 1.15%. In 1992 it went to 2.5%.   
Youth unemployment rate is hovering close to 21 year highs at 8.5% (8.8% 2005). In 1990 before the recession it was at 3.2%. I consider the youth unemployment rate to be quite important.   
Relative unemployment is not high when compared to other countries, but hardly 'all time lows'      Well in 1974 to 1979. There was a negative immigration rate in Switzerland. i.e. More people leaving than coming - a net 163K people left.
		    Lex, please note that anything that might even faintly indicate that just a few of the SVP's points might partly be right simply is not perceived by Wolli. He sure is a good chap, but his eyesight sometimes is a bit poor. It can't be his memory, because he remembers accurately and verifiably how much he paid for that pair of socks in Austin, TX on Sept. 12, 1974 at 11:27 Central Time, so it must be selective perception on the visual side, ak.a. political blindness in one eye.
		 
			
			Putting his eyes a bit below the belt really Captain.   
The openly racist views of the SVP/UDC do actually smother sensible political debate about immigration in CH, sadly- as the vast majority (thank Goodness) do not want to be associated with those views - so yes, it can cause partial blindness, but for all the good reasons.
		    Odile, what I mean is that something that comes from the SVP or Blocher does not automatically have to be wrong. Sadly enough, after some time quite a few of their points turned out to be true, see Roschacher, Beyeler, Stocker, Hollenweger etc., to name just a few. That has nothing to do with the belt line.    
Facts are facts, no matter where they come from.
		    Sorry buddy...I'm am not British...lol      Switzerland works because they do have restrictions, why should they ""fix it if it ain't broke?""
		    Bravo to you...You hit the nail on the head. People want to automatically say something is wrong because it comes from the SVP but overall they SVP are really looking out for the country further down the line. Maybe their tactics are questionable at times, but Switzerland needs their voice for sure...
		    As an engineer, this makes my skin crawl.
		    It shouldn't...lol What does a country who seems to work things out for themselves and have been doing pretty well at it have to do with engineering? There is always room for improvement for sure, but Switzerland's immigration, or so-called ""racism"" is not one of them. That is what is meant by ""why fix it if it ain't broke,""  IMHO.
		    I could even agree on that (already by considering that if there were no migration control, even having collective contracts and legal persecution of Swiss employers who try to practice salary dumping, the very next day half Switzerland would find their jobs replaces by immigrants who would work for half of their salary).   
The point was that you cannot say that CH would or should discriminate immigrants because they want to ""take over the country"" and ""command"" and ruin the country.
		    The Bilateral Treaties got done on the basis of federal public votes which means that the people is in favour of them   
The article you mention shows that the EU immigrants now are exactly the motivated and well educated people Switzerland asked for all the time.  After decades with grumpy Innerschwiizer Tramführer and S-Bahn 'chiefs' we now have motivated and cheerful people form Sachsen. This was/is the receiving end HERE. Oh, sorry, you mean that those chaps from Leipzig and Dresden are Germans ?     
You mentioned an ex-Yugoslav in regard to using Swiss German, which indeed is bizarre, to put it mildly.    
You wrote/write about ""attitudes"". But the attitudes are just the same as in the rest of continental western Europe, which indeed is rather bad, and north-of-the-alps rather bad, but not half as sensational as you try to picture it.    
You mentioned the Ticino, which in political terms in the past two decades has moved to the right and is now pleasing even the Blocherites   
You mentioned the Romandie which is where the most xenophobe movements got up in Geneva   
And all in all, the attitudes no longer are as xenophobe as they were in the 1960ies and 70ies but have tremendously improved
		    A)  what I mean is that it was and is below 5% which is very low 
B)  youth unemployment rates may look high, but the economy is looking for applicants for jobs usually.  
C)  the ""negative immigration rate"" was a result of both Swiss natives, for example out of the agriculture, and many people of foreign origin departing to destinations looking more rewarding
		     I agree with you, however, the point is not to ""blatantly"" discriminate against all immigrants but they do have to separate the ""wheat from the chaff,"" so to speak. If some want to call that discrimination then so be it...
		    and it is not automatically the skin-colour. The fairly dark-skinned Tamils are generally liked while the heavily white-skinned Balkanese are not so much in favour     
			
			And who decides, and on which basis,  who is wheat and who is chaff? 
My wheat is not necessarily yours, and vice-versa?
		     That is not up for debate. That is for Switzerland to decide...
		 
			
			You can't deny it, if you live long enough in Zurich, you will take up the habits of the locals and start to hate the foreigners. Especially the Argovians.
		    And who is 'Switzerland""? It is definitely up for debate... and the Swiss definitely do not agree en bloc about this- and certainly have shown recently that the majority does NOT agree with Blocher and Co.
		    A rather broad brush and fairly inaccurate statement, yes Britain did have an Empire and colonies from about 1600 onwards, but so did all the other European powers. Until about 1900, as far as the European powers were concerned anything non European was considered fair game and up for grabs (even the US indulged in a little empire building...)   
And as far as empires go, Britain's was better than many and worse than none (I can think of a number of European countries whose imperial rule was much harsher and exploitative than Britain's). Let's not forget that a small country like the UK could only rule such a large Empire through the collaboration of local princes and leaders... Like the Roman Empire, the British Empire has left behind a sizable legacy - much of it positive (the world's largest democracy, India, has adopted and adapted much from Britain).   
The reason that Britain is inundated by ""poor and uneducated"" (your words), has more to do with the perception (based on reality) that the UK is a soft touch when it comes down to handing out the cash and benefits, than it has to do with it's colonial past (which may explain why you have immigrants from former non-UK colonies who are trying to get into the UK....).    
Britain has welcomed the poor and displaced in the past, but such immigrants integrated and became British (e.g. the French Huguenots...), today the resentment of immigrants by many is because numerous immigrants not only do not integrate but don't even pay lip service to the notion of abiding by the host country's laws and social norms and THAT fuels xenophobia...
		    Funny, but I seem to remember a vote being taken a couple of years ago about whether or not to continue with the bilateral treaties. While it passed in the end, it was interesting to note that it got higher support in the Romandie and the French-speaking cantons, but in Inner-Schweiz and Central Schweiz, high numbers of voters voted against keeping the treaties.      Why is it bizarre? Because she spoke Schwyzertüutsch? She's lived here 40 years and has made an impressive integration, I would say. Or perhaps you misunderstood something. She was NOT the one harassing me over not speaking Schwyzertüutsch. It was my Swiss-German colleagues who harassed me about it. They also harassed the ex-Yugoslav and some of the other foreigners in our office as well.      I don't live in the rest of Continental western Europe; I live here in die Schweiz  And there is no sensationalizing of anything. I'm just relating what I have personally experienced here the past seven years and the changes I've seen. I know it's not pleasant to read, and I am sorry for that.      Well, for a bunch of extreme xenophobes and Blocherrites, they seem to be making an impressive effort to try to combat racism and promote diversity:          No offense to you, but somehow, I have a hard time believing this, because both my Swiss friends and some of the foreigners I know who've lived here for many years tell me that attitudes used to be more relaxed towards foreigners, and that over the past 10 years, those attitudes have started shifting in the opposite direction. Even I have seen an increase in anti-foreigner sentiment since I've been here.
		 
			
			TrainDoctor- where I lived in the UK, the 'uneducated and the poor' were NOT the immigrants.
		    This article showcases just how foreigners in Switzerland can and do thrive.   
In fact, foreigners in Switzerland have a lot of advantage over the local Swiss in many ways.  They have education, experience and motivations that are not commonly found amongst the locals, so are often paid a lot more.    
What a strange way to socially oppress a minority.       I believe that you need to distinguish between expats and economical immigrants, as the latter are certainly only ""appreciated"" as the budget solution for labor and hardly earn a comfortable income.
		    hmmm, same with Mexican migrant workers in the USA.... ""my country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty""   
So it seems there is a social structure in Switzerland that is based on economic and social productivity, rather than on race.  It just so happens that many on the bottom rung fits a particular ethnicity?     
Even then, this resembles more of a meritocracy than a race based social structure.
		    Yes, thus the number of immigrants living the Swiss dream and succeeding across the ranks? I think not. The US at least provides a wide range of opportunities, whereas the Swiss system limites these oportunities to a Kebab stand or a career in blue collar heaven it seems.
		    But then it is a very small country, not even larger than the city of Los Angeles.  I think its the size of the local market that limits it rather than a conscientious effort on the part of the Swiss to keep people down. If a foreigner could create an opportunity to produce value without harming society, I don't think the Swiss would stop it. Nikolas Hayek did it.   
I think the onus is on the foreigner to develop their opportu ities, not expect it to be handed to them by the Swiss, many of whom are struggling on their own. Why should the foreigner be privileged over the Swiss in this case?
		    ...but population size doesn't have anything to do with the labor market and the possibilities to succeed; just look at Hong Kong or Singapore for instance, which are among the most liberal economies in the world. Also, you cannot create opportunities, where the social infrastructure and political norms don't allow you to strive. Since the only entities, which seem to be regulated in this country are economical interests, one cannot fail to recognize the glass ceiling imposed.
		    That same ""glass celing"" is imposed on foreigners and Swiss alike. I don't think it is done to keep people down, rather to keep the place intact. With a country the size of Switzerland, total liberalization implies opening the flood gates. It would quickly be swept away by the rest of the world until it no longer exist. I think what we see is Switzerland acting in the best interest of Switzerland, which I would applaud. I mean, if I wanted the same opportunities as Singapore and Hong Kong, I would be well advised to move there myself. I think this is how the Swiss see it as well, and why we do see the Swiss moving somewhere else.
		    Keeping the place intact in what sense? You mean like keeping it in the 1970s? So that the few monopolies that run this place can fatten their pocket even more?
		    Keeping its sovereignty and national identity, especially their system of direct democracy, which is unique in the world. Basically protecting their motherland, which is a valid human instinct. They don't seem to be particularly attracted to what they see in other countries of the world, and I could not blame them for that.
		    Well, that is all good and dandy but rather pointless, as there would have to be a strong cultural driving force within the national identiy to begin with. The few things which could be allocated to national identity all come down to the media fuelled dogma of sovereignty and direct democracy. Nobody talks about the banking secrecy, which is Switzerland's biggest export...which without it, this place would probably look and feel like the Ukraine. Also, direct democracy has probably harmed the country more than it has benefited the general populace....and thus, sould be abolished IMO.
		    Or a professor, or a heart surgeon, or the CEO of a big watch making combine, etc..
		    or a football player, or a model, or simply someone whose only other option is to live in a war ravage country where their lives are constantly in danger, etc.
		    How easily is that achieved here versus elsewhere?    That is not the point. Anybody living in a war ravaged country would appreciate safety anywhere. We're talking about the opportunities and possibilities provided...and not the water scarcity in Mogadishu for instance.
		    I don't see how Switzerland has harmed itself. As of late, its main flaw has been that it has done exceedingly too well for itself.  I think Switzerland is doing great, and hope it continues to do so. Granted it does not have thr bling and glamour of Beverly Hills or Vegas, but for that, one can always just go to Beverly Hills or Vegas.
		    How has it harmed itself? For instance, maybe you didn't follow the recent ban on the construction of minarets, or the referendum on 2nd homes, or the almost lost battle and badly reinforced smoking ban, or..... 
Again, Switzerland is doing well as long as foreign money keeps pouring into local banks. The domestic economy with its forced aggregate deman can hardly be the reason for its ""success"".
		    Clearly a matter of perspective, as I am not planning to construct a new minaret, my second home should be in Hawaii, and I am a smoker.  Many in the USA say the same things about the legislations that are being passed or not passed. No country can please everybody, as it is normally impossible. As for the economy, I see people being paid 4 times more than what they are being paid elsewhere, and there is no massively insurmountable debt.  Do you really see what is happening elsewhere in the world for comparison?
		 
			
			by the way, reality check here.... this is a thread on racism in Switzerland. I realize that seeing racism here is along the same lines as seeing anything and everything wrong about Switzerland, but perhaps we should get back on topic.
		    4 times? Hardly...take into consideration the huge premium we have to pay for everything and I can only assume, that for some the balance sheet doesn't ad up.    Sure, where were we...oh yes, racism. I totally dislike it, however it is the right of each individual to hold racist opinions IMO.
		    Seriously true. I know what it cost to hire certain people in the US. For example, Pilots and lawyers can be hired nowadays for about a quarter of what you would have to pay them here.   
No doubt there are racists in Switzerland. But it is refutable that Switzerland is a race based society as portrayed by certain individuals and journalists.
		     I guess, it all comes down to economies of scale...as the system probably makes it easier to aspire for a great profession there.    Certainly, there are racists anywhere in the world but the initial thread was about curbing xenophobic attitudes such as those infamous posters and implementing laws which would protect people from racism, especially institutionalized racism.
		     
Yes, marvellous culture that Nigel Farage is trying to preserve! (see great British comedy link above). An alcoholic will never admit to being an alcoholic, similarly a racist cannot see any racial problem. The two twats you have named are two of the most racist people in Europe, they don't defend any culture, they don't have any!
		 
			
			LIB 80% of the doctors and dentists in my area are foreigners. Just looked at the electoral list for the May elections, and the vast majority are 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants from all over. A large number of our very succesfull businesses here are 2nd/3rd generation immigrants too. 
Many of you are basing your views on living in ONE town, in a very limited circle due to your job- and without much communication with 'natives' (yes including all those 2nd/3rd generation immigrants who are doing so well).
		    Odile, most doctors here are German, because the Swiss system doesn't produce enough high-skilled labor.
		 
			
			As a second generation East African British Asian, I agree with your sentiments below. It is ok to keep your native culture but also one has to adapt to that of the host nation, enrich it, but nt change it.   
Living in Switzerland for 5 years what I am finding is that I am going through a struggle again, just like I did when I was a child and the only 'paki' in the class. Switzerland is like what the UK was in the aely 80s, and so 30 years behind.    
In Switzerland ,  have worked hard for 5 years and no opportunity has been kept away from me, I have tried hard to learn German and to mix with my local community. Yet I still get stares, blank faces and weird gestures made (usually from Non native Swiss people), it is nothing but ignorant behaviour. Somehow all foreigners get painted with the same paint bush. It doesnt matter if you are white, black etc, we are foreigners. So it is not rascist behaviour, it is xenophobic.In the UK this is not the case anymore.    
Switzerland will adapt soon, hopefully it will find a balance, as quite rightly the UK approach has gone too far (as you mention), however the positive legacy has been human rights, and a non acceptence of racsist behaviour. The majority of non native British citizens are proud to be British and proud to live in a country where there are Indians playing cricket for the national side, Africans playing football, representation in Parliament, presenting on TV. There is no country like it and I have often challenged those disillusioned twats to prove it is better in their native countries, after all, they have a choice, and that is to go back, but do they? NO!    
The lure to go back to the UK is strong as I am not willing to let my kids go through the hell I went through in the 80s and neither do I have the strength to be educative and passive and accepting of what in my book is sometimes unacceptable behavior amongst fellow human beings in a civilised country.   
Having said that, I have had a great time here and have made some really good life long friends. Its a hard decision, but it's one being made most probably by my heart and not my brain ! I am thankful for the time that I have had and am thankful for every hospitality afforded to me. Perhaps its time to go home. Now where did I put that 'hot cross bun' recipe?   
---
		    A)  The ""system"" is not the problem, the problem is that a profession with practically unlimited labour-times is not what the young academics want, like doctors  
B)  The ""system"" ?   If you mean by ""system"" the average population and the Maternités which do not ""produce"" enough babies 
C)  The ""system"" produces people who first go abroad to make experience and career. Look at Bundesrat Berset who after his education was active in Brasil as professional jazz pianist. It may look special but is not sooo special really.    
And then we come to your statement.  A majority of all doctors are Swiss, the share of Germans is important, sure, but miles away from ""most"". Go to a hospital and look round, or consult the phone-directories. And look at the history of both Zürich University and ETH and you will see that it was German professors who built up both institutions.  And did some good work really. 
Simply give a glance at THIS link        So many people there with great aspirations have no profession (unemployed). The few who have accomplished great things did so despite a system that worked against them, not served to them on a silver platter. The same opportunities exist here in Switzerland, along with the same challenges.
		    Not necessarily true. My husband got transferred back to the US with a salary of about 10k more, irrespective of currency, e.g. 10k chf--> 20k usd, so he's making more in absolute terms and WAY more in terms of purchasing power.
		    Yeah well I wouldnt use doctors/medicine as a good example for not enough 'high skilled' labour because the problem there is more the lobby group than anything else. Its the licensing body that is to blame for the lack of supply - it usually is - because in this case it certainly isnt the market.   
There would be PLENTY of potential doctors available within the Swiss population if it wasnt for the professions licensing group in the way. They are the ones that are limiting the number of graduates that are taken in and then when supply grossly stops following demand you end up with the situation in Switzerland and foreign doctors need to be brought in to fill gaps. If anything that should disgust the swiss based applicants that failed to get a place even though they would fulfill all the requirements.    
It has nothing at all to do with 'produce' but everything to do with 'regulate'. Your choice of another profession would have been a better example.
		    There are even people making millions more per year, but thats not the point. High unemployment depresses salaries. The longer the unemployment, the more desperate people become, the more likely they are to take lower paying jobs. Unemployment has been high for a prolonged amount of time, and no real recovery in sight.
		    Maybe for engineering, but luckily the quote was in regards to POLITICS. And yes, most of us would be a lot better off if many politicians did nothing and sat on their hands. Instead they have votes to buy (welfare) and laws to sell    
			
			Many surveys in CH have shown that young Swiss are not interested in becoming GPs (General Practitioners/family doctors) as hours are too long and salaries relatively low. Nothing to do with Government intervention. Already the reason why most of the GPs here have been foreign ever since I was a child.   
Quote:        
  		If it continues, the decline in the number of GPs could have a serious effect on health care, they warn.   
 		To better inform the general public of the situation, their  association has launched a campaign demanding a change to health policy  that encourages more students to embrace the profession.   
Only  ten per cent of medicine students plan on careers as family doctors.  Meanwhile, half of Switzerland’s GPs are expected to retire in 2016, and  by 2021, it is expected that 75 per cent will have retired.   
Dr  Bruno Kissling, who has a practice in Bern’s Elfenau neighbourhood, is  one of those family doctors. He plans to work as long as he can, but  retirement is on the cards for him too.   
“I’m 62... and I still  really like to work. I can’t imagine retiring at 65, but I do plan to  withdraw from professional life at 68. I think that at some point you  run out of the energy, but not the desire, to work,” Kissling told  swissinfo.ch.
		    1. First of all, lets get some facts right. I was referring to a quote about not enough 'doctors' because CH doesnt produce enough 'highly skilled labour'. Switzerland CAN produce more doctors, thats not why there is a shortage. What they CANT control is where those doctors go after they graduate i.e. which field. So we are either talking about doctors i.e. the profession, or the sub group within the profession i.e GP's, surgeons etc. I refer to the former.   
2. There are approximately 3.5x the number of applications to places in Swiss medical schools. So in other words 3100 odd get REJECTED. The demand is there to become a doctor as per my first post.   
The information below is from crus.ch.          Yes, but not choosing to become    
So the question then, why dont they take the top 100 failed applicants and give them the option to become GP's? Well thats because not everyone wants a solution. The problem often works to the advantage of a select group of individuals.   
3. Try to quote me accurately, I didnt say 'government intervention'. The lobby group often PRECEDES the intervention. I was referring to the registering body.   
4. When you interfere with a market force (supply/demand), you will always get unintended consequences. i.e. try to stranglehold the intake, dont be surprised then when a shortage becomes a crisis.
		    In Zürich, in the 1950ies and 60ies and 70ies, a vast majority of all doctors, GPs and dentists alike, were Swiss.  Later, many people of East European and Nordic origin  joined the field, but the CH people remained a majority. If I when in hospital look round, the clear majority still are CH, one out of 12 in the oncology is a German, one is Ticinese and two are Italians. When Mum in 2007 had to move into a care-home, there were two Germans (one women and one man) in the care-team, and both were superb. If I hear that there are people who want to deport such wonderful persons I am between tears and a fury !     
The best chap in the careteam of the Triemli-Spital, in October 07, was a German, and we had so many jokes with each other. Whomever wants to kick such a person out should be slapped on the right and on the left for at least an hour !   
But the also excellent other women in the care-team was Swiss, and so was the chief doctor. ""My"" doc at university (meet him once per month) and a majority of his colleagues are Swiss. My dentist is a Swiss of East European origin. I back somewhere in the 80ies, after having been injured by a violent chap in Amsterdam, on arrival in a Paris hotel got an appointment with Dr Med Libermann, a Jewish eye doctor in the Rue Rivooli, who more or less saved my eyelight !  I simply fail to understand people who care about the nationality of doctors.
		 
			
			I agree Wooli, who cares, it is quality and not nationality that counts. 
To get into medical school in CH, all you need to do is pass the Matura - unlike the very selective process of say the UK - where you need very high results + show that you are the right candidate for the course/profession (letter of introduction to the University you apply to + teacher recommendation, and often, interview). So no wonder a great proportion fails - and thank goodness for that. To say that universities could take on 'the top failures' and only if they agree to become GPs is a dreadful one - talk about government intervention! Being a good GP is in many ways much harder than being as being a specialist in a very narrow field. Just like being a good primary school teacher is in many ways much more difficult than being a college professor. But we digress a long long way from the thread re racism, so if anybody wants to continue this discussion, best to open a new thread. All I wanted to say is that it is very possible in CH for the children of immigrants to access highly regarded professions and businesses- much better in fact than in those countries which still rely heavily on private education and even private universities only accessible to the chosen few.
		    Bingo!   
That is the center of what is perceived by foreigners as Swiss racism or xenophobia.  The Swiss have a deeply ingrained notion of social and work ethics embedded in their psyche.  It is centered around one's personal responsibility and obligations to society, for its betterment and for a better standard of living.   
Notice that the Swiss recently turned down a sixth week of vacation? Its not that they don't like to vacation, but they feel that individuals, including themselves, should be doing more for the betterment of the country. Its a sort of Calvinist or Zwinglian guilt trip in a way. But they do take pride in this.   
Now, enter a foreigner from a culture where they have a mentality that society should take care of the individual. Well, just about every post soviet bloc country had a system of society where the state parented the individual. All the individual had to do was demand their daily bread. And when coming to Switzerland, they maintained the same mindset.   
Or what about an individual from the US who find in perfectly alright to ""milk the system"" for their benefit? They come to Switzerland and get frustrated that they flack for trying to milk it.   
From a Swiss perspective, both examples appear as leeches, or parasites. Most Swiss, as a matter of pride, don't even like to show they need help from their gemeinde. But here you have foreigners who have a pattern of coming here to overburden their social safety-net.  And it is EXACTLY this that the SVP posters purport to represent in their psychological campaigns.   
So when a foreigner comes into a picture, their is a suspicion they do not understand or even have a clue that a Swiss code of etihcs exists. So the tendency is to contain at a distance until they have been proven to know and understand ""Swissness"". Once a foreigner is a able to demonstrate it, they let them into their sphere and treat them the same as any other Swiss, regardless of their race or nationality.
		    I really am not sure why you felt compelled to have a go at my post without quoting me directly? You obviously WANT a response, but im not sure why this way.   
Please next time at least have the decency to reply or better yet, dont (if you feel it is off topic which it was I agree). Your first reply to my post was completely unrelated and ALREADY off topic   ,  which i proved to you - and I even gave you a link to check yourself. You quoted a newspaper or article without quoting a source.      No, there are plenty of would be perfect doctors out there who dont get a place at uni NOT because they failed the admission criteria - they actually PASSED - but because there are no more government funded places - thats the same in many countries. Your little dig at my post was factually wrong and unwarranted.      Instead of reminding people, why not take your own advice, especially without the bait.    
			
			The source of the article quoted is clearly at the bottom.  
Are you an 'Economist' by any chance. You sound familiar.
		    I have never heard of a ""medical school"" here. The Matura schools phase out a fixed percentage of all students which means that if your mates are good you may be doomed. The Germans have the much milder Abitur, BUT as the Abitur allowed far too many people to universities had to introduce the Numerus Clausus. I personally would have preferred the German system, and would have ""bridged"" the interim period by doing some manual work as a labourer ,  just as I did between dropping out of Matura Mittelschule and starting my apprenticeship. That interim period made it easy for me to communicate successfully with our warehouse workers later on  !
		    from what I can gather, the Swiss generally don't like being lumped into a big basket of stereotypes.  pretty much just like the rest of us.          Sounds as if you refer to the UK. What I found strange in the past 3 decades was that after the moderate leftist James Callaghan was replaced first by the harsh right-winger Mrs Thatcher and then by the ""leftist"" conservative John Major but finally by the right-wing ""Labourite"" Tony Blair (rather to the right of Mr Major) and later on by Mr Brown (difficult to understand) and now finally by that neo-OxBridge snob Mr Cameron   
Am I a snob myself ?  Just got a delvery from a delivery service with a nice Kebab and an absolutely supert ""Cuvillon"" d'AIGLE Chablais wine of superb quality ... and the whole thing for CHF 22.-      Again, the Kebab IS good but that Cuvillon-Aigle is perfect       Charles Brown, Albert Einstein, James Joyce ...
		    Interesting as all the news analysis I read about it seemed to suggest it had more to do with the burden on the employer and possibly there being fewer jobs as a result leading to higher unemployment. Finland has a really high QoL score and many with a few years on the job get 6-8 weeks, some even more depending on the field and seniority. Catholics take great pride in their guilt, too, though it doesn't make them any more pious.       Mkay.    
Nope. I understand it is digestible to have history presented in easily classifiable notions. But the reality was different. And, I do not know any post Easter block nationals that would expect state to take care of them. Maybe since they had to fight for everything and had to be patient. And super resourceful without anyone knowing. The demands as you describe them, were years long waiting lists and inability to actually get anything apart from undignified conditions. Officially. Unofficially, people had their quiet and efficient ways.       I also happened to work for a bunch of US universities and other employers. Trying to milk anything was very bad ethics. In fact, I had to plea to be able to get a half day off for a dentist, unpaid. The standard vacation was a week, two weeks off was unheard of. Normal was to take 4-5 days off, max, in order to not block the work for too long. Perfectionism. Total slavery. But super efficient and positive. Good team spirit. Never say ""no"" or that you ""cannot do something"". It sounds very different than what you wrote about.    
We all have different ways to stereotype, but saying people from either yank lands or post soviet are certain ways or work certain way...a mental shortcut.
		         
Yeah, you're right those are stereotypes I pulled out of thin air.  I could have chosen a american cowboy or something else.  I was trying to contrast cultural styles that conflict with Swiss mentalities.
		    Nonsense, it's because they all have moved to Ticino!    
Tom
		       
although the US does indeed have a welfare system, if anything the stereotype of Americans is that all we do is work.  and of course spend our money on McDonald's, Justin Bieber records and pet rocks.  it's the reason I generally try to avoid my fellow gringos over here, all they want to do is talk about work and how many vacations they are missing.   
on top of that, you clearly missed my point - in an effort to defend what you consider to be the ""Swiss mentality"", you stereotyped half of Europe, the US   Switzerland.  which seems rather ironic given the topic of the thread.           
My point is the Swiss are suspicious that non-Swiss may not uphold what in their mind is ""Swiss Quality"".  So yes, the non-Swiss are stereotyped and are kept at a distance.
		    so you're saying you agree with the dude from the ECHR?          Hey, pet rocks are awesome!!              
The guy from the ECHR is not saying anything new nor important.  It seems more like he just needed to appear like he is performing some official function.  The situation is too complex for a letter by an inept bureaucrat to capture.   
There are things that can be construed as racism, but may not be racism at all.  At least not racism as defined as hate of a particular race.  Maybe with racial profiling, I can see that.  But then racial profiling occurs everywhere.  Taxi cab drivers in NYC routinely practice racial profiling out of fear for their own safety.  I don't see an ECHR report about it.   
In the case of the Swiss, yes, I do agree with some of their desires to safeguard and protect their society.  But no, I don't agree with the psychological tactics of the far-right campaigns.  Many Swiss don't.
		 
			
			As far as racism is concerned, i remember the day i left my country(I'm African and black) . At the airport my aunt told me to be careful and   a white girl.  Fortunately, my mother is not like her and is color blind. 
But i can assure you that racism(or ignorance) exists everywhere even in Africa.  It's up to you, to educate them whenever you talk to them(and i know it's possible).      
When i arrived in Italy to study engineering, in my residence(a private catholic) we were 2 blacks guys.   Students(one guy in particular) was amazed to know that in my country we had Playstation, Nintendo 64, Gameboy, etc. he felt off his chair when i told him i had done my driving license when i was 18 in Africa.    Simply unbelievable for him.    
But you know what? at the end of the year he told me that after knowing me, he now looks at African people with different eyes.  be a positive example, be an ambassador, and other people of your same race will benefit from it.  Remember anyway that you can not always win.    
USA(they are far from united) and UK are hardly a model for Switzerland to follow.  may be Canada. but still...
		 
			
			Off topic. 
I don't know where the assumption of the banks being the only Swiss industry comes from. But it is false.     
In the ranking listing the top 11   with the the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue(Fortune Global 500), Switzerland is (after United Kingdom, Germany, France, China, Japan and United states). The amazing thing is that Switzerand has   companies in the top 500 corporations worlwide despite its relatively small population.   
1. United States   ----   133    (313,286,000   inhabitants) 
2. Japan    -----------     68   (127,960,000    inhabitants) 
3. China      ---------      61   (1,339,724,852    inhabitants) 
4. France      ----------   35   (65,350,000   inhabitants) 
5. Germany    --------     34    (81,799,600   inhabitants) 
6. United Kingdom  -----   30   (62,262,000   inhabitants)       ------       (     inhabitants) 
8. South Korea  ---------  14   (48,875,000    inhabitants) 
9. Netherlands ----------  12   (16,847,007    inhabitants) 
10. Canada  ------------   11  (34,799,000    inhabitants) 
11. Italy   --------------  10   (60,681,514   inhabitants)          
Spin-off companies from ETH and EPFL are created every single year. In Italy it doesn't happen. In Germany(my sisters are studying there) it does but not like in Switzerland.
		     
Its more Kafkaesque to paint a picture of a racist country controlled by an evil banking system, oppressing people.  Chocolate factories and Umpa Lumpas would be harder to take seriously.
		    No one is more evil than Goldman Sachs, which with their software can manipulate the markets..           I know what you mean. But i think it's difficult to know about the many industrial  Swiss companies if you are not into engineering(mechanical) or  chemistry.
		    Arguments that doubtlessly all have some value of their own, but maybe served to rationalise the guilt trip?
		 
			
			to be honest I did not feel racism at all until this moment.   
Lets see
		 
			
			Well Vaud people showed the UDC that their ideas are not wanted - the only UDC candidate in Romandie was got rid off, and now they have a majority of women on the executive and no right-wing representation at all.
		    those corporations ""earn"" that revenue inside the Alps solely as a matter of tax planning.  this is one of the things that has authorities in Italy and Spain in particular poking around.       
I have previously posted that I have not found Switzerland to be ""racist"" at all.  there is certainly some truth to the statement that the Swiss distrust everybody, but they do so without bias.  from what I have seen, folks who make an honest effort to ""integrate"" or at least are respectful of local customs and culture are all treated the same, regardless of race.   
there is also some truth to the statement, though, that more could be done to encourage ""integration"".
		     
While there ARE racists among the SVP/UDC people, I would NOT describe that party as a racist party. The other way round, the problem of their party in the Romandie is not so much their ideas but their mentality which is ""bodeständig tüütsch-schwiizerisch"". Which in fact also is the reason for their problems in most cities in the ""Alémanique"". There is a particular party in Geneva, the MCG, which sounds to be even to the right of the UDC/SVP and proves that rightwing-ideas in the Romandie have a market.   
The bad results they got in the Romandie would not have been so difficult for the SVP, had they not also got disastrous results in St. Gallen, Zürich, Aargau and other Cantons. Their party under Blocher during 30 years moved more and more to the right, and it looks as if they landed up in a kind of ""overkill-position""
		    Interesting, I didn't know that Nestle, Roche, Novartis, ABB, Adecco, UBS,Credit Swiss, Swiss Re, Zurich Financial Services etc. were actually Spanish and Italian companies that have moved their headquarters to Switzerland for tax reasons.
		    I was actually taught French at school by a guy from Senegal who had won an award for being the best on French grammar. I think of several thousand people from across the French-speaking world who did that test there were only three who had zero errors and he was one of them. None of those three was French by the way.
		 
			
			Amazing to see that most of those UK/US spelling competitions for kids are usually won by children of Asian origin.
		    well, I certainly didn't intend this to be a pissing match about the Swiss economy...   
...but you do realize that, in an effort to rebut the myth that the Swiss economy is centered around banking and chocolates, 4 of the firms you listed are in the finance industry and 1 of them started in large part as a chocolates company?       
Italy and Spain (among others) are not upset about companies moving their HQ's to Switzerland, since HQ's don't generate the bulk of the employment opportunities, etc.  what they're upset about is that hundreds of millions of Euros worth of products are manufactured and sold within their borders but taxed here in Switzerland, largely because of the way multinationals manage internal transfer pricing.   
I don't there is any shame in Switzerland's rich history in banking and financial services.  yes, there have been lapses in judgment and scandals, but that is no different than anywhere else in the world.  I also don't think there is any shame in the way that Switzerland has marketed itself as a tax-efficient place to do business.  and of course there is no shame in the country's chocolate industry.
		     
Welcome to Switzerland!  You ought to see how many registered oil and mining companies are out here, without the actual wells or mines being actually in Switzerland.   
This is common for multinational corporations.  There are approx. 60,000 Apple employees.  But as for those who actually manufacture Apple products, 230,000 are at a company called Foxconn in China.
		    well, Switzerland chose wisely - tax revenue beats serving your citizens up for what is little more than slave-labor every day of the week.
		     
Hence, Switzerland is the focus of LOTS of jealousy around the world.
		 
			
			Mind you, the Fortune 500 Global list is for publicly traded companies that are required to open their books.  What does not make that list are private concerns that get to about the same scale.  As for their actual size, nobody knows except for a few individuals in their accounting team and their government tax agent.
		      I never wanted to rebut the fact that Switzerland produces chocolate or is an important financial center. Btw Switzerland also produces watches.   
It's actually true that international corporations move to Switzerland because they get these phantastic tax breaks. But this is an issue that doesn't concern the big Swiss companies, with the exception of Glencore and Xstrata. And there it's not Spain or Italy that loses out but some poor African state.
		    Taxes ?  the taxes thing of course IS important, but a reason for many ""multinationals"" is the geographic location and the services available    
Bank companiies ?  Banks by nature deal with money. This means that they on a purely financial scale land up fairly high. But those financial figures are misleading. ABB and Swatch for example are more important for Switzerland than CS in quite many ways. Such statistics are crap
		 
			
			I can assure you that those huge tax breaks are being looked up VERY carefully as we speak by the new Vaud Government, and but other Cantons in the area. One Brazillian company only declared a minute portion of their profits last year and will not get away with it, I hope.
		    And pro-audio equipment (otherwise I'd have been unemployed the past 26 years).   
Tom
		    In comparison, what you find in other countries is tragic;  Governments merely playing the role of pimping out its citizens, decisions being made in favor of the highest bidders, graft and corruption, the population lost of trust in its government, they disown their governments and give up any sense of responsibility for their country, communities fall apart, and people's lives hang in the balance.   
One can call Switzerland anachronistic.  I don't care.  It's because it's still one of the few places that still has its act together.
		    Very true - Switzerland is undoubtedly one of only a handful of countries that has any right to call itself a democracy. The US and EU member nations can only pretend these days. Almost nothing of import is ever put to a referendum in those countries (especially regarding the all important issues of the day such as financial services reform, deficit-reduction measures and pan-EU fiscal integration) whereas Switzerland generally treats its citizens as grownups at least in terms of offering referenda on important matters.
		 
			
			What is the point of declaring only a minute portion of their profit in case of a tax break??    
Anyway, always nice to see that companies are being seduced to move to CH with huge tax breaks and being blamed in case they actually do so and on top of that have the nerve to actually claim the tax breaks.       
			
			Beyond tax breaks, there is the benefit of jurisdiction.  Coporation X, conducting business in country Y, need not be answerable to the inquiries from the government of country Z.
		    Not really, the majority of them originated from Switzerland, have always had their HQ here and have either production or research in Switzerland, they are therefore proper Swiss corporations by most definitions. That a global 500 corporation can't have the bulk of its operations or most important market in Switzerland should be self-evident.
		    I would actually like to believe that my employer moved its HQ here because of taxes, but I fear the prime motivation was cheap (at the time oh so many years ago) real estate and the famous Swiss sense of privacy and discretion (which was an important driver for married dudes who had a hankering for flight attendants).          ok, just for this I am going to compile a list of all Fortune 500 multinationals located in switzerland and list their respective jurisdictions of formation.  just kidding.          So that must have been before WW I, right?
		    did they even have airplanes back then???
		    Normal global travellers went by oceanliner       
and      
The first one on top, the ""Teutonic"" is historic because it was on this ship when Souza who had to return to New York swiftly, after the death of his manager, on the voyage devised ""Stars and Stripes"", the National March of the USA.
		    as is quite often the case after one of your posts, I am utterly speechless.
		    well, here the official story   
...........................     The march was an immediate success, and Sousa's Band played it at  almost every concert until his death over 25 years later.
		    Yes.. but engine technology(mostly reciprocating engines) was not mature enough, and the payload of the airplanes was not that great.    
_     It wasn’t until the 1930’s  that the practical gas turbine as we know today began to be placed into  commercial service.  These gas turbines were largely the development of Brown  Boveri and Company in Switzerland and intended to be an offshoot of their  development of the Velox boilers. http://www.turbomachine.com/history/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown,_Boveri_%26_Cie  
I think you underestimate Swiss engineering.   
I'm not Swiss, but i do love good mechanical engineering.       Today me and my wife were shopping and by mistake we took someone's parking spot (the woman was really far away and no blinker!..) anyways, after parking the woman was so angry at us that she called us  ""pig pack of foreigners""..we were both shocked...my wife is Swiss so she understood the dialect expression and stopped the woman's car to first, confront her of her racist statement and second to take the plate number. 
In my opinion there are open minded and very narrowed minded Swiss (heck like in any other place I guess), but I see the problems the Government is facing. Myself I am highly educated and work in research where I meet/work with people from everywhere. I was so astounding today that me and my wife had to stop for a while before continuing our day. 
I hope none here have had the bad luck of crossing one of these narrow minded people.   
I hope for the best in this country, because to be honest foreigners do a great deal in favor to the country.   
Happy Easter,

			When one is realy pissed off ,words come ease out off ones mouth       Exactly, and is then one people let their fears out...
		    sorry for this. I am sure it is no consolation, but unfortunately there are folks here for whom ""foreigner"" is just an all-around insult, the way we might call somebody an ""a**hole"" back in the States. half the time the folks who are throwing the insult around end up wasting their breath on people who are Swiss.   
enjoy your Easter, there are unfortunately stupid people everywhere.       
P.S. my approach to those sorts of situations is to simply pretend to be a tourist.  works at the restaurants, too.  telling people you live here is always a crap shoot, telling them you're a tourist always brings a smile.  there's truth in those first 5 minutes of  .
		    Thanks for your kinds words, it is a shame that we have to hide the fact of leaving here so to avoid being insulted or misstreated. Next tuesday I am going to get informed about my rights and actions I can follow against this violation to human rights. I might not get anything done but I think that if I want to be a citizen here I have to behave as one, right?   
Happy Easter to you too 
 Crotens
		    it's not a question of ""human rights"", it's a question of your rights under Swiss law.  if you haven't already, try learning the local language.  it is a long, slow and painful process (at least it is for me thus far), but the more you learn the better you will be able to diffuse these sorts of situations.  and, if you're not able to diffuse them, you will know the right things to say to clearly communicate the boundaries of what kinds of behavior you're willing to accept, i.e. you will know how to tell people to piss up a rope.       
again, many Swiss distrust non-Swiss, it has nothing whatsoever to do with ""race"".  this is not, of course, a ""Swiss"" issue, this dynamic exists pretty much everywhere in the world.  try being Swiss in Knoxville, Tennesse, for example.
		    sure, and many Zürcher distrust non-Zürcher, Basler for example.        
This person attacked us verbally just because of the skin of my skin (I am latin american). I did not have to try speaking before she called us a ""pig pack of foreigners"", so it's not about mastering or not the dialect. It's pure xenophobia.    
This is an issue of human rights (one can find it when reading the universal declaration of human rights). Swiss law comes into play in case citizen needs protection.   
I disagree with the passive attitude of trying to lower your head to avoid being pointed at, rather than proactively improving this society.
		    if you think that getting called a ""pig"" or a ""foreigner"" after inadvertently taking some pensioner's parking spot is grounds for a UN case, then I wish you nothing but luck and hopefully you get traction with your local authorities.  for me it is not about avoidance   trying to ""improve"" society, it is simply a matter of focusing on what is important to me and mine and not wasting time or calories on folks who are entirely irrelevant (I've been called far worse things in my hometown of Detroit, Michigan), but to each his own.          The person attacked you  
If you didn't look like a foreigner to her she would most likely have attacked and insulted you all the same, simply using different words.     
...and BTW, one thing to consider before you decide to go the legal route:    If your wife actually prevented the swiss women from driving away against her will, that women might sue your wife for coercion (Nötigung).
		    Thanks for your post, Mark.   
The woman stopped on her own will, my wife then stood in front of the vehicle to take a picture of the plate number.   
 Yes, she could have told us ""stupid"" ""idiot""..whatever (and I understand her frustration), but that's quite different from being racist and the level of the insult is very different. I don't think that the cause/effect here is  ""balanced"". Imagine next time a misunderstanding happens they will shoot me in the head for upsetting them....""Sorry it was your fault..you upset me""  
I don't know if you have been insulted like this, Mark, but believe me, me and my wife are still affected by how much racial hatred this woman displayed.
		    Yes, my daughter was bitching about all the ""zucchinis"" clogging up the roads and driving so slow this past weekend!   
Tom
		 
			
			Let's all try to remember back to our first days in Switzerland when people we'd meet (neighbors usually) would ask us, ""How long are you here?""     
And they'd wait with baited breath.     
You could sense that, if you indicated a temporary stay they'd be delighted to be your friend.   But as soon as you said, ""Oh... I'm here for the long-haul.  I'm never going back to that rusty ol' country I came from,"" they'd deflate and their smiles would turn upside down and you could just see the thought bubble above them saying, ""fu**, another foreigner coming to stay.""    
But as for the article... what really pissed me off was this:     
To me it shows a detatchment from understanding why people need equal rights under the law when they word it like that, and perhaps explains why Switzerland is perhaps one of the least progressive countries in Western Europe when it comes to GLBT rights.
		     
Neither the Swiss constitution nor the letter by Burkhalter contain the word   in that context. The Local....      You do realise that's a very provocative thing to do?    
How would you feel if somebody took your parking lot and when you told them to *#x!#, they photographed your registration plates?      You're stretching it long way to go from some racist slur to shooting people.
		    Very good article and to the point! More of these please!
		     
Nah, the letter from Hammarberg was to the point.    
The article was badly written and sensationalist. I can see why you would like it though   
			
			Why is it even a debate? Of course the place is racist, as a newbie to the country you work that out in your first week.   
Then because you are white, skilled and British and you realise the Swiss like you because you are British you realise its not going to be a problem for you. So you stop giving a rats arse about it and get back to the important things like making money.   
Whether its right or wrong is irrelevent. It just is.
		    or, more accurately, because you are white, skilled and British you are not accustomed to picking up the body language and other cues or reading between the lines.          The debate is not whether there is racism, existing in Switzerland or not, as there is no reason why what exists in Italy, Austria, France and Germany should not also be in evidence in Switzerland.   
The debate was/is about the difference between a precise but differentiating report of that EU-man and a sensationalist article.    
Racism and racist mania in Europe grew over centuries and you cannot hope to have that thing eradicated within some decades now. In case of Switzerland it sometimes is necessary to make it clear that Switzerland unfortunately is a member of that club. It did become extreme in the former GDR a decade or a bit more ago, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. More or less racist parties from the North Cape to Calabria regularily get up to 20% of the votes, and big parties with more or less racist ""wings"" up to 30%    
Already here and now, I request you to abstain from Nicolaus tales about a U.K. where racism has fully and totally disappeared
		    sorry my bad...yeah the article was poor but the writing from Hammarberg was excellent! Probably Switzerland will react with ""no gripen!!!!"" waaahhh       I am yet to encounter self confident, perfectly sane and balanced people who would shout such things at people who seem ""foreigners""... Feel pitty for her, such a miserable old woman.    
It is not about lowering your head, it is about choosing your battles..
		    Wrong. As long as different creeds and cultures have met or even mixed there has been racism. If we weren't different colors we'd align ourselves for or against those with freckles, hair color or their breakfast cereal preference. As a race we like to ""compartmentalize"" everything that we come into contact with, that includes other humans. It's how we're designed. That doesn't give anyone the right to mistreat or judge other races, but we do have different mental images and that's not a big deal IMO.
		 
			
			There's only one race, dude.
		    Eh? Who cares about the UK? The report was about Switzerland, not the UK. The refreshing thing about Swiss racism is that nobody really cares about it because its far less important than making money.
		    OK, just testing your theory then. How much would you charge to beat the living crap out of my white neighbor and his slightly tanned girlfriend?
		    Yeap daed on :when I was a kid we picked on other kids with glasse and red hair .I remeber one had autisme and a clumpfoot.I still feel sorry for him
		    Xenophobia is the cousin of racism. In a way the same mentality behind both illnesses. In practical terms, in Zürich locally, in the 1950ies and 60ies when there were practically no ""Blacks"" in evidence, Italians and Turks (etc) had to take some rather harsh xenophobia. Peopole of such ""looks"" for instance might be barred from visiting a schoolfriend when the ""lady"" judged ""ich will nöd das mini Fründinnen findet, min Sohn gänge mit ämö Tschingg"", or that in a queue to check/listen a record one gay at the top of the queue loudly declared ""Tschingge hinnä aschtaa"" without being challenged and suddenly the ""addressed"" chaps found themselves at the end of the line. Time for both to get out of Jelmoli and move over to the competition. For the ""Mediterraneans"" things vastly improved with the arrival of Blacks, Tamils, etc, who then became the focus of the ""pure"" people        Hammarberg quite clearly pointed to legal rules (freedom to make propganda for popular votes in a style he regards as racist, for example) which ought indeed be improved, but of course without reducing democracy and freedom. Those in charge DO care about it, but for a majority of the people who are neither racists nor lawyers, there is not so much to be done.   
And what about the UK ?  I on this (and the other) forum ""heard"" Brits loudly and unashamedly declaring that racism in the UK had completely faded away into history, and generally detest adventourous stories of scarce likellihood
		    A camel and 20p?
		 
			
			Firstly i would like to point out that many Swiss people are clearly bright,kind and open to all peoples of the world.     
Some Swiss (sadly quite alot in my opinion) are like backward stranger hating village idiots when it comes to accepting people,especially black people.   
The general level of straightness,conservatism and anti-intergration feeling is depressing.   
Some Swiss want all foriegners to know their place,speak when they`re spoken to and not to get any ideas above their auslander station.   
They can be quite covert,but underneath there are some right spiteful nazi b******* amongst em.   
Many of em are like scared little rabbits,terrified of non Swissness.   
Some of them have a disgusting arrogance too and they tend to actually look down on auslanders.   
I repeat that i do not consider all Swiss people like this,but in my opinion there are plenty.
		    Interesting quotes       - 
but as countless public votes have shown, there is a clear majority in favour of integration, of progress and of modernisation      - 
there in the 1930ies was a sizeable ""National Front"" known as ""D'Fröntler"". They were prohibited by law at a certain moment and by 1945 just had faded away. BUT does anybody believe they really had disappeared. So, to make it plainly clear, there were and beyond doubt still are, just as in the neighbour countries, some ""eternal Nazis"" by spirit around   
To say it in Swiss German ""Du söttisch nöd um dä heissi Brei umerede""     
			
			Not all Swiss people, but handful number of Swiss people could go to any length in relating to you as a human being and these are the handful wonderful Swiss people who have moved around the world and understand what auslander experience, because they have been in your position in the past. Also, highly educated Swiss people see no difference between them and the auslander, they just want relate to you and carry on with their business, that is all. I have experienced a lot within the last few weeks that I arrived here in Switzerland. at one occassion I had to threat to call the Police and get reference number, also threat to sue the restaurant in the Law Court. This actually made them to behave themselves and dealt with my matter very quickly. I actually promised them that I would go ahead and sue them for spoling my dinner, but how long do i have to do that, when I have tons of work to do for my living. It is just obsord and uncall for.  
Do not give up, challenge any unwelcome behaviour, call the Police if necessary and make sure you have reference number from the Police. Process your complain through the company, if it is company, and if it is individual, do the same, complain to the Police in case of individual and get witness around, let the Police get the details of the third party for Court Summon.  
Good luck            I am not sure if I am wonderful,but I agree with the rest of the sentence   
			
			People are people the world over, stop being such drama queens and focus on the good people.       While most people here will relate to you ""as a human being"" .  To discuss matters with xenophobes and/or racists in restaurants however is a hopeless case. The way to deal with them is to get out of their locality and never go there again. I mean, if you have to achieve some decent behaviours from their side by the threat of legal action you cannot feel well in such a place ever. I am in favour of a pragmatic approach to such things and against trying to be a ""hero"".  I actually physically feel xenophobism when entering such a place here and am out as fast as ""Speedy Gonzalez"". There are enough competitors who will welcome you in a normal way. And it may be added that xenophobe/racist places here tend to disappear within a few years. There at the corner Bahnhofplatz/Löwenstrasse where there now is a Chinese place for years was a widely popular restaurant. Then suddenly, the local ""chief"" gave instructions to his staff no longer to serve ""Arabs etc"", an instruction which was fully practiced immediately. It was reported in the media and so also a good part of the Swiss clientele aboided the place, so that it met its end within a year. There in Zch-Seefeld was a popular and well known ""Wienerwald""-restaurant. But at a certain day, they started to refuse serving Blacks. I know of such an incident when they did do so, and as a result more than a dozen CH-nationals got up and left (some paid and left and others simply left). It got into the press, and the ""Wienerwald"" disappeared within less than two years.    
If you want to report the incident, do not report to the police but send an Email (in German or English) to Blick and Tages Anzeiger and explain precisely what had happened. THIS is how to do it
		    You seem very well integrated already...       Assimilation ?  I would speak about a rapid ""Helvetisation""-process     
			
			We came here as it offered a better quality of life for a family with a young child than the UK did. Who am I to then judge and tell the swiss theyre doing it wrong? I see better integration between comunities here than I did in the UK. Official programs etc to try and help people integrate. Can you blame the swiss for being suspicous of outsiders when 75% of people in the swiss penal system are auslanders?
		    did you invent that number or did you friendly SVP propaganda machine provided it for you? Please inform yourself before posting...      It is obvious. Any judge here in case of most Swiss people can base his judgment on parents and other relatives of the person being domiciled in Switzerland, while he/she in case of many foreigners has to base the judgment on parents etc living somewhere abroad, and so has to act accordingly. Add to this that people guilty of crime usually are between 18 and 65 years old and not above 70 years old. Which means, in view of half of the CH-origin population being above 75, that most people in question MOST BE foreigners    
			
			Your statement indicates you dont interact with people, you are just indoor. you have just made up the figure that suit your purpose. you need to move around and socialise, then come back and tell us something. 
By the way, have you got the statistics of the figure that you have just made up. Huh! How can get the statistic of a made up figure. Be honest to yourself.       Statistics from 2010   Verurteilungen für ein Verbrechen oder Vergehen (Convicted Criminals)   98'200       Nationalität   Schweizer  46.5%  Ausländer   53.5%         
The official amount of foreigners living in Switzerland in 2010:         22.4        That's crime statistics, it looks quite a bit different when you look at violent crime (higher % of foreigners)    
He was almost right with the 75% when it comes to prison population though...        
It was 70,2% in 2009 and according to this source has not changed the last 10 years. It has to be noted, however, that many of these foreigners have no legal residence in Switzerland, so it is not 22% commiting 70% of crime which leads to imprisonment but more like 22% commiting about 35% of crime (rough estimation from my side), which differs vastly across nationalities. All these figures are available in official statistics and have been quoted in countless threads on EF, so do your own research before you accuse others of fabricating stats.
		     
But then again, the prison population includes people who are presumed innocent (custody, where, due to the danger of fleeing, foreigners are vastly over-represented) and people who did not commit any crime in the normal sense of the word (extradition, no Swiss).
		 
			
			Obviously, you are saying there are Illegal Auslander and Legal Auslander, i think the statistics results should be able to clarify/classify/distinguish between the two categories, not just Auslander.
		    But those statistics do not make a difference between residents and visitors, and so are worthless. Neither do these statistic relate the numbers to age groups. I am sure that in the age group of 66 to 100 the share of the foreigners will not be above the one of the CH nationals     
			
			All these categories need to be put into consideration to have accurate statistic of a sensitive case like the above subject matter before going to the public. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the authority to adapt a way of reducing racism in this Country. You can emmagine, whether black or white auslanders, 70% - 72% are Criminals according to the statistic, obviously, in the eyes of the public, when come incontact with auslander, the chances of looking at that person as a Criminal is very high, this obviously brings hatered, and leads to racism. It is not untruth that wonderful Swiss are out there, but reading in-adequate article or figure would not be pleasant to them
		    you're reading the numbers wrong - the statistic is that 70% of criminals are Auslanders,   70% of Auslanders are criminals.   
from my personal view, I have only encountered 2 criminals here in Switzerland, after joining an exclusive club along the lake of folks to have their homes broken into. both were Auslander ohni ausweis, and both came from the same EU-8 country. there are very few things worse than racism, but I think there is also danger in ignoring the simple facts.
		    The authorities cannot do much, as racism ""in this country"" is rather less than in the neighbour country. What that EU official however suggested was that  initiatives which are against international law or/and racist ought to be stopped BEFORE the voting and that the anti-racism laws were extended. The man actually mentioned that such things are difficult and complicated.    
The 70% thing is wrong. A) not 70% of all foreigners are criminals but B) 70% of all ""inmates"" are foreigners. And C) this includes all the ""Untersuchungs-Häftlinge"" (investigation-prisoners) . The percentage among the convicted prisoners is FAR lower. If you then deduct all the ""drug-courier-tourists"" who are not residents and all those with sentences of less than a year, the percentrage drops even more   
BUT, this nowhere in Europe is the reason for racism and xenophobia.   
Racism ?  Saharawis from the southern Wilajets of Algeria complain about the racism of the ""real"" Algerians against them, Nubians say the same about Egyptians in the mainland (Luxor to Alexandria)  and nobody in Zürich would make such ""jokes"" which are quite common standard in Cairo. North Italians tell you that ""Africa begins in Rome"" and do not mean it with humour.  People in Fez will tell you that those down in Marrakech are not real Moroccans but ""nègres"" .  And look around inside Europe. There is lots of discrinimation, mostly if people ""reveal"" their origins by face and/or skin colour
		    Which would, based on relative populations, make the crime rate roughly 10x higher for foreigners than for Swiss!    
Tom
		    No, you cannot say this.   
The debate is quite old, and infact when the percentage lately was touching some 69%, it has been coming up again ...   
It's not the criminal rate, but the inmate one (so all ""minor"" crimes, fine-sentences, or where is low risk of evasion are excluded).   
And it's not linked with Swiss criminality (or criminality by Swiss residents, national Swiss or foreigners), but with criminality regarding somehow Swiss law infractions by people from all over the world Swiss justice can catch.   
Furthermore the Swiss cannot violate laws regarding immigration foreigners maybe are jailed for,   
could also be that national Swiss have better attorneys, lower penalties, know how to avoid conflicts or sentences, which might influence statistics.   
Cheers

and          What surprises me, in spite of what I wrote above, is the heavy share of those in ""Untersuchungshaft"". Sure, a good part of them will either get a fine or a ""bedingte Haftstrafe auf Bewährung"", but the time in U-Haft is something most of them will never forget.They will have it in clear memory even four decades later.
		    I was told that much of the crime-by-foreigners consists of robberies and theft by criminals who cross the border and escape back after the crime, counting on poor police coordination and difficulty of identification and extradition to get away with the crime.    
As they say, you can rob one bank and get away with it. But to repeat the offence as a profession almost assures you will be caught eventually.    
There are other issues: the inability to work of most asylum seekers and economic migrants means they are likely to resort to crime to survive. Asylum law was conceived out of guilt over the Holocaust and out of hostility to Communism and the Iron Curtain. It is unable to deal with massive flows of economic migrants enabled by modern communications. I remember the complaint of an immigration judge in the United States that he was well aware that only 15% of the asylum cases in front of him were genuine. The trouble was that he had no way of telling which 15% they were.    
The Geneva 1951 Refugee Convention and the New York 1967 Protocol will be difficult to amend simply because in this postcolonial world there are now so many more sovereign states that will have a say. And few of them have any interest in making migration to the West more difficult. To some extent the issue of amending the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or domestic law implementing it (as the UK would like to do) is similar. The ECHR has 40 signatories (out of, I think, 46 countries in Europe; the absentee that comes notoriously to mind is Belarus which I know of as the country with unpublished laws, violation of which can put you in prison)   and the EU also has a role, mandating respect of the Convention by its member states.
		    I suspect your first point is correct, which is one of the reasons for the public discussion about tightening up the borders.  it is just simply not that hard for would-be-thieves to enter into the country without ever presenting papers at the border.   
as to your second point - I don't think anyone will ever satisfactorily prove a direct causal relationship between poverty and crime, despite what Dickens might have written all those years ago.
		    It may be difficult to prove the direct relationship, but it is impossible to prove the contrary. And if you are poor and do not have enough money even for basic things, you may feel tempted to revert to illegal methods.

			Swiss distillers of absinthe are mortified by an American television crime drama show that depicts the high-octane spirit as a killer drink.             
			
			That story line was sooo ridiculous - a guy drinks one absinthe in a bar- starts seeing 'things and hearing voices' and goes on in the street and shoots somebody- struuf how ridiculous is that.   
Channel 4 had a very interesting programme the other day on de-bunking the myths about absinthe, very well done.   
And then on Friday evening, a youngster in East Enders (a popular UK TV series) the plot is all about illegal selling of absinthe, and then one of the youngsters gets a bottle, (that horrible green absinthe sold in Eastern Europe) and starts drinking it neat!! Look at tonight's episode for the conclusion - will it be coma or death - or will she go out and murder somebody too!   
BTW, the Fete de l'Absinthe in Boveresse NE will be on 16th of June this year. Sadly I won't be in attendance this time. If anybody ever wants to organise an Absinthe distillery and history visit/day in the area- do pm to ask me for different possibilities (Boveresse is accessible by train to Motiers, then short walk). I can organise chauffering, accommodation, meals, visit to Mauler Champagne, Absinthe Museum and many distilleries for private or corporate groups, made to measure with interpreting.   
For your info - absinthe is NOT green, but clear - and locals here where it was first made never drunk it with a spoon and sugar as shown on the above picture- but mixed with cold clear local water poured from high - about 2/3 to 1/3, to make it go 'milky' white. As often called around here in prohibition time 'un lait du Jura garçon' (a Jura milk waiter) aka known as 'une Bleue' or 'un Fée Verte'.
		 
			
			Repeat after me...   
CSI is not real...CSI is not real...CSI is not real...CSI is not real...CSI is not real...CSI is not real...
		    : ............:d
		          Agreed - and yet for the 'average' American, and now the 'average' Brit - it does keep alive this idea that absinthe is inherently dangerous in a way no other alcohol is- which is stupid. If we offer an absinthe, our very local favourite drink, to British friends, then they still react with a 'are you sure? Is it OK - we thought it was really dangerous- I don't want to go off and cut my ear under the influence, or whatever...' DUH...(:
		    Good lord.   
This doesn't bode well if(when???) I get hauled into court for speeding.
		    That really depends on the recipe, most where indeed clear, but some distillers used ingredients which turned the drink green. Nowadays they add a colorant to get that color.   
The better ones are clear btw.   
I tend to use icewater and still melt sugar into it as caramelized sugar into most of them makes it even more yummy    
			
			Well, I was sort of born and bred in absinthe - here where it was invented (yeah that does explain a lot ). The locals are all Fée Verte specialists as they've been dipped in the stuff from birth too - and many of course are distillers, many from the time it was still illegal. I only have one friend who makes a NATURALLY COLOURED green absinthe (Nicolas Gyger, one of the Fete de l'Absinthe founders) and only for private use. All the others here locally are clear- and I do not know of a single person, here in the Val-de-Travers, who uses sugar and a spoon. Of course some people in the UK and US use absinthe in all sorts of cocktails - but this is really not for us, the locals (never mind The Local!!). Santé!   
The artificially green stuff from Eastern Europe is ***p - really - buy the real thing. And never buy absinthe not made in Franche-Comté (Pontarlier/F) or Val-de-Travers, it would be like buying Whisky from Timbuctu.
		    Those are the good bottles       I currently have only two bottles at home: a Kubler which is clear and a   which is light green.      my excuse: I am Dutch and I have a sweet tooth       That Malicia bottle comes from close to La Chaud de Fonds, not completely Val-de-Travers even though they stamp it on the bottle, but close enough I guess and it is quite a bit better than the Kubler I have, but taste is a personal thing too.   
Lets not start about Whisky, that is a different problem    
			
			I've still got many friends who make the 'illegal' stuff - just for the fun of it, lol. You'll have to come and visit the region and go on a distillery tour. 
I did promise to do an EF event one day - so will get organised as soon as I am able to.   
Never heard of,or tasted Guinand's Malicia. Why buy from outside Franche-Comté/Val-de-Travers though - when we have so many excellent distillers and brands right here in the birth place of absinthe?                
 Absinthe produced in its birthplace. Our distillery  will make you discover the subtle flavours and history of the 19 th  century artists' favourite drink.                  
 The history of Green Fairy lives on with four sorts  of absinthe, all elaborated using traditional methods and distilled by  Willy Bovet: ""Le Chat"", ""Tradition"", ""Nostalgie"" and ""La Septante 7"".                  
 Visit our distillery and discover our different kinds of homemade absinthes, whose subtle aromas will charm you.                  
 Visits of the absinthe distillery ""Elixir du Pays  des Fées"", and the exhibition of ancient utility, promotional objects,  as well as old documents relating the history of Franco-Swiss absinthe.                  
 Have a pleasant time with a former clandestine  distiller who will be happy to welcome you in his distillery with local  scents. On reservation, live distilling session. Swiss absinthe of the  year 2010.                  
 The distillery of absinthe the P'tite is based in  Couvet in the Val de Travers, where we find the origins of real  absinthe. Behind the label Absinthe La P'tite and Absinth'Love 69, lies a  fairy, the first women distiller of absinthe legal in Switzerland meet  the sweet name of Gaudentia. La P'tite works according to traditional  family as time of hiding.                  
 Welcome to the birthplace of absinthe. During the  guided tour, you'll learn about the history of absinthe, the plants used  for its making and on prior request you'll attend a distilling session.                   
 Come and discover a suprising cellar in Couvet,  Val-de-Travers, the village of the first 18th century distillery: the  Officine de Verre. Taste an authentic 55° absinthe, original and  subtle.                    
 Former clandestine distiller Francis Martin welcomes  his guests in a 1777 house belonging to national heritage. The plants  used for the making of his 5 absinthes grow outside in the French-style  18th century garden. He still uses the ancient method for the  distilling.            
And so many more ...
		 
			
			I have developed quite a liking for absinthe -   
I blame Odile       Yep, if in doubt, blame Odile    
East Enders on now - let's see what happens!
		 
			
			Sorry gang, but Hönig Kräuter is better.
		    I am out the month of June, thus please don't do it then as I would love to hop over from Zurich to do a proper tour! (and add some bottles to my small collection   )      Because that is the bottle I got from a friend who is from that region who got it from a friend from a friend etc.

			One in five men in Switzerland has paid at least once in his life to have sex, a new study shows.             
			
			I'd love to talk to someone who does these studies about prostitution. I take for a fact that people lie about sex in general and this kind of questions in particular. I might be wrong, but the methodological problems would be a very interesting topic of conversation. 
If someone can help...       It must be all those male E/F users bumping up the stats!
		 
			
			that does not surprise us, pass many brothels with their red-lights etc, the odd one appears to be 24hrs
		 
			
			I've been surprised to see how 'open' they are about prostitution here compared to the part of the UK i come from, where everything happens behind closed doors.  There again, I'm in Ipswich and the Suffolk Prostitution Murders a few years ago may account for that!!     
But I have been surprised to see young woman seeing it as a profession they want to get into here in Switzerland.  Going off to Geneva and the UN for the businessmen.  It seems a very common thing here.  Then you have the businessmen bringing in the eastern european girls to 'brighten' up their clubs.  Oh yes, i've had my eyes opened!!
		     
I agree totally. I will conduct my own controlled experiment---for science.   
Wonder if I can get an SNF grant for this?
		    too late...has been already done --> google ""prostitution site:snf.ch""
		    Anyone seen a girl along the Limmatquai wearing Vibrams? Those heels really can't be doing her feet any good....      No need to pay for it. Just follow this lot round on their protest tour!        
			
			one way or another all men pay for sex    
			
			If it's true that every fifth Swiss man visits a prostitute once in his life   and there are say 2'000'000 Swiss men at any given moment, then: 400000 (1/5) single visits over 50 years average out at 8000 visits total per year. This gives a daily total of 22 Swiss men visiting a prostitute (in the whole of Switzerland) per day. If there are 10000 prostitutes in CH then they are certainly on the bread line unless of course the numbers are made up by foreigners and others who fill the pros' purses. (Not meant as a pun!)
		    And 1 in 5 men in Switzerland is an üssländer.    
Coincidence? I wonder....
		    key phrase ""at least once"". what if on average it is 1/5 of men and average period between visits is 1 week?
		    No need to wonder! Clearly, those filthy üssländers are stealing all the Swiss girls! Who can blame them, really? Most of us bathe, don't wear red shoes, and know that showing a lady a good time doesn't involve a visit to the local cheese museum. The poor native lads are left with handfuls of daddy's money and no no one to spend it on except the professionals.
		       
Exactly, that's something else.
		 
			
			Ticino has more than 1000 registered prostitutes (and who knows how many unregistered), which translates into one for every 300 people (men, women, children)!    
Of course, most brothels are located near the border.   
Tom
		    I must admit I am one of those Swiss men. In the course of 30 years I paid around two million CHF for sex, usually two numbers a year, three times if I was lucky and one year even four times. All in all about 70 or 80 sessions, makes more than CHF 25,000 per act.    
Granted, besides sex, said money also bought me up to two warm meals per week, but on the other hand, that woman still is still getting about 85 % of my net income, and she firmly believes that's all right because I eventually ran away because not the slightest chance of an improvement was in sight. She still wonders why I left her, and she still doesn't ask herself why I never cheated on her, didn't get into a drinking habit and never started beating her up on a regular basis.    
Marriage sometimes is the most expensive way to get free sex, as the saying goes.
		    I thought more than 20% of men in Switzerland had been married?    
			
			I'm surprised they need prostitution after  . They mustn't be doing it right.
		    It isn't clear whether, by repeating this, you're (a) expressing being gobsmacked, (b) displaying moral outrage, or (c) calling for greater effort.   
And surely Berlusconi should rightfully head the list?
		    biggest fans of prostitution after Spanish   
One in five men in   
According to this, all men in switzerland are swiss. Congratulations guys, you just got the red one.       
			
			So what? Is there any survey about the wife sleeping with her husband to get what she wants? Are these men counted as fans of prostitution?
		    You don't need to be a fan of preostitution to be after Spanish.  I'm always after it too.  'Specially sherbet dib dabs.        You'd think somebody who regularly has to remove her shoes would choose something a little more sensible.
		     
why would she have to remove her shoes?? you've been doing something very wrong!!
		     
do I sense a hint of bitterness here?
		    I can see I need to do more research.
		    Oh no. Sitting in a tiny 2 1/2 Zimmer apartment, trying to get the old clunker through MFK, while she has three cars and lives in that 6-bedroom, 3-bathroom house on one of the largest properties in town including a two-million CHF view over the lake and the mountains, all still fully financed by me -- I can assure you that's all pure fun.    
But let's not derail the thread. It's about paying for sex, not about paying for gullibility and good-naturedness.
		    Going off the grid wasn't an option?    
			
			Till 2011 in Switzerland prostitution were legal from the age of 16. Think about that.
		    As I wrote before, I do not want to hijack the thread. It's about prostitution, not bitches.
		    I guess shoes with height adjusters could be useful?         No. You just have to admit publicly that you are a foot fetish.      I think your story is worth starting a new thread beginning with the following disclaimer: "" Give it a try.
		    Prostitution is a big part of human trafficking. A woman who wants to do it because she likes it and enjoy this work is a very little % in the whole prostitution industry.   
To compare a wife with a woman sold to prostitution is pretty daft and humiliating.
		 
			
			What damit! the spanier beat as .I am off to the bank to take a morgage out and then down to the ho house    
			
			Joke Alert - an old one:       
Or in my case - have a look at Mr's OM's wardrobe and shoes cupboard. 
Both of which are larger than a London Bus       Marriage is the most expensive way to have free sex.  - Old adage.
		 
			
			Prostitution is the only option for some women to make money. Some are making over 20000chf per month in Zurich. I know of eastern bloc men who send there young wives off too make money from prostitution, whilst they sit at home doing nothing. The young wife returning home each month with a bundle of money.   
I also know of young girls in difficult situations in there lives...who would never do prostitution, but feel frustrated by when they see their girlfriends who are prostitutes returning home each month, buying apartments and new cars.   
Everyone does not have it as easy as here in Switzerland.
		    Human trafficking.   
What do you do about it? Since you see it, know it?
		 
			
			Prostitution..what should i do about it, its the oldest profession..some women are happy doing it, happy with the money ...their new apartment, some have even met the man who truely satisfies them during there ""work"" ..and married them.
		    How often? How many? What is the reality of women wanted to do it and being forced to do it? Being married to a man doesn't make him less of a pimp if he ""send"" her doing prostitution.    
How many of those women are doing it because they like it and are not forced into it?    
I knew a girl in Montreal who used to be an escort so she could afford the jetset life and designer clothes, but those girls are a very skinny minority, the reality is mush less glamour.
		    I dont know, ask the pope!
		 
			
			Nil, you aren't going to like this, but I'm going to post it anyway.           
1/1 males in Switzerland have paid for sex, why do you think we offer you drinks and dinner ??? (haha :-P)
		       
The ""recipe"" is like that: girls or young women are brought here (or there) under the false promises of work (in a bar, restaurant, hotel - as cleaners, waitresses etc.), have their documents kept by the pimps, beaten to death, raped by the whole gang, hungered, threatened with death, or the death of families ""back home"", sent to streets to bring money for pimps. Then sold to other pimps and so on. Sometimes they just dissapear.   
The story with ""entrepreneurial"" husbands sending their young wives to make a little fortune out of prostitution seems extremely optimistic to me. I am sure there are ""happy"" cases too, as in persons doing this by their own will and to their (mostly) profit. But that doesn't mean that human trafficking is a joke, or maybe some few accidents, unfortunately, it exists.
		    You are only talking about those happy with it. Most girls in the states in prostitution and porn are there because of addictions or being forced. Money might be good, but it doesn't mean she is living the jet set life style.
		    Yes, but it is so much easier to just close your eyes on the reality and not think about the consequences of supporting it by buying it or by being a bystander.    
Hey! It is the oldest profession in the world, right? What can I do, I don't care.          I am afraid we men like to clöose our eyes on the dark side of prostitution + we lie to ourselves saying they enjoy it so that we can (not saying I personally do) avail ourselves of the services of prostitutes w/o bad feelings and really enjoy it. IGNORANCE IS BLESS, isn't it?
		     Prostitution is the oldest and one of the most lucrative ""professions"". , except for those who practice it.  
At the individual level, it is up to everyone to still go with a prostitute when they know it might not be all right. Not all men have a conscience. (I pay, I get, so   OK)..problem is the police is turning a blind eye to all of these. It's a lucrative business, with big fish involved.    
			
			Near my quaint village, we've got a hustling and bustling bordell. Sunday evenings is one of their best nights. There's gossip that one extremely disgusting local man visited the brothel and collapsed in the shower.  The medics were called but because of the man's weight, the rescue took more time than usual.   
When there's silence at the Stammtisch, someone opens with this story and soon everyone is talking again.
		 
			
			Here a  in Switzerland. In French          What would you suggest for such men? Gelding perhaps      Yes, but these stories fail to point out that unless they have permission from their parents, it is illegal for someone under the age of 18 to work at all, and therefore prostitution under the age of 18 it is de facto illegal!   
Tom
		    Doesn't change the fact that these girls aka kids are doing prostitution. Illegal or not, they are still out there in the street. Forced.
		    The village I used to live in there was a poof about 100 meters away from a kindergarten/middle school. It is no longer there now. In the states we are often considered prudes for all our zoning laws regarding to alcohol and cigarette sales, but c'mon? 100 meters from children that are trusted to go it alone to school. It's one of those details that fly in contrast with all the strict policies on everything here.
		    Homophobia now, is it?    
Hint:In british English ""poof"" is a semi-derogatory term for a male homosexual. Your usage here is a new one on me - I presume from context that you mean a brothel or similar? Where's this expression used?
		    German is Puff, the poster just helped you pronounce it nearly correctly with a creative spelling       Yeah, I was referring to the local use of the word for brothel. I know this is the English Forum, but I don't see how I am a bigot for using a Swiss German word; German at the least.
		    So I guess that was a retaliatory groan because I don't understand you attack on my religion.

252	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/142519-muslim-girls-must-swim-boys-swiss-court.html	" 
			
			A Muslim family in Basel has been fined 1,400 francs ($1,550) for refusing to let its daughters participate in mixed swimming classes.         
			
			Controversial title much eh?      and you are a bit late, the topic has been discussed and closed down.
		 
			
			that's a disgraceful decision by the court.
		 
			
			Will someone in authority at the local please tell me why EVERY SINGLE 'story' in switzerland with the word Muslim in gets reposted here ?? Its worse then the daily mail.   
You have an agenda, please pedal it somewhere else
		 
			
			The court said these girls of that specific family shouldn't miss their swimming class, not that Muslims girls are obligated to swim with boys!    
Poor journalism at its best.
		 
			
			What a disgraceful, sensationalist headline.  Is the writer aiming to work for one of the British tabloids one day?
		 
			
			Not as half as controversial as:     What is the real world alternative? Build a second pool and have that blocked off and restrict access? I can't see the issue here, everyone should have the right to splash around in the pool and learn to swim, religion has got nothing to do with it. Parental indoctrination and angst. The kids just wanna have fun and there's always someone trying to make rules to fit ideologies. Sometimes common sense is martyred for a bullshit principle.
		    What's disgraceful about the concept of swimming together? Sensationalist was the idea that religion should separate the genders.    
If the Daily Mail didn't exist it would be necessary to invent it; we can thus define ourselves by what we're not etc.   
Blimey,  poses topless!
		     One Question  did you read all the details of the courts ruling ?Or just the headlines  form the loco ?
		     There is only a very small gap between ""local' and 'Loco""
		 
			
			In my secondary school we always had seperate times for boys and girls swimming classes, all she had to say was that she had a musical instrument class at the same time... problem solved.
		    Probably the same reason someone in every thread tries to make it reflect negatively about US in some way, even if it's about fondue.       Agreed..religion shouldn't separate genders, colours, ages, in fact should do the opposite.  Funny remark about the ruber band like octomom.      Why the US dollar equivalent?   
Has the Local forgotten which bunch of readers it is supposed to be winding up.   
And why is it that this thread doesn't get merged with the other one?   
If anybody else had started it, I'm sure it would.   
Can't we just create a troll subforum where the Local can post all the cr*p it wants and leave us in peace.    
Or should we start writing to the Local's adverisers to tell them what it is they are paying for and try and starve this nonsense to death?
		 
			
			I think the judge could of said okay fair enough your daughter/s do not have to attend mixed swimming lessons but,i would like you to prove they are learning to swim,perhaps in specially arranged girls only lessons.
		 
			
			Islam only forbids girls and boys swimming together post puberty. These kids were 7 and 8. By the time kids reach puberty, in my area at least, boys and girls swim seperately. If the parents want the kids segregated, it'll cost 'em 1400 CHF per year. Their choice. No rights have been violated.   
When I was a teenager we got to swim all together. Which was nice. Though not in the all together. Except when we sneaked away during school trips.
		    This is probably the first Local post I've responded to. Normally I avoid them - I think that's the best way of dealing with the problem.    
The mods should just lock them as they appear.        
Better still:          (3 Viewing)  
 Questions and information relating to the use of the forum   :    ,    ,   Trash / duplicate questions      Islam doesn't forbid it.
		    I just found this:          I can also find you a verse where it says you must blow yourself up and kill children and women if I want to.   
The scripts of the Qran are translate and interpreted the way that suit someone.
		 
			
			Oh the local, WHINGE WHINGE WHINGE, MOAN MOAN MOAN.   
Why does any post from said paper cause such a frenzy by people on here   
Personally do not see anything wrong with the article
		    I was backing up your comment with a link, chillax!       
LOL @ that site, txt speak and tank tops LOL what a load of BS   
Just like the local's reporting and censorship
		     
my issue with the local and these kind of stories is they are pushing there own agenda, drip drip drip feeding these total BS 'stories' and there anti muslim sentiment. Do they post every bs story about other religions?? no   
You can take this one of 2 ways, either someone at the local is a racist w***ker or they are a cynical b***rd and know religious threads make posts (and so traffic) shoot through the roof, either way its very distasteful   
And no, I'm not a muslim
		       
Thank You very much for such useful link.. Hope everyone can read it and try to understand the reasons behind such religious restrictions.. it is for our own good..
		    Ok, fair enough.    
But maybe I am ignorant, naive, whatever, but I read a headline that says   
Muslim girls must swim with boys.   
I read the article, and its about muslim girls who must swim with boys.   
So....whats wrong with it?   
There is no point in them stating Christian girls as this would be inaccurate.   
They dont say, girls must swim with boys, as the title needs more clarity as to the real topic matter i.e. muslim family contesting their rights based on their religion   
It does not state ALL muslim girls must swim with boys.   
So on the basis of facts, it seems an accurate title and an interesting article bringing about an issue whereby the muslim religion in this issue of swimming has brought about a court case.   
I have not, and do not make a  habit of reading the local, and the only time I really see some of their articles is through this site. Thats not because I like or dilike their work, I just have other reading materials.   
So maybe they are guilty of peddling an agenda, but I do not see one here.
		    What??? Did you read my post above?      Islam recommends learning how to swim from childhood.     The issue with this family was that they did not want to their daughters to swim that way due to cultural believes that is inspired from religion,     As per their story, they tried to ask for alternatives, like swimming with a Muslim swimsuit,      They also commented that in the swim lessons there are groups of two where they disagree on having these groups consisting of male and female as this doesn't go inline with their habits that is based on their religion - but still they were talking about habits especially you have some practise where the girls themselves do not feel happy to do with a male mate.     The issue got developed where discussions about will the school also force aqua phobia children to swim and learn to swim and ended up having two stubborn parties and went to the court.     Here not the family itself who talked but relatives, on a tv show and said - this fine they have to pay was the only way not to have the children dismissed or moved to another school, which is considered in itself a step ahead for the sake of the family not against them.     All what I say is what I saw in a TV show about that case, I am not sure if it is all true or not.     I agree that when one comes to a country, should accept the rules and integrate as much as possible - however I believe that alternatives should always exist that do not cause harm to any of the parties, and I think if the children did not attend the lessons, the school will not be harmed.     It was not easy for this family not to have a good explanation about what harm will be caused to the school if the children did not go to the swim lesson, especially that the girls themselves agree on that, and the family asked if they want to have a psychologist meeting the children to make sure of that, and also they did not get a clear response about how the school deals with Aqua-phobia children.       Again This info is from 2009 - 2010, and I am not 100% sure if all of it is true.      Disgraceful as in the headline is misleading.  Head on over to thread on this that was clsoed this morning.  I fully support the decision; I disapprove of the crappy headline.
		    Headline suggestion then? I have added a few    
Girls of certain religion must swim with boys?   
Peaceful Muslim girls must swim with boys?   
Girls must swim with boys?    
One gender outlook for swimming lessons?
		    What about : don't miss your swimming class or you'll get a fine?
		 
			
			There's swimming with boys and then ""swimming with boys"". I guess many Muslims object to ""swimming with boys"" as opposed to swimming in a class with boys at school.
		    This would be outrageous journalism.   
It would imply that if a student was sick, on holiday, or forgot their clothing that they would be fined.   
To then find an article discussing a very particular case whereby a family were refusing based on religion then I would be  very upset by this misleading headline scaring all and sundry
		    Yes, but try hiding explosives in a swimming costume.     
			
			*musing*  I wonder of Osama bin Laden knew how to swim.   
no, no matter.
		    very nice ,problem he forgot to signe it          
Islamic Center of Beverly Hills (ICBH)
		    What if they can't find any?
		    Instead, how about ""Swimming with dolphins"" ?   Wouldn't that keep everyone happy?
		    good point, let's add ""swimming with the fishes""
		    Still beats swimming with sharks.
		    The court simply followed the rule that in Switzerland, Swiss laws are valid. There is no reason to yield to some demands of Muslim fundamentalists. Or any other strict religious grouping. If somebody is not ready to accept Swiss laws, Switzerland has never built a well up to prevent people from leaving
		 
			
			I think that is crazy, some expats pretend that the country their are living change just for them... This is the way it works here, if you are not , the go back to your country!
		    where did the article say that they were expats?  I mean, the odds aren't great, everybody knows that all expats live in private complexes where only their native tongue is spoken, and for sure they don't let their kids mix with the local schools.
		    Most people from Muslim countries cannot afford either living in compounds or to send their kids to private schools. Add to this that private schools in Switzerland have to act in accordance with the directives of the Cantonal ""Erziehungs-Direktion"" and so basically have to act according to the same guidelines as the ""official"" state-schools. Beside the point that there up to now are no Arabic, Turkish or Albanian language private schools in evidence
		 
			
			I don't understand... 7 & 8 year old girls in islam are not yet women, so they can do as they please quite freely.   
And if not, there's always the burkini.   
I wonder if parents would have been fined if their kids had had a mortal fear of swimming... or something (don't laugh, I actually know someone like this)
		    I find it strange that parents would even consider sending their kids to Switzerland to get an Albanian education. I mean, that's what Albania is for.
		    Had their kids had a ""mortal fear of swimming"" they, I mean the kids, would have been provided psychiatrist care. The Psychiatrist services in Zürich are quite considerable.
		    In pre-independence days, first of all in ""old-Yugoslavia-days"" many Kosovari emigrated to Switzerland, in the years of trouble even more (including Prime Minister Thaci) came to Switzerland. They did not ""send their kids to Switzerland to get an Albanian education"" but ""en-famille"" escaped to Switzerland no longer to get molested by the Serbians. Most Kosovari there and here in fact are rather secularist, and in fact the same applies to Turks and Arabs and other Muslims, but SOME  are rather fundamentalist or at the very least rather strict. Albania is the western part of the Albanian speaking areas there, the eastern part is Kosovo. Both countries are Muslim majority wise, but a majority of those Muslims are not fundamentalist not even rigorous. In case of Turkey, the amazing thing is that some Turks try to push through ideas which are NOT done in Turkey.
		 
			
			Does anyone know what the headline was for the article in Le Matin?  After all the article says it was reported in their online edition, so just wondering if The Local simply used the same headline as the Swiss newspaper did.   
I'd be more concerned about the parents' need to teach their children shame.  What are they supposed to be ashamed of?  Their bodies, the fact that they're girls/women in the first place?  Why should parents need to teach their children this, what reglious significance could it possibly have, for God's sake?
		    Those parents believe that, not parents. Those parents think it has some religious signification, not parents.   
Those.
		    I believe that specific issue is based on culture - please note that in middle east some christian families behave the same as well.   
Children that are not yet adult (means not yet at the age where they can give birth), are having wide range of freedom in terms of their acts and the way they dress.     
If your question about how in general religous significance request women to cover themselves, I found this article may help a bit understanding why adult women in Islam cover themselves, again please note that this doesn't apply on a 7 years old girl that is not yet adult, this is just an answer to the general question if that is what is asked, otherwise if it is not your question then kindly skip reading the article.         
Back to this specific case, the family was not allowed to use the muslim swimsuit (as per their say in a tv show), and also they did not get a good explanation on how the school would deal with aqua phobia children that have fear from water and swimming.   
The family added as well that they refused that their children make some swimming practises in groups of a male and female where some exercises the girls feel shy to do when a boy is stretching his hands to balance the girl's body while they are floating over the water.   
At the end, the family used their right to object in a legal way, and I hope they respected and accepted the court in applying the swiss rules, in the country that hosts them regardless if they stay as guests or as locals.     
-----------   
General off the topic comment (not an answer to Medea Fleecestealer, just a general comment):   
I have a personal opinion about some fights happened here on the forum due to religions and belief, I think the best for those who need to know about some religious rules and concepts is to target an organisation that represents those believers, where people their base their answers on studies and can better explain reasons behind acts and can provide references other than just expressing how they feel about it.   
For muslim specific issues, I found the wikipedia link contains names of those organisations / associations in Switzerland , if someone really needs to know and understand, the best is to contact them,       A)  THat ""Muslim swimsuit"" is NOT accepted as ""swimsuit"" at all here 
B)  They most likely spoke with a teacher and not with a psychiatrist of the ""Schulamt"" .   Most teachers tend to ignore aqua-phobia as a psychical problem and simply regard such children as ""wasserscheu"" 
C)  that boys are instructed to balance the body of girls during swimming instruction is normal . The idea is that many boys are much stronger than girl   
A2)  At a time when swimming places prohibit long ""shorts"" or boys wearing shorts over swimming slips, you cannot expect that almost full clothing is accepted   
I am sorry, but those families live in Switzerland, and so by law have to accept and respect Swiss laws and regulations.  If they do not, they risk that their children are taken away from them to be given into suitable care   
**************************************************  ***************************       Basically, it is to be mentioned that for example the Christian  community in your country is one of the oldest Christian communities in  the world, and that there were/are rather old Christian communities in  countries like Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.    
**************************************************  ****************************      Whomever wrote this is not aware of realities overhere. 
A)  the Hijab rather blocks such women from any effective role in society, as they are regarded as NOT being part of society 
B)  Hijab wearing women are NOT ""honoured"" but regarded as strange 
- 
C)  If they are splendid in regard to knowledge and skills, they will be respected professionally, but will still be regarded as outsiders, and NOT as part of society 
-
		    I don't see a point thst show that they did not respect the swiss law, they objected via the legal channels.
		    Everybody has the right to object to existing regulations via the legal channels, true, But once, the legal verdict gets issued they will have to act accordingly.    
They even then will have a final option and that is to send her girl to a psychiatrist who possibly may issue a kind of ""order"" that the girl for psychical reasons cannot participate. If the psychiatrist however denies a psychical problem and concludes that the whole problem is based on the parents, it will be the end of the road
		 
			
			Slightly off topic, in the USA some non-swimming parents are frightened of their children taking swimming lessons,           fyi, sexual harassment quite often has nothing to do with ""sex"", not to mention that, generally speaking, the track record of countries such as Iran on issues such as sexual harassment is utterly appaling.  the summary you've linked is nothing more than propaganda - the Islamic practice of regulating the manner in which women dress goes back centuries upon centuries and has absolutely nothing to do with providing women with ""immunity"".
		 
			
			The problem is not the way a woman dress up but the way some people think it is ok to abuse women for the way they dress.
		    Do not forget that a vital part of the swimming instruction program in Switzerland is the many lakes around here, where in the 1950ies and 60ies, dozens of people, by majority foreigners !, drowned in the lakes. Why ?  Because quite many of the foreigners in question were used to the seashore back home where you could/can walk out for a few hundreds meters without swimming for a moments, while here, after a few centimeters, you are in deep water.    
Now, when in the USA, in vast stretches of that country, there are few lakes around. And the next seashore usually is more than 1000 kms away. Just look at USA realities. Amazing is that many people in Boston and New York CAN swim, even are good and enthusiastic swimmers. While in Texas, good swimmers are rare. I still remember my first visit to Texas. I was enroute in Dallas and found a nice parking lot where I could take sensational photos of starting B52 bombers. But then temperatures got up and I drove towards Fort Worth, and to my right detected a kind of artificial lake. Went there, and had the ""non-nonswimmer swimmer area almost to myself. An old man when coming to his side complimented me for my swimming capability. I discussed this with the man, nice and interesting. And in the evening, back in Marshall, discussed it with Uncle Bill (born Schaffhausen 1900, over to the USA 1905, died Marshall/TX 1992) who also considered the size of the two countries (he was citizen still of both). He of course, while having learnt to swim in his earlier life, forget about swimming as he had forgotten his native German at this age (1976) .
		     
You are polite as usual.  The problem however rather is that there are men who think it is ok to abuse women but because they are women. Who feel superior just for being men. It's a shame, but we have to face realities as they are.    
Back to article mentioned by ""Misr"". Reality in Muslim countries are a bit different from what the writer said. Reality is that there is as much abuse there as here.
		 
			
			Interestingly I often discussed 'dress' with some of my Muslim students in the UK. some chose to dress much more conservatively than their own parents, and chose to wear a scarf. THEIR choice. I had a great relationship with many of them, so we talked a lot. We used to organise girls only trips to Brick Lane and London every year, so plenty of time to chat as I drove the school minibus down. What they said, and this really surprised me- is that they felt the other girls, with tiny tops with boobs and midrift showing, and very short skirts or shorts, were the ones who were exploited- the ones who felt compulsed to dress that way to please the boys and follow the 'models' in the magazines. They really felt that by covering up - they were freeing themselves from such pressures, and returning to being young women, rather than 'pieces of meat' (their words, not mine).    
My Muslim cousins in South Africa are very devout muslims, but are not ashamed of their body and allow their children to wear lovely Summer clothes, swimsuits, etc. The older one who has done the Hadj will wear more covering clothes and a scarf on more formal occasion.   
One thing that is for sure, there are almost as many ways of being Muslim, as of being Christian, and that so many adiths are added by all sorts of groups and their Imams for all sorts of reasons. We had girls from a strict brethren in my school in UK who wore long skirts and sleeves, long sock and a scarf always- and who were not allowed to stay on at school at 16, even if they really wanted to. Another certainty is that pre puberty girls do not have to cover up, and do not have to be secluded from boys. And another, thanks Sbrinz, is that 1000s of kids drown every year in the world, because they can't swim.   
What I find abhorrent though, is that SOME Swiss people are gloating with glee about this decision, for all the wrong reasons. They exist, sadly.
		       
			
			Its not just Islam,  I went to Israel in my teens to a very religious Jewish boarding school.  Girls and boys were not allowed to swim together.  We had separate swimming sessions strictly forbidden to swim together.   
However we remedied that by sneaking out of our dorms at night and breaking into the pool for a midnight swim.      
Girls weren't allowed to wear skirts above the knee, or trousers,  short sleeve T-shirts.
		    I went to a Catholic school and we had the same with skirt. We used to roll them up on the waist at the moment we were going out.
		    I hope that they washed the skirt after use in Israel before it shipped out to Montréal.   
			
			When I was a swimming teacher (in Australia) I taught boys and girls, including a pair of sisters (and their brother) who were muslim. When they started the girls wore regular one-piece swimsuits and the parents (who supervised the classes closely) didn't mind which teacher taught the class. When the elder girl was about ten, I think, she started wearing a full-body swimsuit (a  ) and the parents, having observed my ""hands-off all students unless physical support is required"" approach, asked for me to teach all of their children (even though I am male). Both girls could swim really well before they hit puberty, so they didn't need lessons when the issue became more sensitive. As for school swimming, they were in a girls-only school and the school was sensitive to the issue (putting children of those families who requested it into the swimming class of their female sport teacher).
		 
			
			Not sure how many Muslim threads we had by now:   
1. Islam, just like any other major religion, has not one clearly defined set of rules. The interpretations range from Turks being not exactly that strict with Alcohol to Wahhabis believing in Jihad.   
2. Much more important than the exact type of Islam one follows are many other factors defining how open you are to integrate into another culture. The most important factor has been proven time and again to be education. The more educated you are (not the number of college degrees, but the social environment you grew up in), the more likely are you accepting that there is not just one truth or just one right and wrong...   
Bottom line: There is no problem with Muslims in Europe. There are a couple of problems with groups of low educated immigrants that cannot accept that their new homes are different from their old ones... and that their kids will therefore not be the exact carbon copy of themselves, make different experiences in life, get a different education and will live a different life style. This has nothing to do with religion at all, those claims are just cheap killer argument as in ""It is against my RELIGION and you said you have the freedom of religion"".
		    I can't help but think that, in this case, the ""law"" has been used when a little commonsense, understanding and compromise would have been easier, less stressful and provided a win-win situation. As it happened, I feel the whole fuss was a packaged, cover up for a racist reaction from the school.   
1. Some of the boys I take to swimming lessons, wear baggies that come to their knees. (a little awkward for them in the water,cold and clammy when they get out but they cope.)     
2.A couple of the boys and the girls, wear lycra one piece suits that cover them from neck, to knee, and to elbow level.  It' takes them longer if they need to have a toilet break hlaf way through the lesson, but is still not a problem and not disruptive to anyone else.    
There is more body touching done by children in the pool, than when they are at other activities. Any reputable teacher should be able to organise the swim classes to avoid both child/child touching, and adult /child contact, IF it is an issue.     
Incidently, at a World Championship boating event, where most teams wwore skimpy shorts and fitting tops, the Iranian women wore long scarves with a hat on top,  long sleeved t shirts with a thigh length tunic over that, and ankle length loose trousers.  They won a medal!       All you mention is true, BUT a lot depends on the individual teacher. I still remember the day in about 1967 when I had to tell our gym teacher that unless he dropped a certain demand (registration for the Federal Ministry of Defence), my schoolfriend H... whose father was employee at the Turkish Consulate General  had to get assistance of their (non existant) lawyer and that I had to ask dad for the assistance of our (equally non existant) family lawyer. And then the teacher mellowed quite nicely       But honestly... how does one roll up a full veil?          Hey Treverus and all good people here, Good day to you all   
we should respect other cultures and stop joking.
		    Oh, hi!   
Hello and welcome to this forum! What a pity that you did not introduce yourself as the automated email suggested to you before you started groaning around.    
This website is a bit different than most in the sense that many user know each other for quite some time and shared quite some stories with each other. So if you as a newby do not understand each an every joke - it must not necessarily be your lack of humour...
		    To understand other cultures does NOT mean to support restrictive and ultra-conservative folks out of those cultures and does NOT mean to DISadvantage secularist people from those ""other cultures""
		    Hey Wollishofener,   
Thank you and thanks to Treverus for his reply and for the red reputation.   
Have a good evening all..     
**** Dear English Forum switzerland Moderator(s)   
I beg your pardon, please, find a way to let people have fun by other mean away from religion, make a code of ethics or whatever to make talk about religion reduced or in a respected manner on this discussion board.   
Moderator, please spend some effort and find a situation to make all winning, the silly and ignorant comments on this discussion board about religion in general (not only islam) makes a group to suffer and isolating them is not a solution.   
Hey People I see you care about dogs and cats on the discussion board, why don't you care about human beings being upset from your way of joking about their religion, please have some blood !!!!     
Good night to all those here.
		    Just stay away from the threads that you find offensive.  There are plenty more threads that do not discuss religion in any way.   
Welcome to the free world!
		    Its not need to read it... Switzerland its not a Muslim country, actually when you refill the registration formulary with your religion the tax is paid only to the protestant or Catholic church (at least is what i remember of my registration process 1 year ago) and as a Expats we should integrate in the sociaty we are living... its clear that perhaps the language and the food or music or some cultural details cant be change but if you dont want your kids to integrate in a diferent culture and act according to the country you are living then you are free to pay private classes for them or go back to your country and keep your culture... Its clear!! 
Actually I think its great that the swiss are not accepting other cultures come to the country and do whatever they want, I cant go to the goverment and pretend to find the info in my language... i should learn the official lenguage...  
we are Spanish and in Spain you can find the authorities formularys in lenguages that are not official or doesnt even belong to the UE... the goverment gives money to others religions to build their churches... its totally crazy...  
Is the expat that should be adapted to the new country not the new country to the expat...
		    Really?          A)  People joking about religion ?  I cannot see much joking about any religion on this forum  
B)  what group suffers ? 
C)  who exactly is upset from ""joking about religion"" ?  
D)  what exactly should the moderators do ?
		    Burn the infidels!
		    BadaBum! 
And this message is too short.
		    and again this joking ""genau"" detests so much     how dare you        You are welcome, you honestly earned it. After only 11 posts do you run to the mods and complain that people have opinions and attitudes you cannot agree with... It gets more and more groan and bad rep worthy, but I am not that childish.   
I do not expect you to agree with everyone here and I do not expect you to find every joke on this forum funny. But the English forum will not change for you and yes, we are an ingorant bunch in many ways. Get over it. There is a latin word for the ability to accept people you cannot agree to even if it hurts: tolerance. Better get some...   
And now back to my freedom of speech:        I agreed with you on everything except now you are doing provocation. You are bigger than that.
		 
			
			Either one supports free speech or one doesn't. There's no grey area there.
		    Freedom of speech goes how far? Racism comments? Insults? Difamation?
		 
			
			Dear all who just replied after my last post   
Thank you all good people for your comments, I have no problem that you joke about me, words will not stick but I feel sad when I see you have fun about my religion.   
Last night I made a prayer to God, from my heart I asked HIM to help you all and give you the wisdom and the strength to seek all the information and find the right way, and have success in your life, May God accept all the prayers.   
If anyone here passed by Baselland, please tell me I invite you to a very nice Arabic cafe with dates and baklawa, I have this all the year time just come.   
It is impossible to take one single thing from the religion and talk about it in the discussion board, it is like when you make diet and instead of reading the whole sentence "" "" >> ""e "" and you eat it every day since you don't want to read it all, or have fun about the nutrition who wrote it.   
Same here you talk about dressing and swimming, and have fun and joke, hey that is not good, discuss all the religion or stop talking about part of it.   
and discussion board is not good source of information about religion.   
and that makes me sad and some others, we cannot change it but if you one day become a Muslim and felt some happiness in your heart due to it you will not like when some ignorant joke about it in direct or indirect manner.    
Hey all here, I forgive all who had fun with my talk, at the end me and you all will be buried under this earth where our deeds and words either will help us to enjoy the life after and the paradise or will make us suffer endlessly in hell and fire, I love that God gave us freedom for choice to select which way we go for.   
Religion and Islam will not loose when some ignorant talk about, it will stay uphold till the end whatever whoever's talk.     
and hey Biff, Thank you. I am very happy for your thanks it come in the crowd of groans and red reputations.     
All here, have peace and enjoy the day,    
Have great time all here and good luck with your life challenges    
Greetings
		    I always found those cartoons absolutely harmless. And yes, I found my pink balaclava saying ""princess"" (which I posted only for you btw) equally harmless. I really do not get how somebody can wind himself up so far to shout for mods to jump in based on this one...    
I am none of the people who continuously bangs the ""you have to integrate"" drum, but if people cannot accept and stand the liberties the western democracies have fought for a long time - get lost. This includes anything from press freedom to individuals being allowed to say what they think no matter how stupid it is.  
I let people live any way they like, but get really angry when somebody tries to limit   rights based on   religous feelings.
		    I know it was for me and I found it hilarious.    
I think it is an utopia to believe we can say everything, anything no matter what. Even in our society where freedom of speech comes with responsability. For exemple: someone being fired for having written on their Facebook status that the boss is an ass. Or paddy being ban for a week for having called Uncle Max a dickhead.   
Freedom of speech has its limit according on how you offended someone and what is the power of the person you offended to take actions.
		    Question:   
If there is no truth to an allegation, why respond?  If the boss is not an ass, why fire the employee?  And if Uncle Max is not a dickhead, why ban Paddy?  Is it a statement of power, and how individuals should obey?  Lest there is some truth in the allegation?
		    It also depends on the tolerance level of the reader.   
For example, you can't even mention the word obesity on this forum (which is in epidemic proportions in some Western countries) without certain people seeing it as a personal attack.   
And obesity is a real problem. God only exists if you believe.       Funny enough did I read an article discussing this very exact point just yesterday:    
In short: You have the freedom to say whatever you want. This does not mean that you have the right to do so and not expect any consequences... freedom comes at a price and well, if you insist on insulting your boss might this price be to get fired.
		    But that does not make him less of a real problem in the world today...
		 
			
			With freedom always comes responsibility and respect.
		     
Hello Genau ,   
Say what you want and express always what you think is ok ,  
your opinion is always correct that might be  wrong  and their opinion is wrong that might also be correct      
 much respect & Viele Grüß
		    this is insensitive the least, and rather provocative...not sure what you are trying to accomplish here
		    Hey! Obesity is NOT a problem, I hardly see anybody overweight, infact from my point of view anybody under 120 Kgs has a eating disorder.
		     I will remember to invite you to my place next time I make a banana cake, dripping in soft chocolate icing.       I am demonstrating that posting a harmless cartoon turns this thread into a groan fest.   
Or to put it differently: That the same people who demand freedom for their religion and frankly ""unSwiss"" culture react like aggressive baboons as soon as somebody does make the slightest provocation. This is the very core of the thread on a family that mentally never arrived here: You cannot demand freedom for yourself but in the same moment jump at anyone who has a conflicting position. To claim that swimming lessons for girls are against religious freedom is complete bullshit and has nothing to do with Islam - it has a lot to do with small minded boneheads. You know, the type of people that would groan on internet forums...   
Your will find the same types in ANY religion, but for some reason I cannot explain do on this website especially the ones on Islam attract the worst crowd.
		    This is what I keep repeating on this forum since I joined!   well said Treverus!
		    i think you are exaggerating, so far what i see is people here have been kindly reminding you that posting a cartoon that many people find offensive and that caused so much trouble through the globe is insensitive, there is nothing aggressive about this. Contrarily, I find your approach pretty aggressive, just look at the language you have been using and you will see...
		 
			
			If we're to believe these religious folks, they get eternal life and are best friends with all powerful beings, what do they need protection from?   
We should be more concerned with other fringe hobbyists, what protection to trainspotters get from ridicule?
		    Are you so sure?        If HE exists, then he also has freedom of speech.   
HE can write holy books with all sorts of strange things.   
HE can write as many holy books as he wants.   
We should not demand those books be banned.   
But those who follow those books to the letter and do hateful things as a result should take the responsibility for their actions and stop blaming HIM.   
Likewise, Danish newspapers can draw cartoons of the guys in those holy books. That is also their freedom.   
If people want to set fire to Swiss embassies as a result, they cannot blame HIM and cannot blame the Danish newspapers but are wholly responsible for their own actions.   
Freedom of speech gives you the right to say what you want, not to do what you want.
		    Hey Treverus,   
how you practice freedom is making others sad, I remind you with your words down here       what one says is part of his personality and if one doesn't believe in what he says and just decorating words to show that he is wise then it is not good.   
freedom limit stops when it hurts others.   
I advise you and all other to step back and review your posts and think if it brings any benefit more than increasing level of hatred between two groups.   
have a good afternoon all.
		    That is a strange definition of freedom of speech.   
If my freedom of speech stops where others are offended, how can we have political debates? How can we have peer review? How can a teacher correct his pupils? How can you question the status quo? How can you define being offended? Anybody can claim to be offended and unless you can see inside their mind, you cannot see whether the offence is real. Banning offensive speech is just a first step to banishing free speech.
		    ...and this is why the US is better than Switzerland.
		 
			
			Wow, lovely. In this thread we saw: Muslim, Islam, God, Jewish, Christian, fat, freedom of speech, terrorists and now USA.    
Forgot something?
		    Feel free to dig through my old posts as long as you want. However, I'd appreciate if you do not pull out single sentences out of context...       My message was that you have the freedom of speech, but when talking to people in a difficult situation - in that thread we were talking about cancer patients that are so suffering that they consider assisted suicide - one should limit himself to not harm them in their vulnerable situation.   
You can read all my posts and I bet you will have a hard time to find something that conflicts with a few points:  
- I believe in freedom of speech and only accept to limit it where it causes direct harm, the cancer patient example is a perfect one for it.  
- I do not accept that a cartoon or any written word can be so harmful that it should be outlawed or deleted by mods. 
- Of course can some words hurt people and their feelings. I am not saying that practicing ones' freedom of speech means that you should walk around and insult people.    
However, if you are not even tolerant enough for a simple harmless cartoon or joke do you simply need to grow a longer fuse in order to survive in Europe.  
You will see a lot more provocative things from ad campaigns to political campaigns that will hurt you hyper sensitive feelings. I personally prefer to live in a place where there is nobody telling me what to think and I am free to choose what to look at and what not. And I most certainly do not want to live in a place where ""acceptable"" is defined by the most intolerant part of the society. No matter what religion they have.      Junk food.
		    The Swiss?   
Tom
		    Landlords and flat cleaning.       Oh, come on.....don't pretend that the cartoon was posted in a harmless way. It was posted to make a point, and it did. Don't play both sides by bating the argument and then complaining when the bait was taken....
		    The point of the thread? Some time ago...
		    The thread was started by The Local.  It didn't have a point.
		    I am in no way complaining. I posted the cartoon to test the reactions if our Muslim members on this thread are as tolerant themselves as they demand the Swiss to be for their views and traditional life style. And for the record is this very much on topic for this thread.   
Up to now the answers seems to unfortunately be a ""no"". As I posted earlier do I not for a second believe that this has anything to do with Islam. I have met far too many tolerant Muslims before to believe so...

Oh dear. That means that the nice cabin crew member who on a Swiss flight asked us to ""please make sure your blackberry, your blueberry, or whatever colour your berry might be is switched off"", its a psycopath!    
			
			That story is so sad.    
Once in Munich the tram driver accidentally left his microphone switched on, and he had a long private radio conversation with another driver. Nothing dirty, but they were expressing their preferences for mutual female aquaintances. All the tram passengers were very amused.
		 
			
			Just read this on the local     
Aparrently a traindriver announced on the tannoy that the next station would be the summit of one of Switzerlands most famous mountains, Jungfraujoch.He then went on to say that passengers could continue their onward journey to Wilderswil from there by sleigh. He apparently also said that passengers could work out for themselves on which side of the train to alight.Its not difficult, he said.  true indeed, and actually somewhat funny.   
what really cracks me up is the statement from SBB > He may have psychological problems and is receiving help, SBB spokeswoman Lea Meyer said.     
Now I am all for a safety first approach , but even in aviation you sometimes hear something similar..        
atleast it brings a smile to ones face and makes people pay more attention to standard Briefings.. what is the harm..(apart from perhaps a perceived lack of professionality)   
what is your take on this ? Is this the being square swiss approach to things or is there something else at play?
		 
			
			If you posted this two hours earlier I'm sure Woli would have already given you a good description of how things work both in aviation and on the trains here. But his bedtime has passed so I will try.   
I know in Mud's wife's home country train, tram, and bus drivers have to pass a mental evaluation before they can take the controls. Makes sense to me, you are responsible for a lot of lives, and are at the same time doing a fairly repetitive job. If this driver said what the article said he did, then they have to investigate, just to be sure.    
My take is he was just in a jolly mood and had an Open Mike moment on the PA. But if he was cracking up, and they did nothing, and there was an accident, there would be hell to pay.
		 
			
			I think he was just a guy with a fun sense of humour having a fun day. I mean, the things he was saying were obviously exaggerated and not to be taken seriously      but I guess a lot people out there didnt see the funny side of it.

			A school teacher known only as Peter C has been accused of playing strip poker with his 12- to 13-year-old pupils and instructing them to watch porn for homework.         
			
			We received a note home from the school yesterday.   
I assume all local school children received a letter.   
""We regret this incident, and will now be looking into a full explanation...""   
What, they want poker lessons now?!    
			
			Nothing scandalous here then. Just another normal day at a Wettingen school preparing the little darlings for the real world.   
Trade you three condoms for a used bra and raise you three porn DVDs ....
		 
			
			I knew Europeans were liberal and comfortable with nudity, more so than Americans, but this takes things a little to far.      As long as it ain't from my collection of ""Midgets Gone Wild"" I'm cool with it.    
On a more serious note, another appaling story of this grand unregulated system. I guess the Mercer idiots didn't bother with the education bit.    
			
			What I can't come around is the fact that parents still send their kids to him everyday since November.    
And waiting until now to take actions because the school didn't? This is at least a full three months.   
I wouldn't have send my child back the next morning and until the guy is out!
		 
			
			Let's wait until we really know what it's all about - anything out of 'Blick' or 'Telezüri' is suspicious - and the man's off work anyway. We have to continually avoid finding people guilty before the truth is out.
		 
			
			The teacher has a psychological problem, the headmaster is an idiot and why do we need to know the names of the accusers?
		 
			
			Why did it take so long for action to be taken? Why weren't the police called? And why only mothers?   
If I'd heard of such going on at my daughters' school, I'd have demanded an explanation immediately, and if I wasn't satisfied, I'd have gone to the police.    
The first casualty of journalism - especially 20min style - is the truth.
		    At the moment accusations are made regarding children, actions must be taken immediately not waiting until MARCH. To find out if they are truth and if not, to give assistance to the teacher and find out why those accusations are out. And if they are real, to protect to kids right away.   
You don't let a potential pedophile in an environment where he/she is with kids and with a position of power on them.   
The thing to do in any cases where accusations are made is to take the teacher off his function right away to allow time for investigations and calm down the situation.
		 
			
			Ah, where were all these teachers when I was 15 or at German lessons....         
			
			And by Wettingen, Zurich they most likely mean my Aare-neighbors Wettingen, Aargau. 
I guess Switzerland's geography isn't a strong point with thelocal        You mean The Local made a mistake?   
Now that would be news indeed.
		 
			
			Having seen the way that the kids in one of my daughters' class engineered the quitting from the profession of their class teacher, it wouldn't surprise me at all to find out there was no foundation in the accusations.   
A false accusation could just as easily engender a complete nervous breakdown. Perhaps even more so.
		 
			
			Please excuse my absence from the interwebz, but some of you may have noticed that there is a sun shining outside, and it is reflecting very prettily off the Limmat today.   
Now you all know I'd hate to be the one to let the truth get in the way of a good story, and would like to believe that Wettingen is indeed in Zurich.   
It also seems that it was   that brought this situation to the attention of the schools management. In February. At which time the teacher was dismissed, and shall not return to teaching in the bustling metropolis of Wettingen.   
Those of you with teenagers, might care to take note of how much your children share with you.  The story may not have been shared with parents until this time.  If it indeed happened as has been mediated.   
What we might also care to note is that the schools management is taking it seriously. And is also looking into why they only found out about the incidents from last year, at this time.   
One may or may not draw conclusions from the incident occurring at the Realschule, not the Gymnasium, where all our über-intelligent kids seem to go.
		 
			
			If a few mums don't like a teacher because of something they said or done, it's very easy to make false accusations... esp against a male teacher... and get them ""disciplined""!!  this is why there are   male teachers out there!! What if it was a female teacher who smacked a Boys bottom for misbehaving?  Isn't that sexual assault as well and shouldn't that teacher be disciplined and fired as well??
		    it is not sexual assault but violence, and that shouldn't be tolerated either.
		 
			
			Teachers don't smack bottoms any more, but I see your point.

About half of the remaining foreign millionaires were able to reorganise their affairs so they actually pay less tax now than under the old flat rate scheme.   
Also according to other newspapers, the net effect is an overall increase in taxes of around 1.5 Million.  Not much return for all the effort involved & one also has to wonder how long the remaining 50 or so foreign millionaires will continue to pay these higher taxes?
		    It's all about being 'fair' which translates  to getting richer people to pay more taxes. Life is not fair, some people are born more intelligent thats just life.
		 
			
			Phil Collins lives here? Another good reason to flee....   
I wonder if many of the large multi-national companies are moving elsewhere, e.g. IBM, due to the strong franc and some of the tax changes.
		    About ""It's all about being 'fair' which translates  to getting richer people to pay more taxes.""   
But three quarters of the 200 rich people who were targeted in Zürich are not paying more tax. 
It was a pretty dumb way to tackle the issue.  Increasing the flat rate tax by only 5% would have had the richer people paying more taxes & generated more revenue for the Kanton.  And of course it could have been increased by more than 5%.   
I think it was more to do with jealousy than fairness. 
As you wrote the smart people will always find a way to be unfair.   
""non dom"" in UK is a much better deal for foreign millionaires.
		    About ""Phil Collins lives here?"" - not any more, it is claimed he was one of the 50% who left         Generally thease people are taxed based on 5 times their rent or notional rent. If they were not that rich, it's clear that they could well be paying less, however when they arrived it was more difficult to live in CH unless they did a deal.   
By increasing the tax rate 5% do you mean going from 20% to 25% or that they just pay 5% more? There was never a flat tax rate, it was always based on the amount of notional income.   
The non dom deal in the UK is better for sure in early years, but only if your living of capital rather than income, as income remmited to the UK is fully taxed. Which is why pop stars with royalty income don't flock to the UK
		 
			
			This is almost like saying, you may have gotten away with taxes somewhere else, but you're gonna have to pay your dues - this is our house.  Good on the Swiss.
		    It's Just Zurich (& now LU), not 'The Swiss', you just need to move to another canton. The people are not 'getting away' with anything, they made a deal & can't work as a result, they have to be 'retired'.  
It's actually just easy money for the Cantons that play ball, many of the people are hardly here at all.......they just choose to pay tax here.
		 
			
			But some cantons, like the one I live (Zug) are based on tax benefits for companies and some ""special people"" like Kimi Raikkonen, Sebastian Vettel, etc... 
The rents are super expensive, and the tiny city with 26,000 inhabitants have a Ferrari car dealer, Maserati, Porsche, etc... 
If they hike taxes here, this place will disappear!
		 
			
			Oh no what are we going to do?
		    Rich does not mean intelligent. Intelligent does not mean rich.   
**************************************************  ***********************************         
They are NOT to raise taxes, but the Royal Emirate of Zug (REZ) will rather drop all taxes        I suppose it's easier to be jealous over someone who is rich, to be jealous of someone more intelligent is a more difficult concept.  
You don't hear people complaining they have low intelligence.
		 
			
			I see a number of, apparently, mutually contradictory themes here:   
1) The need to get the Rich to pay their fare share towards maintaining a civilised society.   
2) The need to avoid punitive taxation.   
I strongly believe that it IS in the interest of the rich to contribute fairly towards paying for the upkeep of society. Surely, a well funded society that takes care of the unfortunates of society, that provides good public services, healthcare and amenities is ultimately saving the rich money overall? I would argue that, were I a multimillionaire industrialist, it is very much in MY interest to have a well educated, healthy and ultimately productive workforce. A well run and funded society would also save ME money in the long run by obviating the need for gated communities, private security armies, expensive-to-run vehicles that can negotiate badly maintained roads, etc., etc.   
However taxation MUST be fair, I think that it is absurd, immoral and socially unethical that a multimillionaire can end up with a total tax burden in terms of percentage of income LESS than the total tax burden in terms of percentage of income of his secretary. But it is equally absurd, immoral and socially unethical to tax the rich at eye-wateringly high rates - I dimly recall reading about one super-group who fled the UK for friendlier tax climes in the 70s because - with all the various taxes added together - they were liable for £1.10 for every £1 earned (if I recall the gist of the story correctly).   
A basic, flat, percentage of ALL incomes tax, with NO loopholes would be fairer to everyone and would likely to bring down taxes per head. But I suspect there would be significant opposition from both ends of the political spectrum, from the soak-the-rich brigade and from the ""I'm making money through loopholes"" mob. So it will never happen.....   
As for me, well let's say I'm stuck in that ghetto of ""being too rich for state handouts and being too poor to hide the money"" - an easy target for the taxman...
		 
			
			We are talking about foreign millionairs who don't work, paying tax in a country which they have not worked for at least 10 years.  
Switzerland is also a country without any public healthcare.   
Your thoughts seem a little off topic?   
Somebody with an average income in CH pays well under 10% of gross income in taxes , subsidised of course by the rich ones.             
			
			I'm still here; what's the fuss about again?
		    That you're not in the 50% that left.    
Sorry, I meant to say, we thank you for subsidising our tax by earning many millions a year.
		    Except of course in the Socialist Republic of Geneva. But it's ok, as a compensation for higher tax rates (2x Zurich rates) we have higher health insurance, higher roadtax, higher rent, higher everything.

			Swiss hotels are the most expensive in the world, according to a study by Hotels.com.         
			
			Rubbish - Hotels in the UK are very very expensive. We manage to stay in simple hotels all over CH for 40-80 CHF all the time.
		 
			
			Asian hotels can be horrendously expensive too- especially if you are on an average asian wage.     
Unlike most of us who are on an average Swiss wage.    
			
			Swiss XYZ are the most expensive in the world, according to a study by XYZ.com.
		     
Hold on there, Hotels.com. I spurn your 142 000 properties worldwide and I cast aspersions on your methodology of reporting a global survey based upon the actual prices that your business actually paid on behalf of your clients globally.   
Odile sometimes stays somewhere cheap, so stick that up your statistically valid survey methodology and let us hear no more of it.   
Bloody timewasters, with their real data and everything    
			
			Costly, indeed.    
But it's more the 70's skiing log cabin formaica interiors that kill me. Too recycled for that price tag.
		    Some fine analysis there Odile! I will challenge you to find me a hotel room In Switzerland for CHF40.-   
To make things interesting for you I will wager CHF10.- for every CHF1.- below CHF60 for 2* hotel within 5km radius from the center of any main city in Switzerland within the next 3 months. In return I will expect you to pay the difference between CH60 and the cheapest hotel you will find    
			
			I dunno, we're staying in a hotel next week and, geez, for a tiny room in an out of the way place in off season...I could stay in the Ritz in NYC with a park view and a butler for the same price. I shopped around a bit, too, and that was the most affordable without lowering my standards/convenience factor too much.      I needed a good chuckle. Maybe they should use that in their next PR campaign....""Switzerland. Just bring all the cash you have...""        You mean this one  No mountain view,dirty NYC air ,mugger ,purse snatcher,murderers,PMS(pims), republicans,bad politicians,Americans ,Canadians, thief's,hose,and discharged gums ,tobacco on the side walk      
			
			LOL -  stayed in a simple hotel in October in Evolène - 80 CHF for a double room including breakfast.  Simple and old fashioned Hotel, but really cute in a lovely Swiss village. Yes, there was no en-suite, only a wash basin, and the bathroom in the corridor. There are plenty like that all over Switzerland- not 5 star, but really typical and in lovely spots like Evolène. All wooden and not a bit of formica in sight. En-suite bedrooms were 100CHF for double. Just one example.   
Hotel Hermitage that was, but the other simple and typical hotels in the area (like Les Haudères) were roughly the same price and in a setting with fabulous views all around. So you takes your choice. I'd much rather stay in such a fabulous setting in a simple hotel, than a 5*. Go to Val d'Hérens and see if you can find a better and more 'Swiss' spot with better views? Friends have got a great (simple) B&B there called La Grande Peur dans la Montagne - views are to die for, a waterfall right at the back with a BBQ and peaceful garden, similar prices (and Madeleine speaks excellent English). Sorry but I never stay in town- but always further out and travel in    
90.- CHF per night for two persons in double room 
60.- CHF per night for two children in twin bedroom 
130.- CHF per night for family room (one doubled size bed, bunk bed (sleeps 2) and kitchen) including breakfast   
You'd be hard pushed to find even a simple B&B in the Lake District for less than £30 squid.
		    Yes, that would be it. I don't' think the hotel we're staying in here has a mountain view either.       Too funny.  I always tell friends who want to come visit, ""Bring your camera. . .and your wallet.""   
			
			I don't know about  whether they're the most expensive but some of the worst hotels I have stayed in in my life have been in Switzerland.   
I've stayed in some wonderful ones as well but lots have been truly terrible (but not in a funny implausible way if you know what I mean).

In all seriousness, Swiss hotel prices are often very poor in terms of value for money - especially in the mid and lower price bands. But when you get to the higher price bands (such as the Grand Hotel Park, Gstaad) you get what you pay for and it IS very, very good.   
I would agree about UK hotel prices, unless you are very lucky it's hard to find anything reasonable in London for less than £120/night
		    You forgot rapists, child abductors, and war criminals.       How about ""Switzerland. Where your money checks-in, but doesn't check-out""    
Seriously, though, if I could have booked a hotel out in the sticks, I would have, but we had to be near the apartment due to movers, etc. It's about 350chf per night (2 adults and 1 child) and it's really nothing special. I does have a bathroom, though.       In Switzerland 14 min. work pays for hotel >USofA 14 month work pays for hotel.Motel payed by client                That was worthy of the honour of being your 2,000th post    
			
			There are a lot of expensive hotels in Switzerland, but I do not agree with the comment in the article saying that it lacks budget accommodation. It does in Zurich/Geneva and top resorts - but there is a lot of great but simple budget accommodation in some stunning areas (see example above).  
We use Freedreams and stay for 3 nights for 2 people in some great locations for 85CHF - but yes we have to take one meal in house. 14CHF per night isn't bad is it? Not many in towns in Switzerland- although a 4* hotel is available in Lugano - 14CHF per night!!!   
I've used hotels.com - to book hotels in Sharm-elSheik , Tenerife and South of Spain. Most people using the site will be booking for stays in such places - no wonder!
		    Since I can't really work here....not so much. Besides, back in my high-flying consulting days, I was a regular enough at the Ritz to know the bartender by first name and get free drinkies.    
			
			we have never had a problem finding hotel options here in Switzerland for between 150 and 200 a night, which is competitive with any of the options we have found in neighboring countries and less expensive (leaving aside FX rates) than most options in the US.   
then again, I have never used hotels.com, nor do I know anybody else who has used their online services.
		 
			
			These easy-headline 'surveys', conducted by   which are then  followed rapidly by a press release issued by - oh! -   , heavily publicising how clever   has been for creating this exhaustive-survey-based-on-a-few-lines-of-SQL, and which is then grinningly passed on like a sexually transmitted disease by lazy-toad Wikipedia ""journalists"", leaving the Marketing Dept at   high-fiving each other as they head out for a long Friday afternoon lunch.....   
.....irritate the hell out of me.
		 
			
			One of the best hotels I ever stayed, a few years ago, was near Cochin in southern India. The cost for one night was what I would normally spend on 3 or 4 beers back home. What an astonishing bargain! Quality-wise, by far the cheapest hotel I'd ever stayed in!   
But then towards the end of my stay there, after chatting with the staff and other locals, I discovered that what I was being charged for one night was what the average local working adult was being paid in a month.    
I translated this back to my home currency and realised that instead of being the cheapest, it was actually the most expensive hotel I'd ever stayed in.   
And that is another reason why this 'survey' is junk. It's junk marketing and junk journalism. It benefits   who devised it, and it benefits the chaotic Breugel-like media minions who will pick up on this morsel and hungrily swarm all over it until it vanishes -- without ever asking the important questions.          I've stayed in some super dive motels in the U.S., the kind of places where you sleep on top of the comforter rather than risk the sheets. The only place I've (almost) stayed worse was the first hotel I tried here: greasy film over the whole room, and what must have been a 12"" log mostly dissolved in the toilet. I say must have been as it was clear it had been there at least a week, and the whole room smelled of it. Management was rather surprised that I didn't want the room, no others to offer, told me to flush it and a maid would be along to clean IF I really wanted.   
This was Neuchatel, ~2000, about a year before I actually moved here. Tried to find the name but can't be sure so I won't incriminate an innocent place a decade later. Ended up saying FARK IT and went to the Beau Rivage, Mud was more flush with cash in those days and put a dent in an empty credit card. Even attacked the mini bar. Impeccable room- but cost about 400 smackers when it was all said and done. Haven't stayed in a hotel here since.    
My face when I saw the first room     
My face when I saw the new room at Beau Rivage     
			
			Well you are very lucky - Beau Rivage - I wish! I had coffee there once   
I really hope I will be able to stay once in the New St Pancras Hotel- but I really can't afford THOSE prices. Neither the Dorchester. C'est la vie - Switzerland can be really cheap if you know where and how to look.
		    Well, that was a long time ago, and it will be a long time coming before I can swing a room like that again.   Ah, memories.

299	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/131628-particles-still-faster-than-light-experiment-re-run.html	" 
			
			A fiercely contested experiment that appears to show the accepted speed limit of the Universe can be broken has yielded the same results in a re-run, European physicists said on Friday.             
			
			Well, that isn't strictly true.... the experiment has proved that Neutrino's have gone from point A to point B faster than light could, however, that doesn't neccessarily mean that they travelled faster than light.  The more likely explanation is that they simply took a different route.   
A possible fifth dimension could be about to be discovered, which would open a whole new world of possibilities and scientific discovery.... either way, very exciting times... you know, if you like that sort of thing.  Ahem.
		    Or maybe the ultimate speed limit is not the speed of light but the speed of neutrino.
		 
			
			Maybe, the point is we don't know.   
Whatever the reason, as long as it's not human error or faulty equipment, this will open up HUGE areas of discovery.
		 
			
			This article was posted in next month's New Scientist magazine. The results of which will be published in last years January edition.
		 
			
			when these alleged particles go faster than the speed of light do they...  
bring a flashlight?    
are they afraid of the dark?  
do they set off speed camera's  ( ohhh err... calculate the fine on that particle will ya ! )
		 
			
			No, they arrive before they left.
		 
			
			What I don't get, how can they make em faster than light..but we loose the friggin radio signal everytime we drive through a tunnel....      Try another channel.
		     
Easy,   
The particles come from the back of my mothers hand.         
When I was a kid I'd always do something wrong.   
My mum ""appeared"" to be just standing there........ and then        
is this tied into your kingsize bed experiment
		    No. It's proved (to a certain level of likelihood) that the experiment really is yielding results which suggest that neutrinos have gone from point A to point B, apparently faster than light could.   
Systematic errors have   been ruled out.
		 
			
			I guess this is all bad new for highway speed cameras huh ?
		    Didn't read the post where I said ""As long as human error or faulty equipment haven't been ruled out..."" then?   
Apologies for missing the word ""apparently""   
FFS
		    Did you prep the flux capacitor yet?
		 
			
			What happens when a car, traveling at the speed of light, turns on its headlights?       That is actually a very interesting question and will require a rather lengthy and technical reply, so, if you'll bare with me.........   
Given that the velocity of the car would be greater than the speed of the light eminating from the cars headlights, and of course taking into consideration the levels of flux in the capacitor, the ionisation effects and the polarity of the resulting tachion pulse, there is only one conclusion, the ar5e of the driver would disappear through the back of his own head.   
Remember, obey the speed limit.
		 
			
			It's an old (very stupid article) but made me laugh!       
Maybe it will shed a bit of light on what's going on in idiot terms (no pun intended)    
			
			If I understand correctly, these particles arrived 0.0025% faster than they were predicted to.   
In other words, sunlight takes 8 mins 19 seconds to reach earth, but these neutrinos might take take 8 mins, 18.99 seconds.   
That's quite some margin of experimental error to claim you have ruled out!   
It also appears to the layman to be.....well......not that much difference at all. Assuming that means that the difference in the speed of light and neutrinos is the speed at which one could theoretically travel backwards and forwards in time - I think that means that it would take a day of time travel to end up 20 seconds ago.   
Anybody care to explain the implications of such a tiny difference?
		     
A new thread by the local?
		    I think this is more about whether or not it   to exceed the speed of light, and not necessarily the degree to which it is possible to exceed the speed of light.  The latter is subject for future experimentation and refinement of technique.   
A good comparison would be aluminum- for most of human history, Aluminum was virtually unworkable (melted at too high a heat) and, at one time, was considered more valuable than gold.  But once it was discovered that it   be extracted and worked, that led to further refinements in techniques which led to aluminum being what it is today- a very commonplace, inexpensive metal used in numerous applications.
		    This is usually like the difference whether you get a speed ticket or not
		 
			
			Surely there is no such thing as a finite speed limit? The only thing that happens is that you can longer ""see"" it, just because you can see it doesn't mean it's not there, evidence the the door frame you stub your toe on in the middle of the night, just because it's pitch black and you can't see it, it's still there.
		    You can still 'observe' things without 'seeing' them.  The doorframe in the darkened room could be 'observed' by putting one's hand out in front of oneself until it makes contact with a solid object (the doorframe).     
In the instance of light speed, no particle has been observed to actually travel faster than light.  All this experiment demonstrates is that these particles appeared at a point sooner than expected, per the current models of Relativity Physics/Quantum Mechanics.
		    Basically, it means that all of Einstein physics is wrong (if true).   
Tom
		    Not necessarily.  That's a bit of a broad brush with which to paint this.  The particle observed, a neutrino, is one of the least-massive (while still having a mass) particles that are known to exist.  With there being a relationship between mass and velocity, it is entirely   under Einstein's Theory of Relativity that a near-massless particle could approach or exceed the speed of light.   
Further, in the realm of Quantum Mechanics, there have been observed 'interactions' between particles whereby the particles changed 'spin' at a rate to imply that information was traversing between these particles instantaneously (i.e. faster than the speed of light).
		    No I didn't. I was responding to the post you made before that. Feel free to put your toys back in your pram.       This, I think is not the case. What happens is that two particles are entangled, in such a way that when the spin of one of the particles is measured, the other's is also known. (Useful) information cannot travel faster than light - in the Einsteinian universe.   
Talk about Einstein being wrong are a bit silly. Without relativity, your GPS wouldn't work - it requires both special and general relativity to be taken into account to get the required results. Newton's theory of gravity wasn't proved ""wrong"" by Einstein, it was refined. It's still plenty good enough to get men on the moon, probes into the far reaches of the solar system etc.   
If it isn't a systematic error, then it will be something on the fringes of the theory.
		 
			
			Just like in Real Life-   
If you're not winning the game, change the rules.   
Apparently the rulers the measuring team were using, may have been crooked.          This theory will be proven wrong in March 2012 I predict. You probably won't see my post until then either, because I've cunningly scattered it's component parts through a tuned up Hoover which is operating at the same frequency as a radio station on Mars playing Elvis's latest 2011 Christmas album.

I have every faith that the guys who look into auto accidents and pathologists are doing what they do best in the Valais right now and answers will be given when they're good and ready, mainly for the families of the deceased to be able to at least try and find something resembling closure.

		    In most Swiss Cantons you have to get a permission from police for doing a demonstrations. You have to give them a schedule and the route of your demo. This is standard in practical all cantons. I mean, Geneva joined Switzerland as early as 1815         
We'd need a referendum to be able to decide this and should there not be a 100% participation it wouldn't be democratic...
		    Geneva too you had to get permission but now it's not allowed (Cause they won't authorize it anyway) and fine is upto 100 K   
It feels like telling the people you have to get permission to say your opinion but we won't let you do it.....freedom of speech is a human right.....pretty odd to me for this to happen here...would love to know the EU / UN opinion on that

			For the second time since 2005, the Geneva football club Servette is on the brink of collapse.            First of all, I hope that Servette-Genève and Xamax-Neuchâtel get rescued in the end.    
Do not be mistaken, there were similar things about those clubs in Luzern and Aarau, and Grasshoppers and FCZ in Zürich are only minimally better off !  The only football club who might survive minimally commercially is the FCB of Basel    
There not only are many different sports in Switzerland, but most of all, there are too many local/regional football clubs around here. Would all those local FCs in Zürich merge into either FCZ or GC, those clubs would be saved. They could maintain local ""subdivisions"" for training facilities of course.    
FCZ and GC a few years ago have merged in regard to icehockey. The result is good but not overwhelming.

			A 23-year-old Swiss man who wants to become Mr. Switzerland is being hailed as a hero for preventing a bus carrying 11 football supporters from crashing when its driver died behind the wheel.         
			
			Talk about a headline teaser.....   
there's no picture of the Mr. Switzerland candidate in the article.

Never mind.  The Blick has saved the day!          And, what's your verdict ?

		    I think Mr Switzerland is about muscles not looks! Unless you like body builders. Or is that different here?   
EDIT: Just looked....yeah, I doubt he's a body builder!!
		 
			
			He obviously had enough brain muscle to stop the bus.
		    He doesn't look Swiss.       
However, after his heroic feat, he should automatically be placed in the top three but still be expected to pose for the speedo part.  Isn't that the most important part of any beauty competition?
		    ""Mr Switzerland"" is about looks and how the person is able to get along with people. Muscles play a relatively minor role. No, it is NOT a bodybuilders-contest. ""Too well groomed"" however is closer to the point as he, in spite of being mechanic, rather looks like a bank-clerk from the ""front-office"".    
Gym ?  The way how he acted shows that his reflection is rapid and his physics up to the point.    
This story now of course may help him ahead to some extent
		    ""To look Swiss"" is not a condition for a ""Mr Switzerland""     
			
			Did he lose his eyebrows in this act of heroism?
		    Mr. Switzerland  , that is       No, it's when they call for world fleece
		 
			
			Is that a watch or a satellite dish?       
			
			The coach driver died of a heart attack, but he was working ""On the black"" on his rest day: he was employed 100% by another company!        
			
			Why would a football need a supporter?       Haven't you seen his watch?
		 
			
			Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh I always love those story's ,""Hero Passenger  saves other passengers !!!"" Hero Pilot saves 250 people""  what about  saving his own Butt ?       I bet the driver died from horror when he thought about The Local.
		    The young man did not want to be a hero and acted out of instinct. He quite obviously simply wanted to stop the bus from crashing. The word ""hero"" may not be exactly correct, but is possibly the best term availabe.    
There is a difference between the two ""heroes"". This young man acted with an incredibly swift reaction and deciseness, while the ""hero pilot"" saved those 250 people by employing his professional abilities.    
Neither wanted to be a hero, but both did what needed to be done at the right time. If they got praised as ""heroes"" so be it.    
What I do not really like are ""Winkelrieds"", chaps who go into death ""heroically"" just to save others.    
The young man stated to be soooo sad that he could not do anything for the driver. He before departure had spoken with the driver about the four children of the man, and deeply felt with the berieved children   
And only when it was over, got clattering bones and teeth

He indeed IS the same !   But, as much as I detested him BEFORE he became Bundesrat, I increasingly appreciate his work. And by saying ""no space available"" he did his due service to his party, any by organising what is needed shows to be doing what is necessary.

			Despite spending more on teaching the language than the top four countries, Switzerland ranked only eleventh in an international survey comparing English proficiency levels among adults.            seems like normal value for schweizer qualitaet!    
			
			I love the bit about having to learn a Second language (French) as being part of the reason. Kids in the Nordics, e.g. Finland, have to learn Finnish and Swedish, often pick English as their third and many also pick up a fourth or fifth without a problem.
		 
			
			I think what Switzerland needs to do is actually bring English in the system. I mean although they might be spending lot of money over teaching English in schools. However the questions they should pose themselves is whether they use English language on daily basis. Look around e.g. sign boards, hoardings, advertisements, and in general use of english in public places...You will agree that English is very limited is use...So unless Swiss brings english into the system, I doubt it is not going to improve...
		    I dunno, French and German are pretty different.  From what I understand, the nordic languages are pretty similar, though maybe Finnish is kinda weird from what I've heard.   
Anyway - maybe they could try subtitling TV instead of dubbing?  That works well for the Dutch.  Whatever the case, I think the English here is just fine, I was only suggesting this if they want to improve it.
		    The Local has managed to post an article that was in regular newspapers    
Congratulations!
		    It's beyond weird, it's not even in the same language family, i.e. not Indo-European, but Fenno-Ugric. Save for loan words, you haven't a prayer of reading anything without first knowing the rules for the extreme inflection and the root words (meaning unlike English, you can't just go to the dictionary and look up words since letters actually change and disappear depending on the rules). It's closest relatives are Hungarian and Estonian.
		 
			
			blurg typical media response to an education problem. Spending more money on education doesn't lead to better results. I'd be interested in an indepth qualitative analysis comparing classroom practices between the countries.   
Also I saw the tables in the 20 minute and the difference between 7 and 13th was so marginal! Also the Scandanavians always top tables - it is their job!   
Also it is a survey of Adults, any new investments in the last decades wouldn't accurately be represented. A better survey would be amongst school leavers or university leavers.
		    Yeah, I heard that from a Hungarian - that the languages are similar.  Strange, I wonder how it ended up that way.   
Like you said, most Finns I know are fluent in Finnish, Swedish, English, and something else, typically.  Cool and extremely bright people.
		    There are a number of studies as to both the origin of the people as well as the language itself, though there's not a lot of consensus on either. Let's just say they're neither Swedish nor Russian (the Finns around will get that particular bit of humor)  . And, yes, they are very bright...afterall, I married one, but even the ones who aren't all that bright, what makes up for it is a culture driven by a value for education. It's changing a bit now, but the top choice of career almost every year when the Helsinki paper surveys school kids is...school teacher. Every year on Mayday, it's an interesting ritual to watch them all head for the park, beers in tow, with their caps on to display their matriculation levels (tassels are tops).    
I think that a lot of Swiss (along with their big-4 brethren) just don't get a lot of exposure to English early on due to the dubbing/translation and, so, don't value it until it's a bit late to really learn it fluently.
		 
			
			Maybe I'm a bit lost here, but I can't see how this two studies are connected with each other. I'm sure I spend much more money on bread than the average Pole. But I guess it's clear to everyone that I have to pay for higher costs of production/living expenses and no one would expect that I eat more or better bread than the Polish. But everywhere I look, it seems that I'm the only one who's bothered by that. Am I missing something?
		 
			
			What? No one has complained about the ironically stilted English thread title?       I just understood that they do this spending while under the influence.     
			
			Obviously the Swiss do not seem to score well compared to the generally excellent foreign language abilities of native English speakers    
			
			Tractor Queen from the US, you wanna share why you groaned me? I'm reasonably fluent in Finnish with a Finnish husband so...I'd like an explanation for the drive-by groaning.
		 
			
			I'd have to agree with the dubbing of tv making a huge difference. My girlfriend whose level of english was quite basic when we met has already improved a lot with both vocab and understanding since we watch subtitled english shows.   
That said I find the overall level of english among students to be fairly high. That said, in Ireland if anyone can speak a second language it's considered a minor miracle.
		 
			
			isnt it also because the nordics have, due to their geographical proximity to the UK, British media on the airwaves? I thought you could watch british tv in Norway? it would make sense the nordics would be better at english than the swiss, theyre closer to them and have closer historical connections as well.   
Besides, the Swiss are still learning Hochdeutsch as their first foreign language, which they do admirably. I would say most german swiss are trilingual: dialect, hoch, then usually english. most of my colleagues at one point learned french to a certain degree as well.       
lol!   
""drive by groaning"". i like that!       
i do not mean to sound snarcy when i say this, but, doesnt irish count? most of the irish i know (granted not thaaaaat many) speak at least, uh, decent / conversational irish in addition to english.   
and the only person ive ever met who has completely mastered the oberbayerisch dialect of german who wasnt a native german speaker was also irish.
		    Another language on the already multilingual signs? Not a good idea.   
Anyway, I was in Texas last year and most of the signs in public places are bilingual English and Spanish. Yet not that many people (othr than recent immigrants) speak very much Spanish. So it doesn't work.
		 
			
			I agree with the comments about lack of exposure to the language. I certainly think we could improve, but it also has to be accepted that learning so many foreign languages (high German, French, English) is a struggle for the less linguistically talented.
		 
			
			Most of the Swiss I know speak English very well. I have never had problems in finding an English speaking shop assistant or whatever. Don't believe what all the pseudo-studies say. That is not to say I have not noticed how well Scandinavians are at foreign languages.
		    All Scandinavians I ever met were very good at English and fairly good at German so it is true that language teaching is good there. But compared to language skills in the countries surrounding it, Switzerland is definitely ahead.
		    Maybe she is Hungarian or Estonian and took offence to you saying they were close to Finished.
		    Tractor Queen might be a man.
		 
			
			No wonder  I work in international company but I did not hear a word of English. They have more attitude to me like I can but I won't. So they stay with the level of CAN, of course. All of them said to me, I should improve my German instead. So yeah, I improve my German but their English is going nowhere      Well, there is the tractor bar, Zetor, in Helsinki which is owned by Aki Kaurismaki and is usually full of Tractor Queens on any given night of the week...  Still, that wouldn't exactly explain the groaning.
		 
			
			It's hard to draw a general conclusion about English proficiency in Switzerland because of the variety of languages spoken.  According to the report, Italy is ranked 21st, France is ranked 17th, Switzerland is 11th and Germany is 8th.   
Perhaps Switzerland 'lagging' English proficiency has to with the large number of French and Italian native speakers.
		    I don't see any evidence that the language skills in those parts of the country are worse.   
On the contrary. The average Ticinese speaks way better German than the average Zürcher manages Italian.
		    That's true, but ask expats from Geneva how good the English of the average Swiss is.. I think the Swiss German part of CH is far ahead in that regard.
		    Not to be a prat or anything but how is your anecdotal evidence less of a 'pseudo-study' than someone else's survey?       I am not surprised at all. Until not too long ago, most Primary School teachers in their youth only had English somewhere in a minor place (only one year in Secondary School, etc) and so until a few years ago, even if able to read, write and speak English, were absolutely NOT in a position to TEACH the language. And look at Secondary Schools.  There (Canton of Zürich) generally were/are two ""parallel"" teachers, one with German, French and History etc and the other in charge with Mathematics, Geometry, Geography etc, and one of them whenever their two classes reached the 3rd year, had to give two lessons of English (or/and Italian), and to limit the number of students in these lessons, only those with an average of 4,5  (from 1,0 up to 6,0) were allowed to attend.  What we see now is the logical result, and in view of the mess described here not even really so bad after all. Rather better than I expected        This question has been on the table for years, and the answer is YES.  Average people in quite many fields here (export industry, tourism, gastronomy, transportation, insurance, banking) use English on a daily basis. To describe that as ""very limited"" simply is wrong.    
So that it even already HAS improved. In the 1970 and 80ies we in the aircargo-business had real problems with the newcomer-apprentices who only brought a minimal command of English with them, which was a disaster as English in this business is needed for almost everything permanently. When speaking with people in this field NOW, the problem is settled     
The question asked also was whether anybody here uses French on a daily basis. The answer is a clear and definite NO !   People however agreed that the French language learning system ought to be improved parallel to the English language learning system.  All good, except that some teachers may have problems to adapt.     
I give them some time. There is a new generation of teachers coming up who are better in French and much better in English than many of the older teachers.
		 
			
			What Wolli said. Most teachers barely speak English themselves, they are  professional English teachers, they are mostly just teachers who, among other subjects, also teach English.   
I am actually surprised that the obvious solution hasn't been proposed yet: 
a) we have a shortage of (qualified) teachers 
b) most English teachers are better at teaching sth else 
--> hire only qualified English teachers from abroad, Swiss teachers should need both a Proficiency A and a language teaching certificate.
		 
			
			Just to confirm what I said before. Learning a language does NOT have to cost much at all nor involve specific courses. Total immersion is the way- which is what I did when I went to London for 6 months in 1970. No contact with ex-pats, no Forums, books, newspapers or telly in MT - just absolute and total get on with it. It works, fast. Although I will concede that having to tackle 2 languages at the same time, Swiss German and High German is much harder.
		    The whole Rio Grande Valley (Texas side) is practically Spanish speaking. This already was so in 1982 and 88 and as I hear has expanded, and so applies also to aereas west and south of San Antonio.  While ""real"" Texans are not seriously into learning Spanish, doing such stunts will help them to drive the ""unwanted"" Yankees nuts        
Totally agree, but ... if they want to introduce English at primary school level, this would be far too expensive and unrealistic. One of the local primary school teachers has just done her Cambridge Intermediate cert to prepare for this. Totally agree that teaching at junior level requires an excellent level of fluency- but this just won't happen. For instance our local rural primary school could not afford to employ a specialist to teach a few hours a week. Maybe a peripatetic system would help.   
Mind you, having taught French (my mt) in the UK for 30+ years, I can assure you that the great majority of UK teachers who teach Mod Langs do not have good fluency and accent either- and having done so many exchanges with France, the level of teaching is very low too in general.

The Norwegians are best in regard to English, Danes and Finns far less BUT often suggested to shift to German which they spoke quite well, Swedes are not so good in English as the Norwegians and astonishingly many people even in Civil Aviation are not speaking either English nor German nor French.  Many Scandinavians I had on the phone were eager to demonstrate their respectable command of German     
I don't know about their French or Italian.      Quite to the contrary. The average command of Italian in the Canton of Zürich is sinking, since Italian was dropped out of the programs of the Secondary Schools some 20 years ago. I think that German and French were taught in parallel in the Ticino. So, if English is added, something needs to get reduced a bit.  Whatever, in regard to languages, the Ticino for a century was ahead of both the rest of Switzerland AND of Italy !      Only a very small number of teachers has the Cambridge Proficiency        The costs primarily are the result of the high costs of the BOOKS published by the schools. Many school-books in Switzerland are published by single Cantons, and only for the schools. This system is out of the times of Iwan the Terrible, but not out of modern times        So sorry, but ""want to introduce English at Primary School level"" ?  They already DID do so.  Here the status in Zürich   
// Englisch und Französisch 
              In der Primarschule werden erste grundlegende Kenntnisse in Englisch                und Französisch erworben. Mit der Einführung des Englischunterrichts                in der Primarschule wurde das Fach Französisch nicht abgebaut,                sondern im bisherigen Umfang beibehalten. Für die beiden Fächer                gelten die folgenden wöchentlichen Lektionendotationen:                                                                                                                                                     source:     
And the situation in most German speaking Cantons is similar, based on the Conferences of the Cantonal School leaders (Cantonal Education Ministers)     
I in spite of having participated in half a dozen public votes about the matter had to look things up   
psssst!  just corrected the writing mistake of the Cantonal chaps !     (wöchentlichen)
		 
			
			Well, you've said it before, Neuchatel lags a bit behind, lol.
		     
I agree that more English-language education is needed in this country...   
			
			I haven't been in a country where people would speak languages of different families as well as here, yet considered themselves mere ""intermediates"". I am not too worried about English in here, by the time kids are teens they speak it well, for most parts, or the other languages they picked that are being offered in schools here. My German is subpar now to my French, so when I am in the German speaking part now, everyone immediately assumes I am a French speaking Swiss who speaks bad German so everyone immediately switches to English. It's impressive.    
By the way, it is not a question on how early English gets introduced into primary. It is a question of are there really enough local and good English teachers in the system who could teach it. So, why attack the problem at the end of the algorithm, when it really needs to be addressed at the Haute Ecoles Pedagogiques, are there courses, are there profs, is it compulsory, how split does it make the generalists/specialists system, are those signing up for language/humanities specialization for secondary pushed also for English, or...It's more complicated than just introducing a language into the school. Somebody has to teach it. And well.
		    I'd love to meet these Irish speakers because of the people I know I could count  on one hand how many would be able to hold a proper conversation in Irish...and this was when they left school! I don't just mean a couple of words. If you consider that irish is mandatory from age 5 till 18 this is shocking. Irish is taught very very badly in Ireland though. English too to be fair, far too much focus on literature and not enough on the basics.
		     
so who wants to hire me? ;-P     
Secondary Education Degree + B1 German, probably by August B2 or C1 with a Graduate Certificate in English Teaching.
		    I agree, anyone who says most irish people are conversational in irish is frankly living in a dream world of leprechauns .  One thing I have noticed is how good the Swiss are at English becuase they work so hard at it. Lots of people (in Zug granted) seems to take lessons, attend night courses and have spent time working or studying abroad. They really work hard at it , which is more than most people do at Irish ( unsurprisingly). I think that's the difference at the end of the day.
		 
			
			The quality isn't quite what it should be, but at least they are trying to find a way. I'd be curious to know how the US scored on teaching foreign languages, same for France. 
Let's hope they don't procrastinate too long in changing their tactics now that there is a study pointing out how ineffective that is... seems that every other year, my kids' teachers get to take 5 weeks time in an Anglo Saxon country (on top of regular holidays)... I want to be a teacher too!
		    I think it really depends who you meet!  I'd have to say that most of the Irish people I know are well fluent in Irish - then again I met them mostly in Irish-language settings so they  , wouldn't they?  Same goes if you spend all your holidays on the Aran Islands or somewhere, or maybe have relatives or in-laws who live in the Gaeltacht or are great enthusiasts.     
It's also hard to tell as a non-speaker of a language whether people are truly spontaneously ""conversational"" in it or just remembering some canned sentences from school.  (Which, hey, if you can have a conversation with 'em...)    
Most Irish people's Irish is better than my French, put it that way, but not altogether the level you'd hope from 5 years of schooling let alone 12. So yeah, perhaps not the shining model for Switzerland to emulate.
		 
			
			There is of course a big rural/town divide. Around here in the sticks, the proportion of those who speak English at a fair level are very few indeed. One is my OH from Surrey, and another a British lady from Herts and her Swiss husband. Then one girl who spent a year as an Au Pair in OZ, and me of course, I get by.  Most people here will speak some German or Swiss German though.
		    Yes, but in general their English isn't very good, also true of Italians, though it's certainly improved in the past 22 years I've been living down here.    
I've got one friend from Verona, known him since '88, he now speaks some passable English, but mainly because he has a lot of Russian clients and he doesn't speak Russian (he's a lawyer).     
In the old days, we had to use his then-wife as a translator, as she was a French-speaking Belgian, and I speak French, but now my Italian is fine, thanks to my current wife who speaks no English!    
Tom
		    In Finland our second language is Swedish, although most of the people here forgets/wants to forget that after the first courses. Hot topic in politics at Finland is getting rid of Swedish, but it will never happen   Most of the Finnish people writes pretty good english, but speaking is different thing. I am lacking pretty much on both of those       Everyone will, once you have your education recognized officially in this country and hold at least B2 in one of the local languages. You will not get a primary school post, maybe not a secondary, or any post that is expected to mix specialization (teaching a few subjects), but you could become specialized English teacher to fill in the gaps ""generalists"" can't teach, or easily in many language schools.
		 
			
			Having worked many years (since the late '90s) with Swedes and  Norwegians (and being married to a half-Norwegian) both here and on  their home turf, I've yet to meet one who speaks the other's language.   
As was explained to me, they each speak their own, and hope the other understands , as they are close, but if that fails, they switch to English!    
And that's how things work here in Ticino, each speaks their dialect,  hoping the other understands, and if that fails, they switch to Italian.     
Tom 		   
			
			What is so tragic, both here in CH and in France, that the oral element of language teaching is practically zilch. Grammar and loads of vocab lists- hardly conducive to getting kids interested. In the UK all 4 skills (listening and reading comp, writing and oral) all have equal value.
		    I was just one of the Zurich voters who, against the suggestions of the Cantonal government, voted in favour of new proposals in favour of English. I think I am not the only one of them who clearly realized that a lot of our teachers were miles away from ""being up to the job"". I and 100 thousands others were fully aware of the facts above, but we all knew that it HAD to be done. In view of realities, rank 11 is not so bad, and I think it is rank 11 out of more than 20. Who t.f. thinks that Switzerland has a subscription to ranks 1 to 10 ?  I mean, Swiss TV announcers do not hesitate to say ""skier A....  B....  arrived at the excellent 14th rank""    but apparently have a problem to say ""Switzerland got the top excellent 11th rank out of 24""     Add to this that they asked the ""adult population"" which means lot of people who like me only started to learn English a bit in class NINE and not before. And in our class we were lucky. Our teacher did not have any Cambridge Exams, but he was a real Anglophile who spent up to three weeks per year on vacation in England, And a charismatic teacher who had the ability to inspire folks. This for sure was not the fate of everybody !
		    Be aware of what you wish for, it might be replaced with Russian.. 
Kidding. The Finns speak English quite well, using a lovely ""s"" when the sound should be like ""sh"" as their trademark, or so I noticed.      That may be because the average Ticinese NEEDS to know German much more than the average Zürcher needs to know Italian. (Somebody correct me if I am wrong.)
		    Tragic ?  To me it back in October 1971, was really GOOD LUCK. I in spite of facing the final exams of apprenticeship decided in favour of taking holidays in the form of a holiday trip to Brussels, London, Dublin, London and Paris, and so right then improved my ORAL command of French and English. When entering the ""examining room"" of the Englishmen (Swiss people of course) I simply greeted them by ""Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen"" and spoke/discussed  about my holidays. They were impressed and gave me the maximum-note of 5.5. Next day in the morning when entering the ""examining room"" of the French (Swiss people again) I greeted them ""Bonjour mesdames et messieurs"" and discussed my holidays with them and got another 5.5. THIS saved me and so I passed with a 4.2 (min 4.0) in spite of the disastrous 2.0 in stenography. The details of that memorable holiday trip are still in my mind as if it had been just last week.
		 
			
			I don't live in Switzerland, so I can't really comment on this country with the same knowledge that you do---but I can ask questions. The question I have is this---is this really that big of a problem for Switzerland?   
Clearly if the Swiss genuinely believe that every Swiss citizen should be as fluent in English as their native canton's language, or most of the members of this forum, they have a lot of catching up to do. But the native languages of Switzerland---German, French, and Italian---are very useful in Europe and enable most Swiss to travel a good deal outside their country without needing English. Also, I can't argue with Swiss who would say it is more important to learn at least one of their fellow countrymen's languages before learning an outside language---no matter how useful that language is.   
While there is a very real language barrier that exists for English speakers who come to Switzerland, there are many Swiss who do speak English, particularly in the larger cities which have a lot of workers and visitors from many different countries. Yes, there are places like Schwyz where nobody speaks anything other than the local Swiss-German dialect. Obviously, the people in Schwyz don't think there is a problem with this. (In fairness to them, there are probably more Swiss who speak English in Schwyz than Americans who speak German in Derwood.) If they DID feel there was a problem, they would probably go about learning English for the same reason why Swiss in Ticino learn German---because they   to.   
Does Switzerland NEED more English-speaking Swiss, or is this like an extra car in the garage---something nice to have, but not absolutely necessary?
		 
			
			There is also another story that is not in the Local.  The Swiss adult scientific literacy rate is 16%.     
To be classified as ""scientifically literate,"" Miller said one must  be  able to understand approximately 20 of 31 scientific concepts and  terms  similar to those that would be found in articles that appear in  the  New York Times weekly science section and in an episode of the PBS   program ""NOVA."" 
Miller is the Hannah Professor of integrative studies at MSU. He has   appointments in the Division of Mathematics and Science Education and   the Department of Political Science   
Miller believes that 28% (USA) is ""insufficient for the requirements of a modern democracy.""          Well atleast Russia is nowadays doing fine when comparing to for example EU or U.S area       You can see the real truth when watching rally driver Tommi Mäkinen interview:    
Although Tommi has been improving his skills over the years, something like that is mainly how we speak    
I did not have many changes to speak English at Switzerland, but those who did speak English were really fluent in it.
		    No, they have no need of German. Why would they, except for the rare trip up north?   
Many, such as my wife, don't speak ANY German, French is far more likely as it is the first language they learn (after Italian), German 3rd, English 4th.   
When I first came to Ticino, I got away with French, as I spoke almost no Italian.   
Tom
		    Or French, which is why, when my kids speak French, they have an Italian accent (but not when speaking English, then they have a CanAm accent).   
Tom
		     
who knows, perhaps after one academic year i could end up teaching english combined with my original subject specialisation - History and Business! Once my german is up to scratch :-)
		    A)  the BIG problem for Switzerland, in the past and now, was and is that Swiss people (I speak about German speaking Switzerland) HAD to do languages in order to cope. Be it for transit-travellers, for guests, as business-travellers or as soldiers in foreign service.  The languages changed over the centuries, and you when looking into history will see that Switzerland often ""lagged behind"" a bit, which however was not a disaster   
B)  Nobody believes that people ought to be ""fluent"" in English, the general idea however is that people ought to understand English and be able to ""communicate"" acceptably in English. And so, English in the past 25 years was gradually upgraded. It now in the Canton of Zürich is taught already in the second primary class, and French only up from the 5th class. Those who profited from that are now still less than 20 years old and hardly in a survey of ""adult people"". A lot of the adult population here grew up when English in schools was only taught in a marginal way and so will have a minimal level of English or none. If you have a look at the ""age structure"" in Switzerland, you will realize that the above 50 generation is in an overwhelming majority. Those folks should have asked the 15 to 30 years old population and the result would have been different   
C)  Do not be mistaken by some ""reports"" on EF about places like Schwyz. People tell you in 10'000 words that those policemen did not speak English or French or Italian.  Beside the point that they of course DO speak either English or French or both,  the simple fact is that POLICE does NOT speak ""ausländisch""     
D)  A personal note about Italian. I never learnt Italian in school. I learnt a good deal when on yearly holidays, not least as I was THE interpreter for my older brother who out of principle did NOT speak ""ausländisch"", and later on when being enroute alone was regarded as a ""Native"" and expected to understand the language. I still cannot really participate in discussions but can communicate sufficiently in Italian to get along. THIS is the level people from Zürich should try to attain in French, English and Italian, at least as far as possible

			The far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP) has claimed to have gathered enough support to push for a referendum aimed at ""stopping mass immigration"", which could have implications for the country's bilateral deal with the EU.         
			
			It's such a shame....
		    The Local? Yes, we know, but they own the place.
		 
			
			According to the article "" At the end of August 31, 2011, foreigners living in Switzerland numbered 1.751 million, making up 22.3 percent of the country's 7.9 million-strong population.""     So assuming unemployment is around 3% if they send the foreigners home who make up 22% of the population then 19% (20%-3%) of the jobs will be vacant with no possibility to fill them.     Wonder how this country can function with around 1 in 5 jobs vacant &amp; no possibility to fill them?   Put this on the daft ideas stack!      Well as much as many of us may dislike SVP, noone is about to send home all the foreigners - not even Blocher and his hillibilly friends.
		 
			
			Ok, this vote is again a smart strategy and has in fact very little to do with immigration at all!   
Switzerland has signed into the Schengen treaty, which allows the free movement of it's citizens around the treaty area. So in principle could one day say all Austrians stand up and decide that the mountains in Switzerland are much nicers... and the Swiss could not do anything against it.   
Before the treaty was the SVP fear mongering like mad - we will all be swamped by Polish workers and all lose our jobs. Didn't happen. But this does not stop them from trying to kill the Schengen membership anyway - because it's a pseudo-religious political agenda not based on facts or numbers. As there would not be a majority in parliament to do something unlogical and frankly bad for the Swiss economony - especially in the current situationa - the SVP uses once again the referendum as a tool.    
They make up some unreasonable claim (there is no mass-immigration right now, is there?) and bombard the masses with posters. Worked with the minarets so there is a decent chance it will work again. And the SVP cannot lose: 
- if they lose the vote, they can from then on blame anything on the opposition. And they are very unlikely to lose in a landslide, so if you have some 40+% you can still claim that you alone represent nearly half of the Swiss voters who all don't want to be part of Schengen. 
- if they win, the   of their text would mean that the Swiss government would have to cancel the Schengen treaty. Then it depends what happens next: 
     - Schengen treaty is cancelled; Very unlikely in my eyes as all other parties are aware of the benefits Switzerland enjoys right now and the potential repercussions. But if it happens, the SVP is the big winner. 
     - Schengen treaty is not cancelled: The SVP can (somehow righfully) claim that ""those in Berne"" don't respect a democratic vote. They, who set up misleading strategies to trick voters into electing stuff they don't understand can stand up and resent themselves as the true democratic power in this country. A fairly likely scenario.   
The SVP has pulled this trick multiple times over the last years and again and again was the legal system outsmarted - there are authorities in place that have the duty to make sure that referendums are clear, transparent and for example do not break any international laws (like the ""criminal foreigner"" vote did...). They should reject the proposed text and tell the SVP that if they want to quit Schengen they should come up with a honest and direct text on topic instead of a smoke-screen that taps into some vague xenophobic fears again.
		 
			
			I always thought (and am too lazy/busy to check an EU website or even wikipedia) Schengen was for freedom of movement, and has nothing to do with right of residence?  So loads of 'foreigners' could not just come and legally settle here.   
BTW saw in 20 minutes this morning that 2 Kosovars are taking the SVP to court over a SVP ad used in their ""Gegen Masseneinwanderung"" campaign (""Kosovaren schlitzen Schweizer auf!"", roughly ""Kosovos slashing/slitting Swiss people's throats!"").
		    A) Well, AFAIK does the often called ""freedom of movement"" spell out as ""Right of Union citizens and their family members to move   freely within the territory of the Member States"".      
B) While I can fully understand the two Kosovars and really agree with them to the fullest: How about you wait till the elections and bring the SVP to court then? Right now all they got was some free PR for the SVP - and 20 minutes being once again the incompetent press organ: They write an entire article on the two guys full of valid points. Yes, a good journalist obviously lets both sides have a say. But you don't let one make some unbalanced statement at the end of the article and leave it uncommented... So what was the result? The critizised SVP campaign is once more pictured on the 20min.ch pretty prominently and for free. Everyone who reads the article will basically remember the last sentence saying ""Foreigners are far over average in the crime statistic"". Well done. If I wouldn't know that they are usually incompetent, I'd assume the paper was biased.
		    Schengen and ""freedom of movement"" are two different matters . The Schengen treaty abolished the border controls between countries that are part of the Schengen area and established a common external border. Switzerland joined Schengen in 2004. So if you cross the border between Switzerland and Germany today, you will no longer be checked.   
""freedom of movement"" , as you wrote above, gives you the right to establish residence and work in an other member state or associated country such as Switzerland.   
the ""freedom of movement"" is part of the bilateral agreements concluded between the EU and Switzerland and entered into force in 2002. The introduction of free movement has given rise to a considerable influx of foreign workers, which wasn't preticted by most experts at the time. The Swiss population has grown by about a million people since EU Citizens are entitled to establish residence in Switzerland. Most economist argue that Switzerland has benefited from this influx but it's a matter of hot debate.
		 
			
			One could argue that Swiss government was a little naive to have signed such a bilateral employment agreement with the EEC especially as they were not under pressure to from the EEC.   
It probably seemed a good idea at the time when the economy was booming artificially but they will probably regret it and would not be surprised if they change this bilateral agreement. 
We will probably see USA and countries in the EEC also trying to change the rules (possibly pulling out of the EEC) as Free Trade doesn't really exist and never will whether goods or people.
		    I think you are jumping to conclusions here. Most people don't come to Switzerland because of some treaty - they come here because they are offered a job. If the Swiss economy didn't do so well during the last two decades there would not be an influx.  
Foreign workers do not dump Swiss salaries (there was an interesting special on ""the Germans in Zurich"" in Tagesanzeiger before showing how much MORE we earned...) and given the low unemployment is all the ""they are taking our jobs"" shouting complete rubbish.   
And just for the record: There surely was a referendum on the freedom of movement. Not just once as the SVP tried again and again to find a majority for their position. 
- The Swiss voters said yes to the idea in 2000 (67,2% yes votes) 
- The Swiss voters extended it to the ""new EU countries"" in 2005 
- The Swiss voters extended it to Bulgaria and Romania in 2009       
But hey, I am sure as soon as the SVP once wins, they'll ignore the first three votes and don't see a need for future referendums either anymore       I don't think I'm jumping to any conclusions. The population statistics show a sharp increase in net immigration since the introduction of the free movement of persons. A lot of foreigen companies haved moved their offices to Switzerland since 2002 as they can now benefit from the huge EU-labour market and the low taxes at the same time. This resulted in a considerable rise of the demand for labour in Switzerland.    
I didn't say in my post before that the free movement of persones is necessarily a bad thing. It has helped to galvanize a stagnant economy and to stabilize our welfare institutions. But it also put a considerable strain on our infrastructure. And I'm also not sure if a net immigration of 50'000 to 100'000 people every year is really sustainable for such a small country in the long run.    
Obviously the Swiss people accepted the introduction of the free movement of persons. They didn't really have choice. All the bilateral agreements are connected. If Switzerland had rejected the principle of free movement of persons, the EU could have canceled under the so-called guillotine-clause the entire body of treaties between the EU and Switzerland, leaving the Swiss economy in huge mess.
		     
About ""The population statistics show a sharp increase in net immigration since the introduction of the free movement of persons."" Do you have a link to these statistics?   
I do not find any statistics that show ""show a sharp increase in net immigration since the introduction of the free movement of persons""   
To me it looks like the yearly increase has been pretty steady for the last 30 years, see link   
Also where do you get the figure ""a net immigration of 50'000 to 100'000 people every year"", around 50,000 is more realistic, also see link         It just goes to show that Americans, Australians and New Zealanders are not the problem.     
ña ña ña ña ña
		     
I was refering in my post to net immigration as whole, not just from the EU. In 2008 net immigration was more than 100'000.   
Source: see excel file: Wanderung der ständigen Wohnbevölkerung:    
But maybe I was wrong to blame the free movement of persons: the stats also show that Switzerland experienced similiar waves of immigration in the sixties and early 90's when foreigners still needed a residence permit in order to work in Switzerland. Probably a certain unease stems from the fact that Switzerland has partly lost its means to control immigration as EU-citizens have now the right to settle in Switzerland.
		    Only when they are offered a job, and if you were around EF for a longer time, judging by the number of people looking for a job in this country you could have noticed it is not an easy thing to get.  
So maybe those evil companies should stop hiring horrible foreigners and then do Switzerland a favour and get the h*** out of this country.       Sorry, your link does not work for me. I would like to see this because according to the Bundesamt the total number of foreigners increases around 50,000 per year   
According to the graph from the Bundesamt (attached) I do not see any sudden increased waves of immigration since 1980.
		 
			
			Funny considering I was just reading an article from The Local (don't shoot me  ) about Swiss Railways being totally understaffed and essentially bribing their employees to help find workers....and they're even recruiting from abroad.   
Maybe we can blame immigrants / expats for overloading the railway system thus making it necessary to find extra workers. BAH!
		    Daft comments stack more likely. Not a single party (even the far right Swiss Democrats) wants to send all foreigners home, not sure where you got that from. It's about limiting further growth, not sure what you want to say with your calculations.
		    No you cannot as foreigners all drive SUVs. And increase the rents. And at the same time offer to work for dumping salaries. There would not be any global warming either without them.
		    Totally agree with this. One thing that annoys me is that in the foreigner debate all issues get mixed together. For exampe for this initiative they were advertising with the story about 2 Kosovorans stabbing a SVP guy. This has absolutely got nothing to do with the subject.  
Firstly they're already here. An initiative which restricts people coming here can't do anything about the ones here. 
Secondly thanks to the expulsion initiative people like these will be automatically expelled anyway 
Thirdly the initiative is aimed at the bilateral contracts with the EU. As Kosovo is in it, Kosovoans won't be affected by this vote anyway.   
Another example is that the SVP has said they have no problem with highly qualified foreigners coming here. This is mostly aimed at those foreigners working for dumping wages. Yet these highly qualified foreigners are the ones forcing the Swiss out of Citys. The solution of the SVP is to       Precisely. A scapegoat is a scapegoat. You don't get to say, well, the rich scapegoats are ok while the poor ones have to go....I'd mention a country to the North in the late 1930s who chose a particular group to scapegoat for all that ailed the country and then moved forward with that propaganda without picking only a certain kind of that group out for being ok, but I don't want to invoke Godwin.   
The SVP is extreme, but they are using a well worn tactic by all such extreme groups by tapping into fear which is easily motivated by making a group of easily identifiable people to blame. It will be interesting to see just how far they get if the measure passes.
		    About ""Not a single party (even the far right Swiss Democrats) wants to send all foreigners home, not sure where you got that from""   
I got this from an SVP advert on ""Masseinwanderung stoppen"" on 16th October (Sunday Blick, 16th Oct. page 26.) which states ""Damit ihre Kinder nicht die einzigen Schweizer in der Klasse sind"" 
I understand this means something like ""consequently your children are  not the only Swiss in the class"".  I do not see how this status can be achieved without sending foreigners home?  Can you explain? 
If less foreigners come into the country in future it will not reduce the number of foreign children in todays classes; it could do in the future but this is does not achieve what the advert promises now.   
About ""not sure what you want to say with your calculations"" Sorry but if you do not understand simple arithmetic that is not my problem.
		    About ""In 2008 net immigration was more than 100'000.""   
no it was not - please quote your source with a working link. 
BTW, you should not be looking at statistics about ""   
You should look for statistics about ""ausländische Wohnbevölkerung ""   
""ausländische "" means foreigners        I was talking about net immigration (=Wanderungssaldo) in my post, which was 98'200 in 2008. if we are only talking about foreigners it was even 103'400 as more Swiss left the country than returned.   
You will find the stats on the bfs-site: bfs/themen/bevölkerung/bevölkerungsbewegung/Indikatoren/wanderungen
		    Seems the net number of foreigners in Switzerland fell in 2009 & 2010 & only rose by 3% in 2011.   
This aligns better with my interpretation of the bfs numbers than yours?     
See last paragraph        No, not at all. Net immigration dropped from a peak of 98'200 in 2008 to 74'600 in 2009 and 64'900 in 2010. Now net immigration has risen again to 75'000 in 2011.   
I wrote ""  "" So the immigrations figures on bfs-website square exactly with what I said.
		 
			
			SVP will keep all black people here in Swaziland to promote the multikulti look. All white banker foreigners should be worried right about now. Later white foreigners       according to the bfs 
2007 1602093 foreign citizens lived in Switzerland 
2008 1669715  
2009 1,714,004  
2010 1,766,277  
2011 1,772,279
		     
This figures won't tell you much about net immigration. Don't forget that the number of foreigners living in Switzerland doesn't rise more sharpely due to fact that thousands of foreigners obtain Swiss citizenship every year.   
I don't understand why can't find the right figures on the bfs-website. Unfortunately the direct link doesn't work. Just go to Bevölkerung/Bevölkerungsbewegung/Indikatoren: It's the table on top of the page, third column ""Wanderungssaldo"".
		    Erm, well, I claim the opposite: The number is only so high because it is so difficult to get the citizenship. In order to do so does one have to live in the same village for many years - something that made sense in the 50s but does not reflect todays society with much more regular job changes anymore... and then you need to have an acceptable nationality and family name or the locals might still reject you.   
The number of naturalizations is actually declining (according ot 20min yesterday...). The people who most wanted as Swiss passport are Non-EU immigrants or to say it more directly the refugees from former Yugoslavia. They got it by now. The others have little to no incentive to get a Swiss passport.
		    I think you missed the point. I know that it's relatively difficult to get Swiss citizenship and the percentage of foreigners in Switzerland would be lower if we had naturalisations laws similar to the ones in our neighbouring countries. But even with these tough nationalisation requirements in place, there're several thousands of new Swiss every year. Therefore that annual change in numbers of foreigners living in Switzerland doesn't correspond with net immigrations. So the figures Marton qouted won't tell you how many people entered or left Switzerland.
		    I've seen SVP ranting within the Business Groups of LinkedIn. 
As a newcomer immigrant I shall be watching closely.
		     
I asked the bfs to explain the difference between your (higher) numbers & my lower numbers.   
They kindly sent me a spread sheet which shows that your net migration figure includes people who are already here but change status the ""Statuswechsel von der nicht-ständigen zur ständigen ausländischen Wohnbevölkerung"" 
These people make up between 35% & 95% of the the net migration figure depending on which year you look at & account for the difference we see.   
So the number of new people entering the country by crossing the border each year is my (lower) number.
		    Thanks for the info. I didn't know that. I still maintain tough that the change in numbers of foreigners living in Switzerland doesn't correspond to net immigration, simply because arround 40'000 foreigners get Swiss citizenship every year.   
I also think you can only discount the people who have change their status from ""non-permanent"" to ""permanent"" if they entered Switzerland before 2002, i.e. the introduction of the free movement of persons. So if somebody entered Switzerland in 2004 as a ""non-permanent"" and changed his status in 2006, there's no reason to exclude him from the statistics. His presence is just recorded statistically two years after his entry.
		     As long as we can agree on the facts (in so much as statistics represent facts) feel free to interpret the numbers however best suits your case.     Interesting decision today  "" Italy violated international human rights laws when it intercepted migrants adrift in the Mediterranean in 2009 and returned them to Libya, the European court of human rights has ruled.   Italian authorities returned them by ship to Tripoli, where they were handed over to Libyan authorities without efforts to identify them, screen them or offer them asylum procedures.""  Seems possible this SVP proposal could conflict with this ruling &amp; Switzerland has since a long time signed up to the European court of human rights   "	35	SVP claims support for anti-migrant vote	2716

			They could try putting some newspaper recycling points on the stations for all the free papers. That seems to be the most of the litter on the trains.   
Having said that they should take the train from London to Dover to see real littering, and graffiti, and puke...    
			
			The train I rode on from Manchester to Liverpool was very clean and comfy.
		    That train averages 35mph over completely flat ground and costs £1 for each 2 miles travelled.   
I guess the least it can do is be clean and comfy, as it's a pretty dire service otherwise       Really? I thought ThomasT was using irony. British humour is too famous, it prevents Brits to be understood literally when they mean to.       Funnily enough, I think it's ThomasT who's the Swiss guy (correct me if I'm wrong), and it's me who's the Brit!     
Maybe I've spent so long here that my ironymeter needs recalibration.  My expectations of a train service have certainly been recalibrated (upwards) here.

			Swiss billionaire Stephan Schmidheiny, sentenced in absentia to 16 years on Monday by an Italian court in a landmark asbestos trial, is a self-styled philanthropist and champion of sustainable development.            But I regard Bill Gates as a famous innovator.  What they share is being rich, but otherwise, the cement industrialist and the ""super innovator"" do not have much in common
		 
			
			I'll stick my neck out on this one. I wouldn't call him the 'Swiss Bill Gates' either. Didn't he inherit his 'start capital' from his father?   
But before we throw too many stones in his direction, does anyone know of the REAL history of the cement story as it actually happened? Without the benefit of hind-sight? I haven't looked for links but maybe someone else knows of something.   
I can well understand that the folk want a scapegoat - they have all suffered far too much. It is a truly horrific story with dreadful consequences. But where did Stephan Schmidheiny get the firm from? If he bought it, why? How much money did he make out of it? When did he start implementing better safety measures? What else could he have done? Closed the place down? Permanently? Till the safety measures were set up?    
Any ideas?   
Edit: a bit late but I have now read the article. I didn't read it to begin with as I had already read the news in the Swiss daily papers this morning.  
The article linked here tells how he took over Eternit but still gives no information about time lapse between knowledge of the danger of asbestos and the beginning of changes in safety precautions. Answers to my other questions would still interest me.
		 
			
			I want to believe that The Local comes up with its headlines just for the lulz here. I really want to believe that.
		    The Local didn't give him the title. Forbes did   
'In 2009, Forbes magazine titled an article on Schmidheiny ""The Bill Gates of Switzerland,"" a reference to his membership of an elite club of donors, including Gates and Warren Buffet, who have given away $1 billion or more.'   
Or so The Local says they did.
		 
			
			asbestos fiber (of certain lengths) was known to be very hazardous as early as the 1930's, although many companies kept the information from the general public until much later.  certainly by the mid 1970's the dangers were widely known.  the press reports suggest that Eternit switched to non-asbestos fiber additives in the mid to late 1980's, so this sort of judgment is likely more ""guilt of the fathers"" than the actual guilt of those subject to the judgment.   
really no winners in this sort of situation, the world of asbestos litigation is absolutely horrible.

		    Maybe they get discount            Would it have sounded more intriguing if it was ""11 single Irish male refugees housed in brothel""

			With the Swiss looking likely to reject an initiative extending paid holiday time to six weeks, politicians and academics believe a mixture of fear and Calvinism are keeping workers off the beach.             
			
			this actually made me laugh out loud.  I'm pretty sure the Calvinists would be turning over in their grave over one week's vacation, if the debate is whether or not to go to 6 weeks then worries about Calvinism went out the window quite a while ago.
		 
			
			I wouldn't mind granting The Local some extra weeks of vacation.
		 
			
			The guy in the photo is both sleeping and drinking coffee at the same time.  Good example of time management but not very productive.     
Sums up ... well, fill in whatever you like there    
			
			Wait... they don't want 6 weeks of paid holiday but they still want the world to keep the doors shuttered on Sundays?  I wish they'd make up their minds.
		 
			
			So  , we read: Then  , we read: An enormous change of heart by 18% of those polled in the course of a few weeks?  Or polling error?  I don't know about you, but I'm inclined to think that maybe it's the poll?
		    Unfortunately,  these are the guys that get good performance ratings
		    Oh my what a terrible terrible article. They even have to interview a professor of history to explain an economics 101 question.    
The extra two weeks are not FREE and nothing to do with psyche. The employer pays wages from a budget that is already fixed and limited. Extra holidays, higher pension, less hours etc are all deducted from this budget, therefore a worker gets nothing 'free' - but they merely forgo cash for benefits in kind. These benefits are eventually either deducted from their pay (i.e. workers get lower wages) or shifting the salary of a future employee to themselves (i.e. a new employee that now no longer gets hired - the swiss fear in this case). The same principle applies with the pension in wages. You DONT get extra pension component added to your salary, it is merely deducted from your already earned salary.   
The fact the initiative hasnt got many supporters shows that the Swiss are quite clued up about these things.
		    There's a difference between working hard and working smart. The Swiss people I've worked with don't seem to understand that. Tüchtig"" is not the same as productive, especially if the work isn't done correctly. Nor is laboring an hour over a task that can be done in 15 minutes time well spent.       What's to fear if it results in a decrease in the immigration rate?      Yes we've also had several discussions about this here in my office.   The non-Swiss are right on board with the ""work smarter, not harder"" ethos, but the Swiss and the Americans are all about the gratuitous ""look at me! I worked a 15 hour day and have no life!"" attitude.
		    That can depend very much on who you are married to       Dude, your mind is in the gutter     I'm talking about at work, on the job, tasks at the office, not ""private"" stuff       Whats a 'new employee' got to do with immigration?     
1. Plenty of new people (i.e. apprentices, uni students, previous hausfrau's etc etc) enter the workforce every year.   
2. There are plenty of people losing their jobs around Switzerland who need/want to re-enter the workforce.   
3. Besides, if a person wishes to work and contribute by entering the workforce, then it helps to have that option there as opposed to the opposite. i.e. no one strives to increase the unemployment rate just to impact the immigration rate    
4. Relevance of the rate of immigration to the number of holidays for Swiss employees = close to zero

			Shocking I agree, but exactly the same happens in private clinics in the US and the UK, and probably in most parts of the world. If you are ever interested check the specialism and experience independently first. Any general surgeon can perform breast enlargement.
		    The thing is that I wouldn't expect it to happen in Switzerland. That is why I am so surprised. US, UK, France, Italy, Turkey, Spain, well yes.
		    It's actually standard in some medical degrees to be trained in breast augmentation (i.e. breast reconstruction following mastectomy).
		 
			
			The title is a bit sensational - as it almost sounds as though non qualified docs (eg non qualified at all) perform breast enhancement. They all have to be qualified doctors and specialised in surgery to do so, but not necessarily be specialist plastic surgeons.

Tom
		    I don't claim it, I said I am surprised if it is the case. In all the countries I lived, Switzerland was by far the best health care experience I had. And I believe the Swiss are very strict with regulations, why my surprise if lack of it.
		 
			
			Apparently, plastic surgery is not strongly regulated (in Switzerland) I think someone brought this up in another thread.  I know that specifically regarding breast surgery that gynecologists are trained to do most mastectomies and lumpectomies, although I don't know about reconstruction. Perhaps most cosmetic procedures are not covered under the basic insurance, so the regulation isn't that strong (in Switzerland).
		 
			
			Agreed, the point I made is that this is not specific to CH, and is the same in the UK or US.

Quote from NY Times:                           
               After moving from New York to Los Angeles in 2010 to take a job with a  financial services firm, Joan, now 59, believed she needed to freshen  her look. So she got a face-lift and   from a board-certified doctor in Beverly Hills.                   
 This week: The sound of the 1880s; wolves versus moose in northern Michigan; and watch where you get that nose job.      Podcast: Science Times         
    What she did not realize was that his certification was in otolaryngology — ear, nose and throat — not  . The outcome was less than ideal: thick scars on her temples and a wavy abdomen.         
 “I had to use all my savings to get a real plastic surgeon to fix what  he did to me,” said Joan, who asked that her last name be withheld to  protect her privacy. “I have an M.B.A. I’m not stupid. But when the  doctor has a nice clinic and all those diplomas and certifications on  the wall, you think he knows what he’s doing.”         
 With declining insurance reimbursements, more doctors, regardless of  specialty, are expanding their practices to include lucrative cosmetic  procedures paid for out of pocket by patients. It’s now common to find  gynecologists offering  , ophthalmologists doing  , even family practice physicians giving   injections.   
Unquote. Several GP practices where I used to live in the uK have (trained) receptionists doing Botox, and so does our dentist. General surgeons also do enhancements, especially in private practice.
		    Sorry for going a little off topic, but...   
The perception of Switzerland as a heavily regulated country is based on an awful lot of myth. The truth is rather that due to the absence of clearly stated  easily fathomable rules and regulations, and laws without gaping loopholes, civilians seem to take it upon themselves to police anything and everything. That gives the false impression that everyone is rather orderly and the country is some sort of pantheon of perfection.   
Switzerland is for example, one of the few places in Europe (if not the only) where it is,or up until recently was legal for children to work as prostitutes - due to inadequate legislation. A lot of regulations also seem to be underpinned by the catch-the-uninformed-offernder-out but then allow them to pay their way -  a rather mercenary focus.    
Switzerland has also been on the Disputed Transparency Index for a long time due to this general penchant for regulatory loopholes/laxness and propensity for financial crimes.   
However much the tourism board and inordinately proud locals would like to promote Switzerland as a pristine, crime-free, perfect Utopia where everything works smoothly and all the inhabitants enjoy the best quality of life on earth, that is simply far from true.
		 
			
			I'd say that medicine in CH is much less regulated than in the UK for instance. Surgeries/Offices are more luxurious, doctors have all sort of equipment a UK GP could never afford if working for the NHS, and consultation times are longer (not necessarily because it is necessary for a good diagnosis). For instance I have a school friend who, aged 59, decided to switch from being a orthopedic surgeon to being a GP. This would not have been possible at all in the UK, where a 3 year specific programme on top of basic studies in internship, is required, for instance including 9 months approx of supervised practice (such an unfortunate word).
		    They aren't.   
Maybe the German speakers are, but who cares about them!    
Tom
		 
			
			This seems to be the thread to share a funny story from my early teens which I don't think I've told anyone before. Back in the 90s when the plastic surgery industry (as we know it now) was just taking off, the papers were full of stories of women getting boob jobs. And there were pictures and interviews and expert opinions, and also a lot written about how expensive these operations were: thousands and thousands of pounds, lots of money back then.   
Every now and then my mum would send me to the chemist to pick up medicine for a sick sibling and I would look at the top shelf behind the chemist counter and see these things called ""breast pumps"" up there. I was probably only 13 or 14 at the time but I'd think, why on earth would a woman get a boob job done for five grand, when she can nick into the chemist and pick up one of these handy breast pumps for 30 quid?!    
It was maaaany, many years later that I realised that these breast pumps at the chemist were not used by women to jump from a B-cup to a D-cup.   
haha
		    Why does that surprise you? Given the lack of regulations this country has across the board, I'd be surprised if it would even meet the EU standards.
		    Is that you Lib ??
		    Thanks for debunking this scam! It has been my hope for a long time, that the Swiss tourism board and proud locals one day will find a more honest way to portray Switzerland and will also put light on the bad sides. E. g. like californian tourism agencies praise drive by shootings, crackheads and toxic waste dumps ...
		      Oh Falcy, it's the weekend and you replied rather early in the morning so you do have an excuse for using sarcasm as a form of wit.  Relax and wait until Monday to start splittling hairs.   
My point was not that the Tourism Board and super proud locals shouldn't ""do their job"" etc but rather that the fruit of their labour is hugely at odds with reality. However if you really want to be pedantic, it is not at all ususual to find tourist guides for other countries with ""guidelines"" for naive visitors.    
Perhaps there are a few ostriches lurking about who have no idea of the dangers beneath the glitter of places like California, London and NY, but they are few and far between.

			I say f**k the vultures... all of them.
		 
			
			When the US threatens to beat you up if you don't give him your milk money, you might cower.     
But when France, Germany or Britain do it... you have to laugh.
		 
			
			Can you explain why? It's not military might that the Swiss would be afraid of so that leaves financial clout and ease of access to markets?   
I have no evidence to back this up but surely Europe (or more precisely the EU) is a more important market for Switzerland than the US?   
That said maybe you are refering to the complete lack of teeth that the EU normally has in which case I guess you're right.
		 
			
			Very simple reason, the US is the world's undisputed economic, cultural, political and military combined superpower, it can speak with one voice and, if the political will is mustered (easier to do on taxes in this current fiscal and economic climate), it can definitely get things done the way it wants (including extending many US laws worldwide, like it or not). I am not condoning or supporting this (actually I think many aspects of it sucks as I have to file and pay US taxes while abroad as a result of it), but I am just stating the reality.   
What would keep you up at night the most?    
-Threats of getting blacklisted by the US Treasury Department or getting indicted by the Justice Department?   
-Similar threats from countries like the UK, Germany, etc...?
		    the Swiss couldn't care less about any of what you listed above.  the simple fact is that the US is already very effective in chasing and taxing foreign income earned by US corporations (and individuals, too, btw).  generally speaking, US corporations therefore do not use Switzerland as a tax haven for their domestic income.  those same corporations do, however, use Switzerland as a tax haven for more or less all of their European income.  the countries here in Europe being pinched the hardest by the current economic climate are now making more and more noise about chasing and taxing income streams run through Switzerland but ""earned"" outside of Switzerland.   
the simple fact is that Switzerland has more to lose by further opening its kimono to the EU, and it will therefore fight the EU harder than it did (and does) the US.
		    Hate them or love them, right or wrong, but at least the US has the balls to execute their threats unlike the EU or many other nations.   
Just look at the Greece situation and you understand my point. The US would not allow these games to be played with them. The EU....that is a different story.

			A napping commuter passenger caused disruptions to 176 trains on Tuesday day when he pulled the emergency brake after missing his stop.             
			
			JFC! i hope they catch this dumbass and fine the bejeezus out of him for being a narcissistic a-hole.
		 
			
			My wife was complaining about the trains on her way to work yesterday... now I know why...    
I, too, hope they catch this individual and fine him.  Additionally, he should have to reimburse everyone that suffered a financial loss due to the delay (missed meetings, etc).  I know he probably doesn't have enough money for this, but its the principle of the matter...
		 
			
			Yesterday was a total disaster on the trains but I still don't get why a 200m cable would fall to the ground because of the emergency brake (N.B. I'm no engineer!)
		 
			
			A fine system they got here. One train suddenly stops and the whole of Switzerland just grinds to a halt.
		    Are you talking about The Local?
		    Surprisingly, not this time.  I actually found this article interesting.        Because of Zurich's central location in Switzerland, and Western Europe, delays at Zurich can ripple through the European rail network and impact schedules in many other countries.  Or so I once read...
		     
interesting it is. This sentence was most interesting:      That must be a record of nonsenscal writing even for The Local.   
What exactly does it mean when when several different types of current cross? The remark is nonsensical by the way because all lines diverging from Schlieren are AC electrified so the ""types of current"" are all the same.
		    I haven't been following the case in question (I'm one of those poor guys who spend most of their time working), but I assume the spot where the engine stopped was right on a  . It separates two sections that are fed from different sources.    
If the pantograph of the loco stops exactly on the insulator, depending on the switch mode of the section, it can cause a short circuit between the neighboring sections. At 15,000 Volt, that can melt the entire overhead wiring in a fraction of a second. It just drips down in nice, red drops, long before a fuse can trip.    
Granted, that's not ""different types of current."" It's current from different sections. Very heavy current, at that. We can't expect journalists to have a degree in electric engineering. For once (and ONLY for once) I'd cut   some slack.    
LiB, at least this country has a working train transportation system. A single incident doesn't mean much. Sh1t happens. In the country that once flew to the Moon, I have to travel 250 miles in order to board a train, and that's two trains in each direction. Per day, not per hour.
		    Yes, but in that same country, one can more likely afford their own personal vehicle to use on the generally excellent roadways, rendering train travel somewhat redundant.
		    If that is what happened (which I still doubt) I'm afraid they're barking up the wrong tree when blaming a sleepy passenger for this. The train could have stopped in precisely that position for any number of reasons (including a legitimate use of the emergeny brake) and thus I would suggest the section breaker was of faulty construction as that sort of thing just shouldn't happen. Drivers should avoid stopping under section breakers, but if it does happen the worst possible consequence should be that the train is stopped and needs another train to push it back into a live section.    
However, I don't think that is what happened as a section breaker should be sufficiently long that a pantograph cannot touch both ends simultaneously. Otherwise there would be a brief short circuit every time a train passed. Anyway, on other forums right now there are speculations that there was no sleepy passenger but that the driver invented this story to cover his own incompetence.      Well, if a journalist told us that the financial crisis was caused by two different types of money crossing we wouldn't hear the end of it. Why is it somehow more acceptable to be sloppy with engineering terminology. After all, journalists are payed to be accurate and truthful. Maybe if you're the first reporter at the scene and the story has to go out quickly this is acceptable. But The Local had plenty of time to reflect and do research.      Agreed.
		    You could ask whether this is a chicken and egg situation as people wouldn't be forced to buy their own personal vehicles if there was a workable alternative. In Switzerland there are a lot of people who could afford their own vehicle but choose not to because they prefer the alternative. That's different to the USA where most people who don't have a vehicle are too poor to get one.
		 
			
			No go on say what you really feel           and realized he had missed his stop at Altstetten and  .  
If he was alone in the carriage, who testified he was really sleeping       Nobody, but one has to remark that it is a very common sight (to see people asleep in the carriage possibly missing their stop). Though it does nicely support Amogles suspicion of a cover-up... There just might be more to the story after all...
		    You can't own and operate a vehicle in Switzerland for the equivalent of $1000 for any period of time.  Hell, I don't think I've even seen a working vehicle for sale at that price.  In the US, a person could purchase a car for several hundred dollars, insure it, and operate it- all for what a Zuricher pays for an annual municipal pass.  That person can then travel at any time, unchained to a transit schedule, to anywhere, without having to purchase a fare if he goes outside of the zones listed on his transit pass.   
I'm not totally bashing mass transit, but the US doesn't have a mass transit system like Switzerland because it doesn't have the population density that makes these systems cost-effective and useful for the average American.
		    You also don't have cars here that fall apart on the road or that melt the ice caps entirely through their own emissions. Nor do you have people earning 10k per year.   
Give and take and all that, not much good comparing the two.   
I'm with amogles on this one. If all you're going to do is plagiarize and translate a real newspaper, then you should have time to at least get the details right, Local.
		 
			
			I asked my husband about this ... he said the train stopped directly on an electricity sector which short circuited. Really crazy, but seemigly pretty bad timing and at a bad location... have they found the jerk yet?
		    Still better than the UK, I must say. A leaf fell on the track and the whole rail network is affected.
		    If my several-hundred-dollar car breaks, I'll go to a car parts shop and get a new $50-$100 part to get it running, or I'll sell it to the junk man and go buy another.  If my several-thousand-franc car breaks down, I probably wouldn't be able to afford the cost of a repair shop, etc. here.     
My point is still that transportation is more accessible and affordable in the US, in general, than in Switzerland.        Melting which ice caps?  Ice caps are always melting, while others are re-forming.  There has been no definitive proof that polar ice caps are melting any faster now than they were at other points in history.  The best scientific estimate of the Earth's overall climate is that we are between two Ice Ages right now.  The climate change (formerly global warming) environmental movement has been so thoroughly hijacked by communists and anti-capitalists that I would question the general credibility of these types of claims.  The best of these scientists could not tell you how much precipitation falls on Earth in one day, let alone a week or a month, but yet they go on to extrapolate these apocalyptic climatic scenarios from limited and flawed (or even   rigged  ) observations.   
Sorry for the OT.    
If I buy a vehicle in the US, chances are, at that price range, it will be a vehicle from the late 1990s/early 2000s, with the emissions technology of the time.  Here, I routinely see individuals driving vehicles from the 1980s or earlier, with the emissions technology of that time.   
Further, these mass transit systems, while being electrified, oftentimes have their electricity supplied by ""non-sustainable"" fossil fuel burning power plants.  So, you are trading one form of emissions for another form of emissions.  Unfortunately for my argument in this instance, Switzerland is one of the few countries that does generate a significant portion of its electricity from hydroelectric and other non-fossil-fuel sources.      No, you probably do have people  10K per year, but they are   much more, in the form of socialist subsidies from the government.  As long as there's someone else's pocket for the government to pick, these folks will be okay.  We have a much worse problem in the US, because these social welfare systems are so interwoven into the demagoguery that constitutes a political campaign that we'll most likely fall on worse times than Greece before someone has the minerals to reform the system.      Plenty of good comparing the two.  I like the US system much better.  I can come and go when and from/to where I want.        This is The Local, remember?  At what point did it ever have any reputation as an intelligent and accurate news reporter?    
			
			The swiss train service is one of the best things about this country, but when it screws up, it does so in spectacular fashion.I guess when trains are meant to meet with others then there is going to be a ripple effect with lots of other trains effected.    
I for one will never take the service for granted ever again lol. Delayed for an hour is not so bad but I imagine there were others very badly effected. Apparently there were three problems, combined they really caused maximum chaos.   
If the story about the emergency brake is true I for one would like to join the lynching mob looking for this guy. Whats wrong with getting to the next available station then working your way back to where you are meant to be? Anyone with the slightest bit of sense would do that surely??

			About this swiss train efficiency... depends where you commute. For example lausanne-geneva fast trains (coming from zurich, usually without stops in morges/nyon) are late 5-10 minutes quite often. Not dramatic, but neither reliable. And in past few months there have been quite a few disruption between these 2 cities, coming late and even staying still in the middle of nowhere for 20-30 minutes.  
They have some long-term issues near Nyon with track I heard, but there is no rush in solving them. So I take this famous swiss precision with a pinch of salt    
			
			Compare 5 minutes late with 3 hours late, which is what we get in the good old USA.
		    Where are you 3 hours late?  I've never been 3 hours late to anything, irregardless of the reason, much less because of transportation.
		     
look, we get it, you love the USA and everything it stands for.   
But you're not there now, and frankly I'm sick of reading all your blinkered 'the usa is the best and can do no wrong, everywhere else is rubbish and to blame' posts, so please, give it a rest
		 
			
			Trains on certain lines in the U.S. are routinely 3 hours or more late because they have to wait for freight trains. So you have to plan around that.
		    Seriously???   
missing a meeting is a financial loss to other individuals? Or do you actually want that corporations whose meetings weren't allowed to be productive because attendants were absent or delayed should tally and measure the lost productivity and man hours and send him a bill?   
ffs. That's more absurd than pulling the emergency break for missing your stop.
		    Check the Amtrak webiste and then go onto real time information.   
There seem to be more trains running late than on time. And those that are late are almost all several hours late.
		    So Brits are allowed to gloat but Americans aren't?
		     
its sickening when any nationality does it, its even more sickening when the 'facts' are wrong and the poster so blinkered
		    1. The polar ice caps aren't ""always melting and reforming"". There are only two -- the Arctic and the Antarctic. They've been omnipresent for some time.    
2. The Arctic Ocean melted sufficiently enough for the first time in human history just within the past few years that ships were able to navigate across it from Europe to Alaska. If Arctic sea ice was always melting and reforming, then Christopher Columbus would never have discovered Hispañola, because the Arctic ""Northwest passage"" to India would long have already been known.   
3. The fact that Artic sea ice is melting at such a rapid rate is threatening extinctions of Artic wildlife at alarming rates.      
Seriously... I don't know what you do for a profession, but when it comes to climate change science, maybe you, Fox News, and the Republicans should leave it to actual scientists while you stay focused on what you do best, which I'm assuming is related to your MBA or your Economics degree.
		    Send a bill? What's with the PC approach. No, they should tally the hours, add a good extra on top (say about 300%), then file a complaint in court, and get a class action suit going. Imagine - there is not only the actual loss of productivity, but also the mental anguish of your coworkers (expecting to see you at a meeting and worrying sick about your whereabouts) to compensate for.
		    of course.  how silly of me to have left that out.  But surely there will be an invoice sent after the litigation is completed.   Perhaps an invoice for preparation of the invoice?
		     
Umm, then don't read them...  I get frustrated with the constant background din of US-bashing that so many love to do here, based upon revisionist history or the reported actions of a few Americans that don't represent the overwhelming majority of Americans.
		    Yes, because the British record is stellar, and they've never done any wrong, correct?   
I'm proud of my country.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  I don't understand the mindset of not being proud of one's country and never will, but I would protect your desire to not be proud of your country, or to even hate your country.     
I've never said, never will say, that the US has done no wrong or can do no wrong.  The US has made tons of mistakes, but I think the good has generally outweighed the bad.
		    Bad choice of words... mea culpa. The polar ice caps are omnipresent, but that does not mean that they are static- they have been changing size and shape, thickening and thinning for millenia.        Columbus didn't have the technology to travel the Artic Ocean in 1492- no country at that time had the technology.  Further, the state of knowledge of the map at that time left much to be desired.  Mankind at that time did not know if the ice caps had receded to allow a passage via the Arctic Ocean from Europe to North America.      Wildlife, like the polar bear?  The polar bear was the ""cute, cuddly"" mascot of the environmental movement for years until it was revealed that polar bear populations have been steadily increasing for quite some time.  The same with other arctic wildlife such as some species of penguins, seals, and whales.  Other species that are endangered have had this attributed more directly to causes such as over-hunting, not ""global warming"" or ""climate change""      Are these ""actual scientists"" the same scientists that place thermometers next to heat exhausts in an urban environment and then publish findings that say ""Its getting warmer?""  Or are these the ones that only include data about a particular ice shelf melting, excluding the nearby ice shelf that is actually becoming thicker?  Scientists can't tell me accurately what the weather is going to be in 1 week, or how much rain fell on Earth yesterday, so how are they able to run around, Chicken-Little-style, predicting climatic apocalypse?
		    Or, I just drive a car and get to where I'm going without a 3-hour wait.   
Do you want to serial-groan this post, BigBlue?
		    This is the problem with American infrastructure.   I actually stopped using public transportation because it cost 2x as much and took 3x as long to get to where I was going than it did to use my car.     
I'll be interested to see how much support Obama can get to beef up the infrastructure as he outlined in the SOTU last night.
		    Mass-transit has and will work well in densely populated US areas like New York, Boston, Chicago, LA, etc. This is one of the reasons it works well in Switzerland- the dense population. The problems it faces in the US are connecting ""Nowheresville, Middle America"" to somewhere (or wheres) that people will want to go, and ""Nowheresville"" being able to afford a public-transit system within its own municipal limits good enough for people to use.
		    But this is missing the point. One of the reasons for having a train service at all is to give people an alternative to driving. If the quality of the service is so poor that people do what you say and don't use it, they don't really have that choice.   
Now I've done quite a lot of train travel in the US and over the years Iguess I've done about half the Amtrak system (which isn't as impressive as it may sound if you look at the map and see how few routes there are). And actually I have a lot of good things to say about it and I would even venture to say that in certain respects European train systems could learn a thing or two. In fact a lot of Americans are surprised when I tell them this. I've talked to fellow passengers on Amtrak trains, and they often say that compared to trains in Europe you must think this is sh*t, and when I tell them not really they are surprised.   
However, talking to fellow passengers, I' have noticed that definitely not all are tourists and leisure travellers but quite a few use the train to go about their regular activity. Some were on their way to job interviews for example, or to college and some were even had a job at one end of the country and a family at the other end. So all in all those trains fulfill a real purpose and quite a lot of people do not have alternatives. So to leisure travellers on holiday a delay of 6 hours (yes, this happened to me once) is maybe all just part of the experience and gives them something to write home about, but to other travellers it is a compromise in terms of service quality. Saying people can drive instead is maybe simplifying things a bit too far.
		    That may be a sound argument as to why not more routes and more services are provided. But it doesn't excuse poor delivery of those services that are provided. Either a service is justified and you run it properly, or you agree that it isn't justified and terminate it and (this is the bit people misunderstand) live with the consequences. But a lot of public service in the USA is built around the premise that nobody wants the negative political capital of actually cutting it so it remains, and nobody really wants to find ways of improving it either as they know they might well end with a lot of egg on their face.
		    Well, defending us from undeserved (or partly deserved) bashing is one thing, but I think we all  have to admit that we are good at some things and bad at some things. The US in general is very very bad at building and running passenger rail-roads. I don't think it has to be this way, but for the moment it is.   
The thing that I think is unfortunate is that a lot of the American public seems to grasp this, and has taken the pride-based stance that ""trains are stupid anyway"". I disagree, which is one of the reasons that I live here instead of in my native US.   
Now, if Americans were to put their minds to it the US could have a fantastic rail system, but to work it can't be a political football - we'd have to go all-in.
		     
Ironically enough, speaking of affordability, the US taxpayer doesn't seem to mind funding regional and local airports that they hardly ever use.
		    Airlines are increasingly pulling out of those nowhere municipal airports unfortunately.  This means that Ma and Pa Kettle are going to have to load up the pickup and drive 6 hours to the nearest airport again.
		    Correct - but the airport per se won't necessarily shut down...
		 
			
			This is the down side to the expat life: somehow every discussion, no matter how trivial and unrelated, ends up being a massive whingefest about the US. Work it out people!       My daughter got a car with fresh MFK last year for CHF 1500, works fine.      Nonsense, I don't know anyone here who cannot afford a car, though I know many who CHOOSE not to own a car!   
Tom
		    OT but your post(s) reminded me of pictures I'd seen recently tracking glacial melt over the last century. I can't find them again now but I did find this:     
There is observable evidence that glaciers are melting faster in recent years than they have done before. 
There could be an argument that even 100 years observation of a glacier is a small amount in the total age of the glacier so is not statistically significant. 
However, I don't think you can dismiss these ""actual scientists"" as you refer to them. In the same way I don't think one should firmly follow the apocalyptic warnings. Either is a blinkered view in my opinion.   
I'd best not stray further off topic       couple of things:   
1. ""irregardless"" is not a word.      
now that ive gotten the grammar nazi off my chest...   
2. three hours late happens to people who commute on the fwys in southern california a handful of times per year because of accidents during rush hour, or thru ""severe storms"" (read: wind) which knock out power lines and effect the traffic lights.   
3. have you ever flown out of chicago in the winter?
		    Further grammar nazi observations:    
- ""I've"" instead of ""ive"" 
- ""got"" rather than ""gotten"" (although I think this might be due to UK vs US english) 
- ""fwys"" is presumably an accepted abbreviation of ""freeways""? 
- ""through"" rather than ""thru"". The latter might be an accepted shortening but I'm pretty sure it isn't a 'proper' word 
- ""affect"" rather than ""effect"" (roughly speaking affect is the verb and effect the noun)   
Your post is fine for me. As far as I'm concerned, on such a forum, as long as the content is readable and understandable then grammar doesn't need to be exact.  
Maybe you're already aware of the above anyway.    
I'll await someone pointing out a mistake in my post.        I love grammar Nazis.
		    Yes yes, but US car driving is nice and easy only if you are YOUNG  and HEALTHY. I have seen many senior citizens there (>80) who drive these huge cars they have (logic: better trash the other car than have yours trashed in an accident), even for daily groceries. Such a pain for them. They caused some serious accidents too. I am sure you would will prefer a public transport system when you become old and if happen to live alone.
		 
			
			Sorry my reply is so late, but at least it gets us back to the topic.       The only reasons for a train to stop precisely under a section insulator are a breakdown of the traction system or an emergency brake maneuvre. Loco engineers (""drivers"") should not ""avoid stopping there""; they MUST not do such at all, because of the consequences mentioned in my previous post. The probability of a loco pantograph stopping right under a section insulator is extremely small, but ship happens. And it happened.    
The ""worst possible consequence"" is a sudden short circuit between two power supply sections that may be under very different voltage due to the resistance between the supply point and the end of the section at the insulator. A difference of 4000 Volt is not unusual, and it can not be shut down by a fuse or the like. A fuse can prevent damage on the supply lines, but not on the overhead wiring, because the wires work like a huge capacitor.       There is a brief short circuit every time indeed, but with a rapidly moving train that's way shorter than a single half wave of the alternating current, so it doesn't do any damage. The pantograph shorting the circuit for a longer time does the trick.       Very funny theory. An emergency brake opens the pressurized air system that controls the brakes. The result is a very brutal stop. The engineer has no control over the behaviour of the train until it comes to complete halt. The activated emergency brake can easily be located, because a seal is broken inside the device. I don't think an engineer is stupid enough to conjure up such a story that can be debunked in minutes.       I totally agree, but that's the way journalism works. For instance, in German speaking Europe we again and again read nonsense like, ""Die amerikanische Notenbank Fed hat bekanntgegeben, ....."" The term ""Notenbank"" implies that the Fed is something like the National Bank in Switzerland. Those journalists just don't know that the Fed is a funny conglomerate of quite a few more or less independent banks. Yet they still earn their salary.    
Sloppy terminology is the norm in journalism. Look at what they did to things like Curie, Becquerel and Sievert after Fukushima. Those hack writers still are in business, and they even had a huge influence on very important political decisions of the last ten months. Worldwide. Their poor grasp of simple physical facts will affect our lives for decades.
		 
			
			The thread above is a classic example of "" You have been owned!!!""
		    Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that somebody legitimately uses the brake and stops the train precisely in that position. You cannot have the overhead line falling down as a result. It could be that the reason the brake was used is an incident with injuries. You don't want to add extra damage by having the overhead cables falling down which may hamper and endanger the efforts of the rescue teams. I maintain that such a response from the section breaker reflects a design flaw.      I think there is a mix-up here.   
There are two types of section breaker. There are those between two different feed-in points that prevent the substations interfering with one-another. These can theoretically cause the effect you describe, and this is why they have a length of 5 to 10 meters. Therefore the pantograph cannot short them. Then there is another type of section breaker that is much shorter, maybe 20 cm, and this type is used to cut off individual bits of overhead so maintenance crews can work on them without having to cut off the power to a larger area. But when they are ""on"", the voltage on both sides comes from the same supply and there is hence no voltage difference betwen them. Usually the switch is right next to the breaker, so any resitsnace due to the switch path is negligble. So for the latter type of breaker to short, the train would have to be entering a section that was not only disconnected but also earthed. For that to be possible, the dispatcher must have sent the train onto the wrong lone, or the driver missed a red signal, or some other screw-up occurred. Again, it doesn't have much to do with a sleepy passenger.      The sparks you sometimes see when a train passes a section breaker have nothing to do with a short circuit but with the arc caused by the brief interruption of current flow. The same can be observed when there is ice on the overhead line.        If the engineer did something stupid and then tried to blame a sleepy passenger, all it takes to fake the proof is to brake the seal on any one of the emergency brake valves. Unless you bring in the forensics it's probably very difficult to prove who broke the seal or when. The ""black box"" will show that a hard braking occurred, but as the locomotive was of an older model, it does not record the driver's actions so it cannot be proven who caused the emergency brake application.
		 
			
			Amogles, I know that what you wrote makes sense, but it is not necessarily the reality. I wrote my previous post with two SBB loco engineers (""drivers"") and an SBB high voltage electrician looking over my shoulders. I met them specifically for that purpose, hence the delay.    
There are lots of places where there are short insulators between sections fed from different points, albeit not necessarily different substations; the distance to the feeding point can still cause a significant voltage difference due to the wirte resistance. Any loco engineer can confirm you that. They see the voltage drop on the volt meter in the cockpit. And of course I know that sparks have nothing to do with that brief shorting.    
Oh, and you mean the engineer could have left the loco, boarded one of the cars and pulled an emergency brake in front of all the passengers? Nice idea, but please get real. I saw stupid passengers pulling emergency brakes, several times. I even got a bad bruise on my head from a suitcase flying from the overhead rack on my forehead. It was not the engineer's fault but a drunk kid.    
Besides that, what kind of stupid thing could the engineer have done? Stopped under a section insulator without any reason to even stop?    
Sorry I can't go on with this discussion. In half an hour I'm leaving for a place in the Alps where there is no Internet. Yes, that kind of thing still exists, and I'm glad it does.
		    The loco was an RBe540, in which there is a door from the driving cab to the passenger compartment. It would have been very easy for the driver to pull the emergency brake.  Furthermore, the train was running empty between two assignments so there would have been nobody to observe what really happened. Nobody besides the driver ever saw the person who supposedly pulled the brake and ran away across the tracks. I'm just saying it is a very human reaction that if you've done something very stupid that you try and get away with blaming somebody else. It could be I'm wrong, but don't discount the possibility outright.
		    What is with the dead man's pedal? Could the driver even leave his position while the train is moving?
		 
			
			I was very late for work because of this incident and when I found out why I was really mad. I thought at the end station someone checks the train to make sure no one is sleeping. I've seen the SBB employees bang on the window from the outside at the last stop.    
Then the other day I nodded off on the train home and missed the station where I have to change trains. The train was still stopped at the stop I wanted. I rushed to the door, pressed the green button but it was too late. So there I was staring at the station where I needed to get off. To my left was the emergency button.....I debated but realised it wasn't an emergency and could only imagine how much I would inconvenience others for what was my fault.    
So I got off at the next stop, and had to backtrack to correct my mistake.   
The thing I don't get is that while living in Japan I observed the commuters had their eyes closed, they looked asleep, but somehow, instinctively, they knew when to get off. If I close my eyes, I just fall asleep.       Ok, back from the Alps. Thanks Laertes, of course you're right.    
Amogles, thanks for the details. However, I'm asking again: What the heck could the engineer have done wrong that could make him do the pretty crazy thing you think he might have done?
		    I don't know. I'm just pointing out the possibility that there was something.   
We will have to wait for the results of the investigation that has been opened, and it would be wrong to pre-empt that with speculation.
		 
			
			update-    
unfortunately, no caning.       
Forget to renew your monthly pass and get caught at a check? 100 CHF please. 
Be a dumbass and destroy the day of hundreds of commuters and cost a pile of money in repairs? Oh that's alright you were just stressed out.       
			
			This whole matter sounds fishy really, the guy was alone in the carriage, they know the dude was sleeping for sure, they know exactly which stop he missed and they know he pulled the emergency breaks and jumped out of the train, in addition they know he was stressed....yet they don't know who the guy actually is!!!    
A more logical scenario would have been, we had a problem during maintenance / due to driver error and it caused a damage that we don't wanna pay for....so maybe our insurance can pay for any future claims       Japanese don't sleep in trains, they meditate       I think you all make it a bit too complicated. The ""Costa Concordia"" comes to mind !  I think that passenger was well existing, and possibly is most extremely well known to the train driver, and by mistake pulled the emergency brake, and so they had to invent a way out, and she.... sorry I mean THE passenger had to get away swiflty             Makes me think of a time I was on one of the Basel trams, at one of the end of line / turnaround stops which happened to have a bathroom. The tram generally sits there for a few minutes before heading off again. On one occasion, I saw the driver come out of the bathroom, still zipping his pants, and was closely followed by a young lady whose hair was a bit messed up.   
I'm not saying there was anything untoward going on but... well...     
So, perhaps Wolli is onto something.         
To have it with a German Fasnacht cabaretist of lately  """"  Ich sag ja nichts, ich mein ja nur""         You miss a point here: Altstetten was the terminal stop and from there the train was heading - off duty and supposedly empty - to its next service. Of course they don't know exactly what happened, it's just the most plausible explanation.

			Whats gird?
		    Here you go      
To prepare (oneself) for action.
		    Thanks for clearing that one up. Must have slipped from my everyday English somehow       I gird 
I girt/girded 
girding          Being girt by sea is nicer than having to gird for -30 or so C.
		       
Gird yer loins, laddy!
		 
			
			It's a weird word nonetheless, is it mostly used in some regional variant?
		    Not regional, but Local ;-)
		 
			
			never thought you could use it as an intransitive verb. feels strange.
		    I agree, it should be ""girds itself"" at the very least.  I'm not sure Switzerland has any loins to gird, or enough rope    
			
			The word reminds me of the item of clothing that bears its name...the  .  And despite all of the sexy pictures that turn up when you Google 'girdle' (try saying that five times fast!), I will forever associate girdles with women of my grandmother's age.         
Is *that* what's going to happen to Switzerland this week?
		    I do hope not, I'm not sure I can find one to fit.
		    Right, I agree. And so does  . Apparently ""gird"" used intransitively means to gibe or jeer!   
Speaking of odd adverbs, how about ""girdingly""?!!!
		    Its absolutely NOT everyday english
		 
			
			Do you look at a lot of websites with middle aged women in vintage underwear?          How did you find out?   
Damned Google with its new terms & conditiond, tracking my browsing.    
			
			For those of you who are non-native English speakers, don't sweat not knowing the verb gird.  It's obsolete, archaic and you can go the rest of your life without saying or writing it.   
Much like ""gild"", now that I think about it.
		    But a gilded girdle, surely that's worth learning the language just for the mental image alone?
		 
			
			I recall the phrase 'gird your lions' from a book I read many years ago. Meaning to get ready for the fray.
		    Was this the cover picture of said book?          What about us native speakers?    
I'd never heard of the word before......wow the Lolcal has actually taught me something I didn't know    
			
			It should definitely   itself now before the freeze, as cold induces shrinkage       Australians still need the word ""gird"", as pointed out in an earlier post.   
In any case, it's a shame to let languages die, or become merged into some lowest-commom-denominator dumbed-down patois. Keep gird, and gild for that matter. I will continue to embrace the phrases ""gird your loins"" and ""gild the lily"".   
Anyway, just to keep this on topic, I girded my car ages ago with winter tyres in anticipation of the Big Chill.
		    ¨   
What would be your next step? Outlaw figures of speech?   
			
			Look, it's just going to be bloody cold, that's all it's trying to say.
		    Ohhhh. So why didn't they just say so?
		    Because its try to show some journalism skills by using strange words...
		    That's a ructious suggestion.
		    Even more amazing.... being seen in all of that underwear back then was cause for anxiety because it you wasn't ""decent"".

TheLocal is the news service from er, The Local. In general their threads stand despite possible previous threads on the same subject. Take 'em or leave 'em. Consider such threads a necessary evil.   
Perhaps continue the discussion on the initial thread, if there's much to discuss?   
The kid in the photo looks like the Feral Kid with the boomerang from Mad Max II.      You're not obliged to read a free news service. The Economist magazine is globally available for a modest fee. I can recommend it as a good read.
		    I could not agree more, that has always been my view of the Catholic church as well!
		    Maybe, so be it.   
But it certainly undermines forum discipline if the people who own this forum don't respect the rules they expect others to live by. The Local is no more than an up in our faces statement saying ""we own the place and the rules don't apply to us"".

			A proposed amendment to the Citizenship Act will make it possible only for foreigners holding residence permit C to apply for naturalization in Zurich, immediately reducing the number of valid applications by about one fifth.         
			
			Who wants to be Swiss anyway. Just take the low taxes forget about the bright red passport
		 
			
			Its only a referendum - not a law.  My understanding is that most referendums in Switzerland fail.   
I'm surprised most applicants are male 10-20 years old.  Wouldn't that make them eligible for military service (or higher taxes if they opt-out) by applying at that age?
		    I think this sentence in the article defies logic. First of all, I thought it was already the case that you had to have a C permit before you could move on to citizenship. maybe the article should have an example where this is possible? I dont know a single person who went from a B permit to citizenship. (25% seems ridiculous)
		    Years spent in education do not normally count towards a C permit but can be counted towards citizenship. So therefore somebody spending a long time in education could theoretically qualify for citizenship before they qualify for a C permit.
		    I can only think of facilitated citizenship for spouses of Swiss citizens.

			A 34-year-old father of two has been sentenced to eight years in prison after he kidnapped his six and seven-year-old sons, took them to Tunisia, and told their mother to pay him 170,000 francs ($182,000) if she wanted to get her children back.         
			
			In this case, I hope he is never going to be able to see his kids again.
		 
			
			Darn foreigners.  You can never trust them.
		 
			
			Did he also steal a Twix from the Kiosk on his way on ?   
			
			Hmm, this reminds me of a fellow ef member asking about his rights for custody as a stay-at-home dad last year.    
You never know.
		 
			
			Ignoring the obvious illegal attributes of this particular situation, this is actually what is happening to many fathers on an acceptable daily basis.
		    I agree there are two sides to a story, i this instanceone would be interested to know the opposing version. This reminds me of a similar case in Lausanne in 2011. where a (Swiss) women after the breakdown of her marriage, abducted her two South African children to Switzerland. She was not prosecuted for abduction but had to return to their place of habitual residence, South Africa.  
In this case one can only I hope that the mom would be able to see her children again.    
(The paternal grandparents have full legal custody granted by a Tunesian court.) 
Tunesia is not a signatory to The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Thus this treaty cannot be invoked if a child is taken from the Switzerland to Tunisia.   
International relationships are complicated, in this case horrendously so.
		 
			
			I know that in some countries, when custody has been disputed, the children have travel restrictions placed on them, so they cannot leave without the right parent (if sole custody has been awarded). If the parents have joint custody, then agreement of both parents is required before the children can leave the country. I guess this is not the case in Switzerland?
		    No, it is the case here as well.   
Tom
		    What a horrible mum! Which mum would not give everything she has for her children?!?!?       
... just kidding. I just love rhetorics.
		     
It is the case in Switzerland but, like in many countries, either the fact that the passport is flagged isn't caught at the airport, or the non-custodial parent applies for a passport of the home country without the other parent knowing and just waves the Swiss passport and passes through the system withthe kid's  home country passport at departure.   
Sad story. People don't realize how difficult having kids with multiple nationalities is when things go wrong.
		       
Yeah, those stay-at-home dads are very suspicious, aren't they? And not only that, you can't b***h about how they leave you alone with the kids either. Bummer.   
A proud product of pre-1994 South African education methinks.

			Four years ago, Peter Conti donated sperm to lesbian friends. He was promised a role in the upbringing of the child, but those promises were never met.         
			
			I feel sorry for men to not have better right regarding their kids. When it goes well with the mother, everything is good but if trouble begin, women can make a father's life miserable.
		 
			
			""Sperm donar frozen out by parents"".   
Does the sexuality of the players have an additional importance?
		    I agree. But there are more than enough men who don't give a sh** about their kids and leave the family, don't even pay child support.
		    Yes, like the other news about the guy who kidnapped his kids and asked money to the mother to get them back....
		 
			
			Gay sperm donor frozen out by lesbian mums.   
What does ""frozen out"" mean?   
As a side thought, Do you think the Local cares about their reputation?
		      And there are moms who kill their babies. WTF does any of it have to do with a father who wants to see his child?
		         
There are more than enough women who don't give a sh** about their kids and leave to party,                  
Look that woman who left the baby to go to the night club!!!
		    I would guess that one would think that as all of the players are gay they would be sympathetic to each other. Other than that it does make for a catchy headline.
		    You forgot to pay attention of my first post.
		 
			
			Donor sperm is usually anonymous and frozen, but this one was probably kept warm in a turkey baster. So the headline is (Gasp!) probably untrue!
		    *ducks for cover* You are right, please find me contrite.
		    Also people can make a father's life miserable. Especially when some of them keep spreading stereotypes, and can seriously hurt the father's already ed up and squeezed by the woman. (Who, as you said, can make a father's life miserable)   
Or when they all give assumptions on the men guiltiness, being accused of not giving a sh*t, etc...   
I knew enough men in that situation, witnessed many comments/behavior. Also I know enough the relevant law to say that the balance is greatly in favor of the woman, especially in the UK.   
So let's all play fair and keep the balance, as you said.
		    Eh? tEh Gays stole the rainbow. Why would 'they' be any more sympathetic than Tom Cruise, who's not a Homosexual?   
Cheap Headline, though.
		    Fair enough, but you have ""I agree but...deadbeat jerks...""   
and, ""yeah, like that other kidnapper jerk"",   
which makes it a bit confusing as it's a thread about a dad who wants to be the opposite of those things. Deadbeat dads are awful, yes, kidnappers are way more awful, yes. Nothing at all to do with a dad who wants to be involved. Which goes with your first post   and now I'm lost  .
		    What about the Rainbow? Did you forget to remember to understand to read my my! MY! post?
		    No, The Local cares about advertising revenue.  
Its just us suckers who think reputation matters.   
Has The Local ever returned to any of the threads it started? Has it ever clarified any of its statements or corrected anything in the light of the input of others or even apologised for its tiresome bumbling incompetence.   
Humility and integriity don't generate income. Therefore The Local doesn't do them.
		    I read it. L. Ron did a soul crack on me before I could type a reply. Tom who?
		    I saw first hand of what a mother can do to a father. And believe me, I would never ever do what has been done.    
We talk about great dads, those who DO want to be involve, who do want to be part of a child's life. Who takes great care of the child.   
I agree with you totally. It is easier to make a father looks bad and not just from the mother. Sometimes (often) the justice system contribute to it.   
In this case, the guy wants to be involve, he should have the right. It is not a anonymous sperm donor, but someone who accept to do it in exchange if being part of his son's life.
		 
			
			I like EF. I think it is intelligent and a ""cut above"" most other online forums. I think the conversation is pretty smart and I'm pleased with myself for being (I hope) a solid part of it.   
Then I read the journalism of the owners and it makes me feel a bit grubby and cast in the same mold as Daily Mail readers.   
Mr Local - do you really think that this level of journalism matches the demographic of (largely) expats in Switzerland? I think you badly misjudge your audience
		 
			
			The Local Yokel....
		    Does sexuality have any importance in the millions of other nasty custody battles that get played out every year between hetero couples?
		    Another example of 'quality' reporting from The Local?
		    Hey, here are some recent thread titles, and some recent Daily Mail titles.    
That's all I'm saying on the matter.                                                        What metrics are you using?       Well, yes, fair point    
(Nice list by the way  )   
I think that the point I was trying to make (badly it seems) is that the purpose of seeding stories is surely to attract people away from our own internal chit-chat to the main website, and I think they need to be providing something extra....   
But your research somewhat weakens my point, damn you
		    What amazed me the most is that you actually took time to find them....
		    Probably some Swedish slang expression...
		    Probably wasn't hard...
		    If it encourages *some* to consider the point being made then it was time well spent, don't you think?
		    Totally, and it help when you have that time.
		    Given freely and happily for the benefit of English speaking people needing help with their life in Switzerland.

_________________________     
			
			It's a pity that the Local ""Reporter"" is so stupid that he mixes up Kinder-garden with day care.   
Kindergardens are free in Switzerland.   
We can all cut and paste, mate. You seem to go one worst.   
			
			But this is from 4 months as it states in the article. So it is kinderkrippe / prekindergarten as I read it. I pay approx 1500 for two mornings a month for kinderkrippe, so i'm all for it.
		    Agreed. So that's the terminology that should have been used.   
It's a good idea though. The more stuff like this that happens, the more acceptable, and possible it will become for women to work if they so chose.
		 
			
			Apparently he is targeting ""normal incomes""?
		    Are the local guys based in Germany?  Because there Kindergartens are not free and thus maybe the mix-up of terms...  Although, children don't go to them until they are 3.  If they need childcare before age 3, a krippe is also the correct term.     
Anyhow, it was confusing to me when we moved here 1/2 year ago as the Kindergarten system in Germany is really flexible and CHEAP (although also not the same prices everywhere).  When we first moved to Germany we put both of our girls in from 8:30 - 3 everyday in order to facilitate learning the language, and it was only 300 a month or so, including lunches!
		    whatever that may be!   
 I finally read the article...and 70 CHF a day doesn't sound low cost to me, granted it is cheaper than what is now offered!  And they will be open between 2 and 5 days a week?  Not sure that will help working women all that much if some are only open 2 days a week, but it's a start, I suppose!
		 
			
			Public tagesschule in the Canton of Bern costs the max. tarif of CHF 11.20/hour for a child of a family of four and a family income of CHF 15'000 gros per month, excl. meals 
For a child of a family of four at an montly income of CHF 7'000 gros, CHF 2.40/hour 
Interesting isn't it?
		    That is a lot! We pay quite a bit less than that for four days till 2pm and that's the highest you can pay at this particular Krippe. It's government-run, so maybe that is the difference, but 1500 for 2 mornings a week is brutal!
		    I should quickly edit that in case I have left the wrong impression: it's 2 mornings a week, but the monthly bill is approx 1500 CHF.

		   Nicolas Blancho is not the person you want to have in charge of muslem affairs in Switzerland.
This is not a nice muslem but belongs to the nasty kind who believes stoning is part of the religion of peace.   This guy will build a parallel muslem society like I see in my home town of Blackburnistan, with sharia courts, halal butchers, muslem bakers, muslem faith schools. In short the works.   Blackburn has now at last count, 46 mosques and no-go areas in town for non muslems.   Not that a lot of Blackburnians go there as these areas now look like the slums in Karachi and Islamabad.   Just for laughs, there are 90 mosques in the whole of Switzerland.      Blackburn has always been and will always be a sh*t-hole with or without Muslims.

			Religion tax by default and church bells at 6 AM are truly radical.
		 
			
			As a Muslim in Switzerland I am really tired of the ICCS/ Nora Illi/ Nicolas Biancho crew getting all the press and thinking they have a mandate to speak for me. I don't blame them partly, because hey, make that money, but as usual, the media only thinks the ""radicals"" are sexy enough to make for good copy.  So it cuts both ways.  The press only goes to the ICCS, and when Biancho says in the papers ignorant bullsh*t about stoning, it comforts the majority opinion that Muslims are all jackasses, which is wrong.  So who loses? Normal Muslims like me who are just paying their taxes, keeping their heads down and who are perfectly content with their current places of worship.
		 
			
			Ah - thread title sounds just like my mum. Made me feel at home so thanks, The Local.
		 
			
			And anyway everyone knows that the Grand Saconnex mosque was built with Saudi money but people have short memories...
		    The     
IS radical    
They they want to build the place in Bern instead of Zürich or Basel or Geneva with far more Muslims shows that it is confrontation and provocation what they have in mind,  and not so much the requirements of the Muslim communities.  Worst is that hose IZRS chaps always talk as if representing THE Muslims in Switzerland, while they in reality are just a small minority, dominated by some rather weird Swiss converts       and she would be the good one or the evil one...inquiring minds want to know       There are actually more muslim residents (in absolute numbers) in Bern than in Basel or Geneva. Astonishingly, Aargau has the second biggest popoulation after Zurich, closely folllowed by Bern and St. Gallen.   
But you are right in that today, some people representing the more moderate muslims (the vast majority of all muslims here) clearly stated that there is no demand for a new mosque in Bern and especially not such a big one.
		 
			
			At the risk of a flaming:   
The problem specifically with these guys is that they have a very basic life view wich corresponds to a particularly harsh view of what Islam is and is not. Because of this, and the view that any Muslim who disagrees with them is an apostate, and therefore subject to hanging, they tend to be most troublesome to other Muslims.   
I have had some experience of this amongst the communites in London where they are aggressive and force communties out of their own mosques, so I can understand a certain degree of nervousnous amongst more integrated Muslim communites.   
Add to this the complete chaos that they sometimes cause       
and you can understand why the wider community does not really want them in their presence. Tolerence is one thing, but tolerence of the intolerant is a little suidcidal...
		    Why is that surprising?   
There are plenty of Bosnians in Aargau.
		    Are you referring to readers of The Local?
		     Yeah well I know that. But I'd still have guessed that the number of residents of muslim faith (especially taking into account those of Turkish and northern African origin) in some other cantons would be bigger.      Nothing too special about it, I was just wrongfully assuming sth. different.   
			
			If you wanna know about islam . Here it is    
The site belongs to Yusuf Estes who was a missionary with a church.
		    I am a bit astonished to hear this. BUT the explanation is relatively easy, as of course many Muslims in Geneva and Basel have their domicile on the French side of the border in spite of working and living in Geneva and Basel.

			A shame. They're going to close down their division in Nyon and fire all employees there; a factory they built over the acquisition in 1996 of the local firm Zyma and which is dedicated to produce over the counter drugs. So basically they bought a competitor and less than two decades later they just shut it down. Bravo Novartis. Out of the 1,080 persons being laid off in Switzerland, 320 are there in Nyon and 760 in Bâle. Considering proportionality and the fact that Zyma was a very well considered local firm and that less than 3 years ago they were promising a bright future for the plant, it's not hard to understand why sometimes les suisses romands have sometimes a negative view of those guys on the other side of Sarine.
		    I guess 15 years is actually plenty of time to observe whether the acquisition was an intelligent one from a cost/revenue point of view, explore potential buyers, realize that they can't offload it and choose to close it down instead.
		    If we consider the fact that as early as 2007 Novartis explicitly said that the plant had a bright future and kept having grand words for it, then according to you for 10 years the acquisition was considered a great move, and in just 3 years they've changed their minds and decided to make such a radical thing with it? In any case, these things are supposed to be analyzed before making the acquisition, and that doesn't explain either why Novartis has not even tried to sell the plant to someone else... it very much looks like they just wanted to get rid off a competitor.
		 
			
			Article in the WSJ -    
			
			Come on guys - the world was very different in 2007. At the current exchange rate this is just one example of many. Sad yes but very predictable given that in 2007 a franc cost approximately 35% less than today in Euro terms and about 25% less in USD.
		 
			
			It makes you wonder how many similar companies will follow suit considering just how expensive labor is here and could be more cheaply replaced elsewhere in the EU and the US.
		 
			
			The issue is a mix of the currency rates AND the regulatory environment. With Governments in Europe buckling under debt, their healthcare costs are also taking a hit. In order to bring in the austerity measures, they are forcing price cuts on medicines, which is directly affecting the margins for the manufacturers. 
Of course the manufacturers have little choice as prices are suddenly regulated and the governments are certainly their biggest customers.
		 
			
			I know quite some people who are affected here in Basel and will loose their job. I just hope that they get all the support available and that they will find a new job soon.
		 
			
			They are expecting ocer 1000 of people losing their jobs ''just'' in Basel.       
			
			Yes, it's been pretty grim here on campus today    
Our messages indicated 2000 jobs worldwide, with approx 1100 in Switzerland many of those in Basel.    
Apparently my area is not affected.    
But several friends have already been cut today - some who have been with Novartis/Sandoz/Ciba for 20 years plus

[Feeling quite queasy about it to be honest.]
		 
			
			We have always paid very high prices for drugs ""to support Swiss pharma"" and look at what we get in return. This is a shame.    
Are we at least going to benefit from lower prices? I don't think so!   
I will boycott Novartis and buy cheaper brands instead. For those who travel to the UK cold remedies are far far cheaper over there, go to Tesco or Boots and buy in bulk (careful...there are limits!)
		    I have boycotted them for the past few months anyway, (chronic meds) after learning that they go thru over 17,000 animals a month in their laboratories.  There`s another firm in the UK that does all its testing on human tissue cultures or something similar, not animals.   
Though I`m sorry about all the people about to lose their jobs.  That is sad.
		    Serious?   
The drug companies make a huge amount from the inflated prices / relationship with the medic here - and it has bugger all to do with saving swiss jobs 
The swiss franc is way too high.  Why pay anyone twice what you have to and get tyhe same work out of them ... it just commerce.  Why do you thi Apple have iPads made in mega factories in China?    I think most people realised that a long time ago.  Germany is a tad nearer and as cheap      Have you got a credible link for that?  It's not what my mate, who works high up in their research say ... Tissue culture is a much cheaper and dependable way of testing these days 
But I am prepared to learn from your source
		    Oh yes I am also sorry about all the people about to lose their jobs. I am also sorry for those who will carry on with nasty Novartis because they may be next.    
I think what we need is our politicians to stop supporting the big companies like Novartis, UBS, etc and start an interest in smaller firms.    
Of course this is difficult because it is an open secret that Novartis and UBS are good supporters are at least some of our political parties (those who lost on Sunday by the way).
		    So just like the UK, France, Germany, The US , Russia etc ????   
I doubt you and your family going forward would thrive under a ""hippy"" economy.  It's a quaint idea - but not how the world works ...
		 
			
			Big ''evil'' companies are providing work to people. It sucks that people lose their jobs and we are pretty relieved to have left before it hits Basel.   
I feel for those I know who will lose their job. But boycotting? Come on. I need their meds and it is because of the big pharmas that we can get generics ones, by the way. People who still working there need also us to buy their products so they can keep working.   
They are not all bad totally 1000 X 100%.   Look at the products they developped to actually safe lives and make one's life better!
		    In all European countries except Switzerland and Sweden funding of political parties is strictly regulated.    
Sorry but I don't understand your point. Are you a Swiss citizen?
		 
			
			From what I know of people who work there, there aren't enough people employed already. Many people are covering 2 or 3 different jobs. (As reflected by the high earnings per employee ratio). Surely at some point productivity is going to suffer.
		 
			
			An article in Le Matin newspaper the other day explaining that the big Swiss pharmas are on the edge of a major crisis as so many drugs are coming to the end of their initial licence- which means that those drugs will soon be opened to the generic market with huge losses for Swiss companies, and of course jobs.
		 
			
			Novartis has two major drugs coming off patent in the next few years: Diovan, worth $6bn per year to the company, and Gleevec, worth $4bn per year to the company. While they've managed to address that somewhat with a more diversified drug portfolio than some competitors, it still leaves a big gap in their income:       
At a certain point in becomes inevitable -- if there are opportunities to move work to lower-cost environments, particulary when faced with $10bn annual revenue base falling away over the next two years, companies are going to take the opportunity to tighten their belt.   
Half the people on this forum drive across the border to buy their groceries in France or Germany because it's too expensive to buy them in Switzerland. Why shouldn't a company do the same thing with their labour force (many of whom are not Swiss in any case!). If they can buy the same quality of employee in another location, don't they have a responsibility to their shareholders to make that savings?   
It's easy to forget, but companies aren't run for the benefit of their employees -- although well-run companies do treat their employees well. Ultimately, though, companies are run for the benefit of their shareholders, and this sort of decision is exactly what shareholders are demanding.   
And as sorry as I am for people who are losing their jobs, I suspect this isn't going to be a hatchet job -- there will be plenty of notice and very generous redundancy packages, if past experience with big pharma is any indicator.
		 
			
			Whatever the reasons, I know its incredibly hard for those who are affected by such drastic redundancies. Its equally difficult for those who are left behind to carry the can. The atmosphere in the office at such times is as if there are multiple funerals going on.   
When you are giving your blood, sweat and tears for the organisation neglecting your health, your family etc. only to be treated as a number in the end and dismissed without consideration; its hard to make any sense of what's happening.
		    Having been on both sides of the coin, I agree. On one hand, I understand why the company is doing it. On the other hand, it makes it no easier to see friends / colleagues losing their jobs, nor the impact that the job loss almost certainly will have on their personal life.   
On a slightly brighter note, all of the friends I've had over the past few years who've lost their job in pharma (and there have been quite a few!) have all done very well -- they've all found jobs reasonably quickly and pocketed generous packages...  One or two have used the money to leave pharma completely to follow their dreams.  When life gives you lemons and all that...
		    I have been there too. It was particularly hard. I was working my butt off, enjoying what I was doing and contributed significantly to the success of the organisation.l It didn't matter - everyone came and offered commiserations and said it had nothing to do with my performance and everything to do with the bottom line etc. However, the fact was that what I did and how I did it, didn't matter. I had to go.   
It was almost like being dumped  - you are in love, doing everything you can, enjoying life and thinking everything is going well etc. And then suddenly the partner gets up leaves saying there is nothing wrong with you, nothing at all but it needs to break      There was an article a year ago about pharma. It talked about various leading companies planning to announce savings 'programs'. So actually this may not be a new round of cuts but ones previously announced. Not as bad as it sounds.
		    No - why?

		    If previously means that those who are losing their job got the news only 2 weeks ago, well...   
The case of Novartis, today, is indeed a new round of cuts.
		 
			
			I personally found it very difficult that on the same day they announce giant profits that they cut jobs. How can that be right? It doesn't feel right to me. I know business is business and not charity, but we are people with families and lives, and we're not numbers, and we've given a lot to this company - without us it wouldn't be what it is. I just don't believe that these cuts are necessary. Lets first cancel the campus development and the giant bonuses of the company directors if we need to save money. Cancelling just one of those fancy buildings would have paid the salaries of all those 2000 for several years. There's enough work for us to do after all.   
My husband has most likely lost his job. They have only announced the numbers today and have left the poor sods to sit there looking at each other thinking ""am I one of the 23 in the group being cut?""   
Another friend has been told her department is being outsourced, but they won't announce the actual redundancies until March - so she's in the situation now where she has to choose to get out now or stick around and wait for some compensation for her 20 years of service.   
I'm pretty sure hubby will be OK - he's got good qualifications, good references and even speaks Swiss German (he's English). The stupid thing is he was actually looking for a new job anyway due to being pissed off, so in some ways it's a blessing if he gets a decent redundancy. But it's a nasty place for our family to be in.
		    When I was at Sun, particularly in the two years prior to the Oracle acquisition, there were so many rounds of layoffs that it's hard, even now, to think about or describe the torture. We'd wait for the email and go to the allotted room wondering if we were the lucky or the damned. Twice they even cut folks off of our own team leaving us with more work and lower morale. The waiting is hard. When we made it through the big cut just before the merger, I didn't go to the office that day as I couldn't bear watching people who had been with the company for 20+ years and who were close to retirement get sacked. I worked from home, mostly, after that since my team was all remote and the mood was so dark and the offices so empty that there was little point in going in every day. When our team's number came in the form of a phone call I was so relieved....I loved the work, but the whole atmosphere of the workplace itself was so depressing I was glad to go.    
I would suggest that your friend not wait for the parachute as, though it might be decent, sometimes it's not worth the waiting and wondering. I got a decent package, but I wish I would have lept when I had the chance and not stuck it out due to a lack of staff and a love of the project.    
And my condolences for your husband. Everything happens for a reason and hopefully it'll lead to a good change for him.
		    Thank you for encouraging me to  do a search.  Very interesting.   
No, their hands are almost ""clean"" - they use Huntington Life Sciences to do their animal testing for them.   
You can google it all.   I can`t seem to get the copy/paste thing right with links (older generation and all that )   
I would be most happy if your mate is correct, because doing my own ""research"", and ""educating"" my doctor is tiring - but I really dont like to think I am possibly supporting companies doing things to animals that would give me nightmares.
		    Does anyone know from which departments the cuts are being made in. One sounds like manufacturing, are there any others?
		    OK, if you believe something just because a company, that too a pharma company, said something, that would be a bit naive. In any case, 3 years is long enough for situation to change, so I wouldn't hold it against them. You can't analyze what will happen 15 year later.       Well said.      That's a mistake; you should NOT give your blood and tears for the org and you should NOT neglect your health, family etc. It is said, don't love your employer but love your job. Which means you should be doing a job you really enjoy doing, and try to keep your skills up to date, pass on the grunt work to someone less clever than you etc. and jump the ship when opportunity arises. In any case, some professions fetch you a premium over some others (like acads, government), that premium is for the additional hours and risk. Sorry for those who were axed, but with a generous redundancy package, it is better than many other cases.
		 
			
			Bottom line: take care of people, and they will take care of you. 
Loyalty begets loyalty.
		    This does not apply to companies - they take care of shareholders 
If you believe anything else you are horribly naive    
Large corporations have no loyalty
		    Supporting?  I believe that Novartis contributes more to the Swiss economy than the Swiss government contributes to Novartis.  Of course I could be wrong but making an assertation like this should require some evidence at least.      1. I don't see how the funding of parties here results in anything significantly different from anywhere else?  Evidence? 
2. The regulations of parties in no way curbs corruption or back-handers, it simply pushes it to the personal level when we arrive at a point where somebody like Tony Blair is now the richest ever ex-PM from England, just due to the commercial companies that ""support"" him now days in exchange for his ""support"" during his term and his ""support"" by introducing them to more ""supporting"" politicians.      I have no idea what this has to do with the price of eggs?
		    I had about 5 paragraphs of disertation written to that effect... and I just boiled it down to two lines.    
Corporations don't care about people. They care about profits and pleasing their shareholders. That's why I find it utterly amusing to see people work 12 hour days, alienate their families, have no social lives outside of work colleagues and all to get ahead and be successful in a corporate world that is never going to say ""thank you""... it's really tragic... and what do they get in the end?    
The boot and a cleverly coded letter of recommendation in a country where discrimination is perfectly legal, accepted and practiced.
		    Are people loyal to their company? If they get a better offer from competition?
		     
spot on, I've worked for quite a few large companies and they have all, without exception treated staff terribly, outright lies, making redundancies just to hire new cheaper staff elsewhere, announcing paycuts the last working day before christmas etc etc usually all done by someone higher up needing to meet targets in order to get there bonus.   
I worked for one company that announced a list of redundancies over the tannoy!!
		    Did they have X-Factor stlye teasing?
		    I hate to brake this to you, but you should never EVER give your blood, sweat and tears for an organization, neglecting your health and your family, unless perhaps it's your own organization (and I'm not sure if even then this should be the case). An organization will never do the same for their employees. Life is too short to set up priorities like that.   
I feel for all those who have their life's turned upside down and especially the expats who came to Switzerland for this exact job.
		 
			
			I am sad to see this happening in Switzerland. But it is a sign of the times we now live in unfortunately. We have put our move there on hold for reasons like this.    
I work in pharma in Ireland and work for a large American company. We had cuts last year, prob more next year. It's gone so cut-throat. It's all about profit margins. They make billions and want to make more. Patents are ending and generics are going to flood the market, some of company's big earner drugs are gone for them so. They have to save money somehow and secure the future of the company rather than it going bust completely.    
Having said that, job cuts are nasty and the amount they are saying upsetting. It will affect many people's lives but as someone else said, the redundancy packages tend to be good and hopefully people will find jobs soon.
		    Totally agree with this. Everyone is replaceable...end of. I would never never give my all to a company unless it was my company. No one will thank you for it and they will let you go in the drop of a hat if it suited them. I have learnt this the hard way.
		      I wholeheartedly concur. Perhaps the less we cared about our jobs, the more companies would care about retaining us. Unfortunately, most of us are probably expendable and the fact we're willing to break our necks to keep our jobs just makes us that more expendable.   
It's kind of a joke in the US that the first thing we do when we get a job is to start looking for another one. I have to admit though, that this strategy helped me to survive (and thrive) in that job market.
		 
			
			Sorry to go on about this (I'm afraid I can't help it) one of the things that gets me is all this ""we value people"" and ""we believe in attracting and retaining talent"" and ""we're spending xx million CHFs on creating the workplace of the future"".   
And - oh - sorry - but it's not actually YOU we value - and we don't really value YOUR talent. In fact we only want CHEAP people and that's all we care about - talent or no talent - just be cheap. And we are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of CHFs on a tree in a courtyard, or some fish in a pond, or several million on a building with unique shaped glass, but spend it on YOU - a person with children to feed - nope sorry.   
This month Novartis employees are going through the regular annual appraisals - and we are expected to rate ourselves on the Novartis ""values and behaviours"" some of which are: loyalty, trustworthiness, honesty. Isn't that great    
It's not new of course, and I'm not naive enough to believe that any job is safe these days, nor do I think that the place I work is anything other than a business aimed at making money - but the hypocrisy and heartlessness of it all still astounds me even now.
		 
			
			Yep they will value you and your work. You may deserve a 3.3 because you busted your behind off and did Great work all year but because you are not the boss 's body, you can't get the 3.3.    
They may have 2 of those 3.3 availables for the whole team (yes, because it doesn't really work on merit, noooooo)  even if 5 of team did an outstanding work.          I understand but don't agree with your anger toward the corporations. Cutting jobs simply makes the world a more efficient place, so that resources are redistributed in a better way. Shifting jobs doesn't kill jobs, it just moves it from a place where a graduate earns 100,000 CHF (and asks if he/she can survive on that  ) to a poorer country where a graduate will do the same work and take less perks, for a tenth of the cost and feed his/her children/parents. What is so bad about it    
I don't see any hypocrisy; we do like to work in places with beautiful ponds, nice buildings etc., don't we? They need the frills to keep the uber-rich top management happy. Is that fair? That someone who earns 1 millions was spared but someone at 100k was axed? Well, for that you need to ask whether you believe in capitalism, free markets and all those fundamental things.   
OK, the patent is expiring, it may be the cliff for the corporation. But why only look at it form the corporation's / financial perspective? The drug going generic means more people are going to be able to afford it, more lives will be saved, that is a good thing for me even if a few thousand jobs are axed as a result. Sorry.
		     
what a very simplistic view of life you have!   
Do you have any idea how much time, effort and money it takes to get a new drug on the market? if a company can make more money producing generic cough syrup then producing the cure for malaria, then in your world they will just produce the cough medicine, no lives will be saved.
		    I was only commenting about the immediate fallout of two important drugs of Novartis becoming generic shortly. One is, jobs are being cut. Second is, those drugs will soon be accessible to more people. Third is, people in low cost countries are going to benefit from new jobs created. That is all in the short term.   
I was not commenting on how the whole pharma industry or the whole world ought to work, or on the merits of patents etc.
		    BTW, what exactly is your more nuanced, complex view of lofe? That Novartis is the villain for moving jobs to a cheaper place? Just curious.
		    as you ask   
Cheaper is not better, places are cheaper for a reason, less protection for workers, environment, safety etc etc its greed, that's all, bosses in there ivory towers want bigger bonuses, shareholders want more dividends and screw the people actually doing the work.   
I'm not saying the patent system is fair, or unfair, but it doesn't really seem to me that it gives companies much incentive to invest huge sums of money and opens them up to considerable risks for someone else to then be able to copy there work without taking any risks at all.
		 
			
			OK, that I can agree, cheaper is not necessarily better (or worse; I can point out areas where superior quality is available for far lower price, so we can't generalize).   
I also don't know if the patent system is fair, it is complex subject for me.   
Yippee, I got my 10th post    
			
			@chandra and @glinna 
Of course I have known that all along and have been learning that over and over again as well. At the same time, I have to also add that I have been working for more than three decades now and have worked around the world except the USA. Loyalty used to be appreciated by both the employers and the employees, and although  people did get the sack once in a while,   is that this ""commoditisation"" of the work force picked up traction around the world since the dot.com bust and has now become the norm.    
I have come to accept that the only person who will take up for you or look after you is going to be you yourself. You need to protect yourself and in order to do that and to survive in the modern work place one needs to be a selfish, lying, cheating, self serving ba$£@rd. I have become a cynic and will never trust anyone at work.
		 
			
			Whats to stop us setting up a white collar union? it does sound a bit indulgent to those that do real work, but I would certainly enjoy standing on a petrol drum rallying the troops and hurling cusswords at management      
Seriously, regardless of how much you earn we are all human beings and deserve to be treated accordingly. Some of the despicable HR tactics I've seen used at my level (pitting people against each other, stringing them along with promises of promotion then sacking them etc..) would result in a factory walk out if applied to our blue collar colleagues.
		    When I started, it used to be the Industrial Relations dept. Then it became Personnel dept. which then metamorphosed into Human Relations, then Human Relations & Development etc. The latest fad is Human Capital. Its the same people doing the same job.   
In my last organisation, the redundancies were always announced and carried out in the 3rd week of December. One would be called to a conference room, told about the sack, offered a package and then made (pressured) to sign the papers. All in about 30 mins. Then you taken back to your work place only to find yourself cut off from e-mail and rest of the network. You would be given 15 minutes to pack while the the HR person would be standing there watching over you and then you would be escorted out of the door. No time for phone calls, goodbyes what ever. I had a colleague who wasn't even allowed to go back to her desk. Her stuff was sent to her by FedEx after 45 days. I was lucky. They needed me and actually asked me stay for another few months. Human Relations dept. normally turns out to be most inHuman one...
		    This underlines the fact that we would benefit from some form of union representation. I've just found out from a German colleague that not only are white collar workers unionised, but the main union has an office in Zurich to protect Germans working in CH.
		    Happened to someone I knew where I worked in UK.  Very upsetting for him and the people he managed, who had to watch him being escorted out.
		    Happened to someone I knew at Novartis too       In my old company it was affectionately known as ""Human Remains""       Merry Frickin' Christmas, right?! Imagine having to tell your WHOLE family over the holidays that you lost your job    
One of my former companies actually had security guards walk you out - in front of everyone so as to instill fear in those who remained, I suppose.   
And the box they offered was so small that you almost certainly had to leave some belongings behind.
		    Merry Christmas indeed. How sensitive and considerate!   
In most of the cases, and especially with the my last company, the lay offs could have been easily avoided by effecting 10% salary cuts across the board and reducing or downgrading perks (i.e. economy class travel instead of business) etc. However, those deciding didn't want to lose out on anything for themselves. Their only interest was short term, just making the numbers look good for that moment. Whatever happened to the actual work was not considered, as long as they met their targets and got their bonuses.
		    ha ha. Yes, if it existed. Banks/businesses getting bailouts and corporations getting selective assistance are pretty far from that though - it is so tied up with government it is anything but free. i.e. Corporatism
		    Ya, times are very tough now
		    It seems to be like that at any big company these days. When the financial crisis was dawning on big business, they made massive cuts to prepare for the worst. I think most can agree they cut too deep. But those who continue/d to have jobs, obviously for fear they would be next, took on the jobs of the others that were cut. 
Then big business either wasn't sure we were not as bad as initially thought, or realized that their productivity soared, and kept things they way they are.  
And they are going to keep squeezing people until productivity does suffer, and when they go to hire again, they will get either experienced personnel at a discount, or less experienced for next to nothing.   
Plus, also in the case with big Pharma companies, like Novartis, Astra Zeneca, Eli Lilly, and so on, much of that ""break thru"" technology is being developed by micro firms, whose only means of support is grants from the bigger firms( Such as Astra Zeneca's grants to Palatin Tech who is developing Pepid receptor stuff), when the firms hit pay dirt/oor FDA approval, then the companies who have paid the grants have first dibs on the research, and when they clunk out in phase 2 or 3 trials, the grants stop, and the micro companies either fold or find their funding from another big company.  
Small Pharma firms have taken the blunt of research and the sacking of jobs for a long time now, but if research fails in 10 small research companies, that hire between 30 and 50 people each, every few months, it doesn't make headlines. But that sort of relationship has helped the big pharmas stay big.    
I don't see why anyone would boycott a company that is making life saving or life changing drugs, except if there is that kind of level of animal cruelty being given. Plus, if you are going to boycott companies based on over working their employees, hiring in exchange cheaper ones elsewhere, and just basically screwing everyone over while they continue to churn out healthy profits, while still issuing ""warnings"" things are only going to get worse, they that appears to be most of any big company world wide right now.   
Although I do agree, big business seems to be getting worse and more greedy, and self employed and small entrepreneurs are getting shut out, so we can ""save"" bigger brand names cause they are apparently more important, and adhere to socialism as opposed to pure capitalism. Boycott everyone, and get your medicines from the home made herbs concoctions at Apothekes like the one in Einsiedln.    
Sorry, long day at work :  nervous:       It has ,for Novartis       
Yes, Yes, save the company, not the people.
		    Great idea. But how many people do you know that would willingly take a 10% pay cut so that somebody they don't even know can keep their job? Relatively few, I'd wager. Then you have an increased risk that the most qualified people will leave the company to get their higher pay back (whereas I do know people that have accepted jobs in companies undergoing cuts - as long as the pay is right, they're confident they can outperform and aren't at risk).   
I'm not saying its right or wrong - but the people making these kinds of decisions do give thought to alternatives as well, and each has it's own risk.
		 
			
			There is a protest planned in Basel and ""outside the Chairman's villa"" on Saturday.          The pay cut is not for that one unknown person alone but to protect job losses from the entire organisation. Many people in many organisations do this. E.g. during the 2008-2009 crisis, Emirates airline in Dubai offered upto 6 months unpaid leave to its staff explaining the reasons and appealing for help. I know of entire departments within Emirates (of course not all staff together), in spite of having tremendous pressure of work, volunteering to take upto a month's unpaid leave. Cabin crew actually took upto six months. During the same time, Lufthansa had announced internally that there would be no job cuts - to reduce the number of staff they would not create new positions and just not fill up the vacancies occurring naturally. If this didn't help, they would administer pay cuts upto 20%.   
I know for a fact that in my last organisation majority of the employees were more than willing to accept pay-cuts till the situation improved. However, that would have meant the top 10 persons losing out on substantial amounts.
		    I'd gladly take some unpaid leave from Emirates, as long as they'd thrown in some First Class vouchers to use during the prolonged vacation  .
		    Working for an airline you would get free or rebated tickets on ""sub-load"" basis. The class of travel depends upon your level/grade within the company.
		    I'm curious as to why there's a protest on a Saturday but not a job walk-out during the week? Perhaps fear? And the news reporting this protest will most likely ensure that the Chairman won't even be there.
		    And when you have been at it for a few years, your happy close family members (not just wife and children but brothers and sisters (  tee hee)) get to travel with for similarly lovely concessions.       
Brother has worked for airlines for 25 years and has been made redundant 3 times.  But brother-in-law must have had the worst of it .. worked for the public sector in the UK for 25 years and has had to reapply for his various jobs 9 times now, during which he suffered redundancy twice.  I've never heard of anything nearly as bad in the private sector.
		    With Emirates, its also for parents, parents-in-law etc. I still get two frees (ID90%) from my sibling. The only issue is, if I have to go to SFO or LAX I have to go to Dubai first and then connect.   
I know in the UK the public sector redundancies have been happening quite regularly and they are going to be worse with all these austerity measures. Think about the Greek public sector workers         
And the next time there is redundancy, pay everyone 20% less and downgrade to travel by rail, or sea and give them second hand desktops etc. Those who don't like it can quit   Nice way to attract and retain talent.    
Jokes apart, I am really curious to know from the corporate's perspective, why some of them handle redundancies so daftly, insensitively. I am all for cutting or moving jobs elsewhere as the market forces dictate, but do it  .
		    because some people don't take too kindly to losing there jobs, and do things like send out emails to the whole company, copy company data, steal company property etc etc   
I was at one company as a contractor, the parent company pulled the plug, all the permies where called into one room, all us contractors where called into another, while the permies where being told they had lost there jobs we where busily running round the office collecting up the laptops, desktops and company phones to stop them going walkies, which is exactly what happened when they shut one of the london offices, people just left with all the laptops, phones, anything that wasn't bolted down (this was back when a laptop was around £3k a pop)
		    It depends a little bit on the circumstances. The Goldman example is talking about underperformance-related firings, not mass restructurings.   
People are often escorted out the door immediately because of the sensitive information they have access to. Never underestimate the amount of damage a disgrunted worker who has just been handed their marching orders can do.   
Typically anyone who is client-facing will (at a minimum) immediately be taken off client work, and if there aren't constructive things they can be doing, they may be sent home immediately. Similarly, if you work in research at a big pharma company, you presumably have access to proprietary knowledge -- and since chances are that you're going to end up at a competitor, the sooner they get you out of the research environment, the fewer secrets you can reveal once you've left.   
On the other hand, what Novartis have done in this case isn't necessarily better.  They've given very advanced warning of the cuts, which will take place over the next few years.  On one hand, employees appreciate the advanced notice, but on the other hand, it can feel a little bit like death-by-a-thousand swords.  It really kills morale and leaves the whole company in a black fog for months.  Sometimes a short, sharp cull is actually the easier thing to digest.   
I've been involved in a number of restructuring efforts at a number of companies. It may not feel like it as you're being fired, but in every single case there was always a long discussion about how employees would be impacted and the best approach to how/when they should be told. I really do believe that companies aren't out to be nasty when they fire people -- they're doing the best they can while still protecting the interests of those left behind.    
It comes down to this: there really is no nice way to be fired...      i've seen similar things. in fact, at one firm, we had a very important database. it was a very accurate predictor of who would resign as many people copied this database before resigning...
		 
			
			Most of my friends/classmates are in IT, they expect to find a pink slip on their desk when they reach office any day   May feel heartless, but from the company's perspective, I find it justifiable.   
What I find hard to get is crudeness, like involving security personnel, announcing on the PA system.    
Or, saying 30% of you are going to be axed 6 months from now when we outsource blah blah, but we won't tell you which ones of you will go (as someone was posting an real example earlier). I mean, how can any employee do anything except perhaps the most clerical things under such environment   Won't it do more harm than good? Like disgruntled people stealing data, etc.?
		    I'm sure some are already making 'backups'.
		    what you also have to understand is that a lot of things that happen, and the reason it happens is also down to legal requirements.
		    Canada's public sector is one of the best.
		    Probably the jobs are there but in China. That is where most people are moving right now. China all the way.
		    The above sentence is straight out the PR blurb of the HR dept of any company. When it comes to crunch time, this ""attracting and retaining talent"" BS is the last thing on anyone's mind. In case of my last company, the only thing ""they"" had in mind was to reduce the number of employees to the level specified by the CEO and his HR goon. The questions such as what talent was being lost, how much experience was being lost, how were they to cope with the on going projects, how would the company's image be affected, what impact would it have on the company's customer service etc. were all brushed aside with ""we will see what happens"". Everyone involved was focused on meeting the required target ( number of employees to be reduced) and meeting the budgeted numbers. There were instructions, confidentially, to look for employees over a certain age, above certain grades etc. to achieve maximum value for each ""hit"".   
The pay cuts and reduced perks etc. are only means to tide over tough times. No one says they have to be permanent. If the company is even (reasonably) transparent with the employees, they can respond positively, as was the case with Emirates. The fact that the organisation is doing its bit to protect its employees can have a very positive effect on the employees. I know of a manufacturing company where the orders had almost dried up during the crisis. The employees were offered a 40% pay cut or complete redundancy. Most opted to stay back. During the lean period, those who opted to stay back were asked to perform complete maintenance and overhaul, get the records updated, carry out internal training etc. I can't remember the name of this company - it was a parts supplier to the US auto industry. Its activities are now back to normal.   
In the end, I also agree with Village Idiot that there is no nice way of firing people or getting fired.
		    I would.  In fact I did, back in 2001.  Of course, it didn't help, I got laid off in the 2nd round of lay offs 3 months later (that noone knew were coming, unlike the first one)       Maybe not, But there are certainly some really crap ways...
		    Sure, one worse than the other...
		    May I quote my old Economics Lecturer from University 25 years ago     
He was right.   
Personally, I learnt that in real-life when Big Airways of West London went down the Outsourcing Route for my section and then Swissair went bankrupt.   
Nowadays I go to work to keep out of the way of Mrs OM and to help feed my children    I exaggerate, but I have learnt NOT to love my Employer.
		    Very wise old Lecturer I might add. I have learnt the same lesson the hard way. In the corporate environment at least, you need to love yourself more than anything/anyone      You're comparing apples and oranges here.  A temporary wage reduction (I suspect hours were cut as well) helps cyclical industries like manufacturing and airlines get through tough patches without having to resort to layoffs.   
The Novartis problem is a little different: they're faced with a huge, on-going hit to their income in the form of a patent cliff.  They need to make cuts that will help them remain competitive despite this.  At the same time, they don't want to cut the overall effort in their research & development activity -- that's where their future income will come from -- they just want to do it more cost-effectively.   
Cutting wages by 20% won't help unless those wages can   cut by 20%, and then you have to worry about whether they could continue to attract talent in the Swiss market (particularly as they need to offer high enough salaries to lure a large number of expats to Basel).  By contrast, moving the work to lower-cost environments means that they   get their sustainable 20% savings while still remaining competitive in the local labour market.
		    I totally agree, this is the best way to keep healthy.    
Staff at Novartis apparently accepted to work on Saturdays, thinking they would get anything in return. Sorry but this is naive.    
Only do the bare minimum and have plenty of activities apart from work!
		    Good if you want to stay in your position. But if you have the intention to become CFO, CEO, you have to bust your ass off.    
Each their own on what they want in life.
		    Yes the 320 workers made redundant in Nyon will not make it to CEO or CFO...despite working much more than the German workers who will replace them when their jobs are moved there.    
Work is too expensive in Switzerland, so first local people were replaced by imported staff mainly France and Germany (since 2004) but now with the strong franc this is not enough. Of course the pharma industry has in addition its own problems.
		 
			
			It's relatively easy to sit back and theorize/intellectualize about why it's necessary economically for a large corporation to cut here and cut there. But the tone of some of these posts seem to completely disregard the fact that these are   with lives, with kids, families who face a very uncertain future.   
Easy to be an armchair expert when it's never happened to you, or when you feel ""safe"" in your job and world. But this can happen to anyone - talented or otherwise.   
Someone close to me back in the UK is one person of many I know affected by the economic crisis. He worked in top management for a luxury German car brand for over 20 years and was made redundant last year (in his 50's) He doesn't have a cat in hell's chance of re-entering the workforce in a similar position or indeed any position at the moment. He's become so depressed he's tried to take his own life......he has a family.    
The people ""making the cuts"" while still awarding the top few obscene bonuses can't see the real suffering behind these ""economic"" decisions they're making. I mean come on - why would anyone ""need"" several million a year!!   
Of course people should be rewarded economically for their skills and efforts, but let's face it - the top 1% the CEO's of the world - command salaries and bonuses that are quite frankly obscene. The banks stuffed up yet the top people still get their big bonuses and in the meantime regular people lose their jobs......and look a little further at the situation in the UK and US....people who can't afford to heat their homes, people who can't even afford homes, pensioners and families struggle it's a sorry state of affairs.   
It's a sick world in every sense of the word - and something has to change.
		     
			
			It's a job, not a marriage. 
But we become so involved, engrossed and passionate about our jobs (1/3 of every day) that it sure is hard to remember that it's just a contract.
		    Depends on your employer       (   
Hi, 
I do hope your hubby is ok - please let us know. could you tell me if everyone who is going to be cut will find out before Xmas or will they drag out the cuts for the next few months?
		    You mean you don't want a reasoned debate on the topic but just one sided commiserating, tch-tch-ing for what happened and lambasting companies? I thought showing to the affected parties that there is some logic on the company's side too would also lessen their pain and help them come to grips with the situation, but maybe you know better.      That's simply because the bottom 99% collectively cannot substitute the rare combination of skills, drive, vision that the top 1% has. Companies will founder if it is led by people who are happy with 9-5 routine jobs.   
It is a sick world   You have no idea how much worse this episode could potentially have been; the deal that these retrenched guys will be getting will be seen enviously by many people elsewhere in the world.    
Anyway I would suspect this would be a long term trend, of jobs going to cheaper places, so you'd better get used to it.
		 
			
			When you look at how many millions per years Novartis spend on events for doctors, it is shocking! But what shock me more is how doctors are greedy too. Being paid huge amount of money to attend an event, 5 stars hotel, business trip and family hollidays. Redecorations of offices, etc, etc...   
And someone already mentioned the fish on the Campus.   I can't remember the price of a single one. I just remember how obscene it it indeed.
		    It is important to understand they are cutting now instead to have to cut much more like Roche had to do. A bit now or much more later?
		 
			
			Hi, 
Anyone out there actually know when people at Novartis sites in Swiss will know if they have there job or not? I mean will it be like Pfizer where the process takes months..one article i read mentioned employee consultaions  - what does that mean?
		    Many knows already, many don't I guess.
		     Not very helpful..   
			
			Dear Chandra - one day you may be personally affected by redundancy and job cuts? Wouldn't wish it on anyone...and people generally do see that often these cuts are not done maliciously but are a response that companies have made to outside pressures (share holders, etc)    
Have you ever been affected? Perhaps you have lots of life experience - perhaps you don't have much at all and speak from what you know from books? You tell me?    
I'm on a high horse? That's your perception.   
I'm only speaking from my own life experience, what I see and have seen around me and in various countries where I've lived and worked.   
I've seen too much suffering on a human level as a result of the collapse of entire industries and ""relocation"" of jobs to save money. I grew up in an industrial area of the UK where over a matter of years an entire generation of skilled workers, admin staff, technical staff were laid off as first ship building, then steel works shifted production to the Indian sub-continent.    
We're talking about the destruction of entire communities here  - those jobs, those industries were never replaced, leaving mass unemployment. Have you the slightest idea what that does to a community? To people, to families? What the social impact of such ""policies"" are? I'm not talking ""theories from books"" here - I'm talking, real life. Live and see the effect of these decisions taken.    
So sorry no  I will not get used to"" the fact that jobs are being relocated to  economies with cheaper labour or slave labour. In countries with  questionable human rights. There are millions of people who thank God  refuse to get used to that. And if you've lived in a place affected by these decisions on a massive scale - you wouldn't ""get used to it"" either.   
Your view of the 99% who work 9 - 5 seems somewhat patronizing - and yes that's my perception - maybe you didn't feel that way on writing it.    
There are plenty of people who work 9-5 with vision and drive. There are also people who work 9-5 who do just want to work an honest days work, support their families, and would rather spend time with their families than climbing a career ladder which one day may well fall from beneath them. There are many good people with too much integrity to get involved in the kind of politics and game playing and BS which is often involved in climbing ""getting to the top""
		    Sorry, the 9-5 reference I didn't mean it literally. What i meant was        which I feel is generally true.   
p.s. I would prefer to participate in this thread without getting too personal, but to each their own.
		 
			
			Appreciate the clarification Chandra.   
Regarding getting personal I respect your decision not to answer personal questions -  from my perspective, this thread is extremely personal to us all - it's about a topic that directly impacts people, communities and countries.
		    How am I suppose to answer your question? I didn't go to every single 2000 people to ask them if they know they have been fired or not.    
It may take a while before it is all settle, etc. Do you have an easier question?
		     
According to law, if a company employing more than 300 is terminating at least 30, this is considered mass dismissal and consultations with employees (or their representative body) have to be held. Employees then have the chance to make suggestions to limit the number of dismissals.
		    From the company side, is this ever more than just going through the motions?  Not necessarily a criticism, they'll have thought long and hard about what they need to do.   
The 30 day consultation period just seems to drag out the pain before they can announce anything concrete.
		    Completely agree with that. We were in that position at the start of the year and it was absolutely horrible. They expected everyone to carry on as normal during that time while all the time knowing that 30% of them would be out of a job at the end of it.   
At the end of that time they called two meetings simultaneously. Group A were told they were staying and group B were going. Not nice at all. It was very hard to be happy about keeping your job when so many good people weren't.   
OH was lucky this time but we has been made redundant twice befor (both times in Pharma) so we know what it's like.
		    Yeah, right. Plus the rare combination of all financiers' help and governmental deals that backs up whatever adventurous projects they might have.  
But I'm not complaining  .
		    Is Basel a nice place to relocate to?
		    It will be a pleasure to answer that question if you start a thread on it. So we can stay on topic in this one!        
Thank you ..this is helpful...but I'm not sure it can only be a 30 day  be consultation period becasue some reports say the cuts will happen over 3-5 years..or am I getting that wrong? It's a bit confusing..I mean surely if a company announces cuts ..it should do employees the courtesy of letting them know what is going on asap it's really unfair for those waiting..the mood at campus must be dire!
		    only a newbie..so how do i start a new thread?
		    The 30 day consultation is to discuss with employees (or employee collectives, unions, etc.) alternatives.  The outcome will very likely be that there are still cuts over the next however many years.  But they're not allowed to just start laying people off until the end of the consultation period.
		    Just do whatever it was you did  .
		    same here with Huntsman. Its clear that the production site will be closed but because there is still the consultation phase they declare it as a proposal. what a joke!    
			
			Its time to show that we dont accept all these job losses just because companies like Novartis, Harlan, Huntsman, Swissmetal etc. want to maximise their profits!!    
So please join us all tomorrow for a      Its important that there as many people as possible so please spread this information.  Thanks!
		    This is a good moment to ask if we as foreigners/ausländer/masseneinwanderer are allowed to participate in any political activity, because in the country I come from foreigners cannot even publicly express political opinions.
		           
1 Freedom of expression and of information is guaranteed. 
2   has the right freely to form, express, and impart their opinions. 
3 Everyone has the right freely to receive information to gather it from generally accessible sources and to disseminate it.   
HTH   
Off course, that does not give you the right to do or say everything you want. But to voice your opinion and participate in such an event is certainly legal.   
And a good thing IMHO.      Mojado, you are very welcome to join us tomorrow.
		    Sorry Chandra, that is not the full picture. 
Executive Pay is out of control, I repeat out-of-control!     
Future generations will laugh at us for accepting this!   
I state clearly:   
I have  problem with the likes of the Google Boys, Bill Gates and even Michael O'Leary of Ryanair earning fortunes. 
These people changed the world.  They transformed the way we work, and (if you're unlucky enough to fly them  ) the way we fly.   
They did extraordinary things.   
But too many CEOs are living off the backs of others and NOT doing those things. They are merely glorified Bean-counters out to buy, cut, merge, cut again, ""make the numbers, make the numbers"" mantra not ""make human life better""   
e.g. here's an Executive who certainly had a lot of drive and vision:      
Do you really think Mr. Hurd has a   fiddling his expenses and having a fling (allegedly) with a former pron-star ""actress?
		    Then how come people at Nyon already know they are going..where was their consultation period? It seems to me that this process will take happen as quickly and slowly as Novartis require..and its the employees /families who will suffer whilst waiting......      I think the ""proposal"" for Nyon is to shut the plant.  I don't think there's much interpretation of who will be going.
		 
			
			As far as I know - based on what friends were told, right now in Switzerland nobody has actually been made redundant (as in ""officially asked to leave their job"") some announcements have been made as to which groups and departments are affected, and the numbers of people affected, but not individuals. Now starts the period of consultation - which goes until March - with the employee reps and unions about the conditions and the packages for those who may be made redundant - including the obligation to try and find them an alternative position within the company.   
However, at the moment because some groups are being moved to India, and there are currently no actual staff there, they need people here to stay on until 2013 to train those people up and cover the gap. So some people will be offered a job until the end of 2013. What's not clear is whether those people will then be entitled to redundancy afterwards - and what if the situation changed again before then anyway? These things will have to be negotiated. But this is a really bum deal as who would want to stay in that situation? Watching your friends and colleagues being laid off, knowing that you yourself are only there to train your replacement and then will be got rid of too. I mean, how on earth would you motivate people?   
A lot of people who may have a good chance of staying are already job hunting and I guess that this is in fact what the company wants - to minimise the redundancy it has to pay out.   
OK guys, I'm really done with this topic now - I think we all need to just button lip and move on in whatever way we can. After all, things are not going to change now are they! Thanks everyone for your well wishes to us personally by the way - I appreciate your thoughts, I'm sure that we'll be OK somehow, not sure what will happen job-wise still, but that's life isn't it?!
		    Why can't it be on a Sunday when there's nothing else to do?  Why do you have to spoil shopping day?   
better yet do it on a work day in front of the Novartis campus... that would really make a point.
		    Very, very well said Stephanie. Its so easy so brush these things aside by saying how necessary they are to the survival of the company etc. I really hope and pray that this doesn't happen to anyone any time, but this a real world and we are dealing with real people as you say. Some nice words about ""Corporate Social Responsibility"" sound very appealing in promotional brochures and company websites but, I guess, that's where it ends. Families, communities and some times even cities get wiped out while trying to meet the numbers and pleasing the shareholders. I don't know what the solution is to all this but definitely a drastic change in how we look at things is, will be required.    
This and my other comments earlier on this thread are fairly general and not specific to the Novartis situation.
		    In my husband's old team, they already know who are going to leave and how many.      Because on sunday, that street is dead. So nobody to see the manifestation. And usually, a manifestation to express an opinion in a way that can bother people, so people acknowledge the situation the manifestation is for.
		 
			
			Stephanie, while I sympathise and empathise about this situation, I have some questions to ask about you view of the situation:    So, what is the solution here?   
Surely if the default rule is to just keep people who are not contributing to the overall profitability of the organisation onboard, then eventually the whole organisation is going to go under and nobody will be employed?      What about those employees still at the company?   
If the offer was made to every other employee in the company that they could give thier job up to save one of thier co-workers jobs, what do you think the average decision would be?   
Are there any ""unreal people"" who don't have lives, no kids, no families that face a perfectly sure future?      Sorry, this is a comment rather than a question: 
Many of us are or have been in situation and have survived.  This is nothing unusual in today's society and it is better to think of it as an environmental factor rather than being the victim of something other than the fact that we have been living unrealistically for the last while and there is a needed adjustment coming along.  I find the constant ""victim"" culture surrounding the crisis to be disengenuous to those of us that are trying our damdest to weather it and come out the other side in better state.  Some soul searching is due and not just at management levels.      Who decides what is ""obscene"" and what is ""needed""? 
Do the proliterate or the bourgeoisie? 
Is is democratically agreed? 
Is there a band or just one wage? 
Are you allowed to mass personal wealth? 
How are we going to impliment this new system and how are we going to right the inequalities that currently exist?   
Most importantly, how are we going to avoid the very dangerous systems that we implemented in the last century to fix this problem that you are talking about?      Sorry a point here, yes, it is not a perfect world but it is so much better than in was just 4 or 5 generations ago.  The poor now live better than the vast majority did in those days.      I agree with you fully on this but it is getting better.  I just believe it is vitally important to see the opportunites that are exposed by these situations rather than being a victim of them.   
And I really hope that we can all see it like this and work together to make things better.
		 
			
			being relatively young, i've grown up in an environment where a 'job for life' or a 'defined benefit pension' is a mythical thing. while you could say this is a bad things since we lost out economically, it is also good since it is clear that:   
1. nobody owes you a living/job 
2. you can be fired at any time and 5 years in the same job/company is a pretty good run 
3. if you don't like it, don't take the job 
4. you have to make your own provision for contingencies and emergencies because you're not in nursery any more and nobody is going to wipe your bum for you   
personally, i would quite like to be self-employed and avoid various hassles that come with employment. then again, i recognise what a fantastic deal being paid a (high) salary is especially since the only thing you have to do is show up for 50 hours a week or so.   
try starting your own business and see how 'easy' it is just to earn 20% of your gross salary.
		   [QUOTE=wattsli1;1390761]As far as I know - based on what friends were told, right now in Switzerland nobody has actually been made redundant (as in ""officially asked to leave their job"") some announcements have been made as to which groups and departments are affected, and the numbers of people affected, but not individuals.

Sorry one last question-I thought the consultation period was 30 days! not 5 months!
		 
			
			Question here:   
Who are the ones the most at risk to be fired in a situation like this today?   
In a team of 30, you have to fire 5 of them. What would be the ''the trigger'' to decide who's in, who's out?
		    This is the problem with the world today. 
I do not have the news in English but today Whirlpool decided to layoff 5000 people.   
You can say: reduction costs.   
But the truth is unbelievable. They have rose the earning but not as much as promised.   
Let me quote Queen: Is this the world we created?
		    You know, I'll just guess that you a) didn't grow up in the US and b) didn't grow up in the privileged class as I did both and I'll tell you that the 1% has none of the above skills. Lots of those in the 90% do, but not that 1% who have been taking in the most of the cash over the years. Leaders of companies, with the exception of very few, are mostly paid toadys. Lots of people get a fine education, bust their arse for years and never make the kind of cash the 1% have.    
In the words of Herr Ghandi....It takes money to make money. The 1% don't work. You'll just have to trust me on that.
		    You are not serious, right? It sounds so bookish, new MBA sort of thing. Look around..
		    Sorry for offtopic but i think there are many points in this thread now to discuss.   
For example  talking about offshoring or displacement. Did you see the news about USA moving out of China because the minimum wage is now on 200 dollars?   
Like india where 10 000 - 20 000 dollars/year is the value of a freshman in IT.   
With the overhead of offshore management and ppl earning 10, 20 or 30k dollars the value of India offshore is decreasing (with lower salaries in europe).   
Now the next paradise is Indonesia.   
PS: And i as many, been told at 2 pm to pack thing and go out at 5 pm. This was on Qimonda, the Siemens memory group.   
Globalization ......so what to do? Being one step ahead....moving or managing.
		 
			
			So sorry to hear that. It is a tough tough world out there.   
And you are asking some excellent questions.   
Do wonder though how many pharma and IT people stood up for the Miners and the steel workers not that long ago?
		    Dont forget textile workers too.
		    Commiserations. Its really tough. Hope you got a decent package. Thankfully you are in one of the best countries to be in , in such situations. I don't know your personal circumstances but normally you should be covered by the unemployment insurance which is fairly decent.   
The new paradise(s) are Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines and also the east European countries.
		    very good post this.    
You have to take the good with the bad. I don't think people were complaining when plasmas, notebooks, ipods, smartphones et al became so much cheaper and accessible for them because the whole hardware manufacturing industry moved to the Far East. Of course, people were laid off in the first world then as well but since it lead to cheaper gadgets for everyone, the majority were happy with it.   
A sense of entitlement will not take you anywhere in this globalized world. It didn't surprise me that kids were running off with flatscreens and such during the London riots. It seems to me that there is a growing sense of entitlement where everyone thinks they deserve a life where they have the big home, the SUV and the flatscreen and the other electronic gadgets.   
I did find it ironical and hilarious that the OccupyWallStreet lot are now complaining that the homeless and other ""vagrants"" are going to Zuccotti Parkto get a free meal; and are freeloading off them.  .    
   So now that they are excluding the approximately 6.5% with criminal  records, does that make them the 92.5%, are they are going to have to  change all their signs?      
Bit of a rant this and I do agree that there are lots of CEO and upper management who are essentially incompetent and hardly deserve their pay. However, luck and being at the right place at the right time will always lead to such instances. It doesn't mean that the world is unfair or against you.
		    Zero. The Miners and steel workers had unions. Unfortunately, unions or not and protests or not don't get you any more than 6 CHF will get you a coffee at starbucks. It's a noble thing these OWS folks are doing, but in the end, protests don't do much. It takes money to move money and to move those with more money than you. Welcome to the playground 30+ years on and with more at stake than the monkey bars.
		 
			
			Novartis has always blackmailed Switzerland by saying they would leave the country if the good conditions were not granted.    
OK now that they leave, can we get discounts on their drugs? I bet we will still have to pay 5 X the UK price for a box of paracetamol or ibuprofen.    
And ok they are still active in Basel but most employees are French or German. This is the first step to save money. Some departments are full of Indians and Chinese, I have seen it myself.    
I am not racist or anything but you cannot claim to be Swiss and act differently. They should not be allowed to call themselves ""Swiss pharma company"" because they are half US half Indian
		    Not to be contentious but....are there qualified Swiss in Switzerland who could fill those jobs filled by foreigners? The companies aren't here for the labor, but for the tax haven, we all understand that but once the currency is pricing you out of the market, the nationality of the labor isn't the important bit leading to the layoffs. Without the furriners, there's only what, 5 million Swiss? That's like only part of the Boston metro with plenty of imports, just to give you an idea of scale.
		 
			
			UktoSwiss, are you serious about that? As far as I know so did Nokia in Finland. What about taxes? Not to mention that having a company as Novartis it is a question of prestige that many countries would wish for.  
And you sure there were so many Swiss available for those jobs occupied by foreigners?         And how many with the right qualification and work experience needed for those positions.       Nokia isn't the best comparison ATM as it's about to shed a big chunk of people but, yes, of the 2% of foreigners in Finland, a very high percentage of them were/are either employed directly by Nokia or contractors thereof.
		    Yes this is always what they say. We Swiss are stupid.  
Prior to 2004 it was much more difficult for companies to hire EU staff and companies managed very well.    
But this is not against foreigners, but against our right-wing (FDP and SVP) politicians who serve the interests of big firms and health insurance companies, and totally ignore the needs of families. Next elections they will be punished even more. This weekend I join SP.
		    Oh my God! Please do not understand I suggested this nonsense. The Swiss are definitely NOT stupid. (there are a lot of others disputing this adjective  , I'm joking now). It is only unlikely that a small country will be always producing the demanded amount of qualified people for a certain field, especially pharma, IT etc.  the same time producing the exact amount of farmers, cleaning staff, nurses etc.
		 
			
			A French boss working in Switzerland told me that he would like to hire Swiss staff, but they are too expensive so he hires French staff. This is how we are treated! 
Of course there is always some need for foreigners and everybody is welcome. But employers like Novartis who use the Swissness to sell and misbehave should be named and shamed.
		    That's an awful thing to write!  Of course Novartis can claim to be Swiss .think of all the extenal servies/jobs etc that have been created to cater for the needs of the Novartis employees! Surely these roles are being fulfilled by the Swiss. and Novartis' workforce cannot simply be Indian and Chinese!  one of who  
happens to be my husband! an Indian who's worked in India, Uk and now Basel..he wasn't employed becasue of his nationality but becasue of his skills!
		 
			
			Hi All, 
am going to leave this thread now..as lots has been said and realistically this is going to go on now until at least the first quarter of next year....I'm praying people are able to find a way out of the coming  onslaught and that personally  we are able to cope with what happens...positive thought people.....   
			
			""Do wonder though how many pharma and IT people stood up for the Miners and the steel workers not that long ago?!""   
Not me.  I was at school    It was actually quite a long time ago (in the UK at least - not sure when the Swiss coal mines shut down *cough*).   
Anyway, I'm surprised IT people such as me haven't already gone the way of the coal miners.  When I was at Uni, around 20 years ago (ouch!) I did a mix of Electronic Engineering and Computing.  Loads of people were doing pure computing and it looked very easy.  Every year people kept studing IT.  The market must have been flooded.   
And then people rebelled and said ""IT is for geeks"".  Wahay!  There's been a shortage ever since.  However, I still thought the market would be dead after we'd all done all those fixes and upgrades for the four digit year 2000 change.  And then I thought it would be over once we sorted all the banking systems when the Euro was introduced almost exactly 10 years ago. (Maybe there'll soon be work in altering the number of digits needed to store Drachma.)   
And then along came outsourcing.   
But here I am, being paid a comfortable, if not extremely high salary, to sit in an ergonomically designed chair, in a temperature controlled office, to surf the net, chat to colleagues and do the occasional bit of work which I actually enjoy.   
How come?  Don't know.  I'm still surprised the work is available and we haven't all been made redundant and replaced with 20 year old genetic engineering students in the workforce.   
Cool!     
Life is easier than I thought it would be. Even if I lost my job tomorrow, it's been a good run.  I'll still moan though.  And of course have financial issues.  But hey.
		 
			
			Dear Colin,   
Novartis is profitable.       
 - laying people off and relocating has everything to do with wanting  - rather than fighting against loss.    
The criticism is actually less about a specific company and more about a way of thinking - more about a world driven by greed.   
Regarding top pay:   
Basically no-one body or person can ""decide"" on what is an acceptable amount for a top CEO to earn - but in a true democracy why not ask the people? I mean - really, we all know what the cost of living is here in Switzerland, we are all aware of what range of salaries allow for a hard life/comfortable life. What does one person need?       
""Novartis president and former CEO Daniel Vasella was the top earner, taking home    
Why not ask the general public - the people what is acceptable pay for a top CEO?       
I have been out and had one too many cosmopolitans tonight so can't really give a more coherent answer than that at the moment!!
		    If a company wants to maximize its profits that is greedy         24.5 mil CHF seems to be within   for pharma sector; comparing CEO salaries across industries is like comparing apples and bananas. In fact, given the high prices of meat in Switzerland, I would have expected the Novartis CEO to be given a   pay    
p.s. the current CEO's salary seems to be around 10 million; Daniel Vasella's 24.5 includes the golden handshake component; his normal salary would be less.    
But anyway I like your notion of ""true democracy"", asking people to fix CEO salaries, would love to see it being implemented. General public, you mean the whole canton will vote, or CH or Europe or the whole world should vote?
		    Having CEOs gain more than lets say 20 times than what the the rank and file get is just plain wrong, especially if they announce massive firings at the same time.  This is morally and socially unforgivable, and we will pay a heavy price for it.   
			
			Bankers bonuses for failing banks who owe the State billions,  footballers salaries ... not just in CH (sadly).   
As Cameron says - 'never forget we are all in this together' (yeah oh yeah).   
Thinking of you all who are at risk of losing or have lost their jobs- even worse when you have uprooted the family for said job. Bonne chance.
		    What price would that be? People seem to think those protesting in the OWS vein to be stupid and few want to picket outside a CEO's home so....what price does/or will a CEO pay for soaking up that kind of salary? None. None until there is such a crisis that even the middle-class in their relative luxury feel so impinged by such an inequity that even they are moved to protest and/or riot. Wrong isn't the issue, the issue is how much will it take for those who feel it is wrong to forcibly make it right.
		 
			
			And? How was the protestation?
		 
			
			I know I am coming in late for th discussion but I can say a few things, NVS is already understaffed as many people have already been flocking away from it. I am really sorry for all the people that will lose a job, and I do not know whether I feel lucky or not that I quit a few months ago, I just found out the company I will work for has been bought by another one...darn...
		    fighting against a loss is also wanting 'more profit'. ultimately, the directors have a fiduciary duty to the company and so are to act in the best interest of the company which may not be the same as the best interest of all employees (at least not current ones).   
although hopefully will be in the best interest of employees in the long term by cutting unprofitable lines and growing and developing more profitable lines which in the future will give rise to better jobs (just witness what happens to companies which fail to move with the times, they might preserve jobs for a few years, but ultimately lose everything).      because the general public have nothing to do with it. novartis has shareholders who do have voting rights and can exercise them.
		    Do you feel that it is socially wrong for CEOs only or for anybody else to gain so much?
		    Hmm. In some departments at NVS you see more people passing through than in other departments. However, the objective-centered high performance atmosphere at NVS also makes people to take on more work than what is generally accepted in other companies. I have worked at 4 different pharma companies, and never was working as hard as now in NVS (except when working in the hospital). And this is not only due to understaffing, but also due to high expectations from management and the way our salary system is organized.   
Now this is a self-selecting thing, and the people staying (aka not leaving by themself) are the ones feeling good at this. I do not know how this translates in the upper management regions. But I do know that the job cuts affect both low-educated and high-educated people. And that it affects not only Swiss. Actually, 19 out of 20 people that I know that have been notified that their job will disappear are non-Swiss people.   
It is interesting to see how the reactions on this thread ventured into the ""old discussion"" of how large business should behave, around the balance of profitability and loyalty to the employees, and around the Swiss vs non-Swiss thing. It is easy for me to say that - ""if I am sr management, I would do things differently, with more loyalty to my employees"". However, I am not sr management, and I do not know how they come to decisions. Maybe I don't want to know.   
I feel sorry for my colleagues who will be out of a job soon. When the news was made public (pm Basel time) the affected colleagues were already notified in the am. We were informed that every one of them will have consultations with HR to see if they can be placed somewhere else in the company. I heard (not confirmed) that no new external people will be hired for several months to give the internal people a chance to find a job inside NVS. So, at least NVS is doing something to ease the pain. For some (higher educated / project managers) it will be easier than for others (animal care people). I am already reaching out to my network to try and help some of them with a new job. Still, it is extremely difficult and challenging for everybody who is about to loose his/her job.
		    Cheaper workforce, less regulation, no stress , no question, no syndicate results  more profit.
		    It may sound brutal, but it is NOT the job of a company to create or maintain jobs. IF the steps now taken stabilize and/or improve the company, not short-term but medium-term and long-term, in the interests of medium- and long-term shareholders and the company as such, alright. Only the future will tell whether they at Novartis made the right decisions. I hope they did.
		    I agree with you. Companies like Novartis should be free to operate where it is in their interest to do so.    
BUT governments should be free to fix the price of drugs, unlike here where Novartis blackmailed Switzerland by saying: keep overcharging the Swiss or we go. Now that they go then we should have access to cheaper drugs!   
Fortunately Switzerland is small and hence it is possible for most to buy OTC drugs abroad.
		    I would have less of a problem if it were the owner of the company and not some ""oh-you've-f*ed-up-here-take-your-golden-parachute-manager"". But still.   
Anyway, while I agree with the statement, it is not mine. It is by Peter F. Drucker, the old commie..   
			
			Hi , 
 I know its been over a week since the big announcement..does anyone out there know if the protest had any effect? Has anyone out there heard anything?    
			
			I saw   and was wondering if this was a fresh set of cuts, or were they taken into account when the 2000 cuts were announced?       
			
			Novartis won't be leaving Nyon or fire people in there after all.    
Source:    
I don't know the details but to me it looks like they blackmailed canton Vaud.
		    Wow, that is cynical.  I suppose some are never content.  First they are the devil for cutting jobs, now they are blackmailers because they are keeping them.   
I for one however applaud the effort taken by all parties to attempt to come to a better outcome.
		    That's the truth. I just hope no other companies follow suit and start telling the newspapers they're going to leave X or Y canton and then wait until the authorities offer them a fiscal discount in order to stay.
		    What, you hope they just up and leave then? Just shut down things and pack up because it is easier. You don't think industry, government and the people dont need to work co-operatively? You think that Switzerland is an easy place to produce things with the strength of the currency and the current economic climate in the world? You think that Novartis should make a loss and just swallow that?   
Well, I have some news for you. Those pensions and securities and all those wonderful things that people take as a ""right"" are very much tied to the success of companies such as Novartis and if the company fails, then everybody will feel it, that simple. If the company withdraws, it won't pay taxes there anymore and the local communities will feel the pain. If the company goes bankrupt, then the local communities will feel the pain. These things are linked, no matter whether you like it or not. If you can figure out a way to unlink them, I suggest you go into politics.
		    Yes whatever... but who says they're making a loss in a particular site? Novartis themselves, of course, and if it wasn't true they'd easily create that loss, there are many clean ways of doing it.
		    I don't know how to answer that.  You are the one accusing them of things.  Do you have any proof?  I am sure they have auditable books that must have some public record?  Do you know something that was not brought up at the press conference?  I just honestly think that it is better for these groups to work together to find a solution than to sit around sulking about ""the big corporate evils"" and accusing them of things without providing proof of thier wrong doing.   
You would not want the public to assume that you are guilty until proven innocent, right?

			Life in prison just doesn't seem harsh enough!
		    The Local shows clearly that life free in Switzerland is indeed far worse.    
BTW: Thanks to the local for the adjective, I was wondering if the axe murder was brutal or gentle. I feel informed now.
		    The BeaUty of great journalism!
		 
			
			Apparently in some cultures, the brutal, violent murder of one your offspring is less dishonourable than, e.g. having a Christian boyfriend. Until that mindset changes for millions of people, this kind of thing will continue to happen.   
She should have gone to the police when he tried to electrocute him. At least there are laws here to protect people from this kind of vile cultural practice.
		 
			
			We had a discussion here a few months back saying that those things happen very rarely and only in remote villages in muslim countries. Guess not...
		 
			
			Im not comenting about the article, but if someone else reads this forum and identifies with the situation please know that there are institutions to help you,    
If this girl went back to her parents after he tried to electrocute her, I can only think she didnt know she had any other option.   
The Frauenhaus is a refuge for women who are abused phisically or psicologically, or both. the violence can come from the husband, partner, gay partner, son, daughter, parents etc. Any type of violence that makes you feel unsafe at your place.  
So I dont get the eyebrow raised from the ones that think Im sexist, I can also say that there is the same for men who are abuse by the wife etc. 
There are social workers who know how to proceed, where to call etc.   
If you dont know how to contact them or does not speak German, please get in touch with me. But do not risk your life.
		 
			
			We have a trial case right in Canada about honor crime where 4 women died.  is the name to look for.
		      Well, to be fair, The Local is not the only news reporter to use seemingly unnecessary adjectives in headlines.
		    Yes. But when it comes down to the Local, it is easier to openly and directly criticized it.        I think I'll befriend The Local and give them some greenies.
		    Honor is not the word to use here.   
Compare this case to the one of the peeing Marines - no rage nor promise of bloody retribution from the general public.    
maybe in  case - not likely,  either.
		    It is called honor crime, that you agree on it or not.
		    It is called ""Honor crime"" in some backward countries, in the west (i.e Canada) - it's called ""family crime"" (see your own link).   
Killing a family member for having sex out of wedlock is not honorable, neither does having sex diminish the family's honor - don't you agree ?
		    Only in backwards societies where such is accepted.   
Here, and in other civilized societies, it's called a disgusting, evil, senseless crime.   
Tom
		    I hope that you are only referring to English speaking western countries. Because in German, it's   and in French   (as far as I can remember, also Norwegian: æresdrap/æremord, Danish æresdrab, Dutch erenmoord). The reason given for these crimes is as bad a reason can be for a crime, nevertheless it's the one they claim to have for them. Hence the name.   
But it may be totally different in the English language, no problem.
		    Yes, on the Canadian news, they talk about crime d'honneur. Because Shafia was found saying at multiple time that his honor was more important than anything else.   
You have to listen the French news though.
		 
			
			In England it's also called an honor crime. Evil and disgusting still come to mind though.
		    Well of course. It is absolutely immoral and barbarian.
		    I agree. The concept of Honor should be replaced by dignity - especially when morals are concerned.
		 
			
			Call it what you will, there is nothing ""honorable"" about it.   
It's about as honorable as urinating on dead bodies (less, actually).   
Calling it an ""honor crime"" is supporting the evil scum who commit such acts.   
Tom
		    I agree with you totally. I am not the one who called and named it like this. Who took the decision to give that name in French and other language I don't know. But I would guess it is because it is related to what the murder call the reason for that crime. To wash their ""honor"". As sick as it is.
		    Why?   
The term is often written within quotation marks precisely because of the point Nil makes above.
		    Here now under accusation by court is not what may be honourable or dishonourable somewhere but simply a 53 years old killer who committed premeditated murder. I only hope they do not go down to ""Totschlag im Affekt"" but regard it as what it was, and that is ""Vorsätzlicher Mord"".    
Here above mentioned is of course the accusation of the Attorney of State for the Proscecution but neither the plea of the lawyer of the defence nor the verdict of the court.   
**************************************************  ***********************       ""Ehrenmord"" may be a term in Germany, but here in Switzerland it either  is Mord or Totschlag. A cousin of me who is lawyer for the defence in  such a case would go for ""Totschlag im Affekt"" even if feeling  personally for ""geplanter Mord"", and in view of his convincing  capability would succeed to reduce the sentence from life-imprisonment  to 10 or 15 years (only)   
**************************************************  ************************************       
AND, the term of ""honour crime"" is not a  at all. It  therefore is used in the media, but in justice only in ""quotation  marks"". And this applies to most countries on earth including countries  where it happens a bit more often than over here. There is a very small  number of countries where it is seen differently.   
**************************************************  ****************************
		    .... it's the same.   
You mix up juridical concepts (Mord, Totschlag) and general public vocabulary (Ehrenmord). Which is strange because you don't mix them up in your answer to Karenin. Of course there is no Ehrenmord in German/Swiss law books!! Duh!
		    If so we agree. EXCEPT that I even oppose to the media accepting the term directly or indirectly as they should simply abstain from taking over the term   
Quite to the contrary, the lawyer for the defence will carefully abstain from this term, but emphasize that the father simply was in a fit of fury about the whole affair and had .... etc ... etc ...  AND if he succeeds in this will get the sentence down by many years
		 
			
			Well, like it or not,   the term exists. Note the Human Rights Watch definition.   
If ""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"", an abomination remains an abomination whatever it is called.

			Switzerland ratcheted up sanctions against Iran on Thursday, announcing it was freezing the assets of 180 Iranian people and enterprises.             
Finally: It will be legal for US to confiscate Iranian assets and use them to pay 9/11 victims:     Judge: Iran, Taliban, al Qaeda liable for 9/11   
Not only, it may also legalize the kidnapping of al Qaeda supporters (Iranian officials)
		    A)  I don't know how many Iranian assets there (still) are in the USA 
B)  That judge for sure needs immediate psychiatrist care
		    It doesn't matter where they are as long as the US has enough leverage in the country in which they are.   
Capture and judgement of Iranian officials will be something good for Iran and for the World.
		     
Any country allowing the USA to capture Iranian assets inside its territory simply is losing its sovereignty and national independence. In reality, most countries, even definite allies of the USA, will NOT allow the USA to do so. For international war crimes, there is the International Court in DenHaag, but not a court somewhere in the USA. If the USA desires to apply Voodoo justice on a world scale, let them desire so, but let's never accept that notion
		    They don't lose sovereignty, they sovereignly agree to help. 
Gladly exchange ayatollah-Sharia law for US law, anytime.
		    How is it bad for the US to do it but not the EU and Switzerland? Did you read the first article?
		    If for example, such an official is for whatever reason taken into custody, the USA can place an extradition request to the country in question, in accordance with international standards. The procedure is a matter of police and justice and not a procedure of the executive.    
In such a case, the USA judiciary has to prove and to document that the person in question has committed a crime against the USA. If there is an extradition-treaty, things will be easier than without.    
In case, the proven crime is a ""crime against humanity"" or a war-crime, the person will get delivered to the international court in DenHaag.
		    You don't see my point here. I'm talking about ""extracting"" Iranian officials using a US court mandate. Do you think the Interpol will get collaboration of Iranian police?
		    No European country (inside or outside the EU) wants and can simply pick somebody from inside the USA
		    A)  a US court mandate simply is invalid and irrelevant outside the USA 
B)  if an Iranian official is inside Iran, he/she is on the secure side anyway 
C)  many countries, like Switzerland, will under NO circumstances extradite a national of its own country to anybody, absolutely 
--- which means that Switzerland will NOT extradite any Swiss national on demand from Interpol. The person may/will get arrested and be a subject to justice by court in Switzerland ,   but nowhere else
		    The Local article was about the EU and Switzerland freezing Iranian assets. Not about 'picking someone up'.
		    And I referred to post nr 2 of this thread.    
The freezing of some more Iranian assets in Switzerland is a positive thing. But no basis for whomever to regard Switzrland as the place simply to ""collect"" assets desired
		    Not for the US, who cares about validity for others. Do you think Noriega was extracted from Panama according to Panamanian law? Who cares about Panamanian or Iranian law?    Just wait a few weeks/months and we'll see how safe they are in Iran.    Thats Ok, I was talking about extracting people not asking ""please can you hand me over that guy"".
		    A)  Who cares about Iranian law ?   People in Iran for example. ""Extracting"" people is a form of kidnapping,   
B) How safe are they in Iran ?  You quite clearly refer here to either a US occupation of that country, or US agents trying to kidnap officials out of their country. Either way may be a bit difficult to do.   
C)  the invasion of Panama ?   as covered here     
I hope that those in charge in Washington/DC are not so silly as to regard a possible invasion of Iran as comparable to that ""visit"" to Panama. I mean if the USA decides to try to invade Iran, their invasion of Iraq may have been a leisurly walk around by comparison.
		 
			
			Switzerland is neutral, therefore it continues with business as usual as long as the sole organization Switzerland has joined (the UN) asks for it. And this is exactly what the country is doing, freezing assets of the iranian shipping lines as indicated in UN resolution 1929.
		    Switzerland is a full member of the Councill of Europe and dozens of other organisations. And many other neutral countries ARE members of the U.N.

What the news say is actually quite differently.   
Saying no to MORE European workers is different from NO European workers.

		    Pretty good advice. Time to hit the little X button...

Cheer up, your mood will recover tonight at the 'dukt   
			
			Don't worry.  The Local will make sure the referandum fails.  Afterall,  
English-speaking European workers are the bread and butter of this forum.
		    Well, I do not defent the mediocre article, but to be honest does saying no to more EU workers simply translate to saying no to the freedom of movement, a.k.a. Schengen. In short is Switzerland once again trying to have it's cake and eat it. Get all the upsides of the Schengen treaty - for example can many non Swiss forum members now freely move within the EU without visas based on their Swiss permit alone - but not accept the downsides. 
As much symphatie I have for Switzerland do I honestly hope that the EU for once stands together and counters every Swiss action with the same. As soon as Swiss nationals then are facing some of the same bullshit in other countries again does the government maybe get the message. You do not generate jobs for Swiss by kicking out anyone or preventing anyone to take a job. You just give companies another good reason to shift the job abroad... it is already cheaper today, so if you on top of that raise the bureaucratic bar to get people to Switzerland do you simply shoot yourself in the foot. 
I had lunch with a guy running a company in Switzerland who was very interested in how hard it is to set up a shop here in Singapore (very easy), how hard it is to get the work permits (much easier than in Switzerland)... and the answer is that Switzerland has to compete in a global economy. It will not successfully do so with protectionism. (and the same is true for the other countries that have the same tendencies right now...)
		 
			
			That's right, Suisse, say ""NON, MERCI"" to the EU workers, and make room for more of us non-EU folks!  We're less stodgy and much more loveable anyway.
		     It is not what it is saying. Schengen is related to freedom of movement and not to the freedom to work. Schengen and work permits are unrelated.        Freedom of movement refers to live AND/OR work. Schengen is the open border policy i.e. UK and Ireland are not part of it.

			If I read the article right it's a clause in the treaty with the EU which allows Switzerland to close its borders to EU workers once a certain quota has been used up.     
Nothing underhanded going on here by the Swiss and something the EU agreed to already...   
It's also only a temporary thing unless they decide to amend the treaty...
		    I see that Lex and Millso have already mentioned my points. Should have read the whole thread before replying...      Sorry, but the free movement of people and Schengen are two entirely different things.   
The free movement of people is about taking residence and being allowed to work. 
Schengen is about no border controls, common visa and the exchange of information between member countries.   
E.g. the UK is not part of Schengen but still participates in the free movement of people.      The safeguard clause mentioned in the article is actually part of an existing agreement that both parties (i.e. the EU and Switzerland) have agreed with. It's not like Switzerland is violating an agreement or something.   
Besides, the clause is limited to just a few years anyway.
		    I think this is the way it should be. Fair treatment for all non-Swiss.

			Swiss retailers Coop and Manor have joined forces to ask for a minimum exchange rate of 1.40 francs ($1.50) per euro and longer opening hours.            To have the ""PEG"" at  1.35 as a minimum is an absolute requirement.
		 
			
			Hopefully, Mrs Hildebrand can hold back buying Euros this time ;-)
		    absolute requirement for what?
		    Absolute requirement to guarantee we end up with huge inflationary rises since COOP is clearly struggling they only made a 38.9% rise in profits in the last 12 months!!   
COOP and Migros need to learn its Aldis and Lidls operating within Switzerland and with the same market conditions that have their business model worked out, people who are shopping outside the country to avoid the highway robbery prices of COOP and Migros will still do it at 1.60-1.70 exchange rates.    
They should be told to stop complaining and set their prices at a realistic competitive price and then people wont need to go outside the country.
		    You would have done well as the finance minister/central banker somewhere in the Warsaw Pact  . They also believed in 'fixes' here, 'controls' there. Literally anything except accepting the function that is called 'price'.  Prices send signals to the rest of the economy.
		    Once you've privatized profits and socialized losses and once you have a government supported/protected market, where's your motivation to be 'competitive'? Who are the polticians more concerned about : Coop and Migros or you? Same shit, different country.
		    Almost all consumer products are imported these days, therefore they should become cheaper as the Franc rises. But instead of passing on their savings to the consumers, retailers and importers cash in on their windfall profits.   
Coop and Migros (and many other retailers/importers) have no qualms to import cheaply made stuff from China and sell it at huge markups (e.g. sometimes at double or triple the US price) but as soon as the consumers start to take advantage of globalization and free markets they cry for the government and the central bank to intervene. What a bunch of greedy hypocrites!
		    When she buys then we all buy        It's called Capitalism.
		    Yes. But asking for government intervention at the slightest hint of competition certainly isn't.
		 
			
			Come on guys, have a little bit of understanding. If they see a profit possibility, they would be stupid not to use it. Of course they are robbing us, but why shouldn't they rob us more if we allow them? And it is our right as consumers say to them - f@@k you all! 
I never do major shopping in this country, unless it cost equally or less for some obscure reasons. If some feel the need to ""support local economy"" be my guest, but don't expect same from me. Too bad I don't live close enough to border to do grocery shopping there. It makes some sense to buy from locals on weekend markets, but that's it. And if there would be french growers standing next to swiss selling for half the price, guess what...
		    Very true, that bit is called socialism  .
		 
			
			I went shopping in France and the parking was  . We also noticed an increased control from the customs when entering Switzerland. They do check the quantities of meat you buy.
		    No, that's called privatising profits and socialising risks and losses.
		    Customs?  You were lucky to find a manned post.  I have given up trying to get VAT back; the Customs posts are always deserted!
		 
			
			I'd be very much in favour of longer opening hours but If I recall correctly this very idea was shot down in a vote not too long ago..? (at least in Fribourg though they were going to shorten saturday and lenghten another day (or something) so not really extra hours, just moving them around but still)
		    There's a box somwehere in those ""posts"" where you can self filled your ""vat back"".... apparently you put your document to stamp, fill your data and just put it there---   
I never done it because it's pain in the ass (long form) and i'm quite sure-or scared- that there's going to be some admin charges...          China catches all kind of flack for allegedly keeping their currency artifically low.  When Switzerland artifically devalues the currency it's ""OK"" and it should be pushed lower.     
Fiscal double standards.
		    You're not very good at this.       Asking for assistance when times are appearing tough! Weakening a currency in an export based country they are trying to spread the pain from devaluation elsewhere (thats the theory anyway and its littered with long term consequences). Thats exactly the problem with the so called 'mixed economy' being championed by all sides of politics, its where the saying 'privatising profits, socialising losses' comes from i.e. capitalism meets socialism. And as has been mentioned above, it not only affects competition, it actually encourages management to make decisions that would normally not be justified according to risk/reward profiles. But please, do explain?
		    Sometimes I feel dirty paying those prices at Coop. V V grateful I have easy access to Geant in Saint Louis. Only been here for three months, but didn't take long to figure out who was going to fool whom.
		    privatising profits and socialising losses (using your political connections to avoid losing money based on your poor decisions) is not   (an economic system where government owns/controls the mean of production).
		    Ok, see below. Yes its wiki, blah blah I understand, but it saves me time.      You will find the above in the 4th paragraph of this.    
And that has relevance to what I said previously - these continuous interventions of varying sorts into the markets are mostly being supported by supporters of 'mixed economies' who thought they found a compromise between capitalism and socialism. The problem with this way of thought is that these people can pick and choose which of the ideals applies where. Thats one of the reasons bankers are getting bailouts in regards to bankrupt banks and then continue to pay themselves large salaries and/or bonuses, or in other words  .   
Now to start getting really technical and risk derailing the thread, a poster commented that keeping 'windfall profits' and not passing on the 'savings' is called 'capitalism' (maybe jokingly maybe not). So,, in a trying to be funny manner, since we live in a 'mixed economy', asking for assistance when times get tough is more of a socialist ideal - hence intervention.   I also put a big smiley face to indicate the seriousness of my post - cause I had a feeling someone would flinch and get upset if I didnt. So next time lay off the 'your not very good at this' jibe and stick to an adult conversation.   
Now back on topic       The point that I and others are trying to make is that your equating of every government intervention with Socialism is not doing your argument any favours. Socialism was a terrible thing that started many wars and killed millions of people and brought suffering to many more. Socialism did not involve bailouts because it didn't need to. The state basically called the shots on everything and everyone and the money of the companies and the money of the state were effectively in the same pot anyway. That's got very little to do with the situation we have today. Calling some corrective measures (whether or not you agree with them) socialist is a bit like calling every wine drinker an alcoholic. It's reducing all the shades and nuances to the extremes in a way that prevents objective discussion of the issue at hand.   
Now just for the meaure, I don't like bailouts myself. I'd much rather see badly managed companies fail, freeing up space for the better run companies to grow into. But I don't call people who support such measures socialists.
		 
			
			And let's not forget the other possible demand - they're also asking for the duty-free limit to be lowered to keep/force people to shop in Switzerland.   
I seriously doubt collecting duty on smaller amounts will be profitable for the state once the paperwork has been paid for, but of course these retailers don't care - they just once to dissuade shoppers with the nuisance factor.   
It's one thing manipulating an exchange rate (at potentially huge downstream inflationary cost to the general population, disproportionately hitting the poorest) to keep large exporters temporarily in business; but asking the public to pay through inflation in order to give an incredibly profitable company more profit is purified opportunistic greed.   
These companies are a long, long way from death's door -  and even if they were, there are many companies who would love to jump in and take over their incredibly privileged and protected market position in a shot.  I can't wait for every other business sector in Switzerland to start demanding their best exchange rate be enforced simultaneously too       for Switzerland
		    I think there's a little bit of talking at cross-purposes going on here - it's a bit strange to be talking about socialism in the past tense and as if its only flavour is somewhere between 1950s USSR and revolutionary Angola.   
In Europe, I find that when most people refer to socialism they have something more akin to Scandinavian social democracy in mind, and I've yet to see Marxist struggle and collectivisation in Denmark.     
The difference in meaning of the words ""socialist"" (and ""conservative"") between everyday use in Europe and the US - it's practically an insult on one side of the Atlantic, and a compliment in areas of the other       Oh yes but retailers ""sponsor"" right-wing political parties, in particular the mighty FDP. It's an open secret and explains why there will be support for lowering the duty-free limit, despite such as decision being against the interest of > 99 % of the population.
		    Indeed, but I don't like their kind, either (and I have spent a lot of time up there).   
Tom
		    Fair enough, I was just pointing out the potential for confusion    
Although socialism necessarily involves government intervention in the economy, I think it's confusing the issue to equate the two, seeing as every government in the world of all persuasion intervenes to some extent.  The type of intervention depends more on local factors than anything ideological.   
The internal contradiction of the SVP economic policy is amusing though - they must be the first fully free market party to have extensive agricultural subsidy as a key policy.  Just like with these retailers, there's a sense of wanting their cake and eating it.
		    Says who..?
		    Not to mention ""liberal"".   
In Europe, a political liberal is a right-of-centre free market dude. In the USA he is completely the opposite.
		    Sorry, but here you mix two aspects. First of all, Lidl and Aldi, to a lesser extent even Spar, work on the basis of the business-model of Coop and Migros, while those two co-operatives do not. Coop has shown that it still could do with the Prix Guarantie line, which is their original business model. Reality is that both Lidl and Aldi in Switzerland are more expensive than in Germany and they both say that they here do NOT make more profits   
No, to demand a realistic exchange-rate is in support of much of the industry, while I have no doubts that they have their profits in mind. And you can be sure that both Aldi.-CH and Lidl-CH support the Mi.-Coop duopoly in this .
		    What is asked for on the political side is a RAISE of the duty-free limits, and this by about 200%.     
Manipulating the exchange rates is what the finance-markets-speculators did and do, what is required is some ANTI-manipulation. That this includes an inflation-risk is obvious and is the reason why Mr Hiltebrand was so caucious. Major industrialist Blocher now has found a route either to oust the man or to bring him under control. And Mr Blocher is supported in this by Mr Rechsteiner, the powerful trades-unions leader, in an amazing alliance.
		    Open secret? Isn't that just another way of saying ""well everyone knows it"" and therefore not bothering with citations or provable facts?
		    That'll be   you're referring to.   
Most of Europe has socialist parties (eg SP) and often socialist governments (eg Tony Blair's Labour Party).   
Britain's ""free"" National Health system is an incredibly socialist ideal and Europe's largest employer, but has yet to start a war, although it is responsible for killing many people if the Daily Mail is to be believed....
		    First of all, it is wrong.  Coop is a co-operative, but owned by the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. Migros for decades had its own left-of-centre party, LDU, which in the end had to be given up. The co-operative members (simply customers who pay an entry-fee of some CHF 100) are in political terms from far left to right of centre but hardly right-wing as Migros still is regarded as LEFTwing by the rightwingers.    
Second, what is under discussion is to RAISE the dutyfree-limits.    
Third, it is fairly easy to circumvent these limits in places like Geneva, Basel-St.Louis/Lörrach and Kreuzlingen/Konstanz by simply first making a deposit outside CH, then bringing over the goodies in two or three batches using different crossing points and then picking the mess up again at the chosen ""consolidation-point"". Sir, it DOES work        Let's say it's on open secret that is so open that the people concerned admit it. Or are you suggesting it is not so?   
The FDP as a party is basically a representation of business interests. In the past that ws not so, as the FDP played a pivotal role in building Switzerland's statehood and continued to play that role until about the 1950s. But today the FDP is just the party that takes money from business and defends their interests. There's no real secret about it. I believe that they are the only party that doesn't even charge a membership fee because they don't need anybody else's money.   
In the last 20 years or so that has shifted a little again as many businessmen have aligned themselves with the SVP, and of course the FDP has failed in such affairs as its bail-out of Swissair. But the FDP still definitely represents the old school of business.
		    all that is true.   
However, I read somewhere that people from the right side of the political spectrum are more likely to be loyal to Migros, whereas those from the left are more loyal to Coop. And at least by looking at the people I know I see some truth in this. And strangely, its not out of persuasion but because, I guess, the Migros style just clicks more with one mindset and the Coop style more with the other.
		    Those parties are social democratic parties, not socialist parties.   
But I guess at the end of the day it all boils down to semantics and definitions.   
Nevertheless, it was not the socialist parties, and neither was it the social democratic parties who (in most cases) were the driving force behind bailing out banks. It was the right of centre and more pro-free-market parties who did it.
		      Look, just read the original interview.   
Joos Sutter of Co-op in Sonntagszeitung:       
The word ""Senkung"" isn't particularly ambiguous.  Co-op are clearly asking for the limit to be lowered.
		    Hmm.. Just out of curiosity, what was the thing you did not like?
		    Really? Who's asking to raise the limit?   
The only report regarding is      
Der SVP-Parlamentarier will für gleich lange Spiesse sorgen bei der Freigrenze, für die Waren aus dem Ausland abgaben- und mehrwertsteuerfrei in die Schweiz eingeführt werden dürfen. «Entweder wirkt der Bundesrat darauf hin, dass die Freigrenze im angrenzenden Deutschland angehoben wird  oder er sorgt dafür, dass weniger Güter unversteuert in die Schweiz kommen können», fordert Germann   
Some SVP politicians want to reduce the duty-free limit. As Germans from the region apparently have a far lower limit.     
I understand if exporters want a higher Euro course But before retailists start whining about the strong Euro I feel they should have a look at themselves first. As has been briefly touched upon. Coop and Migros have some of the   which is for example almost twice as much as Sainsburys in the UK. They also need to stick together to fight the suppliers for lower prices. It's ridiculous that some suppliers demand in Switzerland higher prices than what it is sold for by retailers in the EU.     
I experienced an example yesterday regarding margins in Switzerland. The perfume that I've used for a few years now is occasionally on sale in Denner. I missed that sale and wanted to buy it online yesterday. Import parfumerie which belongs to Coop and calims to be ''the nr.1 specialst discounter for perfumes'' if you google them, wants 96 Fr for it. Otto's and geschenkidee.ch sells it for 36 Fr! I was able to buy two and it was still cheaper than getting it from the ''nr. 1 discounter'' which belongs to the Coop.    
If they don't want to compete on prices then the shops need to offer more service. For example I was looking to buy new football boots. I went into Ochsner sport. There was roughly 2 costumers apart from me and 3 employees. I was looking and trying on shows for around 15-20 min. Not once did someone come to ask how I was getting on. I then went hime and bought them online from the english equivalent JJB sport for half the price.   
I support them though regarding the opening times. I find 18.30-19.00 is far too short to browse around the shops. I would really need to rush to get my shopping done and wouldn't have time to browse other items. Becuase of this I buy my clothes on holidays when I have time and nearly all non-food items online when it suits me and not the shop
		    Yes, they have a limit of €90 (including an additional limit of €30 for food), but this only applies to: 
- cross border workers 
- bus or truck drivers who cross the border regularly (i.e. more than once a month) 
- people who cross the border within 15 km from their place of residence and haven't travelled further than 15 km (from the border crossing) within Switzerland.   
For everyone else, the limit is €300 which is even higher than the Swiss limit!   
E.g. if a guy living in Konstanz buys something in Kreuzlingen, the limit is €90, but if he goes to Frauenfeld the limit is already €300.   
In case anyone is interested, here are the relevant links to the German Zoll website:          Thanks I saw the 300 Euro limit but couldn't find the limit for locals but as often there's quite a lot of misinformation being spread.
		    About "" ""   
Not sure about this, if I was Hildebrand I would be pushing for the people involved to be prosecuted under Swiss bank secrecy laws. 
They know who made the original leak so it should be relatively simple to follow the chain &, who knows, it could lead all the way to Blocher.  Then Blocher would be the one under control?
		    Mr Germann wanted to become Bundesrat and failed. So much about ""they"".    
That the retailers including Lidl-CH and Aldi-CH btw now join the industry is good, whatever their motives.    
No, the shops do not need to give more service but LESS service. Aldi and Lidl give far less service than Migros-Coop.    
Ochsner is rather expensive. You could have got the same stuff from shops like Dosenbach and H&M and C&A for 30% of the price. If you go to the most expensive shops and then compare their prices with the cheapest online solution, you cannot convince me.-    
You might go shopping at noon, and you have enough time for everything. Provided, you have a modern employer with flexible working times.

Beside the point that people can easily circumvent the problem by using  different points of entry, it is wrong to pick on the shoppers, instead  of tackling the financial markets.   
**************************************************  *************************************      A)  it is NOT keeping somebody TEMPORARILY in business but to keep the  money earners of the general population, the export industry and the  inbound tourism, in good shape.    
B)  That the chiefs at Migros-Coop want to stop the efforts to raise the  duty-free-limits is understandable but shabby and lousy.    
C)  Migros and Coop now have joined the general economy, partially out  of wanting more profits, but most of all, because the two co-operatives  are THE OWNERS of many export-industry-companies !   
**************************************************  *******************      Coop, while in principle also owned by its ""Genossenschafter"" is still under defacto-control of the Social Democratic Party. Migros, owned by its Genossenschafter is clearly left-of-centre, and is detested by people from the right side of the political spectrum as much as Coop. True, the present president of Migros is in my view rather a bit of a conservative. Arguing against Lidl and Aldi with exactly the same arguments used against Migros some 50 and 40 years ago.    
The conservative grandmother of a schoolfriend NEVER went shopping in Migros  (Coop was not yet around, and its predecessors LVZ and KVZ were oldfashioned and not yet self-service, even if the LVZ was already under SP control). She opposed that ""leftist discounter club"" who according to the rightwingers ""destroyed normal business by too low prices"". The Migros-Genossenschafter of present days in votings show to be rather more to the left as the Genossenschafter of the old days. Migros originally was founded as an A.G. but then changed into a co-operative by aging Mr Duttweiler.   
**************************************************  ***************************       The FDP always was the conservative party of business. This was the  reason why its left-wing in around 1900 broke away and became the  Social-Democratic Party.  There were farmers parties and parties of  small business and of the gastronomy who gradually merged into the BGB  which later was re-named into SVP. But only Mr Blocher after 1980  managed to steer the party to the far right and attracting some business  tycoons to the party.  However, the position of the FDP is different  from Canton to Canton. The FDP in Zürich is fairly right-wing while the  FDP in Luzern is centrist, as the CVP in Luzern is rather right-wing.  There were Liberal Parties in Bern and Graubünden who half a century ago  merged into the SVP, and now have broken away as the BDP.  A problem  for FDP, CVP and even SVP now is the Green Liberal Party, the former  right wing of the Green Party, which now is heavily moving into the  Centrist field.
		    Oh, no. The  problem is an utter lack of price competition in many sectors of the domestic market! What happened over the last two years is simply that the sinking Euro exposed that long existing problem in a way that started to hurt Swiss retailers. Many Swiss consumers finally woke up from their ""everything is better in Switzerland"" dreams and their ""more expensive means better"" illusions, dropped their irrational behaviour and started to shop across the border in numbers.    
After all, it's not like shopping abroad wasn't worth it when the Euro was floating around 1.50 and the smarter consumers already knew about that and took advantage of it back then. What changed with the Euro crisis is the awareness of broad sections of the population how badly overpriced many imported goods actually are and this awareness will not go away, even with a higher EUR exchange rate. This means that we finally have some competitive pressure and that the current price level in Switzerland will most likely not be sustainable, even with an exchange rate of 1.40. Therefore Swiss retailers would better start putting some serious pressure on importers and foreign suppliers and having a close look at their cost structure instead of crying for government intervention like little babies.
		 
			
			In short:   
Longer opening hours, yes please. 
Weaker Franc, No.   
That is all.
		    Yeah the head of Coop and some SVP politicians are asking for a duty-free price reduction. So much for ''the political side'' asking for a price increase.      If the want to keep their price so high than they bloody well better give better service to justify that price. Otherwise they had better lower their price to justify the service they're giving.   
Regarding Ochsner that's rubbish. They're probably the biggest sports retailer in Switzerland. I'm comparing them to the biggest sports retailer in England.    
firstly C&A and H&M don't do sports stuff.    
Secondly regarding   
''If you go to the most expensive shops and then compare their prices with the cheapest online solution, you cannot convince me''   
Since your telling me to compare like for like, suggesting I go to somewhere like Dosenbach and buy a pair of Victory shoes for 60Fr instead of Addidas world cup is pretty lame. In Shops here be it Ochsner or Atleticum or private sports shops they cost around200 Fr in season.    
In Any shop outside of  Switzerland  when I bought them they cost £65  or Euro. I've saw JJB has put up the price to £80 but thats still a massive difference     
And yes I do have have flexible working times but why should I do my shopping when the shops want me to come? They want my money so I expect them to adjust to my needs. I'll go shopping when it suits me if the Swiss aren't prepared to adjust then I'll take my money either to other countries or online. Tough luck
		 
			
			I remember when the CHF was roughly 1.6, my CH OH lived in Basel, it started to make no sense at all shopping in DE, Swiss shops were actually cheaper!            Even @ 1.6 a lot of things were cheaper in de, for example, under 6 euro for a pack of 20 recordable DVDs versus what? 15/18CHF in CH?
		    I was talking more about food & supermarket shopping, my CH OH would want to spend 400 Euro on monthly food shopping followed by 200 CHF weekly shopping followed by 100 CHF daily shopping for 2 people & 7 cats. No doubt the cats ate Scottish salmon & caviar.
		    & you were on left overs??  arme schwein!!          I have no idea what she spent the money on, we could have eaten in the indian resturant in DE every night and saved a fortune!
		    Women & their mysterious ways; probably there were several families living well off your rubbish sacks.          More likely every cat within a 5 mile radus!
		    This may very well be the case for some stuff, but let's look at a typical clothing item with pricing of 99 in Germany and CHF 199 in Switzerland. Even with an exchange rate of 1.60, buying in Germany still equals to savings of more than 25% including Swiss VAT! 
The price difference for many items such as detergents, cosmetics, etc. is often even higher.       While other sectors of the economy have been asking and still ARE asking for the limit, most of all the limits on postal imports, to be raised. That the limits on the postal imports will be raised is almost certain now, and is, for various reasons, even supported the the post-office and the customs-authorities. What Co-op by asking for a lowering of the traveller imports limits wants to achieve is that they are not raised. The compromise will be the status quo.
		 
			
			CHF has become ""artificially"" inflated as a result of the markets using the currency as a safe haven against volatility everywhere else.  and if an inflated CHF hurts Switzerland more than it helps, why shouldn't the central bank do something?  every country, even the US, would do the same thing, either through printing more money or other means.   
of course, I wish the US had the same problem, our Fed has been whiffing for decades as to how to at least keep its currency from a constant decline.
		    CH is a much smaller market with 3 launguages to deal & shop  salaries more than twice that of DE, it's suprising it's as competetive  as it is especially for electrical goods.  
Ultimately I suppose you could have a country without any shops, however I think many people would pay for the conveniance-
		    I don't buy the language argument in the slightest.  Belgium is a market of comparable size, but their prices aren't 60% higher than those in the Netherlands because there's two more national languages to deal with.     
If the languages involved were Welsh, Basque and Faroese and there were no well developed trade infrastructure, then possibly.  But huge added costs for French, German and Italian?  It's just apologetics.
		    Hi,   
I work in TV commercials often the 3 launguage sound tracks & voice overs plus different product shot exceeds 50% of the budget. Those are real costs you never even thought existed.  
London is a bigger market than the whole of Switzerland, economies of scale make a huge difference.
		    So what your saying is you now agree that people in the retail industry are lobbying to get the traveller import rates reduced despite trying to argue that this is not the case against anyone who mentioned this?        Theoretically companies don't now need to have the labels in 3 languages and can directly import from the EU   
Kassensturz covered the argument of high wages. It turns out employees are cheaper in Switzerland as in Germany due to the higher productivity of the employees. Just 14% of the costs are related to the wages anyway. The guy  Kassensturz interviewed apparently does reports for retailists as well and he said prices should be even slightly cheaper than in the EU due to the lower VAT. The economic professor who they interviews after the report also put the blame clearly on a lack of competition which also many on here have already said.       
Has anyone ever read an independent report that said the high prices are justified? All I hear are these lazy arguments which when analysed almost always turn out to be wrong
		 
			
			How does multiple languages change the price? Most modern manuals for things like electronics, cameras, etc come in a plethora of languages (and ones that aren't printed can be downloaded in PDF form). Many products have been this way for years. Do the Swiss need multi-language manuals in order to buy and wear a pair of jeans?
		     
It's true (more or less) at least for stuff that is imported - just compare the prices for hardware in the Swiss and German Apple Online Store (and subtract the 8% and 19% VAT accordingly) 
And it's true for stuff like photo-equipment.   
It's difficult to judge (as an outsider) for stuff completely produced inside the country (like milk) - but that certainly doesn't explain why Nivea is twice, trice or four times the price in Switzerland as it is in Germany - all coming out of the same factory by the metric ton....
		    THIS is ""quark"" !   The point is not really the languages as such but the fact that there are three different markets. And if you look at the positions of big chains from neighbouring countries, Mediamarkt, Lidl and Aldi needed ages until coming into Switzerland, which shows that Switzerland was regarded as too small a marketplace. From France, only Conforama persevered while Carrefour-CH collapsed and surrendered. To me, Carrefour is Shit-France beyond defence. Take Coop-CH and Migros and compare them in Europe !  They are small companies. The lack of international companies and the way of NL-Spar to participate in the Mi.-Coop-duopoly is a main reason for a price-level which already was high up in the 1980ies.    
Another point is that the laws which required companies here to label everything in  German, French and Italian were adapted and liberalized. But you mentioned Belgium. Ever been there ?  If so you certainly saw that goods also in the Flemish majority part often simply are labelled in French. To stay on the markets here in Switzerland, you have to label your stuff at least in German and French, wherever you got it from. And THIS, no doubt, DOES increase the costs. Amazing is to what extent Romands and Ticinesi swallow outright rubbish committed by CH ""multi-Cantonals"" like Migros and Coop. I am, when travelling to the Romandie and the Ticino, often shocked by the complete rubbish to be seen on advertisements on/in shops. It only works as the Romands/Ticinesi apparently still regard the ""SuisseAlémanique"" as the source of better quality than France&Italy. Which in reality is often NOT the case.    
Fact is that those three ""markets"" are, by world-companies, regarded as laughable and therefore simply NOT tackled. Their perfect right, true, but helping Migros-Coop in maintaining their leading role and keeping the price-level up as they desire.  I just on Saturday made some shopping at Lidl-CH (Oerlikon) for CHF 25.05 and can tell for sure that the same stuff would have been between CHF 40 and CHF 60 at Mi-Coop .    
And finally over to Walmart. This tremendous chain was interested in EPA when that company finally collapsed but A) found the company to be too small, (B) the market(s) in question too small,  (C) the potential partners too complicated.  EPA finally was swallowed by Coop. This clearly lead to a price increase here in Switzerland of many percentage points. While the decision of Walmart NOT to move into Switzerland possibly was not only their right but clearly correct from their side, I am also correct in saying that the Walmart surrender from Switzerland contributed to the price level, by giving Coop a very bad lead.
		    Not now but for ages. Retailing has opposed the traveller import allowance for decades. This is not new at all. But the general idea is to get the levels in question RAISED. Some chaps at Coop and Migros just found the moment convenient to rejuvenate their stance on this. I by stating this referred to statements of the customs authorities who ARE part of the federal government while Coop and Migros are NOT.     
In regard to Coop, you have to realize that they know precisely well that their party, the SP, for a variety of reasons will if possible block a lowering of the allowance-limit. Migros no longer has a political party in Bern on its side, except maybe the Green-Liberals and the FDP, and so KNOW that nobody is in favour of lowering the allowance-levels.
		    I KNOW that this isn't true. I've already linked to one politician who is in favour of it. I can't be bothered to find anymore links but to state nobody is in favour of lowering the allowance is wrong. Germann isn't the only politician in favour. They may be still a small minority but they're definitely there.   
Anyway back to the main topic. I think Mark summed it up pretty well. I've yet to see any evidence that speaks against this       Or maybe in the words of the    
''They profited too long - one bought the products in Euro and didn't give the currency profit to the customer. The branch waited too long. One needs to be cautious with whinging about the Euro: Many problems are homemade''
		 
			
			And sorry Wolli I don't mean to be picking on you but I find you seem to be contradicting yourself on this thread Another example        Is there now sufficient competition or not?
		    Yes.      No more than here.  Unsurprising, as it's a particularly politically sensitive topic there.      No, there is doubt.  It might costs a little bit more, but it's unclear to many why adding two languages adds 30-60% on to the price between France and Switzerland, but not between France and Belgium.   
It's still very unclear how the language argument miraculously applies to Switzerland and not Belgium and Finland.  It's also very unclear why the ""too small a market"" argument applies many, many times more strongly to Switzerland than it does to Denmark, Finland and Ireland (which are all smaller).  The Alps can only be blamed for so much - it's expensive and slow to get containers to Ireland and Finland too.    
Yes, there are extra costs associated with dealing with a multilingual, small market - but they are nowhere near high enough to justify the price differential seen.  There are other more likely explanatory factors (wages and lack of pressure on importers, for example), but those two are insignificant in comparison.
		    Well, if the Swiss market is deemed so unimportant by those multinationals, then why are they fighting tooth and nail to keep their obscene margins? Doesn't really make sense, does it?
		    Maybe not, but the language is not just what's printed on the packet. On this forum we are seeing lots of complaints about service and support people not speaking English adequately. But if those companies react and employ people who can, then we complian about the cost. And remember that English is not the only language people will be wanting to speak. If you're in the US or UK you can easily offshore phone centres to India. Maybe French and Dutch can similarly be offshored to Africa and Spanish and Portugese to South America. But there aren't many low cost countries that speak Swiss German. The Amish don't like telephones, unfortunately.    "	74	Swiss retail giants call for weaker franc	4214

			Excellent read, wasn't aware Switzerland had such a high rate of suicide.
		    Maybe, but that rate will /would hardly drop due to more anti-weapons laws. More important is that people realize that the present regulations were introduced in times when A) there usually was at least one member of the household around mostly or often throughout the day, and when the place of work of the weapons-holder was less than 5 kilometers away from home. What IS needed is that the soldiers have the possibility to deposit their weapons Monday to Friday and also on Saturdays (between 9am and 6pm) and to take them over from Monday to Saturday between 9am and 6pm), and this without much ado and in many places (places less than 5 km away from home). The last proposal which was recjected did NOT include much help for the soldiers but mostly restrictions. Any new proposal also has to include the interests of the Shooting Associations which are very powerful outside the cities.    
Strangely enough, both supporters and adversaries of the proposal last time suffered of the impression that most Swiss soldiers WANTED to have that weapon at home, which is rubbish. True however is that most Swiss soldiers do NOT want to first travel an hour and then  to queue for two hours and fill out endless forms just to deposit or take back that piece of shit.

			The Swiss franc rose further against the euro on Monday despite last week's decision by the central bank to maintain its cap on the exchange rate.                 
The  had risen to 1.27 , but the limit at present still is 1.20 .  The re-elected Finance Minister now can be expected to lift the PEG to 1.30 and to intervene accordingly
		 
			
			WTF:   ""This relatively small transaction netted the Hildebrand family only ~$50,000 in less than one month. Being that the amount is so small, the conclusion is that nothing nefarious has taken place. Therefore no central banker in the world would risk his job.""       
Poor central bankers of the World... and poor wives of course!
		 
			
			...meanwhile the CHF to USD rate continues to plummet, forcing American expats to ask themselves each morning, ""Why am I here???""
		    I strikes me that there is some inane inability of those who have the power to change the way millions of folk earn their money through hard work to be able to resist the urge to make a quick buck through their insider knowledge. The reason that the SVP have Hildebrand in their sights is good for Switzerland in the long term.
		    Kind of opposite vision of finance world: SVP wants a control-free finance whereas Hildebrand likes to put more check points for them.
		    We know now why! 
If the market is free, there is not a lot of insider trading that you can benefit from.   
This is precisely why when people complain about greedy bankers and say they want more regulation, I reply that it is just who you prefer to get robbed by, the private or the public sector?    
The good thing about the private sector is that when they cheat, the chance of ending up in jail is higher.

			And this is Switzerland, can you imagine what the Brussels politimafia do with the information they manage?   
Just imagine the value of knowing that you will flood the markets with liquidity.   
Or that this or that guy will make a speech with a specific orientation. You can clearly see the market swinging for almost every phrase that Draghi pronounces.   
2011, Siemens had become nervous about the French banking system and withdraw its cash balances from Societe Generale to deposit them “for safety” at the ECB. It is hard to imagine who could have leaked this story other than the Bundesbank? And what was the purpose? Was this the reason why there were so many short positions on Societe Generale at the time?   
In America happens exactly the same. Last time I saw it, it was incredibly visible 30/11 when the coordinated swap line bailout by the Federal Reserve Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank were set-up. One day before, inexplicably, the market volume and prices started to go up in European markets. Following trading day it was clear: bailout made public. Someone at the Fed leaked the information.   
So when someone talks bad about bankers, you have to consider that they are successful only due to their intimate and profitable partnership with politicians.   
Exchange of political power for money.   
This is indeed a shit-hole.
		    Now we gone  find out if Switzerland is  different .I would love to hand him the pink slip       The exchange-rate level of the US$ is beyond the influence of Switzerland.    
And it today shows that the $ is as low as 
USD                
            0.9428   
shown here, which means less than CHF -.95 .  The actual value of US$ (and by actual I mean the merchandise value) is between CHF 1.00 and CHF 1.10, the ""value"" on the financial markets dropped to unprecedented levels due to the doubts about the USA economy. All US-Americans should welcome the US$ apparently regaining some trust among the finance-markets chaps. If things go right, for both the USA and Switzerland, the exchange-rate will be around 1:1 again shortly. It however might become 1.--$=  CHF1.08, depending on financial and economic developments in the USA. The Swiss National Bank most likely will raise the -CHF ""PEG"" to 1.35 shortly, which indeed may put the $-rates up.  This not due to the SNB but due to the USA financial markets, who are entitled to jump to THEIR conclusions.    
Sorry, but if you came here just on the basis of the bizarre and absurd levels into the CHF got pressed for a while, then you got something a bit wrong.
		    The actual value of something in free markets is not what fundamentals determine but by what the consensus is willing to pay for it.
		    And they did know that as recently as 2005 it was 1.25 CHF to 1 USD, but when they tried to negotiate on historical exchange rates they got laughed at, and the response was, ""But it comes with a bonus and you should be happy!""
		    When your debasing a currency, or at least throwing it out of windows buying up government debt to push rates down (and making front running banks richer), then a weaker currency is completely warranted (in the case of the $US that is).
		    Devaluing a currency may deliver short term gains by making imports more expensive and exports cheaper, but then you've also got to be able to take advantage of that price advantage. Nobody is going to relocate manufacturing, which is a long term process requiring long lead times and high costs, just to take advantage of short-term favourable exchange rates. Existing manufacturers may be able to ramp up capacity, but them they have to have spare capacity they can use. In the aftermath of a consolidation phase, that isn't likely to be the case. Furthermore, devaluing a currency also destroys value, so it shouldn't be done lightly.

			an editorial in the Financial times covers it nicely. entitled               I missed some ""ss"" for $. I'll read my Weltwoche and get back to you tomorrow ....      I agree with you, I dont get the saga either and the media arnt even focusing on the issues here - insider trading etc. If Vassela's (Novartis) wife etc had tried this there would be a sh^ storm. This is one of the reasons I have stopped following the story.
		 
			
			OK, I've read my Weltwoche now. It's pretty hard to discern any facts here because neither side is telling the whole truth. The Weltwoche claim that it was Hildebrand's personal financial advisor who spilled the beans, whereas the Sarasin Bank claim that the whistleblower was only an IT dude.   
The Weltwoche published what they say is Hildebrand's bank account extracts detailing four transactions, three currency and one share purchase.    
Casual onlookers will not be surprised to learn that the pro and anti Hildebrand factions are very much split along political lines, but the socialists seem to be united with the SVP on this one, Calmy-Rey getting a surprisingly good write up by the Weltwoche journalist Urs Paul Engeler.   
I have no insight into this whatsoever. Only Hildebrand knows the truth. He earns close to CHF 1M per annum, so shifting a few hundred thousand around is well within his own budget. The question is how would you feel if the top man at your National Bank was using his knowledge to make a few extra bucks on the side and why does he find this absolutely neccesary with the trust placed in him?   
It's times like these in politics when you get to find out who your true friends are and how far they'd stick their necks out for you to cover your butt.   
If there's a positive to this affair, at least Swiss charity ""Schweizer Berghilfe"" were given Hildebrand's currency exchange profit of CHF 75'000.

			No, the bigger problem is we dont know how big his Euro long is. If he were to admit the true size no one would want that job. He has created a monster ponzi scheme.           Yes we know, with some delay though:       
look in : 
Foreign currency investments   
in page #13 you have the split by currency. Unfortunately they do it only per quarter... you know, transparency is not a Swiss forte.   
They have been buying EUR like crazy but converting a big chunk of them to USD. They are not so stupid... their wives neither.
		 
			
			Will be curious if they are buying HUF. Currency 6 is ""other"".....    
Much of these CHF have to be finding their way to Hungary via the ECB. CHF's going to Hungary will be the only thing to delay a major inflation in CH.    
But Eur still has to be the biggest chunk. Dont think they want to fight a two currency front. They have to stick with Eur and let the eurusd take care of its self.            
			
			The 'fixed' EUR-CHF rate is bloody annoying when you need to pay off study loans in EUR   I didn't mind it to be 1EUR=1CHF last year!!!
		 
			
			Food shopping in Germany was funner too!           and so we are talking about SVP campaigns and Godwin again. Surely we all know what the rat represents       First of all, in Switzerland, ""insider"" laws only apply to deals in regard to the stock exchange but not to deals in regard with currency deals, so that the man here, at least legally, is out of trouble. The political nature of his job however means that he depends on the trust of people (actual, people, the media, politicians) in him, and this is clearly shaken. His position is more critical than the one of German Federal President Wulff as HIS job is the one of a decision-maker.   
Second, what are the federal laws in the USA in this regard ?   You above mention stock-exchange things, which here would be a difference. But what if those persons in the USA had, at a good time, bought Yen, , CHF or UK£  ?
		 
			
			So youre justifying this guy using his powers to make money in a fashion that is unethical?    
Also, US laws dont matter. Im talking about the fact that this guy yields more power than anyone else in the country. Let me put it to you this way. Two months ago I wrote a 50 page template about central banking in African nations. I focused on the central banks where I had met with the President of the Banque Central. My ending thesis is that they would never be as advanced as the West until they got rid of the corruption. Whether its borrowing $20mn and then devaluing the currency 2 days later, or priniting money without any rhyme or reason, without sterilization.    
This is the SNB not the BC du Congo.    
Also, to answer your question. Eurodollars arent traded on the stock exchange. They are a future. Oil can be traded physically or on a commodities exchange.    
In both cases you can circumvent any and all insider regulations simply by trading physicals (Oil or Zero Coupon GOVT's). The laws wouldnt matter. The ethics would.               What makes you think he's going to get away with it? This guy has got so much sh*t coming his way that even if survives the first lot he'll be a lame duck in whatever job his buddies decide to place him. And maybe all the people on this forum who always moan and groan at the SVP should consider that without them, this guy would probably be getting away with it.
		    It's a shame that this sort of thing is currently only monitored by political parties for political reasons using rather questionable methods.  The ends may or may not justify the means in this case, but it certainly highlights a massive hole in the regulatory system that needs repairing in the future.
		    The court has decided that what the Hildebrand family did is not punishable by law. BUT, would you buy a second-hand car from this chap ?        It is not about what I may find justifiable. It is, as the court in Zurich has stated, that Swiss laws includes laws against insider-deals in regard to the stock exchange but no laws against insider-deals in regard to currencies. This is the legal situation in Switzerland. The court made it clear that his is the law, and that this does not mean that the deals in question were ethical.    
Legally, he CAN stay in office. From an ethical point of view, he should resign. As I am not a lawyer I cannot tell you who could order him to resign.    
Back again. Mr H. did NOT violate any Swiss laws.

			I don't buy it that the dolphin died from the music. They do have something like 15 times better hearing than humans, but that makes sense being underwater. They can also make sonic booms that exceed the pain threshold in humans (well over 130 decibels) so they are no stranger to noise. Add to that the fact that you have to subtract around 60 decibels going from air to water, so if the show was at an extremely loud 120 decibels, in water it would be 60 db which is about as loud as a dishwasher from several meters away. Hardly deadly.   
And- dolphins are known to spontaneously help humans, in the wild. Captive dolphins develop an ever closer bond. This one had to be aware that people were enjoying themselves, which should have given it pleasure.    
Just a headline grabber. However, the fact that it's the 7th dolphin to die there in 3 years makes me question how they are being cared for overall, doesn't seem too good.
		 
			
			It doesn't sound like this place has any business keeping dolphins - truly beautiful and intelligent creatures.   
And as for a ""Swiss techno party"" I'm pretty sure I'd want to curl up and die if I got near one.

		    Don't you just love ambiguous lines like the one quoted. Can't be sure if 1864 was hotter or not because of the wording. I imagine that it wasn't.
		 
			
			It may have been the hottest average however in 2006 summer Zurich recorded 6 weeks of 30C each day and we reached 42-43C    
2011 was pretty mild in the summer compared to these temps so it is only the warmest because the autumn and start of the winter were warmer then normal.
		 
			
			Must say I was disappointed with this article: I was expecting something else when I read the title....
		    April and May were good, but June to August were lousy. September was good again. Strange. And the meteo-chaps and the statisticians of course mix everything together and then make out average -values. In short, in real terms, this year was not particularily hot and rather mediocre.

			Moved here this year and was surprised with how warm it was. It was warm enough to go out jogging in December in shorts and a tee shirt. Bought my new skis in October, ready to ski when the high resorts opened in November. Didn't get to ski until yesterday. Then it snowed and dumped 20 cm here, now it's 8 degrees, raining and all the snow is washing away. To say I was wrong with what I thought about the weather here is an UNDERSTATEMENT. I was hoping for a White Christmas, now it looks I will just get a brown, wet one. Even at 1000 meters. Depressing.
		 
			
			Just when there was no more hope - here comes the calvary!   
After a long evening session with Martin Horat and a quick chat with Wollishofer, we decided to give Martin's ants a mild sedative to put them into a long winter's sleep.   
As a result, the snow will come again this weekend and then the temperatures will drop.   
The Swiss aim to please, especially when bribed with a bottle of Kraüterschnapps.
		    I love oxymorons          April, May and September were excellent. I was swimming in the Zürichsee as late as 2nd October, a new record as the last one was 1st October in the early 1980ies.  But in late November, it became cold while staying dry. I would never have started anything in shorts etc up from 1st December. I am very sorry, but what you will see is an average Christmas of all places below 800 meters above sealevel, and fairly common for places up to 1100m .  If a winter gets cold, it anyway will be in January or up to March. I still remember late 1963 when it was very mild up to New Year, but then we in Zürich saw temperatures of between minus 27° and minus 21° and the lake freezing, resulting in a frozen lake, the almost historical Seegfrörni

			People who reveal the location of Swiss speed cameras on the internet face fines of up to 10,000 francs ($10,700), under new laws.         
			
			Quote from the article 
"" .""   
Seems the well informed Radical Party councillor Markus Hutter does not know that GPS navigation systems which alert drivers when they are approaching cameras are illegal in Switzerland! The systems can be confiscated & a fine of around 1/200 CHF.
		     
mine does it all over Europe Except in CH .....are they programmed like that?
		    Yes, but you can get speed camera POI files with Swiss cameras in.   
My CoPilot has Europe but not Swiss, and if I wanted Swiss (which obviously I wouldn't) then I would probably get them from somewhere like SCDB.info
		    Yes. They latest speed cameras databases are 2009 I think. All big manufacturers of units have removed the swiss speed cameras from their maps so if you update you no longer have the cameras. Most of the GPS warners have also deleted the CH cameras in the next updates, so if you want to get one with them you need to find an older update or include them as POI or something similar by yourself. It's do-able. Maybe you won't have ALL the speed cameras, but most of them.    
There are few groups who collect these data (user-driven) one is French another one is English, if you search them with mentioned keyword you can find them.    
Another point is how they will search your GPS to find out if you have the speed cameras is questionable for me.    
There are 2 other programs that are GPS and user driven with real live data from drivers (waze and trapster) but they work on 3g/mobile Internet hence I never tried them. I guess both programs now will be illegal in Switzerland. But the reports are not only speed cameras, also traffic jams, workers on road etc.    
Another possibility is if you have a smart phone with a GPS you can set up a small easy app to remind you of the cameras, but as I said the latest official update is 2009 but users have been updating it. SCBD has excluded Switzerland from the latest updates also.    
I don't know how this device is legal in Switzerland?          I love unenforceable laws.
		    I fully understand why they would, I've actually seen Blocher driving his black Volvo XC 90.    
			
			I'll just post some areas that are best viewed below the speed limit to ensure you see the natural beauty of the area...for a mile or so
		     Call the  !
		 
			
			Just start a new wesite called ""Areas which are advised not to speed"" and make sure there are no mentions of speed cameras   
I think that is a stupid law. I most countries, cameras are put there to try to stop drivers from speeding in the first place, not to catch them in a dangerous act.
		    I have a friend who was stopped in a police control & the officer checked his GPS in a very competent way; luckily he had no Swiss speed cameras installed.
		 
			
			What about that one just before the Gubrist on the A1 headed west?   
Rats, someone at the door, be right back ..........       
(Editor: Mr. A last seen being bundled into a Gulfstream with ""Rendition Airlines"" painted on the side)
		 
			
			Even though these signs in France make me chuckle every time I see one (radar ahead) I fully understand the point of them, it's to get drivers to slow down!       
In Switzerland it's all about turning a profit.   
In 2009 Kanton Zurich earned CHF   from their radar units..! One unit on Hohlstrasse alone earned CHF  ..!! A total of   speeding citations were issued.

			A 49-year-old Swiss banker has been arrested for allegedly murdering his wife and burying her corpse in the garden, days after he reported her missing.

			What has the garden to do with all that ? More detail please was it a flower garden or vegetable garden ?    
			
			Certain things don't add up in this case, I'm here to give you some clues:   
1) He's Swiss for a start - we never murder anyone (well, often ....)   
2) Bankers always deal within the confines of the law (11th Commandment)   
3) If you're going to do it properly, chop her up into little pieces and feed them to the pigs.       
4) Er, don't even think about disposing of the body in your own garden! In your own garden? Don't bankers ever watch CSI? How stupid do you need to be? There are daily tips of how to do murder properly freely available on TV and the internet.   
5) Bankers, tsk ....

After all, the young Assad also was educated in the UK, right?
		    Dont think it makes much difference. Where he is/was educated will have little to do with the person he will become.   
Parents take note.
		    Does that mean he will now get a PHD from LSE?      Also notable, he was considered the world's best basketball player. In his first games playing, he shot 13 consecutive 3 pointers, with a game total of 138 points.   
He went on to entertain the crowd with his dunking abilities.

			damnit I just gave up my hail insurance.....           
Looks like something heavier is heading our way.
		 
			
			the heat has made you slow man....   
			
			Hooray!  I love storms.  And before someone says I'm callous, and how can I enjoy something which has the freak chance (in Switzerland) of killing people ... well, I like cycling and people die doing that. I like eating and people die doing that. So ner.  Bring on the heavy rain, thunder and lightening!  Basel (well, ok, I) wants it.
		     
I love the storms also, but my car doesnt like the hail that much ......lets see if it actually hits tho as i noticed metteosuisse is quit quick to say things
		 
			
			I am with you on that one!  Real weather, hell yeah!
		    Amazing storms here near the mountains this week......great sight to watch the storms roll over the Alps....and I thought that ""hailstones the size of golfballs"" was a myth until Wednesday afternoon!   
Enjoyed it less last night when I got a puncture 4km from home in the hail and rain storm though    
			
			According to   most of the storms will be in the East. Basel might get 2 or three over the next 24 hours.
		 
			
			My maps upside down. Basel East
		 
			
			Just heard some warnings on the radio... at first I thought they were just promoting the website   but then I realized that it was an actual warning

			Wow this is quite serious then...the storms that is.

			Nothing at all yet in Neuchâtel - getting gradually darker but no wind, rain or storms.
		 
			
			Had a brief hailstorm here in Basel.  Rain has stopped now; temperature risen almost back to what it was before.  Expect two more storms tonight - hopefully one of them heralds the start of some cooler weather.  If not, well, at least the thunderstorms are fun!
		    No sooner did I post that than it started raining and the wind gusting...
		 
			
			Looks ominous when put like this.
		 
			
			Is ""4"" good?    
I think it's time for me to cycle home now the hail has finished before the next storm hits!  Then I can admire it all from my balcony.
		 
			
			Mother Nature likes to shake us off like a bad case of fleas sometimes       Riots in the UK?  Oh, sorry.

		    Yes love to have open windows, but always make sure they are closed when out.  When in watch the wind and quick to start closing, learnt the hard way how quick the wind will take the window and smash the glass.

...and I just took up for you mother nature...
		 
			
			Absolutely nothing here, apart from the fact that the temperature has gone from 30 to 15 over the last four hours. It's just a chilly, cloudy evening with showers. Very boring.

			It's gone very chilly and windy out here - and the clouds rolling down the mountain toward us were something to see! - but only a few spits of rain so far.     
Neighbors are all frantically trying to cram more cars and bikes into their garages though, so I reckon they are expecting hail later on.  Oh, and the storm lights (the 'bad' ones, fast blink) are up on the Walensee.
		 
			
			So where's this storm then?
		 
			
			The hailstones were mildly diverting, but in Basel I think it's fair to say that armageddon has been somewhat underwhelming.   
Or at least, no different to a perfect summer's day weather in the Pennines.
		 
			
			SOfar Schaffhausen is fine, big temp drop but no rain but by the looks of the radar it will change soon.....Getting ready to have at least 2 kids in the bed       I was just thinking exactly that.......
		 
			
			Me too. Not so much as a light breeze in 8001. Radar lies!
		 
			
			So have I missed it......;-)
		    It's coming: if you're in Pfaffikon SZ, you'll get the best of it at dawn tomorrow. If you're in Pfaffikon ZH, you'll get it a few minutes later.       Thought it was meant to be tonight? Dawn you say?
		 
			
			Oh right. So day in tomorrow.... Well got a Pax wardrobe to build that I've put off for a month......groan.
		    Down this end, yes, apparently.   
It's just windy and a bit rainy at the moment, though.
		    I feel that this thread has mislead me. Are we blaming ""Swiss news via The Local"" for the insanity?
		 
			
			Oooh... here it comes! The rain has just picked up suddenly. If it takes six hours to build up, it should be a good 'un!
		 
			
			4am I was awake with Junior and there was maybe 40 minutes of occasional loud thunder and rain but certainly nothing I would say would put anyone in 'great danger'   
pah
		 
			
			So far, the storm's bark has been worse than its bite.     
Hope it stays that way.
		 
			
			Some distant rumbling and rain at 5/6 am is all we got here...
		 
			
			All a bit of a damp squib really.   
			
			What did I miss ?
		    Nothing at all.  Some English like weather....that is all.
		 
			
			love these storms too. 
the sound of the massive thunder at night 
FAAAAAAAAAANTASTIC.
		 
			
			Anyone got some milkshakes to throw?       
			
			NICE.   
Reminds me of home. 
Very normal in JHB South Africa to get these hectic electric thunderstorms every evening in summer. 
I just loves it.      We had some thunder which just about shook the building, which pretty impressive since the building is concrete block. Other than that, wasn't much. Wish the weather would make up it's mind today. It's changing from blue sky to rain about every 45 minutes.
		     ( )   
In other words, MeteoSchweiz have admitted that instead of this:   
Level 4: You will not see Saturday - phone your family and tell them you love them.   
they should have said this:   
Level 3: Raised risk of moist cervelats at Friday BBQs     
Blick still ran with headline ""Mega-Unwetter: Hier wütet der Sturm über der Schweiz"" though       Agreed. Especially since our car was just repaired from the last hail storm.
		    That's cause newspapers are written and go to print in the evening... they were simply so sure that it would happen that they pre-wrote it and pasted some pics in the last second... people only realize that some journos didn't even see the TV programs they write articles about when things go wrong. Last year was there a terrible accident in a German game show with a stunt man falling into a coma. Some Austrian newspaper was too late to change their prewritten piece that was titled ""only Robbie Williams got the show out of a coma""... the show was stopped after the accident - Robbie Williams did not perform.     
Remember this when you buy a paper next time and wonder...
		 
			
			Don't now about bracing for fresh storms. There was nothing here to write home about.  
But yesterday afternoon it was 27C and when I went out this morning it was 9C. 
That felt pretty bracing and fresh.
		 
			
			Well it was extremely windy here all day yesterday, then we had some fantastic lightning at about 4 am.   I was woken up by a loud, prolonged noise such as might be caused by a plane coming in to land, and got up to see because the local landing strip only operates in good visibility, and it turned out to be very long peals of thunder accompanied by some of the fattest lightning bolts I've ever seen. (Can lightning vary in width? or is it just the brightness that gives that impression?)   
Otherwise nothing particularly exciting. The good thing about thunder that sounds like a plane passing overhead is it doesn't wake up the children.    
			
			The storm last night was like a doomsday. 
Storms in here are horrible. Ive never seen anything like this. Im still scared.
		    Whereabouts in Zurich are you?  I thought it was a piss-poor attempt at a storm last night.  Bit of rumbly thunder and a couple of hours of rain.     
			
			Went about with my mother-in-law today, she says that although the storms weren't too bad here, apparently there were some rogue winds (""vindhose""?) in Germany that laid some trees flat out.   
Doing a search for ""vindhose"" shows me tornadoes in Germany... this looks like it's current:    
So, another time to be thankful that although we do get freaky odd weather due to the mountains here, at least for the very most part, we don't seem to be flat enough for tornadoes to develop. The weather yesterday and overnight last night certainly was the type in which they frequently are born.
		 
			
			Apparently, we're in for a hefty storm. Tie up your plants and kids on the balcony and garden, as there will be strong winds over night.          Thanks for that. I've been meaning to get my potted plants indoors but felt too lazy. I guess I'll have to stop procrastinating now after your warning        
Enjoy   he he
		 
			
			not had anything here yet either in Reinach. Although it has gone a wee bit dark, but nothing else... hee hee cant wait for it to start..   sarah x
		    Sounds like an opportunity to me ....   
			
			For the newbies out there. Here is a website with all the storm warnings etc.        
			
			This type of storm is called a Föhn, and is a very strong warm & dry southerly wind, which affects mainly mountain areas.
		 
			
			Alright party people..it looks like we're in for something hefty.       
			
			No wonder you went home early.... Is this overkill again??      This reminds of DVDs which have warnings about ""scenes of mild peril"".
		    Possibly..it's not as bad as yet..supposedly, it's going to get real ugly tomorrow though. If this weather keeps up, we'll have to plan our next couple of EF events in a bunker.    
			
			Ha ha. I just reasured family that we have a bunker. Are the Swiss good they think of everything.
		 
			
			Actually I find it exciting and also realised I need to clear the garden up of loose items. Otherwise it could look like scene from Wizard of Oz.
		          Do you think my curry could blow the storm away?       You curry is beyond slight peril..as a matter of fact, it should be classified as atomic!   So yes, it would blow away this storm...and no, surprisingly enough, I don't need an alka-seltzer.  
(TMI: It's definitley going to burn when exiting the premises.. )
		     
Had to laugh Lib, I didn't think it was that hot was it??  Just as long as you enjoyed it....  you did didn't you????   
			
			Just picked my fence off 20 meters from where it is supposed to be......  broke the posts clean off.
		     
For more info
		 
			
			15 minute walk to work, pants are soaked as if I went swimming, the rest almost soaked though, the umbrella pretty much served to keep my head dry (but my hair is wet from washing anyway  ). I think I counted 3 people who had their umbrella flip inside out- probably more, but most of the journey I had mine in front of me so didn't see much. Where's the snow?
		    I missread this & thought you wrote you have a  !   
I guess we will have to rope ourselves together when we go for lunch     
			
			A gust of wind lifted me off the waterfront in Brunnen and set me down gently in Seelisberg - all at no cost. I'm waiting for the next gust to bring me back across the stormy waters of vierwaldstättersee. Blown' in the wind in the innerschweiz....
		     Fly, fly, fly oh sweet little dove....may your goals set in the horizon be reached by my gentle breeze.    
			
			Well no real wind or rain or any sign of a storm.  Just like being in England with this weather.  Grey and drizzly    
			
			Totally calm in Zurich West.... but many flights have been cancelled today already at Zurich Airport. Some friends just had their mid day flight to Amsterdam cancelled, due to ""bad weather in amsterdam""
		 
			
			We're having quite a bit of wind and heavy rain, south of Bern. Very unpleasant.
		 
			
			I have just been blown over our garden wall into the meadow!  I was trying to rescue our childrens' Big Bobby Blue slide and it and me got blown over and I ended up in a very ungraceful heap in the field with the slide well .. straddling me  .   
Thank God the neighbours were out.
		           
Only 8's and 9's?? What do I have to do?    
			
			Probably have to show your knickers......you know what some are like around here        
OH is sitting at Heathrow waiting for his flight to Zurich but the time just keeps getting put back. It's already over an hour late and he hasn't even been given a gate yet. 
Weather is perfect in London so it must be due to bad weather en route if Zurich is OK.   
It's absolutely awful in Neuchatel and has been all day. (and all of last night)
		 
			
			Same in Geneva   
Horrible weather. Rain and strong winds. If i didnt have to take the mutt out i wouldnt get my pjs off!
		 
			
			I work pretty near Basel airport and just had a 737 fly, let me rephrase, wobble past just under the cloud cover. Almost as if it was flying backwards.
		 
			
			The word was out to stay out of the forests and away from scaffolding due to strong winds.   
So I went running for a couple of hours in the forest and lived to write these words.    
ZRH currently measuring south-westerly winds at 25 knots, temp is +10C, so nothing earth shattering just yet.
		     
I'm supposed to fly to London from Zurich tonight, quite a few flights cancelled already, mine's still shown, for now.
		 
			
			Here in Oberere Baselbiet it is now really quite dangerous.  The children from our village school were not allowed home unless they were being taken by car.  The fire service is out directing cars around blown down branches and roping off pavements under roofs where rows and rows of tiles have blown off.  A load  of tiles crashed to the ground just a couple of metres away from where the car was parked as I waited for the children to get in.  Really not nice.   
We have lit the fire and intend to stay indoors.
		    Lucky you. His one has disappeared from the arrivals list so I'm hoping they've just combined it with the later one. He was due at 15.20 and the next one is due to arrive at 16.55.(an hour later than scheduled)   
Edit: It's just popped back on there with an arrival time of 16.55 so I guess he's up there somewhere now.
		   To all those who have a plane to catch. I once thought I was the lucky one when due to adverse weather (in London) Swiss cancelled all their flights to/from London but Easy Jet went on with their services. I regret it up till now that I was with Easy Jet as the bouncing about in the air was not fun at all and the majority of passengers were so scared it was terrifying. I wished my flight had been cancelled.   
			
			Storm seems to be peaking, regarding strong, blustery winds and horizontal rain, here in the west - and heading eastwards all the time.   
Looks like you folks are in for a noisy night; - and to quote the Oz definition of romantic foreplay:   
- ""You better brace yourself, Sheila""
		 
			
			Batten down the hatches in Zurich, she's a-comin' in...   
Just rescued the contents of the balcony...    
			
			The storm is in full force in the Innerschweiz too.  On my way home today, I was attacked by rain, wind, loose blue barrels rolling around the road and huge sheets of plastic being tossed left and right.     
Wishing you all a safe drive home where ever you are.
		 
			
			Pounding surf from Lac Leman.  If I didn't know better, I'd think it was the ocean out there.  Waves crashing onto the road and pretty big swell.     
I love it!     
Family coming here from New York tomorrow.   No flights from JFK to Europe cancelled.  Apparently, in NY they're saying it's gonna clear during the night.  I think the weather forecasters are calling for heavy snow tomorrow, though, no?
		 
			
			3 hours later Geneva is nice and quiet. Just came back from shopping and im going out again. Might as well take advantage of the calm weather. You never know...
		 
			
			The bad weather is still continuing, and what is worse is the cyclonic wind... 
Today, on my way to home I faced the heavy rain, and strong wind ...I could hardly walk so strong was the wind from the opposite direction 
I pray everyone is safe in this weather.... 
I have never seen this type of weather here in Zurich during my stay of 2 yrs...
		    The worst storm I've experienced was the infamous Lothar storm on December 24, 1999.  Roof tiles were flying through the air as well as anything else that wasn't battened down.  Whole hillsides of forests were blown down and the effects can still be seen today.
		 
			
			So far in Basel-Stadt the effects are nothing more than a normal storm.  Hopefully it stays that way but a bit of me was looking forward to some dramatic weather in otherwise predictable Basel       You have to look back to understand the EasyJet stance to carry on flights to Zurich under all circumstances. EasyJet, after having served Zurich for many years, stopped operating to Zurich due to a conflict with the airport about landing taxes. BUT then, in late March 2006, heavy snowfalls brought the airports of Stuttgart, Basel and Geneva, all served by EasyJet, to a total stop, and EasyJet was forced to carry over hundreds of passengers from Luton to Heathrow and put them onto various rather full British Airways flights to Zurich. BA pushed heavier airplanes onto the route to cope. EasyJet returned to ZRH within less than a year      Sure, trams and buses in Zürich were totally cancelled but SBB and S-Bahn were in full operation.

662	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/133911-one-seven-swiss-risk-poverty-survey.html	" 
			
			Nearly 14 percent of people in Switzerland were exposed to the risk of poverty in 2010, according to a survey conducted by  the Federal Office of Statistics.         
			
			What !!!   
They earn less than 150k CHF net or 200k CHF gross ....   
Surely - this has to be escalated !!!
		 
			
			'In 2010, the average annual income per household in Switzerland was 47,567 francs ($50,654).'   
This should be emailed to every new user who registers.
		 
			
			it's because it costs 100CHF per person to have Fondue!         
			
			Don't forget that Switzerland is also home to a very large number of 'non practising millionaires' !   
see   for explanation
		 
			
			In the article it states 
""For individuals, the poverty line in Switzerland is set at 2,400 francs ($2,554) a month.  
In 2010, the average annual income per household in Switzerland was 47,567 francs ($50,654). ""   
So if the average household consist of at least 2 people then the annual poverty line is 2,400 * 2 * 12 = 52,800 francs. This means the average household with income of 47,567francs  is below the poverty line?  Or did I get something wrong         The poverty line you quote of CHF 2'400 is for a family of four. To this can be added a cheap 3 bedroom apartment, and the subsidised health insurance, so the actual level will vary between areas.
		 
			
			""Households with two adults and two children under 14  with a combined monthly income of less than 5,000 francs ($5,323) are  also considered at risk of poverty.""   
That's for a family of four. The article does specify 2,400 for individuals, not for families. Shoddy (or just incomplete) reporting by the Local perhaps?       yes, having a house and some savings makes you a millionaire here. 
Let me give you your first one:
		    I'm not entirely sure about what he's written. I've got a window on to Baarerstrasse at work, and not an hour goes by without some sort of exotic stopping at the lights below where I sit. By exotic I mean a car that would attention in an ordinary city not known for having loads of wealthy people, rather than just expensive. Porsche, Ferrari, Bentley, Maserati, Corvette, Lamborghini, Lotus, etc. When I was a kid I think I saw one of these cars at most twice a year. Now it's each day. Throw in a huge number of Range Rovers and you get a pretty expensive picture of what the average Zug car is.   
He's right about the place being less ostentatious than certain parts of London, but don't forget people who go to places like Nobu are often not paying for it themselves.   
Also, property prices here can be pretty huge. I called about a PoA from an online site once, and it was 16M for a house by the lakefront. I'll probably wait until zombies take over most of the world before I put an offer in for it.
		 
			
			Yes there are plenty of very rich people in ZH, and in GE and other places like Gstaad - just like in parts of London and the UK.  London is not the UK, and ZH is not Switzerland. Maybe time to visit some other areas?   
It's not just in the UK or the US that the rich are now getting richer, and the poor poorer in the current crisis.
		 
			
			One of my pet peeves.... people think that if you live in Switzerland, you are, of course, well off.   
It's an expensive country for common mortals. 
The cost of living is considerably higher than in other countries.   
There really are families who can not afford to go to the dentist or the doctor or buy their kids prescription glasses.   
A little solidarity doesn't cost much.
		    Really?? It costs me less than 6sfr when it's on sale at Lidl or 2 for 1 around 13-17 francs from Gerber... don't know where you're buying yours from!

			Ah, Vitus, Vitus, Vitus.  I've met him.  He's a short man with colorful clothes.   
First he bans the Fasnachtlers from wearing costumes during a mass just for fasnachtlers (which is rather ironic considering what he wears).   
And now this.   
It's time to have our annual talk again.  I'm not sure if making the Local is exactly the press he wants.
		 
			
			So the Bishop felt choked    
			
			In other words, the bish wants to keep the people ignorant (and unhealthy) and the girls barefoot and pregnant. Aarrgghhh.
		    You mean in the three K´s, Kirche, Küche, Kinder.
		    Well, barefoot and pregnant = more souls for the congregation (and tithes for the coffer), so of course!     
Anyhow, what in tarnation is natural about being ashamed of our bodies and sex? I've never met a baby that was bashful about running around with just a diaper (or even without!), nor have I ever met a baby that was shy about hugging and kissing other babies.   
Shame in these things (and sex) is a purely cultural phenomenon, mainly propagated by those who are ""concerned"" for the ""morality"" of others.    
			
			This thread was started by ""The Local"" guys. Please move on. Don't feed the troll. The interview in question happened several years ago.
		 
			
			Whilst I certainly don't agree with him, he is entitled to his own opinion.   
Perhaps we should stop bashing the bishop...............
		 
			
			""shame"" is taught.  it's not natural.     
What a dolt.
		    You're right.  I'll send him a basket of bananas as a peace offering.
		    I mean seriously, it's time we took a firm grip on negative comments.   
We should take it firmly in hand and work this thing vigorously through to it's natural conclusion.
		      You should be thoroughly ashamed!! Euphemism cannot disguise the filthy and perverted thoughts you are thinking. Obviously you have had your natural sense of shame permanently damaged by sex ed. Or p0rn. Probably the same thing to the Bishop.
		 
			
			I nearly spewed my wine reading that. LOL. Having grown up catholic around all the boys who were getting to know 'father' a bit better than they liked and having a whole different kind of sex ed, I find it rather hilarious there's still a priest left who can say this sort of stuff with a straight face. Now I gotta go refill my wine...maybe I can find someone who can do a water to wine miracle on the way to the kitchen.   J, M and J, reality always trumps fiction in the strange department.
		    Ah, the old 'hairy palms' plan. Don't forget the vaseline and the tissues. And a razor.       Maybe a nice warm canteloupe, too.
		    Cantelopes are a bit too big for the ben wa treatment....
		    You're not sticking the canteloupe IN something. Vice versa, rather.

""Yeah mum, I'm just finishing up my Christmas shopping, nipping into Starbucks for a skinny latte then going home for a bit of ""me"" time with my Ribbed Colossus...""
		    hmm. it's a common topic of conversation when i chat with girls, but maybe that's just me...   i once threatened to get my ex-gf a vibrator for xmas which made watching her gingerly opening her present around the family particularly entertaining    
			
			English Forum needs its own Adult Chat.
		 
			
			Adult chat is for kids       You don't know any cause you haven't met one yet.        
PM me..............     
cheers

			Well who is better than you to know how your body works? Don't leave in someone else hands your own pleasure, me think. Be pro-active and know how the whole mechanic works, so your partner can learn how   work.
		    Really?  Is that why you closed the thread about prostitutes and pussy talk?
		    Present = euphemism for what now exactly....?   
			
			EF needs less German invading noobs
		    Probably even wasn't me, heheh, can't remember. I would certainly not close it for any kind of offensive factor.    
TT pussy talk does not suffice? I will bring it up at our next admin meeting..       LOL Well TT pussy talk is local pussy talk so it does not apply to EF members.   
Seriously now, Adult Chat in TT is more X-rated than that. 
I am sure the admins will be thrilled.       The admin being that Editor Bob guy who runs TT as well? Just he cares about them and not us?
		 
			
			These stats are skewed by the number of bankers here in Switzerland.
		    The surprising thing is that two Swiss women I know, neither of them close friends, have brought up the topic in casual conversation.   
The first, and this was actually the second time we'd ever met and the first that we were together alone, we were discussing Swiss laws about washing machines and I said something along the lines of that every generation of washing machines was more quiet than the last and so soon bans on late night or Sunday washing would be superfluous. She replied she didn't want that because she likes to sit on her washing machine nude when its doing the spin thing. I first thought I'd misunderstood but she confirmed that she was addicted to the vibration. Later on she told me her hobby was reading erotic novels so it may well be that she was trying to tell me something so shame on me for not following it up.    
The second woman who did it, and this was also our first meeting together and it wasn't a date or anything, said her hobby was measuring and keeping track of her temperature. I didn't quite follow and she explained, for the purpose of natural contraception. A bit later she said that on the way home she was passing a shop to pick up some stuff she'd ordered and would I mind coming with her, seeing I would be passing that way anyway on my way home. It turned out the items she had ordered were sex toys and she had the shopkeeper, who presumably thought we were a couple, explain their function to us in great detail.    
So I would say, yes, some at least are very open and comfortable with the topic.
		 
			
			as long as we are talking.. somewhere.. about mod inconsistencies...     
I wonder how long this thread would have lasted had I started it ??     ( not that I would.. I'm Baptist ya know )       Isn't that like catholic light. Same sins half the guilt or something??       I believe, that entirely depends on the priest.       oh no... we've got generations of fire and brimstone, we just don't have the dude in the funny hat
		    Ya, sex is a sin for you guys right?  
It is considered to be a good deed for Jews. 
Sorry, LOL.       No no, totally normal topic of conversation for people who hardly know each other. Stand easy, you didnt misread the situation at all.
		    ya, but what about that whole thing about eating pork?     
naw....it's better to be a Baptist
		 
			
			Does the Vatican's preference for Swiss guards to protect the Pope has something to do with the topic of this very thread?
		 
			
			It happenend to me a while ago, I was looking for some aspirin in a colleague's bathroom cabinet and couldn't believe my eyes what I saw.. My headache was gone in an instant and ever since then I've seen her in a completely different light       you told us enough to get interested but not enough to enjoy it    
			
			Quantity does not beget quality.
		    I was in a local shop wanting to buy large batteries; I mean larger than the AA & AAA I usually buy.  I was not sure the ones I selected were correct size because I did not have my new torch with me.   
I mentioned this dilemma to my Swiss neighbour who was also in the shop & she said if they were no good then she would take them for her vibrator.
		 
			
			Do you see sometimes strange links between threads? Like the present one and this one:          sorry guys....I have a terrible day at work and misuses this thread to release some of the pressure.      I see more the relation to Stocking Filler Ideas This Christmas...haha
		 
			
			come on the hand does what u want and doesnt complain       it was too quick...even for your hand.
		 
			
			I too would like to add a lame masturbation related pun to this thread but at the moment i cannot think of friggin' anything!
		 
			
			Another study says that swiss don't wash hands regularly...
		 
			
			Is the pic in the OP meant to encourage us non-Swiss to up our game?
		       
			
			Maybe this is why the Swiss keep       Oh yeah, I recall, it was a 2 year old thread, wasn't it, or something like that, that a random poster revived, I think it was a newbie too, just to have a few quickly march in and trash talk...when the thread was originally about some laws related to prostitutes? Yeah. Closing it had nothing to do with the topic of conversation.      But you aren't even local so why the quest..       Adult chat in Germany being more X-rated than our forum is not a shocker, hahaha...   
The thing is, it seems to me, here folks like to do it as opposed to chitchat about it anonymously. I think there aren't so many who need to brag online? Dunno.    
I think if the culture was more repressed, than it would make sense to go into the whole sex liberty brag and revelation stuff as it's easier to stand out and score points, but everyone I know here is far from repressed..Maybe I hang out with freaks, who knows.. I am sure everyone here knows how to get their tips and pointers   though, principally I wouldn't be against it. Right after they make my long pushed Swiss Education Subforum, please, hint hint, hahahah. That's a tad more urgent than some random porn talk I can easily outsource elsewhere.
		 
			
			Who does research like this and why 
Perhaps it just proves that the Swiss are more open and honest? 
And that many others are just liars      Closet perverts?      Or they can't come up with good 'conquest' stories to tell their buddies?        I can believe!        all tongue-in-cheek...   
			
			So does this explain  ?   
Tom
		    After the day I've had today this strikes me as perhaps the single most obvious headline of all time.      C-date (casual-dating web site) commissioned the study. They know that such a topic will be taken and published by low-level/quality newspapers à la 20minuten or forums. It will attract enough eye  to justify the expense.      Given my previous explanation, you can't say anything with such a non-scientific motivation of the study. 
I became swiss a few months ago and I did not notice any major change in the ways I use my hand(s).
		    and The Local of course
		    yes of course    
If you check you'll see that it has been the most visited/viewed thread so far under ""TheLocal"".
		     
  The thread I am referring to was a thread started last week by a member called NikkiNikki . She wanted to talk about her experiences visiting the area around Rue de Berne.          So quick to judge. Sheesh. Just because my Hauptwohnsitz happens to be Frankfurt does not mean I don’t own property in Switzerland, and go there frequently for business and fun.        
  Adult chat is not about bragging online. It is about discussing Adult Topics you know with fellow adults. Mind you, TT Adult Chat is not a cheap spot for hookups. I wouldn’t be interested in the Swiss Education Subforum as I have been there and done that.
		    Now we KNOW you are a troll.       It takes one to know one.       No idea who closed it, but have an idea why..       Why judgment? It was a simple question on why you living elsewhere desire adult chat here, heheh. That's all. We aren't really so quick with judgment here, seems like..and when we are, it's a lot more obvious.       Hmmmm.....I will leave that unanswered. Coz I can't nor need to really share my experiences.       There is nothing kinky about Edu Subforum, so true. Though, if you have been there and done that, you could actually contribute. Our brand new future (hello? pweeseee? admin?) Swiss Edu Subforum would love anyone who went through Swiss system and have experiences to share, from a student POV. We have a bunch of profs here already.    
Back to hand jobs.
		    Usually this kind of surveys boils down to things like, ""Who are the best liars?"" and ""What are the taboos in those societies?"" I mean, they ask people, but how do they assess the trustworthiness and reliability of the answers? They can't. Period. I call that scientific masturbation.
		 
			
			Like 'no sex we are British' lol.
		 
			
			I was wondering.... what makes the Swiss so honest about the question ?  
It's hardly a happy hours drinks topic is it ?
		 
			
			So, perhaps the national anthem should be changed to ""Beat It""?    
Tom
		 
			
			Two things to comment on:   
1) No other thread started by ""The Local"" has ever created such a response before. Clearly, there are experts at work here.   
2) Why hasn't anyone created a poll yet? ""How often do you whack off?""   
- What's that? 
- Never alone 
- Hardly ever 
- What is considered normal? 
- My hands never leave my pockets 
- I have 20% discount with Kleenex 
- Etc. 
- Er, that's it ...
		    Rumor has it, grynch got a bad case of carpal tunnel from it..      Unless we have access to the questionnaire we can't draw any conclusion. Sometimes they come up with wacky formulations for questions sent to all nationalities: 
 Question1) check the most frequent option in the last 20 years: 
 - Option 1: smiling to neighbour 
 - Option 2: use hand to please yourself   
One can easily then imagine we come to the conclusion as posted by TheLOCAL in this thread.
		    What about  ?
		    They probably thought it was a tax filing form...      Excellent word association there...from thread title... to happy hours...       Fixed that for you...
		    yes, people tend to boast and exaggerate their sexual performance, but when it comes to masturbation I would expect the opposite to be true.

			Since masturbation feels good and the Swiss do it the most, can we infer the Swiss are the cheeriest people in Europe?
		    Nope....another study revealed that the Danes are the most happy people.....maybe even the happiest wankers.....   
Once a happy camper now a happy wanker ;-)
		    Do they fantasise about filling in tax forms while masturbating? Or is it more the writing anonymous letters to neighbours?
		    Are both possible ?       I cannot tell as I don't camp ;-)

			This thread makes me wonder if the following is true:   
Deaf people (and Swiss in particular) use both hands while...em....spanking the monkey. One to do the (hand)job and one to do the moaning....yeah?       I missed a thread with prostitutes AND pussy talk?         To be fair - there are an awful lot of moaning ex-pats here!      BTW I can't believe you are still at it so to speak (talking about this).
		    What about ""You'll never wank alone""?
		 
			
			Or ...          Oh......why?
		 
			
			Don't want to put a damper on the Swiss being world-class wankers, but this study suffers from what we in academia call sample-selection bias.   
If you get data from a website like c-date, you're pooling from a sample of people that are from a niche of people that are perhaps more likely than the average Joe to masturbate frequently (it's a dating site people). I'd be hestitant to extrapolate such findings to the greater population.   
Thank you, thank you. If your company is on the search for a charming and prudent young economist, please PM me (no, really, I'm on the dole).

Oh well......      Well, it appears to me that the model found the taking of the photo to be a bit stimulating.

			Well, I am surprised to be honest. Geneva and Zurich of course - but Bern? Really? More expensive than Moscow?? Really??   
Although the methodology of the survey is absolute bollocks - apparently Kinshasa is more expensive than New York, and Luanda more than Paris!

Angola might be a poor African country to the unsuspecting eye, but you might pay up to 10.000 USD to have a decent appartment. Decent here being: clean potable water, kitchen apliances, non broken windows, and a security guard to stop you from being raped, murdered or kidnapped when leaving the door to the outside.   
I have 2 friends who work in Angola. I had the same reaction when they told me how freaking expensive it is. Till they got their receipts out of their wallets...
		    This seems to explain why Bern is up there: There are no (only very minor) price differences in the different coop, migros, aldi and lidl shops.

		    Let's name them ""the Swiss Labour Party"" as a compromise !  Interesting is that the Social Democrats originally were a leftist split-away from the Liberals (FDP-Freisinnige). And they in the early days were in favour of nationalisation of services and industry and trade all over. A frequent guest of them at meetings in the Volkshaus and in the Cooperativo and in the Odean in the 1910ies was a certain Mr Vladimir Ilyitch Ulyanov. Who had his very own ideas about the future of the world.

			Switzerland are the best at making watches       Maybe not the best, but the most prestigious, expensive and famous - yes.    
For example, a 200 dollar automatic Seiko will need less service and be as accurate or more than a 3000 dollar automatic Omega.    
On the other hand, the Omega will appreciate on it's value over time given right model/movement. Very recent example, prices have gone up on the used market for the discontinued line of Seamasters where the new one is still not available for sale never mind the 30% increase in price!       I disagree..much like anything in Switzerland, they rely on quality produced back in the days. If I had to buy a watch now, I'd settle for either a Citizen or a Seiko. Much better quality IMO.

Assuming that skill comes with practice and practice involves girls doing ""non-feminine"" (not culturally allowed) things, this would be the explanation... there are other cultures (or cultures-inside-cultures) in which such things are probably evident as well, owing nothing specifically to religion itself.

			Politicians, criminologists and police have called for army-issue weapons to be kept out of the hands of lawbreakers after a young man with a criminal record shot and killed his girlfriend last Friday.         
			
			Another killing, in Neuchâtel       
			
			Very idealistic.  Making it 'illegal' for individuals with criminal records to own/get guns isn't going to stop any of the determined ones from getting guns.
		 
			
			There is no sane reason to keep weapons at home. Maybe if Switzerland moved into the 21st century and realised that wars are no longer fought inside Europe, and especially with WWI tactics, the girl might be alive. The new recruit failed his 3 day entry assessment as the psychologist ruled him unsafe, but his unit still gave him the weapon. The third failure is whom gave him the ammunition? I understand Swiss Army rifle ammunition has a unique size, and cannot be obtained privately.
		    Sure there is.  ""When seconds count, the police are minutes away.""  I'd rather be able to defend myself against a criminal invading my home, than to have to hide and pray.        I'm sure they said that about the 20th century, and then we had the two biggest wars in history...one of which was started in Europe (WWII was already 'started' in the Pacific for several years, IMHO)  There will be wars fought wherever there is a group of people that covet what another group of people have- land, resources, or wealth, and try to use force to take it.      This   should be investigated.  Somebody screwed up, and now somebody's daughter is dead.  It is a horrible tragedy.  The man needs to be further assessed to see if he is fit for trial, and whomsoever enabled him by issuing him a weapon & ammunition after the assessment needs to face charges also.
		    If firearms were the only problem, then countries with strict firearms laws would be the safest places on earth. But in reality, some of them are the most dangerous where only criminals seem to have the monopoly. And by that logic also, Switzerland would have to be the most dangerous, but that isnt true either, and in fact there is a lot less gun crime here than elsewhere. Therefore the issue of no firearms means no violence is complete nonsense. The question here is how did a known unstable person come into contact with a firearm. That is whats to blame.      Right to bear arms isnt something just against foreign armies but more importantly to keep Government in check (History is littered with evidence of where Government has gone mad i.e. Germany), something many people in society have forgotten. People do have a right to defend themselves.   
Wouldnt it be interesting to see how the holocaust in Germany would have turned out had citizens been armed? Or to see how long World War 2 might have lasted? I'd stick my neck out and say that the damage would have been a lot less and a lot less people would have died. There were many Germans who were against what was going on.   
I dont have firearms by the way    
			
			This is slightly concerning...       The Swiss authorities' best guess is over a million adrift.       Kinda proves my earlier point.  There are enough guns floating on the grey and black markets that someone who wanted a gun could get one, law or no law.
		 
			
			Here, I have some very sad news of someone killed by accident in Neuchatel, by a gun.       
It was a colleague of my partners, who was working the night we went and dined Saturday night in Neuchatel.    
When you're next preaching about freedom of owning a gun, human rights and all that, I urge you to think of this young man of 23 years. Not only this guy, but the friend who was there who has been in hospital ever since on medication after being traumatised by seeing his friend killed, the trauma of the person who pulled the trigger, the sadness of all of his friends, and work mates. But in my opinion, the saddest part is his body being flown back to his family in Italy. How tragic, and what was it caused by.... 
A gun.    
Shame on you who voted for that to happen.
		 
			
			Why are you focussing on guns? We should be trying to ban cars: they are the real killers!
		    A)  Practically all cities voted AGAINST soldiers having to keep the army weapon at home, but the countryside had its day 
B)  While the army-psychiatrists wanted to remove him from the force, the militarists wanted him in the army and succeeded 
C)  He is 23 and so most likely already did the ""Obligatorische"". There, you can buy trial-ammunition (in addition to the stuff you have to purchase) but then not use it really .... and so you automatically have some ""private"" ammunition
		    I believe your statements Wolli, but I find this sloppy attitude to dangerous practices completely irresponsible! Especially when the Swiss punish erring motorists extremely hard.
		     
all these sorts of threads need to have this picture posted.   
the swiss, like the americans, like their guns, and are willing to pay the collateral damage in the form of murders and what not. Collectively, they seem to view the freedom to have them greater than the costs to the society this freedom inflicts. Indeed the CHer voted to this effect last year. The brits have drawn other conclusions.    
noones going to change anyone's mind about this issue, for me i think this is one of those third rail topics. Youre never gonna change someone's mind on abortion, and youre never gonna change someone's mind on guns.
		    It would be interesting, though, to see a statistic that shows the amount of people murdered with guns in the US compared with Switzerland (per capita).   
I think the Swiss are mainly indifferent to whether they keep a gun at home and most are duty bound to keep one because they are still in the army.  Most of the Swiss I know find it a hassle and it just takes up space.   My husband was overjoyed to be able to give his back (along with the shedload of army gubbins) about 5 years ago and suddenly we had space in the cellar again!   
You are always going to find cases of mentally unstable people becoming ""a statistic"" but in my experience I think, on the whole, the attitude to gun ownership is a lot different to the US.
		    that's what makes arguing about it all the more fun!    
			
			The other option which no one has yet discussed is introducing non-lethal weapons like spud guns. Although they are unlikely to stop an advancing convoy of heavy tanks and artillery, their whimsical ""popping"" noise may well inflict joviality and childlike urges amongst their protagonists, ultimately leading to world peace and global man hugs.   
This could however lead to more brutal killing with garden shears or gnomes bearing sharp edges during domestic rage and suburban violence.
		     
im sure its vastly higher in the US, we have much more crime than exists here for any number of reasons: greater income disparity, fewer social saftey nets which keep people from feeling like they have nothing to lose, looser control (depends on the state but generally speaking) on guns in circulation and much easier access to ammunition. i think the firearm deaths in the US every year number in the 10s of thousands, although im sure a number of them are ""justified"" and ""defense"" and not technically crimes.   
The US has its cultural myth of the Minute Man ready to go fight the brits, the cowboy in the old west, the rough frontiersman marksman davey crocket type, all the way to the present day belief of ""an armed population can overthrow a repressive govt"" thing. And, like it or not, its in the constitution, and that's fact.   
The swiss have their traditions too of fighting off habsburg encroachment on their territory (although this is admittedly pre firearm) which melds well with the marksmanship and militia fostered in the 19th century when Napoleon was thrown out finally and the Swiss realized that with the growth of the Levee en Masse national conscription armies of the 19th century theyd better match em or risk not being able to maintain independence in the face of armed neighbros. one reason for the ""weapons at home"" tradition that ive heard (dont know if its true tho) was that in the mid 19th century before the ubiquitousness of good rail networks and autobahnen, information travelled slowly and due to the rural nature of CH at the time, it would take an awful long time for the swiss to mobilize their soldiers, get them to their depots, and ship them out, so they opted for everyone to keep their stuff at home to expedite mobilization. Makes sense to me.   
That neither of these large schools of thought for the US or CH are really relevant any longer seems to me to be beside the point: theyre part of the tradition of the countries mentioned and until those myths change the weapons arent going to go anywhere.
		    Sarcasm, right?   
I would go on the theory that statistics could show an idiot with a gun is more likely to kill someone than an idiot with a car. 
I say that despite the massive number of idiots driving in Switzerland.
		    To be fair, I don't think your average Swiss guy thinks that deeply when he's shoving all his army stuff out of the way to get to his skis in the cellar.   
I think another factor why they haven't moved to change the policy that all the stuff is kept at home is the logistical implications.  Can you imagine the army storing all that equipment for the 11 months it's not used by an individual soldier?     
It might as well be gathering dust in our cellar than taking up space in some army camp somewhere.
		    Statistically, you're wrong. In both the US and in Switzerland, auto related deaths per 100,000 people outnumber gun related deaths per 100,000 people by a factor of 2-3. The difference is in Switzerland, most gun related deaths are suicides whereas in the US half are suicides and half are homicides. Thus, in CH, you're more likely to get run over by a banker late for a very important meeting or someone driving while texting than you are to get shot by someone. It's cute the way you defend all things Swiss but you should at least be backing up your claims with facts.
		    about 370 people die each year from motor accidents in switzerland (excluding non-fatal injuries). if we banned cars from switzerland, we'd probably save around 370 lives each year.
		     
you say ""leading to global man hugs"" like its a good thing.    
im not sure i can support that.
		    First off, I'm sorry to hear about your colleagues.  Something like that can only be traumatic and terrible.   
This was not caused by a gun, in and of itself.  It was caused by the action of a person holding the gun.  This premise is comparable to saying that because someone was stabbed by a kitchen knife, it is the fault of the kitchen knife and all kitchen knives should be banned.   
The majority of firearms accidents are caused by one thing- poor decision making by someone owning or using a firearm.  A   second cause is malfunction.   
I'm sorry if I offend you, but I don't believe that my ability to defend myself and my family should be diminished because someone else made or may make a mistake.
		 
			
			Since every gun debate is pretty much a copy-paste of the last one I'll do one better and link the last big one here.          I did a little looking around, and the U.S. Census estimate for 2010 for firearm fatalities in the US is 650, not tens of thousands...      These are not 'myths' but traditions of preparedness and individuality that too many Americans have abandoned for a false sense of government-subsidized safety.  And the Second Amendment is a recognition and affirmation of the right to life (the right to defend one's life), and a legitimate check on the excesses of government (the government doesn't control all the guns).      It makes a lot of sense, and that's why countries like Switzerland and others maintain an armed militia population.      These schools of thought are absolutely relevant today.  Every time in history that man has thought vigilance was no longer necessary, we've had a war.  WWI was thought to be, ""The War to End All Wars,"" but we ended up having WWII, despite Chamberlain's ""Peace in Our Time,"" speech.  We thought the Cold War was the last major conflict, and then a group of fanatics flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.   
BTW, if you take guns away, people who are determined to hurt and kill will just do it with something else.
		     
Yeah, its pretty much like politics and abortion.  Nobody's gonna change any minds, I don't think.
		    i agree. the chance of a major armed conflict within europe will be increasing more and more over the next few years.
		 
			
			@phdoofus   
You are so naive to suggest i back up all things Swiss. Apparently it is Swiss to own a gun and Swiss to use public transport. I do neither and endorse neither here, so you cone shove that argument where the sun doesn't shine.

My point is this. Millions of people get in a car and drive it all over the place every day, killing very few of the people around them. If millions of people (the same number of people) walked around with loaded guns all day (since if we are going to compare apples with apples, then our car is loaded and ready to kill therefore the gun has to be loaded and ready to kill) then surely there would be a lot more deaths by gun than deaths by auto.   
Have I made this simple enough for you? Do I really need to come with statistics to show that your logic is flawed? If everyone in Switzerland ran around with their loaded guns all day, more people would die from accidental gunshot than from accidental auto collisions (a theory, I don't intend to write a doctoral thesis on it to satisfy your opinion to the contrary but am happy to invite you to counter it with your own thesis).
		 
			
			As an addition to what 100% says (not saying I agree with either point of view, but I like statistics):   
It would be interesting to see how many car-related accidental fatalities are caused by the driver, and how many by some other person or object (victim crossing the road without looking, child dropping stone from a bridge, sudden appearance of cat causing car to swerve into tree,...).  
And also how many gun-related accidental fatalities are caused by someone other than the person in charge of the trigger.   
Then you would also have to compare deliberate car-related fatalities (I'm sure there are some, if films are anything to go by ) to deliberate gun-related fatalities.   
I'm sure some other geek has already done this somewhere, just can't be bothered to google it.
		    I agree with your statistic. But my theory has nothing to do with the odds on cause of death as it stands now, rather as to what is more dangerous in the hands of a moron. A car, or a gun?
		    Me neither. it is purely academic at the end of the day. We probably can't change the guns or the driving. We just live on.
		    Dead is dead, regardless of whether you got shot by a gun or run over because of an inattentive driver. You aren't arguing a 'theory', you're putting forth an emotional reaction. A theory says 'X is the cause of Y', you're saying 'It's worse to be killed by X than by Y'.  My statistics were a simple summary of numbers that are very easily found on the internet by a simple Google search. It took me 5 minutes. Nothing complex, trust me. Cars kill more people than guns because, unlike guns, it's likely that your average car owner doesn't think of their vehicle as a dangerous weapon and are, therefore, much less attentive to safety issues when using it. I suggest you start learning how to do it since you seem fond of making proclamations based on emotions and then asking everyone else to back up there statements with links and facts and statistics.
		 
			
			Goodness, there is no point trying to communicate with you.   
I didn't say it is better be killed by a car than a gun or anything on those lines at all. 
I said, if as many people had loaded guns as people that drive cars, for the same time as people drive cars, probably more people would die by loaded gun than by loaded car.   
It is a theory. I am not going to try and spell it out any clearer for the academically challenged.
		    It is indeed tragic and I do sympathise. Guns must be handled with care and it appears that insufficient education was given to these young people about handling firearms. Ignorance can kill as easily as intention, give the guns a break from blame.
		     It seems like a rather facetious remark to indicate that de-armament of a nation or society leads to an increase in gun related crime, I'd like to see your evidence for this, In the UK hand guns are banned and hand gun related crime is almost non-existent, the recent spate in the UK of rifle crime would be equally diminished if we banned all guns.     We don't have a 'right to bare arms', the Americans do, that is similar to the statement that morons who vote for UKIP spout out 'no taxation without representation', we don't have a constitution or bill of rights, America is over 2000 miles away, and the war of independence was over 200 years ago, meaningless statements referencing a system that is alien is pointless and confusing.     I think your last point about WW2 Germany is laughable to say the least; it was the Nazi death squads of the 30's that had the guns and forced the will of the party on the common man.     Based on your reasoning would it have been advisable to arm the Hutus and the tootsies, or the Bosnians? Do you think its a good idea to chuck them all Kalashnikovs and close the door? What a brilliant foreign policy...      calling a brain-fart a theory doesn't really give it more legitimacy.   
coming up with hypothetical straw-man arguments doesn't really mean you win the argument.   
people die from guns. a large proportion of those deaths are deliberate and so a high proportion would have happened anyway even if guns were eliminated from switzerland.   
people die from car accidents. presumably most of these are not deliberate and so would not have happened if cars were eliminated from switzerland.   
we accept guns because they secure the defence of the country and secure the freedom that all other freedoms are built upon.   
we accept cars because they make our lives more convenient.   
a small number of deaths each year is the price we pay for our freedom and convenience.
		       Hang on, hang on...     This is also a false comparison of the highest order; we do not 'need' guns. Is the ultimate price paid by the death of innocents for a toy equal to the necessity of a car?  Well no, it's not, not at all   
			
			We cannot directly compare gun related deaths to car related deaths, even when we (attempt to)factor in the disparity in total numbers and usage of each.   
The car's main function is to get someone or something from A to B, the guns main function is to kill or seriously injure.   
Most car deaths are accidents, most gun deaths are deliberate. You cannot compare the two and doing so does not advance the debate as you are comparing apples with oranges.   
My personal opinion is not that guns kill people, but that people kill people. Whether they use a gun or a knife or a rope or a car doesn't change the fact that if someone wants someone else dead, it is going to happen one way or another.   
While the removal of legal firearms from the home may lessen accidental gun deaths, I propose that it would only slightly lessen deliberate gun deaths. Other deliberate methods of killing may also rise a similar amount.   
I'm sure that there are some that say that any lessening of death is a goal to strive for but if that were the case than pretty much everything would need to be banned, from electricity to pillows. Everything has the potential to kill but for our physical and mental well being some things need to be tolerated.
		    i'd say defence and security are more important than being able to drive to the shops instead of taking the train.
		     finally, an intelligent comment, I agree but with a caveat:- some men can kill with their bare hands e.g. boxers, MMA guys ,special forces etc, these guys are licensed and arrested if they do so because it is easier for them to kill, a gun makes things really easy for anyone to kill, you try killing someone with a knife, bloody hard work, or strangling someone, it takes ages, the indiscriminant and easy method of killing by gun (or bomb) is the problem.     If someone wants to kill others we should keep it hard work.     Its funny we don't have any opposing points of view about bombers, there are a few budding chemists and electrical engineers out there who would probably love constructing bombs for fun.     Its not alright to bomb but it is alright to shoot?      I'd agree, that is why we have the police, or army.
		    An public transportation
		    Who keep their guns at home, for the record. And make up a very significant percentage of the Swiss population.
		    Umm yes, the common man was unarmed. That was my point. Had the common man been armed then history may have taken a different direction.      No, thats based on your reasoning. My foreign policy is to keep out of other peoples business and stop influencing other countries. Besides, both those groups you listed above were forced together by external powers - now thats hardly brilliant foreign policy.   
p.s is there any chance you can take some of the emotion out of your posts? - i.e like when you use the words 'morons' or the occasional insult you seem to throw around (And before you ask Im not from UK so dont vote for UKIP - though im sure some people on this forum might).
		    An interesting question though is whether a baseball bat* (or pepper spray) could be as effective in the case of an intruder entering your home as a gun in the long term. A gun, of course, is a better deterrent if people KNOW for a fact that you have one and are willing to (capably) use it but there are very few ways to broadcast that you own a gun to everyone (which I guess is why dogs are great deterents as they are easily visible). In the case of an intruder looking for valuables a baseball bat(or even your simple awareness that they are there) may be just as effective in scaring them off while someone coming to do you or your family harm would probably be armed themselves in some shape or form.   
Basically, in my own personal opinion of course, a gun is only useful if you have the time to load it(assuming you don't want to keep a loaded gun in the house), are willing(if not willing then the gun may become a liability as intruder may take it from you and be themselves willing) and properly trained to use it (once again if not properly trained you may do more harm than good).   
Just as an aside, would the majority of intruders carry guns if the majority of home owners also had guns? Does one side escalating matters mean the other side would also respond in kind?   
*Maybe ice hockey stick is more apt for Switzerland       With training usually comes the ability to judge when the person has had enough and anymore is going to endanger them. For a boxer it is usually when your opponent falls down (you don't keep pummelling them), for special forces there are different techniques for disabling and killing etc. They must also live with the consequences of their training if they do go too far and kill or seriously injure someone.      True, guns make things simpler for the actual act but if you are planning to kill someone then chances are you don't really care about a bit of extra effort. I assume with the original topic what it is that we aren't really discussing accidental gun deaths.   
There are very few defences for the keeping of bombs for personal use. Firearms can be said to be kept for defence as they are (relatively) accurate (when properly trained) and with a fairly limited area of effect while a bomb is pretty much meant for large(er) scale destruction.
		    Or more of the common man would have been killed by the better trained and coordinated professionals who would then see the common man as a larger threat. We just don't know.
		    My post refers to choice rather than bodycount. Had the millions that were rounded up and perished in Germany been given a choice to defend themselves then maybe the intent of Germany's leaders would have toned down their aggression and could have never gained traction in the first place. Its all hypothetical of course, but im sure many people in the same circumstances would say 'i would like to defend myself and my family if my otherwise end result is this....'.    
Using death squads against unarmed cilivians is purely one sided, hence it will always be easy to execute with little opposition if thats the intent already like it was in Germany. However when it is matched with another armed side with possibility of resistence, then what you might end up with is a stalemate. i.e. everyone lives, maybe as Im only taking prior to WW2 here. Its not a surprise that totalitarian regimes are always for the confiscation of weapons in private hands. In communist Eastern Europe if you were suspected of being even slightly anti government, you would immediately lose your strictly regulated hunting rifle for example (if you had one which was already very difficult).   
Anyways.......
		    well, i guess we are still in an old model of trinitarian war with state, army and people as separate actors and the people more often than not the 'victims' or 'spoils' of war.   
i guess in modern times 'state' has been weakened and may be replaced by political elites or economic elites.   
i think in the next couple of decades, europe will re-learn the lessons of war and realpolitik and its people will re-learn their lowly position as victims of war and as the spoils of war (primarily as units of labour and taxation).   
i like switzerland since the state, army and people are more 'unified'  than many other models and i think the swiss will see the benefit of being a people that live together, govern together and fight together.
		    I agree with you 100% that I would prefer to defend myself and my family. I just wanted to point out that things are rarely black and white that x action would lead to y result.   
As you say, we'll never know.
		    The common man was armed before 1933, and then the more militant and feckless ones organised in paramilitary organisations - that's how the Nazi (and the Communist) party armies = SA, SS,   were able to undermine democratic institutions.   
But of course walking around thinking that you have an enormous gun makes you feel happy you bought that rifle I suppose.
		    Or this 'spate' could be criminals seeking another venue for a weapon with which to use in the commission of a crime.  If not handguns, then rifles.  If not guns at all, then knives and bludgeons.  A determined, violent person will find a way to maim or kill.  Before guns were even invented, people were killing each other.      Its not alien to an American.    Do you think these death squads would have been anywhere near as eager to kick someone's door in, if they knew there was a possibility of someone pointing a Mauser or a Luger at them and using it in self-defense.  Nazi death squads are a perfect example of a government excess that occurs when the government controls all the guns (i.e. the citizens can't arm themselves).  These 'laughable' excesses are exactly why the US has the Second Amendment.    I don't see where this was said, nor implied.  Avoid demagoguery- it always comes across as the last resort of the one who hasn't any facts to cite.
		    It's the mindset of a gun as a toy that leads to so many accidental gun injuries and fatalities.  The   thing any responsible firearm operator/owner does is learn proper gun safety.     
We don't need guns, except when an opposing country invades ours... 
...And they have guns.   
We don't need guns, except when a criminal has broken into our house and the police are nowhere near... 
...And the hood has a gun.
		    You seem to think Nazi Germany had some sort of Rule of Law and that ""Nazi death squads"" were some sort of illegal thing, and that a couple folks with guns standing on their front porch would have scared them off. The reallity is that they were sent by the Nazi government, and that they were to some extend the executive arm of the government. Armed resistance against the Nazi governement = high treason in their book.    
It did happen of course, and was without fail met with brutal repression (i.e. execution and/or imprisonment in concentration camps), not only against the perpetrators but also their families. This included repression related to events that pre-dated the Nazi's accession to power (""Altona Bloody Sunday"" 17 Juli 1932 - 4 suspected communists were beheaded for this in 1933). Heavy stuff, innit?
		    Sorry, couldn't  ...       Gun controls began in Germany in 1928. The Constitution prior had no rights to bear arms anyways and its true that Hitler came to power without armed force. After 1933 they started to take firearms out of the hands of opponents and then to solidify that action, in 1938 a new gun control law came into affect which began to disarm most of the 'non nazi' populace. I guess being so long ago some can continue to play around with the details, dates and intricacies all they want and we will probably never know whats true and whats not, but all totalitarian regimes impose strict gun controls as was the case there. So the only point referred to in my post is,, could it have been a different outcome had that not been the case? Maybe, maybe not. This is starting to shift off topic though.      Probably relevant to someone else I would imagine.
		    No, the Nazis had the Rule of Man, 1 man- I believe we all agree upon that and I don't think I ever said nor implied that there existed any other scenario.  Nor did I say or imply that Nazi death squads were illegal- they were perfectly legal by Hitler's rules, which is why I (correctly) described them as a government excess (Hitler   the government).  And no, I don't think 'a couple folks with guns standing on their front porch would have scared them off.'  I   think that the lowly Private who had the responsibility of kicking in the door and being first in would have been (much, IMHO) more likely to hesitate had he known there was a possibility of meeting armed resistance.  Thuggery is very easy when you have all the guns.   
If you want a more recent example of what happens to excessive regimes when the citizens arm themselves in their own defense, you should give Qadaffi a ring and ask him how an armed populace was able to check his government's excesses.     
			
			We're not in a conflict, and have not been for 500 years. 
Weapons of any kind have absolutely no place in today's society.
		 
			
			According to the german Wikipedia article regarding the german weapens law, the Nazis, did actually   the common man:       roughly translated:   
Wheras Jews, Gipsies, Homosexuals, and other enemies of the state were completely disarmed, the government equipped the people and its organisations extensively with weapons. A license was only needed for handguns, whereas long guns and ammunition could be bought freely.   
(This is in contrast to the weapons laws of the Weimar Republic, which have been much more restrictive: until 1928 possession of weapons were forbidden, after 28 only with license).   
As most common men proberabley do not classifie as enemies of the state, the would have had the possibility to defend themselves using weapons
		    I would not jump to such a totalitarian position. But I support all moves to reduce the place of military weapons, by A) organizing things in a way that the soldiers can leave the weapons at an arsenal (of the soldier's choice) and B) by abolishing the ""Obligatorische"" which only is kept up to finance those Schützenvereine  and C) by changing the Swiss armed forces into a fully professional army
		    Weren't those the exact groups the Nazis were rounding up and shipping to concentration camps?  And why, in your opinion, are these people not to be considered 'the common man'?
		    What defines a weapon?  As others have pointed out, a car can be used to kill- should we then, by this rationale, abolish cars?  What about rolling pins?  One could strike another over the head with one of these and kill, thus it is a weapon.  So, no more pies then?     
There's no way to eliminate weapons, as a violent person would ultimately resort to his/her own fists, if nothing else were available.
		 
			
			As a hopeless idealist and pacifist, had I been born in another generation, I might have answered tanks with flowers. 
Not saying it would have worked or would have been worth anything.. but one should stand up for one's beliefs and, if possible, make small changes for a better world.   
It's not totalitarian to say that weapons have no place whatsoever, in every day society.
		     
Here some statistic ,in a country where guns are illegal
		    I admire your idealism.    
			
			I don't see how people can defend guns. Honestly, I just don't understand it. Anyway that's just me.    
The case in Neuchatel, was an accident. It wasn't a moronic person who did it. The thing which happened was stupid, but the fact is that if the gun wasn't there; no one one have died, so many lives wouldn't have been ruined.    
As for guns being Swiss and in Swiss culture. Most of the Swiss I know hate guns, hate the glorification of guns and gun culture.   
Yes, people killed each other before guns even existed. This is obvious. A gun cannot be compared to a kitchen knife, or a car, please think about it if you are one of the people who keeps comparing them. A gun is made to murder, instantly.    
If it was your daughter or son who was killed, by accident by a stupid gun, maybe you'd see it differently.   
As for the people who say that opinions can't be changed - well you're wrong. Maybe I'm not the person to do it. Maybe it will take someone close to you to be killed, I know in this tragic case, a lot of people in the circle now feel differently about guns.   
As for protecting your family, I seriously believe you need to re-think your ideas. Having a gun in the house is putting people in more danger. In your opinion you are the only person who will use it, the one responsible, well life isn't clear and simple.... Just as you can get a hold of it, anyone else can. You can use other things to protect yourself, if you really feel the need to.
		    The idea that the soldiers should have their guns at home is out of times when at least one member of the family was usually around or at least nearby. While the reality today is that guns are in households where the members of the household during the day are 10 or 20 or 30 kilometers away. I had the gun in a cupboard on top and behind in two WWII towels (black and dark-red) and so practically not visible. It of course was good for that thing, but most of all it was secure for all of us.   
The trouble is that the shooting-clubs realize that a law which would make it possible for the soldiers (or mandatory) to deposit the rubbish in an arsenal over a certain period would lead to an abolishment of the ""Obligatorische"" (Compulsary shooting) which is the financial basis for many of those clubs. As you have to buy the ammunition for something you do not wish but are condemned to do        Hmmm, Switzerland hasn't been invaded since 1798 and even if it was, do you think conscripts with a rifle and a hundred or so rounds each at home would do   against an invading force, you are sadly mistaken.   
Just out of interest, when was the last time you were confronted by a criminal in your home?
		    Really? The handguns and improvised explosives used in Iraq gave the strongest army of the world a pretty hard time in the last decade, no? And those Iraqis did not receive the same military training Swiss men got.   
Honestly: From a defense perspective is it the most cost efficient and logical strategy. The question is more if you really need a defense strategy right now as there is no nazi nor communist threat anymore and Switzerland does not have any oil or natural resources worth invading...
		    Word.   
Bomb disposal Robot-> 10,000 USD 
IED -> 50 USD.

not entirely true. ive heard somewhere CH has 11% of europe's water.    
could well become an issue later
		    OK, I can actually speak from experience here, so forgive me if I come across a bit strong....   
How do you know what training the Iraqi insurgency has?  You seem to be making the very same mistake as the invading forces, i.e.  Underestimating them.  You are talking a people who have bene operationally at war, on and off, for the last 30 ir so years.  No amount of training hardens you like that, the Iraqi insurgents would do very well against a conscript Swiss army, but that is by the by really and a completely different argument.   
I have heard of no other country that allows military grade weaponry to be taken home.  It's insane.  Even when in the British army, unless we were on operations, our weapons were kept under lock and key in an armoury.  Where they should be.   
Were we actually talking Iraq, Afghanistan or Kuwait, I might be able to understand the need to prepare for a possible invasion, as they have all been invaded very recently.  But Switzerland??  We're talking a country that managed to avoid involvement in 2 of the biggest wars this panet has every seen, whilst being geographically slap bang in the middle of it.   
My point about rifles at home being no defense is a very pertinent one, were Switzerland to be invaded, having rifles at home would do nothing.  Nothing.  Your use of Iraq is a poor example for one reason, it didn't stop them being invaded did it?
		    I truly respect your opinion, and I will defend your right to have it to the utmost; however I simply disagree with it.        Most firearms accidents are not caused by 'moronic' people, truly, but people who make mistakes.  Unfortunately, guns are not very forgiving.  Still, it was a person who discharged the firearm; the gun did not go off by itself.  Again, I am very sorry to hear about this tragic event, and my heart goes out to yourself and your colleague.      I can't speak to this, as I don't personally know any Swiss whom I could ask.      More people die in the US in automobile collisions than by firearm accidents.  Further, more children in the US die in backyard swimming pools than die in firearm accidents.  I think the comparisons are valid in pointing out the differing levels of attention these topics get.  However, firearms are what gets the negative attention.   
No, guns are not 'made to murder.'  Guns are made to discharge a bullet.  Murder is an illegal action, and used in this manner, only serves to emotionally load the argument.  There are many legitimate functions that are served by firearms: hunting, target shooting, and self defense are the first that come to my mind.      I don't have any children (yet), so I don't know how I would feel if this ever happened to me.  I pray I never find myself in that situation, and I know I will do everything in my power to prevent it.      I truly respect you for standing for your beliefs, even though they may be different from my own.  Discussing these things, IMO, is the only way our beliefs become better and stronger, whether that is a reaffirmation of our existing beliefs or a modification after new information has been considered.      Simply having a gun in the house does not put anyone in danger.  Having grown up in a house with guns (multiple) in the house, as well as coming from families that have a history of keeping firearms in the house for more than 2 centuries, all without one accident, I can personally attest to this.  My opinion never was that I would be the only person who would use a firearm- if my wife needed it to defend herself, she could use it also.   
I   use something else to defend myself, but when I am faced by a weapon-wielding criminal, I want only the most effective, most guaranteed way of defending myself and my family.  Sprays can blow back in my face, and some people have a very high tolerance to the discomfort caused by these things.  Tasers, knives, and bludgeons all have a limited reach, meaning that I have to put myself in more danger to get close enough to defend myself.  Stun-guns require complicated reloading processes in the likely event I miss with the first shot; meanwhile the attacker could close the distance and then I'm in trouble.  A firearm offers me the best potential to stop someone determined on doing myself or my family harm.      Simply because Switzerland hasn't been invaded recently does not imply it will not happen again.  As recently as WWII, there were plans for a German invasion of Switzerland; it is simply because the opportunity never arose for the Germans that it didn't happen.  I'd rather not depend on chance to defend my country.   
Conscripts at least have training and proper military organization; I think that they would be able to put forth a good defense of their homelands, if the call came.  If you want to find out what a bunch of   tribesmen with 'a rifle and a hundred or so rounds each at home' can do to one of the most powerful military forces in human history, you can ask any veterans of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Or if you want a more recent example- take a look at Libya.      Hasn't happened yet, and I pray it never happens, but again, this is not an indicator of whether or not it will happen.  If it does, I'd like to be prepared for it.
		    Hi Jobs, firstly, allow me to say, like you, I do respect your opinion, but i disagree with most of it, if not all.   
When you have a country of 320 or so million, 40,000 road deaths a year, while still high, has to be taken into context against the size of the population.   
I can't be bothered to trawl through all the statisitcics here, but all I shall say is PLEASE take a look for yourself.   
The US is the poorest of poor examples you could use, per 100,000 people they have more Homocides (NOT accidents you note) than any other ""civilised/western"" country on earth.     
Now, look through the rest of the league table... what do most, if not all of the countries in the top 10 have in common?   
Guns are legal.   
Using the argument that you need it for protection, again, does not wash.  How many times in your entire life have you had need of a gun?  If you are robbed or burgled, it is the police's job to bring them to justice.  Not yours.  We do not live in the wild west.   
This total rubbish and condescending view of these ""tribesman"" really does grate, these ""tribesmen"" are INFINITELY better equipped for war than the conscript swiss army.  Where you get this impression from astounds me.   
What the allies found in Afghan and Iraq were not ""Tribesmen"" with sticks,  handguns and a few hand grenades.  these were highly trained, highly motivated and well equipped soldiers and, for the most part, they had been fightiong for years.   
As for Libya..... do you honestly think Gadaffi would have been toppled without the massive support of the west?   Honestly??   
I guess some may get their news from CNN... I'd suggest a change.
		    No, you have this the other way around respectfully. What your talking here is occupiers versus defenders. It doesnt matter if you are an Iraqi, Chinese or French. Defenders will ALWAYS have an advantage on local terrain, and very importantly, sympathy from the civilian population. Those things usually destroy occupying forces long term because they demoralise and bankrupt them.   
I dont know whether Iraqis are better forces than Swiss, but i do know that the Swiss, and every male, can fight as a unit and has the basic training - the key here being the unit part, which means it can take orders from a strategical sense. Thats a big difference between handing a cilivian a weapon or a trained fighter.      But can you not see why? Everything is done on a risk versus benefit analysis, even crossing the road. Do you think that maybe the reason why the Swiss werent invaded was because in the risk part you would have to put 'armed guerilla/militia force' and the costs of that would have been high. I dont understand the logic of people saying, 'but the swiss werent invaded', as thats the whole point, its a deterent. Its a deterent to the point that an occupying force 'could' win, but the costs would be so high that the occupying force would have to consider also not bothering. The Swiss are not trained as a occupying army. The fact the Swiss have these capabilities is probably the reason why the Swiss werent to be invaded at the beginning of the war (WW2), but towards its end.      Having rifles at home is an advantage. The first things that get knocked out during a crisis such as wars are the armory's. Without an armory an army is nothing and the Swiss as a defending force know that. Now whether that justifies arms at home or not is another matter.
		    And do you think their being armed to the teeth had little or nothing to do with the Swiss having been surrounded by belligerents but not invaded during both of those wars?
		    Erm, are you serious? The difference here is that Switzerland has a clear defense strategy that is ""sure you can invade, we'll snipe you in the back like our national hero did"". Iraq on the other hand was completely misunderstood by the US government before the invasion - they expected people to dance on the street of joy for them ""bringing democracy"". It caught them as a surprise. So the question is hypothetical: ""If the US government had been able to foresee the entire guerilla war - would they still have invaded Iraq?"" or simply put ""how many soldiers were they willing to lose in exchange of an occupation of Iraq?"". The trick of the strategy is to not prevent an invasion but to make it expensive.   
But anyway: Why does it matter if the firearm is ""military grade""? Germany has for example a pretty strict gun control. Did not stop high school massacres either as there always is and always will be a black market - if you are nuts and you want something, you'll get it. 99.x% of Swiss soldiers aren't nuts and don't go crazy with their gun. What upsets me is that time and again you'll find that all warning signs were there before one did go berserk. The teenage shooter from Höngg for example had a formal file from a mental hospital saying that he is not stable... and the army still gave him a gun home. That's the problem, not the gun itself.
		    Thank you, I appreciate that.      While there are 40,000 road deaths in a year in the US, the number of accidental deaths due to firearms numbers only in the hundreds annually; meanwhile there are many more firearms in the US than automobiles.  Like I said, the average person in the US is much more likely to die from many other things than from a firearm.   
Introducing homicides, in general (intentional as well as accidental) changes the numbers somewhat, but you do not differentiate between justifiable homicide (self-defense, legal police action) and illegal homicide.  I was discussing firearms accidents only, because, IMO, if someone wants to kill someone, either by premeditation or impulse, they'll find something to use, whether or not a gun is available, so homicide rate is no indicator of the safety of firearms nor an argument against them.      The 'Wild West' is a poor comparison.  Guns are heavily regulated, and Americans do not walk around with six-shooters on their hips, waiting to have a shootout at high noon.  The origins of the 'Wild West' cowboy was from the general lack of law enforcement presence at that time.  Many towns had only a one-person police department; some had no police department.  If one wanted to protect one's life, property, and freedom, one had to do it oneself.  This is no different than in any other country in the history of the world- the US just did it in an age of guns.     
As I said earlier, past history is not an indication of future performance.  I could live 99% of my life without ever encountering a situation where I might need to protect myself, but I would choose to be prepared for the 1% incident that could make that 99% a much shorter time on Earth than I choose.   
Yes, it is the police's job, but the police are not always outside my door (nor do I want them there), but more likely some distance and time away.  When someone invades my home and threatens my family, I need to defend myself  , not when the police arrive.  By then, I could be dead.      I actually believe I was speaking in admiration of these tribesmen.  Most have no formal education, much less proper military training.  I agree with your premise that living one's life in a constantly warring environment hardens oneself, and the survivors learn quickly from the mistakes of the dead, but I agree with others who have said that you discount the value of people defending their homeland.  Additionally, you overlooked the geographic advantages the Swiss have in defending their country.  The Alps create a huge strategic barrier to invading armies and smaller groups of less-well-trained conscripts could hold off a larger professional army in the mountain passes for quite some time, possibly enough time for another country to come to Switzerland's aid.      Would the West have gotten involved if the insurgents hadn't chosen to oppose Qadaffi's regime?  My brother was 'over there' and involved in the US action against Qadaffi forces; if there hadn't been some belief in the viability of these forces, we wouldn't have supported them.  I agree with you, however, in that they needed Western help to complete the job sooner, but I think they would've done it eventually.      I don't watch CNN.    At all.
		 
			
			Wow, if you are honestly trying to suggest that Hitler took a look at Switzerland said ""Bugger that, they've got people at home with rifles.""  I'm not sure what else to say.  incredible.   
I will say this again, any conscript army is about as much use against a modern invading force as a wet tissue.
		    No, Hitler said ""I want Switzerland, but I've got bigger fish to fry- Britain and Russia.""  Fortunately, the Allies turned the tide, and Hitler never got his chance.  Do you think that he would've left Switzerland alone if he had had the opportunity to consolidate his ill-gotten gains?   
Switzerland was fortunate, but eventually luck runs out.  And then you need to defend your country...
		    Yeah, just look at  , for example.       Just maybe you're not sure what to say because you don't know what you're talking about.  What the Nazis thought about Switzerland has been adequately documented   and  .  Try pretending to be incredulous after reading those books.   
And they weren't ""people at home with rifles"" — some 20% of the population was continuously under arms and mobilized throughout the war.
		    Excellent, I tried, but there's only so many times you can listen to the ophrase ""Go beyond borders"" before you want to throw something hard at the TV   
My brother was also over there my old fruit, and they would NEVER have completed the job without western help, regardless of how long it took.  Without the no fly zone the rebels would have been crushed within about a month.   
I HAVE to ask where you get your figures from?  The papers I have read put the figure of gun murders, no suicides or accidents, at 16,000 a year in the US.   
Your point about someone will find a way to kill someone if they want to is absolutely spot on, however, how many of all murders are ""crimes of passion,"" murder comitted in the heat of the moment?  My guess is most, very few murders are premeditated.  How many of those muders would have been avoided if the perpetrator had no access to a gun?   
Geographically, you are 100% correct, you can draw huge paralells between Switzerland and Afghan actually.  I would suggest that, and not any weapons that any invading force might be up against, would be the biggest deciding factor.   
You, and other pro-gun friends I debate with, constantly use the line ""To protect my family.""  From what and who?  Have you ever heard of a situation where a family have all been killed in a burglary or robbery?  Honest question, I've not heard of any, maybe you have.
		    You can't have it both ways, you suggested that that one of the reasons Switzerland avoided the wars was due to the fact it's inhabitants had guns.  Now it was because he had other fish to fry.          I should have phrased that better, thanks for pointing it out.   
Israel have been in a state of war for pretty much its whole existence, and have not yet been invaded. ;-)
		    Fixed that for you.       I will disagree with that, again. Geography is only one part, the other is resources. Israel has a terrible geographical location, actually its really bad - if they could move their country, they would  . Yet they're access to resources overcomes that, even from a stand point of number of men vs resources. They have proven that decisively time and again.    
The fact that Switzerland can combine geography with resources was a reason to put it at the end of the list in WW2 IMO.
		    No, I am poorly informed on the Swiss neutrality during the war, this I will admit.   
However, do you think that this case for weapons at home still stands?
		    Actually, you know well that there were a handful of factors - not least an ongoing war on several fronts or the fact that there were some Swiss sympathies on their side as well, which resulted in trades during WWII which have tarnished any kind of Swiss reputation well into present days..   
Other than that, I quite enjoy following this discussion.. keep it going..
		    You are spot on here. But remember that neutrality means that you CONTINUE to trade with all parties the same as always. The Swiss did that, and this does sadly go down very badly with many people. But that is what neutrality is. If the Swiss stopped trading with one side then that obviously is no longer a neutral position. This is why I dont like when people always pull out that the Swiss traded with Germany - they had little choice if one was to remain neutral - and the consideration of swiss citizens was whats at stake - government first and foremost has a duty to its own citizens.   
I take my hat off to the Swiss because they were in an extremely cra%^y situation. They decided to put their political ideologies to one side (even though there were some nazi sympathizers here as well as the polar opposite) and instead concentrate on what was best for their citizens regardless. While doing so they did not say, 'we are neutral, therefore we wont be invaded'. They instead prepared for Nazi invasion, accepting ALL possibilities of what could happen.
		    Sorry, but it really cracks me up when I hear something in the ""they had no choice"" line. Do you actually know what happened?  
- Switzerland produced ammunition and sold it to ONE side, Germany. The allies bombed the factories in Schaffhausen as a retaliation (officially the bombers lost their way to Konstanz and by pure coincidence happened to bomb a weapons factory...) 
- A five digit number of ""forced labour"" in Germany worked for Swiss companies, for example Maggi, Nestle, Lonza. Nobody can force them to use these slaves for their factories (German companies had a hard time to say no, but any Swiss boss could simply say ""sorry, we are neutral, so I cannot use them""), they actively decided to benefit from them. 
- don't get me started on the entire Nazi gold story or the ""lost"" accounts of Jewish victims of the holocaust.   
In short: Switzerland was not neutral. Maybe the average Swiss person was, but the industrial and financial leaders were anything but neutral. They worked hand in hand with the Nazis and delivered important products for the war effort. And that's exactly why nobody invaded the country.
		 
			
			Firstly, I have to apologise.  In my naturally liberal lefty nature, I jumped into a discussion about Swiss gun laws without knowing some of the facts.  Some have now been pointed out to me and some, I've gone and had a quick look on t'interweb... google's magic.   
My ""people at homes with guns"" line was way off as I now understand it.  however, the fact that Switzerland had a militarised population would really have factored little into Hitler's considerations.   
""  with the general mobilization in 1939 and  border occupation by 430,000 troops (20 % of the employed persons). However, their equipment was not very up to date. Eugen Bircher, a  Swiss colonel at the time,  probably made a correct assessment of the situation  when saying that the Germans would have been able to advance towards the Swiss capital Berne with a single tank regiment easily.  (Edgar Bonjour, Neutralität, Bd. IV, 1970, p. 379 quoted afterIndependent  Commission of Experts Switzerland - World War II, final report, German edition, p. 92. Note that the english edition of the final report, p. 89f does not give the important adverb ""easily"") 
This assessment was shared (but not declared publicly) by a broad majority of leading Swiss Army officers. As a consequence Switzerland's commander in chief  developped his famous   in summer 1940, according to which the   if attacked, but would have        
From my limited reading, please correct me if I'm wrong here, but wasn't one of the reasons Hitler didn't immediately invade was the railway line between Italy and Germany which the Germans and Italians were allowed to transpost sealed box cars through Switzerland?  The swiss were able to export to these countires in return.  The swiss had threatened to blow up that railway and all connecting tunnels and bridges in the event of any invasion.   
Again, apologies for my lack of knowledge here.   
However, as enlightening as this is, and it is, I still see no reason for this policy still existing today.
		    Again, I was speaking of firearms accidents- not intentional shootings, which was around 650 in the US for 2010.  And like I said, factoring in intentional shootings raises the number to around 16,000 a year, which, is still less than the number of automobile-related fatalities in the same country, and there are still more guns than cars in the US.  Based upon this perspective, our ire should be aimed at cars. (Sorry for the pun.  )      Very few, if any.  Like I said, and you agreed, someone who wants to kill will kill- a gun is just one tool, of many, from which to choose.  There are numerous items in an ordinary household, used everyday, that could kill someone just as easily and effectively as a gun.      I've responded to this multiple times, on this thread alone.  I would protect my family from battery, murder, robbery, rape, and whatever other mayhem a criminal (the who) may try to commit against us or our property.  Yes, I've heard of numerous situations where families have been killed in the process of a burglary or robbery.  Unfortunately, in the US, it happens on a weekly, if not daily basis, that an innocent person is killed in the commission of a crime.  I am envious that you live somewhere so safe as that you've never even heard of something like that.  For most of the world, its a potential hazard.   
If and when you drive a car, do you put on your seat belt?  Do you know anyone who has been injured or killed in a car accident that could've been saved had they worn their seat belt?  Seat belts can kill people, if used improperly, also.  My point here, however, was to prove that I can change the term 'gun' or 'firearm' to something more innocuous like 'seat belt' and you're probably thinking that the line of questioning now is a bit nonsensical- ""Of course we wear seat belts!  Its for safety!""     
Lastly, nobody is forcing you to own a gun, hold a gun, use a gun, etc.  If you don't want one, that's your choice, and I believe in freedom of choice.  The other side of the freedom of choice piece is that I don't want you or anyone else telling me I can't have a gun, if I choose.
		     
As other posters have pointed out, you should be aware that there are numerous factors that go into making a decision like invading a country.  Stating one was a factor does not mean that another was not also a factor.
		    I can understand most of where you are coming from... I am British, so my perspective will be a little different.   
Cars really aren't the best argument here.  Not many people intentionally run someone over or crash.....in much the same way, as your stat so helpfully pointed out, not many people accidentally shoot someone.  Gun related deaths are nearly always intentional.      guns were made illegal in America and those laws properly enforced, do you think you would need one to protect yourself from people who would no longer be armed?  Or is your stance that you want one only because everyone else does?  i completely understand you wnating to protect your family, if I were under that threat, I may think about doing the same.   
However, you allude to the view that you don't want anyone telling you that you can't have a gun, as it is your choice.  This is where we differ.  Most governments have made asbestos illegal as it kills, you can't ""choose"" to insulate your house with it.  this is the role of government in some instances.... I am sure you disagree.  Is the issue the US has with Guns being intertwined  with your ideas of freedom maybe?  Genuine question.   
Fascinating hearing your views, even if we do differ.          
Awesome. Pure awesome. 'Cause we know that there are no more drugs or money laundering or embezzlement or alien workers or anything else illegal.    
""but-but-"" 
'and those laws properly enforced'     
Ohhh, right. Riiiiight.       Was that what was said?  Criminal elements will always find a way to carry on their activities, regardless of the gun laws.   
Or are you suggesting the US is incapable of implementing something other countries the world over have managed?
		 
			
			I think we should be arming our great army with tazer guns instead. It might save a few lives along the way & a number of police forces around the world seem to have success with them. Obviously, not a lomg range weapon, but then nothing is perfect....guns have proven that.
		    Quite possibly. Could probably make a list. It's a pretty unique country.
		    Of course I dont claim to know what happened, this was the 40's, but Im sure  you will provide me with all the correct, no BS answers.   
Yes, ive read the material myself. Lots of things were made here and sold to the Nazi's during the war, the same way as they were sold before the war. This includes precision equipment, that although could be used for a variety of purposes, was used in bomb targeting equipment. Im not naive to think that there were people who didnt directly benefit from the war. The same as there were many American companies who cant really claim a moral high ground either. Im not going to blanket the country with the fact that these things did occur. Im also not going to gobble up all the information written against Switzerland - there is also plenty of envy out there that a country could come out unscathed and successful after the war, a certain amount of negative bias does exist, so I try to tread cautiously. There were also many accidental bombings of Switzerland, including a court martial in the Zurich bombings - a court martial doesnt really suggest it was deliberate does it? But it happened and you can believe what you wish, after all it was considered 'bad weather', so I guess its all possible.   
The Nazi gold was sold in Switzerland as were allied gold holdings. The origins of the Nazi gold were always in dispute - damn the bankers and money men for that. I dont defend the bankers for not verifying the origins of the gold.   
I take issue to the lost accounts. The lost accounts were studied extensively after the war and Switzerland together with other neutral nations copped heaps and deservidly - seems a little comical for the US to play a moral high power there though doesnt it (they published a lot of the reports). There are many publication out there that talk about a smear campaign against Switzerland about assisting the Nazi's. President Truman had already presided over the initial return of accounts soon after the war. F. Lips who worked at a Swiss Jewish bank said his bank was actively searching for more such accounts in the 1960's and they found hardly anything that was considered unclaimed or unnamed. He said there were hardly any unnamed accounts - what was left was dealt with after the war. Now you can believe what he said or you dont have to, thats your perogative, but he says he was there at the time and his Jewish bosses were actively searching for these accounts but they didnt exist and his bosses accepted that. I weigh this information of his with those of Codevilla who claims similar - I wasnt there. Then of course came the 1990's where some groups chose to dig the past up again.    
There are plenty of pro-israel groups that also chose to distance themselves from the late 90's campaign of getting Switzerland to pay for compensation as they themselves believed that no such claims existed. One of those was Israel themselves whose Government 'privately' said they were not part of this campaign nor did they support it.   
The World Jewish Congress launched the campaign because they had significant co-operation from Bill Clinton to whom the WJC were direct donors - he gave them access to the US Justice department. You ask the victims of the holocaust who were a part of the suit how many of them actually saw any of the money that Switzerland accepted to pay on behalf of the victims???? Not much I assure you, the WJC swallowed up a lot- probably through the lawyers, who were heavily critised by other Jews for this, other lawyers on behalf of other groups swallowed up a lot too, together with some advisors to Clinton who made huge names for themselves. These arnt my accusations, they are from the material I read.   
Today many prominent Swiss critisise the quick nature of the Swiss government to capitulate to US demands, seems pretty familiar to some circumstances in banking today doesnt it?? They critisised the fact that the government seemingly very quickly chose to make payments even though evidence was lacking - to them it seemed the Swiss were just plain scared of the US. UBS after their merger with another Swiss entity were seeking a banking license during this time in the State of New York, how co-incidental that they received this banking license AFTER they accepted US demands.   
What proves the point even more, is that after the Swiss handed over the money, all media publications that were previously touting an anti Swiss position, all of a sudden stopped. You heard nothing more, it was over. Hardly something to forget given the seriousness of the accusations, dont you think?      
There are publications here if you wish that show the position of the Swiss during this period   -  I dont claim to know more than anyone else, I wasnt there, were you? I also cant claim to say that I would want to have been in the shoes of the political establishment at the time.   
With that I think I have nothing more to contribute to this thread.

			[QUOTE=BobbysAnorak;1416080]No, I am poorly informed on the Swiss neutrality during the war, this I will admit.     QUOTE] 
 The case of weapons at home was decided just a view month ago, by a vote of the swiss citizen ,may I point out   
			
			st2lemans - Oh let me guess, that's not how the people in Ticino think?       The continued trade with all countries  (just as done by Portugal, Ireland, Turkey) was/is not a big problem. A big problem was/is that the commercial banks in Switzerland took over lots of Jewish money but when the storm was over invented dozens of bureaucratic hurdles to deny paying back. And that nobody took care of the matter. In Portugal, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar DID settle the problems with the Jews. Alright, as dictator he could simply give orders    
Back to the weapons at home. When Switzerland went into war mobilisation in WWII, Switzerland was NOT under attack and General Guisan could determine the date and time. So that the news hit CH households deep at night, and so most soldiers could take the weapon out in the very early morning and move. Gave them an advantage of maybe two hours against having to pick up the weapon at the arsenal, but not more. AND, as you cannot expect a possible wannabe-invader to have the courtesy to attack at a convenient time, most soliders at the critical time would be 20 or 30 kms away from home, and the advantage would be zero. All this means that the ""weapons-at-home-doctrine"" is clearly outdated and no longer makes real sense. And to keep the weapon at home for most is NOT a ""right"" but a ""duty"", a duty most could de very well without.
		 
			
			[QUOTE=cannut;1416687]   I can tell you that there will be other votes, with the next one presumably be a bit more of a compromise by no longer making it compulsary but POSSIBLE to deposit the weapon in the arsenal (which will get lots of YES-votes) and by so many a bit hidden prohibitions. The YES to such a compromise will reduce the number of weapons in domiciles by at least 30% but up to 70% .  The ""NO"" last time was not a YES for weapons stored at home but a NO against a number of small prohibitions and a NO against forcing people living in remote places to travel to a far-away arsenal when they need to get the weapon back.
		    A)  the bombers did NOT bomb ""THE factories"" but bombed the rail-station (40% DB btw.) and the residentail quarter up the hill to the ""Breite"" and much of the innercity. SIG is nicely visible from the south, but THE factories were not bombed as much as downtown and ""lower"" Breite.  The choice of localities shows that it was an error.  
B)  Switzerland as long as it was possible sold material to ""the other side"" but as Nazi-Germany of course had an eye on exports via N.G. controlled areas of Europe could no longer deliver to ""the other side"". Which reduced the list of possible customers for military products to just ONE  
C) Swiss companies in Germany worked under German law. No, a Swiss boss out there could NOT say ""NO"", not at all 
D)  Most of the people were AGAINST Nazi-Germany and also the political and military top brass was mostly anti-German, and so, YES, Switzerland was NOT neutral, it was on the side of the anti-NaziGermany allies, except a few rich business tycoons 
E)  the ""Abwehr"" which was the anti-spionnage service, was clearly anti-German and regularily delivered their results to ""services"" of the embassies of the USA and Britain in Bern  
F)  at the other hand, in a deal with Berlin, the DB had the right to send cargo-trains from Basel to Chiasso enroute to Italy between 21.00 and 05.00 on a few  specified routes  
G)  the ""lost"" accounts were lost to the greed of some bankers
		    Cars are a great argument, because of the perceptual difference between them and firearms.  People are very serious about firearm regulation and safety, but take a much more casual view of cars, and this is part of why there are so many more car fatalities today.  The same mindset explains why more US children die in backyard swimming pools than do by firearms.      The problem is that there is no way to properly enforce a ban on firearms.  Law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns (otherwise they'd be criminals) while many criminals would choose to defy the law and keep their guns, which would give the criminals an advantage in imposing their will by violence.  Many countries have tried to ban firearms, but invariably determined criminals do still find ways to obtain them.   
IMHO, anyone who wants a firearm simply because everyone else has one is someone who doesn't need to have one.    Personally, I probably believe in a lot less government regulation than you do.  If someone wants to use asbestos, especially knowing the hazards, that is their stupidity, and not the government's job to protect them from themselves.     
It is good to discuss this objectively, thank you.
		    It as a first step should become POSSIBLE for CH soldiers to deposit the weapon at the local arsenal. It A) would help many and B) would reduce the numbers of weapons around.    
If you have a weapon at home and work 25kms away you have ZERO command or control of that ugly piece of sh..... !     
I simply do not believe in too many prohibitions or laws which by their nature need special permits for thousands of cases, I simply believe in pragmatist and practical solutions. And I believe in step-by-step solutions and distrust ""hey-presto-recipes""         Wolly!  your old gramophone record has a crack in it and is badly scratched ,with other words ,""you sound like a broken record ""      Don't mind him.  He's just sucking up to the mods by staying on topic (unlike the rest of us).       As has already been said, ""neutral"" doesn't mean having nothing to do with the belligerents.   
Elements that Wolli didn't mention (and which balance the picture in some measure) include hosting and cooperating with a US intelligence boss's HQ, selling parts to the allies, treating downed US airmen as (captive) guests rather than war prisoners, and executing Swiss citizens caught spying on behalf of Germany, all of which is well documented  .
		 
			
			Guns don't kill people... People kill people!   
He shouldn't have been given a gun, sure! He would've then used someting else, baseball bat, kitchen knife, car. God, even a piece of string can be used to kill!   
Why don't we restrict everything that ""could"" be leathal??!!??

			Swiss rail operator SBB has said it will begin fining passengers who take up seats in full carriages with their jackets or bags.                Ahh & once more the customer is King
		 
			
			Now I   wanna get on the train with my dog and put him in a seat.
		    Is it cheaper to put the dog in a bag and buy a bag ticket, or get panniers for your dog and buy a dog ticket?
		    Finally, some good news about Switzerland from The Local...
		          OK. Finally, The Local posts news on the same day as it appeared elsewhere on EF...
		    Journo must have shaken their coke and booze induced stupor a few hours earlier today then...   
I like the way that no one officially had the balls to take a suitable picture of a deviant with their feet or bags on a seat and we were treated to an stock photo of a Swiss Train's ass slinking its way through the landscape. Hold the front page....
		    oooh... that's a toughy.  I'm thinking panniers.
		 
			
			So, what happens if you buy an extra seat for your laptop and granny has to stand?
		 
			
			I take it this will only apply when trains are full?
		    One of my pet hates has always been the selfishness of people who do sprawl over two or more seats when the train/tram/bus is obvioulsy pretty full. But, rather than fining, would it not be nicer to begin with just have a notice in carriages, to encourage courtesy to other passengers?  that could be enough to either stop the culprits, or at least empower the standing people to ask the culprits to move their stuff out of the way.
		 
			
			Why not just ask them to move their bag? That's what I do. I've never had anyone refuse or get aggressive.
		    Agreed. ""Ist das noch frei?"" (Is this still free?) was one of the first things my German teacher insisted I learn. You need it when looking to share a table at a restaurant anyway, so why not use it for the tram as well?
		     
Sometimes people get annoyed, but I really don't care. I paid for a seat, and if there is one free, I want my butt in it. No ifs, and or, about it.
		    No, you didn't pay for a seat. You just paid for transportation. However, there is no reason whatsoever for other passengers to get annoyed if you ask politely and there are no free seats around. I never have problems when I ask people to move their stuff. It may depend on the way you ask. I just note that some EFers have troubles with Swiss people time and again while others hardly ever see a reason for complaints. Food for thought.
		    I wasn't complaining. I simply don't think an inanimate object holds priority over me having an open seat. Not everyone on a Swiss train is Swiss, and it's really not the issue.    
I always ask politely, but, again, it might bother me, if another person, regardless of what their passport says on it, refused to remove their bags so that I could sit down.   
I think that's just obvious.
		 
			
			I'd rather go to the end of the train to look for a seat than ask someone to move their bags. If I really can't find a seat, then I ask if a seat is free. I've never been refused. I also always clear my bags when I see that the train is getting full.    
I was a bit confused when I read this in the newspaper. Is it only applicable if the train is full? If the train is rather empty, I really don't see why I'm obligated to put my bags away? People can just go sit somewhere else if there's plenty of room...
		 
			
			The SBB clearly declared that they also in future will tolerate people leaving stuff on the other seat if the train is half empty, but will intervene in case of full trains. I mean, it to me is self-evident that if a train ""fills up"" you have to ""create space"" by moving your stuff to a place below (generally between your legs). That the SBB with support from the police has to get harsh about what should be quite normal is a bit sad.    
Comparable to what you do if seeing elderly or handicapped people. A long time ago, I in such situations simply stood up and ""surrendered"" my seat. But when realising that if doing so, your seat will get captured by chaps of between 14 and 30, I changed my tactics and wait until the person in need really is quite near and then offer the seat precisely to the person and if that person declines for whatever reason I stay on. Worse even is to see that many ""youngish"" folks do not even consider to yield ...
		    I noticed that as well. I reckon its because the latter are big, violent-looking sorts - I'm sure my skinhead, bovver boots and union jack t-shirt helps - and the former are meek and mild.       Now that you mention that, I'm afraid I must revise the picture I formed of some seemingly nice EF lasses and lads.    
			
			I catch the train to Zurich frequently and I cannot believe the amount of people who sit on the steps. It is annoying enough you have to ask people to move their stuff off a free seat, they are just selfish. But people sitting on the steps in the way is really a nuisance. If they are caught do they get a fine?. Because I think it is a problem, I nearly tripped over a teenager the other day whilst I was trying to get down the stairs. He had head phones on and didn't hear me asking him to move. He only moved when I tapped him with my umbrella.
		    Next time just bang your shoulder bag in their head, that'll teach 'm. If you don't have a shoulder bag, get one    
My pet peeve is when people block the entrance or exits of excalators, typically to look around where to go next. 
I find it so inconsiderate that they don't move to the side to let other people pass. I've shoved many a person  
out of the way in situations like this....
		    I get that at Marktkauf. Only with a half-full trolley in front of me, if they don't get out of the way, they're likely to get squashed.
		 
			
			I have to admit, this is something that REALLY annoys me when other people do it, but then I find myself doing it :-(  
The other being people who sit on the outside, so it is more awkward to then sit down....again something I have been guilty of doing...
		    I just look at them and go 'Mooooooovvvvvvve'. I figure them being Swiss they are fluent in cow. It seems to work.    
			
			Very sceptical. I don't think it's a legit measure to make money from  fines for luggage on seats. Such rules leave to much interpretation to  the personnel and are taken of advantage arbitrarily. Lately,  SBB sadly  only seems to work like this: more and more opportunities for fining  people who wish no other than a transportation at an affordable price,  who (most of the time) are complying to common rules of courtesy.  Speaking up when one wishes another passenger to clear his or her bags  from an otherwise free seat helps already. I'd  rather have SBB tackling the problem from a different angle:  re-considering the interior of the wagons would be the first - planning  enough space, so luggage can be stowed under seats, above or even a  separate storage space (a bit larger than nowadays).  
SBB has  gathered data about passenger flux and peak-times of travel for nearly  over a decade and can prospect the increment of passengers from year to  year pretty well. They are therefore in possession of the relevant data  helping them in those decisions. I simply don't see it put in practice,  especially not for 2nd class travel. For 1st class travel it worked -  SBB wasn't flaunting the (business) customer needs which require space  for work (or storage) on the train and the infrastructure of  connectivity. I would be more than pleased to see them apply more of  this ethic also to 2nd class travel areas. If levering the price, only  in exchange to better service. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to  assess also the luggage items that are carried by passengers, so SBBs  estimation of what space is required for storage becomes a little more  accurate.
		 
			
			I always move my bag if I see that a pretty girl is looking for a seat          .....Hussy
		 
			
			The biggest laugh has to be one of the quotes in the article:   
Conductors are less happy with the new regulations, which they say that will lead to “additional conflicts” with passengers.   
Have yet to find a conductor that has any issues with conflict they all appear to rather enjoy the conflict part especially when they catch a fare dodger........thankfuly I have my abo!
		 
			
			My pet annoyance in when an inevitable old couple book two seats together in a ""huddle"" of four seats, then put their luggage on the booked ones at the beginning of the journey and sit in the opposite ones.   
When that happened and I asked them to move the bags for us to sit, they refused on the grounds that they had booked them!
		    Full train + putting a bag on the seat = You'll get a fine.   
I do not see a lot of room for interpretation except of ""when is a train full"". Rule of thumb: If people have to stand because they can't get a seat.      Sure. That's what you had to do up to now. (and I did many times during my years of commuting) But you know: People did not block the seat by mistake - they did so completely on purpose because the do not want somebody sitting next to them. So speaking up is a direct confrontation. It is not considered ""bad"" behaviour, so many Swiss will only move slowly and with a ""do you really have to sit HERE"" look at you. The fine is not necessarily only a way to make money, but simply a rule that should raise awareness that parking your bag on a seat is selfish. That's how things work in Switzerland: If you put up a sign saying it is ""verboten"" with a price tag attached to it, people will start to act accordingly.    There is not enough space for luggage, especially in the trains going to the airport. But that's not the same problem at all. Nobody complains if a group of twenty going to the airport put all the suitcases on one pile on a bench. The problem is behavioral and mainly on commuter trains and the bags are usually neither large or heavy. It is not about luggage at all, it is about the lady with the designer handbag or the business guy spreading out his laptop and files all over a place to make sure he can travel in comfort while others can't.

			Swiss banking giant UBS said on Thursday it was to dramatically cut back its investment bank arm, reducing its risky assets by half, or 145 billion francs ($159 billion).             
			
			Here we go again......""The investment bank will be ""more focused and less complex,"" UBS said on Thursday, while revealing that the number of people it employs was expected to drop from 18,000 to 16,000 by the end of 2016.   
This means 400 to 500 more staff will go on top of the 3,500 cuts announced across the bank in August, a spokesman said""   
Thankfully, the time horizon of 4 years will at least make it somewhat easier as people may start looking for alternatives already...
		 
			
			If they are going to be selling their Government Debt holdings, well thats just on par with all the other European banks.       That UBS is enroute to reposition itself is good anyway. And that the cuts are not done within 3 months but fairly longterm means that first those affected get time to find alternatives and that second the economy will profit from qualified personnel gradually available. Bitter for many such EXbankers of course will be that nobody in the economy pays as much as they were used to
		 
			
			The move is easy to understand:   
Lower the risks (halving the investment banking) and higher asset management division.   
Miss that part in the news. With Asia growing someone will have to manage the fortunes from Asia.
		    I guess you meant ""of""... but ""from"" is what I think we will see: Switzerland did not become big in banking cause their banks are so good or competitive. The country got big cause it offered stability which is something large parts of the world didn't have. So it's a great place for African dictators and 3rd world ""businessmen"" to store their money. On top of that was it always a great place to ""optimize"" your German taxes.   
Asia on the other hand, especially the fast growing part, is stable. While they have a bucket of problems do I personally believe that even the PRC is more stable than the EU right now. I don't see why Asians would bring their money to Switzerland, the Swiss banks will (and do) have to come over here. And they will have to compete, something they aren't that used to. For the topic does that translate to more UBS and CS jobs in Asia in the future... not necessarily in Zurich.
		 
			
			they plan to do that in the next 5 years... which, in market terms, means .. NEVER.   
You can bet that within the next 5 years there will be several major financial crises, rogue traders, bankruptcies, restructurings, devaluations etc etc - which will render most scenarios and projections of today rather moot.   
If they seriously want to change it will have to be done in the next 6 months. a 5 year plan is just whitewash.
		    Compete ?  Depends on the sector. In many sectors they had to compete always, in others they had not to.    
Jobs of Swiss banks in Asia will result in more jobs in Zürich, as always. And while you speak about Africa, Asia not only has been the emphasis of the Swiss economy for at least three decades but also of the Swiss banks.  
Here the Asia map of UBS :     
and here of CS :      
which reveals that also CS is already heavily active in Asia    
If you realize that Asian countries like China and India for years have been the most important ""suppliers"" of customers to the inbound-tourism and that Asian countries are the most important export markets of the Swiss economy, than you can see that a few African dictators are not of such a paramount importance. They get into the headlines as their moves are often shrouded in scandal and corruption.    
The Arab World is different from Africa in so far as the Arab countries from Morocco to Oman are in a similar league than Asia.    
And to keep the balance, the most important SINGLE country for the Swiss economy (not just the banking sector) still is the USA. That country may be in trouble, but still is THE heavyweight par-excellence
		    Mr Ermotti in a recent interview was even stricter. He spoke about changes to be implemented within 4 months. Some changes according to him already are started, some will be implemented within 2 months, some within 4 months, others within a year and some within 5 years.    
As you can see here     
they at CS already use the past-tense to speak about new strategies.  Their CEO Brady W Dougan and his team are possibly a step further than Ermotti and his folks.     
What then is the sense of speaking about a ""5-years-plan"" ?   Simple, it is to keep off the chaps of the KV Zürich (Kaufmännischer Verein Zürich) who without this phrasing would be in the reception-rooms of UBS on Monday morning     "	8	UBS shrinks investment bank, halves risky assets	915

For a change, those animal welfare activists could step back a bit, but quite many of them quite obviously are aggressive and maybe even dangerous fanatics.
		    or even poisoned the dolphins themselves to make a point??

778	http://www.englishforum.ch/swiss-news-via-local/127672-coop-caught-selling-old-meat-new.html	" 
			
			Former employees of supermarket chain Coop have said that they were occasionally ordered to take old packaged meat off the shelves, repackage it and put it for sale again as fresh meat, even after the expiration date.             
			
			I'm not surprised to be honest. Where I used to work in Ireland (in the butchers section of a large supermarket chain), we often minced old meat (ie about to expire or aleady expired a day or two) and put it out behind the counter. When customers then bought the meat the price tag then added another couple of days before it would ""expire"".   
I never understood how they got away with it all the time ,though to be honest, the meat tasted fine and I never felt ill the few times I ate it. I'm not really squeamish about this type of thing and actually believe that often the use by date is very pessimistic or just plain wrong (like maple syrup that always seems to expire about a month before pancake day...).
		    Maple syrup is one thing, but meat!!  
Another good reason to be vegetarian.
		 
			
			Waste not want not...   
I don't see a problem... Saturday half price shopping at 4pm in coop is the time I go to the super market    
			
			as a student I also worked for a large supermarket chain, and this was common, don't know if its changed now but then the managers used to get into real s**t if they over ordered and had to throw stuff away, so if it was near its date it was taken back down stairs and repackaged. this was back in the day when we had real butchers etc on site, so probably can't happen now
		 
			
			I know that you picked up the title from the Local but shouldn't it be ""Coop   of selling old meat as new""?   
Not to defend Coop, but I don't see anywhere in the article where an independent or government authority ""caught"" Coop doing anything. Seems to be a ""he said / she said"" situation with no proof.
		 
			
			""Coop workers would wait until the sell-by date before unpacking it and selling it again as fresh meat. Chicken breasts and beef fillets remained on sale for several days after their expiration dates, the ex-worker alleged.""     
- i reckon that quote there from the article is precise enough to imply the Coop has been 'caught' lol
		    Not really       Are you saying the Local is actually gossiping?    
How shocking and surprising....    
			
			Kind of OT, but why does The Local always get groaned?       I'll guess it is because he is acting like a bad remix of a new old Beverly Hills 90210.
		    There are several reasons:     I hope that explains the situation to your satisfaction.    
			
			It's all right for you lot ... I used to sometimes shop in this branch, and probably bought meat - although usually vac-pac.   
Having also spent some of my student years working for the then biggest supermarket chain (in UK), I am also aware of the  , but find it it a little surprising (stupid) that there are those who try the same now -  with much tighter food regs. and controls.
		    Uh, yeah, maybe, but after all this is Swiss Meat, which is 3 times or so the price of non-Swiss Meat (you know, the kind where you get all sorts of disease if you so much as eye it in the meat counter at Carrefour St. Louis), so it must be fine.    
			
			If people are really concerned about this then I suggest they never eat in restaurants, ever.   
You're much more likely to get ill from eating in a restaurant than from anything you buy and cook from the supermarket.   
Restaurants have much more interesting 'Tricks of the trade'.
		 
			
			Simple rules: if it smells funny when you open it, bin it. Otherwise trust your own instinct and cook it thoroughly.   
I must admit that I was a stickler for sell-by dates when I was a bachelor, but I've since been educated in the Ways of Proper Eating and haven't looked back since.        
to be fair pot noodles have a very long sell by date though
		 
			
			One of the biggest supermarket chains in the US was busted for doing this same thing about 10 years ago. They wouldn't even repackage the meat. They would just cover up the old stickers with new ones that had later expiration dates.   
I've heard, though, that the Swiss are otherwise extremely cautious when it comes to their expiration dates and usually set the dates for much sooner than is really needed. I'm not sure if that's true, but it's something I've been told a few times... and it does seem to me that a lot of foods here have very soon expiry dates.
		    Got Campylobactor from a Zizzi restaurant in the UK last year- from undercooked chicken. NOT to be recommended - but I did lose a few kilos.
		    I swore I'd never mention it again - so young lady in Neuch I'll stick to my promise, lol.   
Now, MN time to educate him in the Ways of Proper COOKING no?
		    Funny you should say that. I got on a bus the other day and the bus driver said to me 'If you're English I hope you haven't got any fish with you!'   
Sorry but I just couldn't resist.      Although perfectly good meat can smell funny to some people - an organic chicken can smell or taste much stronger than a bleached cheap one.
		    But the Swedes have delicious meatballs, ABBA and a country full of beautiful blondes. And the Ice Hotel.    
I don't think they want anything more than the ad revenue.   
The only thing I don't like about the articles is that they're usually nothing to raise my spirits about living here, e.g. the article about the mayor who resigned after getting death threats for being pro-immigration.
		 
			
			I really shouldn't complain about COOP... I been pushin' old meat for awhile now.        ( yes , even for me that was bad... I'll get my coat )             Bleaching is a popular trick to extend the fresh look of chicken breasts. Injecting water too make it meat heavier - that's why they put the pad at the bottom of the box nowdays.    
Always read the label too. I saw beef mince last week that had 15% binding agents in it. I guess I wouldn't have needed breadcrumbs in my meatballs with that stuff    
I only buy meat now at my local butcher. The better taste is worth the premium. I'd prefer to eat less better quality stuff anyways. Same goes for wine.    
			
			This is way i never bought meat ... not the fact that is expensive ... is because i can never trust the hands behind my .... meat xD   
but serioulsy i tough everybody nows that every single big company that sells food does things like that.. thats why if you go there to buy food.. you see it .. smell it and then choose it and find out the next day if you were right or wrong      
			
			I've glance through the thread.  Am I right in thinking;        Ever the old cheapo, hey? Anything for less than CHF 70/kg can't be any good.
		 
			
			The Kassensturz has done some more digging and - surprise, surprise - found lots of witnesses who confirm that repacking or simply marinating about-to-expire meat is a common practice in COOPs all over the country.     
The less meat was thrown away, the more bonus did the managers get. 
Talk about mis-guided bonus-objectives...   
Except for minced meat, cold cuts and sausages (which, I'm hoping no one has any illusions about, contain the meat that really no-one wanted to buy), there's IMO no reason meat couldn't be sold a couple of days or even a week after the ""best use before"" date.  
Just not at the full price.
		 
			
			External controls to be introduced to curb malpractice, says Coop             
			
			Oh, those eco-friendly Swiss...... at least when they get caught.   
			
			we have a pretty good way of checking the freshness of meat, we wave a small piece under one of cats noses, if they turn their nose up at it then it's a pretty good sign the meat is off
		 
			
			I would like to add I strongly believe they add water to the meat at both Coop and Migro's to add weight to the packing. It was an old trick I use to see butchers use to make more money. Wehen you cook meat here it usually forms alot of water you have to cook off. Normal beef doesn't do this.
		    Hmmm. I have a friend who occasionally brings me back bacon from the UK. 
I have never seen so much water coming out of Swiss bacon as I have out of that stuff. Yuk!!   
In fact, in my opinion, you can keep yer German/ American/ British imports, etc, because despite this Coop incident, the quality of meat here is way above anything I've ever had the misfortune to encounter in Britain.
		 
			
			What about websites that recycle old news stories as if they had a scoop?   
Cheers, 
Nick
		    Looking at it from a different perspective, though, I think there is far worse to be found in those supermarkets that chuck obscene amounts of food out when it's still perfectly edible.  If it hadn't been reported with a ""greedy financial"" light of Coop trying to make a fast buck out of ""rotten meat"" it wouldn't have looked so bad.   
Like Dougal's Breakfast said earlier in the thread, use your nose and eyes to check food whether has gone off or not.   
The meat I buy is from the butcher down the road and (checks recent packaging) he doesn't even put a use by date on his stuff.
		    Good trick!   
Not very convenient to bring the cat to do grocery though...
		    Well, they change the sell-by date and inject it with water, presumably.   
At least it doesn't come at 50.-/kg....
		 
			
			Just to even things out - Migros has also been caught doing this in the past:       
			
			What gets me, is that in all the pictures they show about Coop getting caught selling old me as new there is somebody holding meat without a glove or a utensil.    
			
			Choose your cow and get it sent ASAP - can´t get any fresher than that -        
5kg for EUR75 plus EUR15 shipping to Konstanz / Basel border area for beef.
		    This doesn't bother me as much as incorrect storage, for example.  Coop meat counters don't handle money so there is no contamination there.  As long as there are hand washing facilities in use, there is little risk from clean, ungloved hands.   
I think I have read on here a link showing that people who use gloves are less precise with their hygiene, relying on a false sense of security with the gloves or tongs.   
In all of this stupid episode and high indignance by the media somehow trying to scaremonger I haven't read of any outbreaks of food poisoning.   
If there had been outbreaks of E-Coli or Salmonella I think I would have been slightly more concerned.      Fresh beef??  No thanks - why doesn't anyone mature the meat any more?  Slaughter house to plate in an afternoon       Well, for one, the media here does a fine, fine job at downplaying and under-reporting anything. I once observed a lady stocking shelves, when she was called to the meat counter. She didn't wash her hands, handled meat, then went over to the cheese counter to cut up some cheese with the same knife and then went back to the meat counter.
		    I've never seen anyone slicing cheese in a supermarket with a knife.  They have a cheese slicer...    
I'm not saying there aren't flaws in the process, same as everywhere else, but the point is that correct hygiene does not preclude handling meat with ungloved hands.   
You have to admit the system can't be that bad otherwise people would be dropping like flies.  Sometimes you have to not dwell on the isolated incidents and look at the bigger picture.   
The media would lose even more face if they reported every tittle-tattle tale that the great public reported to them.
		    Well, IMO, Switzerland should drop the 3rd world process and get up date (ah yes, where to start, where to start).....mind you, people are not dropping like flies, but they do tend to get sick fairly frequently.
		    Ah, yes but if you solved the ""draught"" problem, the health of the population would improve overnight, never mind the food processes...    
			
			it is very 'he said, she said' and mostly disgruntled ex-employees are pretty unreliable witnesses.   
Even if it did occur, this is such an isolated incident and comes down to crappy management in one branch of Coop, which in my opinion far surpasses Migros for quality.   
So far as Swiss use by dates go, I have noticed a lot of anomalies lately. If I buy identically packaged Uncle Ben's rice, Bonne Maman jam, spices and herbs etc in a French supermarket the same week as I do in a Swiss one, the use by dates in France are up to even 2 years further away.   
Going by the amount of wastage we have in Switzerland and my nose telling me that products are still fine, either the supermarkets here are storing their foods for way too long before putting them on the shelves, or their is a supermarket conspiracy going on where they stamp an early date so we have to buy more. 
food hygiene in Switzerland, like the toilet hygiene is generally far higher than any other country I know. Though admittedly, when I briefly worked at a McDonalds here, the staff broke all of the rules that we would have been sacked for breaking back in the old country.
		 
			
			To my mind, the ""wastage"" issue that was talked about in the Sunday newspapers (Coop and Migros complaining that they are having to throw out up to 6% of meat) is really a red herring.   
In any of the Coop stores that I frequent, as soon as they put a 25% or 50% sticker on the close dated product, it flies off the shelf. No wastage.   
What Coop and Migros are worried about is their margin. Nothing else. Discounting products that have reached their due date has an impact for sure.    
It just happened that Coop got caught this time because they were pushing things TOO far. When I hear that they were doing this as well for fish and cheese it really ticks me off.    
We should see Coop being much more careful in the future as they really shot themselves in the foot over this very bad PR. Good on them.
		 
			
			I am not surprised by this article.  In the last 6 months of living in CH i have purchased three lots of meat from Coop all of which were totally inedible yet before their expiration dates.   
I purchased a chicken on a Saturday, the expiration date was the following Monday.  I opened it to cook that Saturday night and the underside of the chicken was GREEN and it absolutely stank.  I returned it to Coop at the earliest opportunity, ie on the Monday and they refused to refund me as the day i returned it was the expiration date.  Appauling customer service.     
I have also bought inedible beef and salmon.  What really annoys me is that they charge so much for their meat and yet it is a lottery as to whether the food is edible.
		    To be fair, I think ""inedible"" in this case is highly subjective without a lab to analyse whether the bacteria levels render the product unfit for human consumption.   
Don't you perhaps mean ""not to your taste""?   
Sometimes meat which has been stored in plastic gives off a smell which is why I always take fresh meat out of its packaging and store it on a covered plate or in greaseproof paper.   
Perhaps this is the ""stink"" you detected..?   
In the past I have bought salmon which seemed to have been spoiled in the commercial freezing / defrosting process and had turned into a kind of mush after cooking.  It wasn't ""inedible"" and certainly wouldn't have harmed me but the lack of texture and structure in the fish put me off and I chose not to eat it.
		 
			
			I was under the impression that the meat in question was over the sell-by date - not rotten??  
If you can spot that by just smelling, then you have an amazing nose!!   
Also, I have been in CH for 18 years now and have never once had food poisoning. In the other countries I've lived in (UK, Spain, Greece) I had it at least a couple of times.       The price of meat in Switzerland is very reasonable when the income in considered. Studies show that the Switzerland offers the greatest potential in the world for saving money when taking the average income and the average cost of living.  
I have to concur with these findings and I eat like royalty, only buying fresh Swiss meats when they are available.   
I find it very hard to believe what you state about these inedible meats (I am not calling you a liar, I am actually finding it hard to believe). my experience with Swiss supermarket meats during the last seven years has been fantastic. The few 'less appealing' cuts of meat I have come across have come from a Migros but even then, my cooking was probably to blame.    
I am going on the assumption that you stored that chicken properly.
		    I wonder how much pressure the local supermarkets have come under with the strong Frank and the fact that many Swiss are now crossing borders for their food. Also the discounters Lidl and Aldi have forced prices down here. I understand that Farmers and suppliers have to make a profit, but the price of meat here almost forces one to become vegetarian. I saw a pensioner in a local shop buy three kinds of sausage, this was probably his meat allowance for the week and it appears sad when it appears that the old guy can only buy or afford sausages.
		    I had the same experience once. That is what comes from being so far from the sea. I just decided that I would leave fresh ocean fish (and Salmon) for holidays on coastlines. Plenty of nice freshwater fish around anyway.
		    Yes, that's true.       Swiss love sausages! And you can't compare a Swiss sausage and the consumption thereof to the qualities of English/Aussie/NZ sausages which really are full of S___.  
someone buying sausages here doesn't mean the price of meat is too high, it means they are having a grill or have a craving for a juicy Olma Bratwurst or Cervelat.   
I never shop at Lidl or Aldi because I detest the disorganisation and queues. I do frequently travel to France to buy a bug lot of groceries but not because of the price, rather because I love the products they have (salted butters, Croque Monsieur, etc). I never by fresh meat of milk products there because the quality in Switzerland is too high. I also don't (and won't) go to Germany for better prices because the product range is as limited there as in Switzerland and the petrol/time costs outweigh the price difference anyway. Furthermore, I earn money in Switzerland, I spend in Switzerland. That is the honest way to go about it.
		    Make your mind up.
		    Mind is made up. I clearly state that I go to France for the product range and to buy product there that isn't available in Switzerland. Likewise, I don't buy meats etc there because the quality is not the same and that would hurt the Swiss farmers.   
I support Switzerland by buying in Switzerland when i can. My gripe is with people that trot over the border every week to buy identical products in Germany that they can by here. I don't do that, therefore I am supporting the Swiss economy.   
I don't think my position is all that hard to understand.
		    There are some plans to restrict that:       
even if one buys identical Swiss made products across the border that are even cheaper than here.       
			
			I expect that the type of folk that cause trouble in this area know where to cross the border without paying duties.   
I understand the frustration of paying a crazy price for a product that costs so much less across the border but think the solution is much bigger than going over there myself to buy things. Ultimately, the duty needs to be abolished altogether but this would cause new nightmares/economic issues for many involved.   
It isn't and easy problem to fix.    
Of course, I am also guilty of getting angry about the difficulty involved in getting my hands on some items from outside of Switzerland. But again, these items tend to be the ones that you cannot buy here... not just ordered from Europe because they are cheaper.   
It is an interesting move to suggest lowering the duty-free limit. That would cause a real uproar, no doubt. And the movement to more underground tactics.
		    You're not supporting ""the Swiss economy"" by shopping at Coop or Migros. They use the same products and the same methods as the ""bad boys"" across the border (in fact one of the less reported accusations against Coop was that German chicken products were labelled as ""Swiss"", thus justifying a higher price - if true, that's fraud, even if said chicken is safe to eat). If you really want to support the Swiss economy, buy dairy and produce from a local farm (often distributed through Landi or Volg stores), bread from a local baker, meat from a butcher who sources locally.   
Just to clarify:        What a utter, steaming pile of old bollocks. 
I particularly liked the sausage bit   
Are you Swiss per chance?
		    I'm not condoning it but I read that as long as the meat is prepared, processed and packaged in Switzerland, it can be labelled as ""Swiss"".  Bit shady but apparently legal...
		     
I very proudly buy canvas bags from Hyper-U or Eleclerc and walk happily from car-park to house. I have nothing to hide. 
The products I am often buying are supermerkets own brand and are not available in Switzerland, though a few Leader price products can be found at Pam (previously Pick-Pay).   
We do often buy our farm produce direct from the farm. If anyone wants a great source of Lamb from the Tessin of Beef from Graubunden, let me know. They deliver it to your door butchered, packed and frozen. Great value for a side of cattle, real Swiss meat.   
If this is true about the big two relabelling foreign meats as Swiss then I hope it is cracked down on. I would boycott them, but I can't get beyond the great Coop toilet paper and kitchen towels.
		    Would love to see that. Can you find the link?  
My understanding of the laws protecting the Swiss brand is that a product must be also of at least 50% Swiss origin.
		    Which part is bollocks?   
I am Swiss now but I used to be a New Zealander.   
The sausages in Switzerland are extremely high in meat content and good quality.
		    Can't remember but it was probably in the KTipp magazine around the time everyone was in a tuck about bird 'flu and the origins of their chicken.  All sorts of eyebrow-raising stuff in there...    
			
			There were several about chickens from Poland, China and Brazil being passed off as Swiss, like in here:               
			
			Whoops, i just looked back over a receipt from France from a couple of months ago and have a confession to make.   
It seems I started to buy some items that were also available in Switzerland, no doubt because of the price. This would include the likes of 15 can multi-packs of Coke (only 6's in Switzerland).   
So I apologise for my holier-than-thou stance from earlier.   
I always like a good discussion that gets me thinking and absolutely love it when someone can change my opinion through a solid argument, so thanks.
		    Familiar with the winner of the Gesundheitstip article. Those Findus nuggets are very good. Current carton states that the meat is from Brazil, The US, or Poland. Have eaten many and never had a problem. It is hard to find frozen chicken products with Swiss meat.
		    Ja ja, read ""Schweizer Qualitat"" and then switch off the brain.   
There are countries in Europe where a ""sausage"" has to be meat (which may include offal and blood, but also connective tissue), salt, spices and water only. Not the UK obviously - two words: rusk and gristle  . But neither Switzerland, where milk may be added and where there are no limits on how much water there can be in a sausage.   that Globus' Kalbsbratwurst contained 19.8% added water, Coop Bratwurst was 32.8% fat, and most of the Swiss samples had between 67% and 80% sheer meat (without connective tissue). For the supposedly inferior German sausages, the maximum permitted amount of added water is 8%, and the products were found to contain bewteen 85 and 90% sheer meat.
		    Well that's the thing....Swiss retailers are crap at negotiating prices and they have to tinker with the quality as their order quantity is too small to generate any interest to potential suppliers.
		    As long as consumers believe that ""Swiss is best and should cost more"" no matter what, there is no incentive at all to change anything.
		 
			
			I'm a former chef.  I know how to store meat and when meat is inedible.  A fresh chicken should not be green and should not have a certain stink, which my chicken did.
		    Sure, just as soon as you start backing up every claim that you've been making with some hard facts. Fair is fair after all.
		     - English/Aussie/NZ sausages really are full of S___.    
 - I never by (buy) fresh meat of milk products [outside Switzerland] because the quality in Switzerland is too high   
 - I also don't go to Germany because the product range is as limited there as in Switzerland
		 
			
			With regards to British sausages (to the previous poster who kindly mentioned German sausages, I didn't refer to them. I agree, their meat content is high), but back to the British bangers (Aussie snags and NZ bangers):      From Wikipedia Sausage page. Not that I endorse them as an authority, but the claims can be easily confirmed elsewhere.   
Second point to answer:    This is (as is everything anyone writes here) my opinion. I cannot justify buying meat from outside Switzerland when there is limitations on what you can bring in, the quality is not better than I can get here, and I have shops so close to home.   
Third point: product range. It is my experience (and again opinion) that if I visit Germany for products I find the same food brands and styles of food as in Switzerland. Therefore i prefer France. Of course, those living in Vaud, Fribourg, Geneva etc probably have the same problem shopping in France and find different styles of product in Germany.   
I fail to understand why my opinion gets up so many folk here. Do you really all find German food so much better that you can't stand Swiss products or supermarkets?
		    From my own point of view it's just simply a money saver.  A few weeks ago I bought a joint of beef from a butcher in Germany that cost a   of the price I would have paid here.  The quality is no better and no worse than here.  (LiB - the butcher was also not wearing gloves as far as I remember...).   
We're not regular visitors to Germany but it DOES stick in the throat when you see Germans paying unfathomably lower prices for most stuff (they certainly don't live on wages that are a third of their Swiss counterparts).  I like shopping here in Switzerland and can't justify chasing up to Germany for every piddly thing but I will definitely do a run up there before Christmas simply because I feel I'm going to be shamelessly ripped off for the same items here in Zurich.
		        Yes, you've made it quite clear that you believe that what you do is honest, and so implying that what other people do is dishonest. 
(Otherwise why bother with such a sentence?).   
Personally, I couldn't take anyone seriously who takes such a pompous stance and then says they go all the way to France to buy a Croque Monsieur, which is , let's face it, just a cheese sandwich.    
			
			I think my meaning and tone of voice has been misunderstood throughout this thread. A lot of you seem to have missed my earlier confession and correction where I thanked you for helping me to see the light.   
We probably have to agree to disagree. My intention is not to offend anyone it is to defend the country I love.
		    Which kind of brings us full circle dosen't it? - I'll blindly buy any old thing if it's got a Swiss flag slapped on it.  
Very odd.
		 
			
			Groan away, mate.  
I've got some beautiful organic lemon & thyme 90% pork sausages from William Rose in London defrosting for dinner tonight.       That does sound good. 90% part in particular.
		    Mmmmmmmh.... proper English sausages....
		    Surely this is an integral ingredient in all Bratwursts??   
And I can only speak for the UK, where sausage quality was pretty dire up until about 15 years ago. Now things are better, but quite honestly, Swiss sausages are decent.    
And what's with all this ex-pat Swiss bashing???
		    No it isn't. Not even in Switzerland      Swiss bashing? It doesn't exist on this thread. There is a lot of Coop bashing, and this is entirely justified. There is also a fair bit of Bünzli (Philistine) bashing, which is equally justified, because what Coop did would come back to haunt them were it not for a part of the Swiss population who will, without thinking twice, devour anything that has a Swiss cross on it, pay obscene prices, and dismiss foreign food as inferior per se.   
Your link is a nice example. The tourist office (!) sings the praise of the St. Galler Kalbsbratwurst, where ""Only the finest veal, a little bacon and fresh milk may be used as ingredients"" [ ].   (  - not enough veal, excessive added water, one Bratwurst  -Bell, no less- contained sunflower oil). Are K-tipp Swiss-bashers, too?
		    But if I do take the cat to the shops...can I claim 500g of meat for him?       His senses are required for meat sold in Switzerland - no quotas apply          
			
			I'm afraid that milk   an ingredient in Kalbsbratwurst. Ask any butcher here.  
And Kalbsbratwurst can only be called that if it has at least 50% veal, otherwise it is just Bratwurst. 
Don't know about American Brats, though. The ingredients in those are anybody's guess......
		    This.  Many times this. It is like you read my mind on this thread. Truth be known I'm fairly indifferent to Swiss farmers, you do your job, I do mine. Except I don't get subsidised to the tune on 2 gigabucks annually:       
...and yet it still seems cheaper to send lamb from NZ to here than grow it locally.   
I'm also yet to appreciate this mythical ""quality is better here"" that I keep hearing about.  Yes quality here is good, and you never see really cheap rubbish (or cheap anything) but it's not that great, given the cost.  One thing I miss from back home is the butcher section of the Queen Victoria Market. It's like the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory of Meat (well...something like that). With or without antibiotics at no extra cost....Actually I miss proper marketplace markets in general. I guess it needs too much space / makes too much noise or mess to work well here.   
As for the sausage issue (insert dodgy joke here), yep yourr low end snags in Australia and the UK are indeed filled with filling of questionable origin, but by at the price what do you expect?  But what I do miss here is you variety in the sausage dept (insert 2nd dodgy joke here) e.g., the honey chicken, spicy jamaica, lamb & thyme etc....   
Dammit, when I go on vacation in December I'm eating red meat and oysters for every freakin' meal....
		    You said ""in all bratwursts"" - which is wrong. 
You quoted an article that gave the impression that Kalbsbratwurst is veal an very little else - which is wrong. 
You brought up ""American brats"" - which nobody talked about. 
You tried to make this an ""expats vs. Swiss"" thread  - which it isn't.     
			
			Thank you, oh knowlegeable one.    
And as an afterthought :    
Google the 'Pflichtenheft' for Kalbsbratwurst from the Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft. 
There you will see - in great detail - the guidelines regarding ingredients and production of the above. 
Oh yes - and the list includes 'Schüttung' - milk.   "	92	Coop caught selling old meat as new	5463

			The Swiss central bank warned it is ready to intervene again if necessary to push down the value of the national currency against the euro in order to protect exports to the country's main market.                Leaders of the economy have stepped up their pressure onto the SNB, to raise the PEG to at least 1.30 .   I think, the change is imminent
		    Hopefully traders at UBS are not following a dead cert again, the last time it cost the bank 2.3 Billion.
		    Let's realize that whomever imports  + £ stuff will have to pay more after the PEG gets raised again, as it must. At the other hand, the profits of UBS and CS subsidiaries abroad will be far better after the raise of the PEG.    
I don't know what mistakes those bank-traders did ""last time"", I however remember that people at the commercial banks did not expect the PEG, not even when it was clear to come. While it is difficult really to know WHEN the PEG will get raised, it is obvious that it WILL be raised.  While Mr Rechsteiner of the trades unions still speaks about 1.40, that may be a bit too high, so that it will be between 1.30 and 1.35 (most likely simply 1.30)
		    It's rather niave to think anything is obvious in financial markets, if it was everybody would be rich. There are 2 sides to every trade, one winner & one sucker!
		    This may be true, but it is the job of the UBS folks to make sure that UBS is not the sucker but the winner. How they do it is not my business to know but theirs.
		 
			
			Glad I came across this. We missed out on freezing the franc rate when it was almost equal to the euro. Looks like we better get on the ball and freeze the current rate.
		    The present rate is too low, what is needed is the 1=CHF 1.30 .  1.40 indeed would be good but might be extremely difficult to sustain.  So that the compromise is 1.30 and is the one to come
		 
			
			Let's hope that God... ehem, I mean, the BNS, answers our prayers! 1.35! 1.35! or even better, 1.4!       Why would you want to throw 15% of your money down the toilet, you could just give it to me!
		 
			
			Time to buy some euros...
		    Probably not, but that's another story.
		    I don't understand really, raising it to 1.3 while the euro is falling more and more.....do they ever think that there's any solution soon to the EU zone with all what's happening on daily basis?.   
SNB is just tied to a sinking rock here, so they might wanna think of an exit plan of the consequences of what they have been doing recently.
		    Because 60% of exports and 80% of imports come from EU countries, mostly eurozone members who completely sorround the country, and therefore it really doesn't matter whether the euro is depreciating against other currencies and the swiss franc with it, what matters is that the exchange rate of the, by far, most important partner, is still too strong, rendering swiss exports and tourism uncompetitive and imports too cheap... killing swiss industry as news are lately showing and giving potential for the country to enter in a deflationary cycle.    
And yes, that means I'm willing to ""give up"" some money (although I have plenty of savings in euros)... in exchange for job safety and general well-being of the country.
		    I totally understand that but instead of being hooked on a sinking stone, they should have studied other internal options to support businesses and revise their pricing strategies......all i can see now is that we're heading towards major inflation now if this continues cause EU is not gonna sort their mess anytime soon
		    Why should we? The deflationary preassures remain, partly because the franc is still overvalued against the euros and import prices keep lowering (albeit not as much as they should) as contracts are renegotiated, and beacuse the swiss national bank has not been printing any franc so far to fight against investors who would try to break the 1.2 barrier, as they simply haven't dared to try to fight the central bank's aim, in fact the exchange rate has not even approached 1.2 since then, staying above 1.22 for most of the time (notice that right now it's 1.23). Why should we head into a major inflation? There is not reason for that to happen.

			A Geneva-based rheumatologist has said he will no longer prescribe Novartis medicines to patients in protest at job losses at the pharmaceutical company, which plans to shutter its production operations in the south-west of the country.         
			
			Is it so difficult to write ""doc "". ""Doc"" is used mostly by Bugs Bunny and teenagers, and probably shouldn't be used by news sites. Not even tabloids reduce themselves to that.   
As a side note, when I read this I thought   was boycotting, which led to some understanding problems.
		     
There is only 1 doc...       
			
			A story over one doctor? Only One?   
I have a headline for you, The Local. I did a poo this morning! Surely this is important, isn't it?
		    Had a pretty big discussion yesterday with BH because of him. We were watching Fringe, and he refused to believe me when I said ""It's Doc!!!!!!!"".   
I guess having seen the films more than 20 times might help my memory...
		     That makes 2 of us       Also, he will continue to prescribe Novartis where there is no generic alternative.    
Hang on a minute... that means that until now he prescribed Novartis products even if there was a cheaper generic alternative? Oh wait, this is common practice in Switzerland? Also, the government is against parallel imports for medication, which are sold much much cheaper in the EU? And consumers pay for this nice cartel through health insurance that keeps going up and up?   
Now that would be worthy of attention. Unfortunately, journalistic skills and efforts beyond ""copy, paste and translate"" are required for this one - and The Lolcat lacks these.
		 
			
			Shouldn't all doctors be prescribing generics when available?
		    It depends. Not all generics work on all patients. Some have fillers or other substances that patients are sensitive to. Sometimes the dosages are inconsistent... This is or was a big problem in the US where many generics(often imported)  used were not subjected to adequate quality control. I don't know what the situation is here. Most of my generics seem to come from sandoz, and maybe mepha.    
For many medications it is just fine, but it really depends.
		    The use of ""doc"" along with typographical errors would seem to indicate the need for a copy editor of some sort.   
From the article:   
""The doctor said the move  , especially generics, that he can prescribe to substitute Novartis medicines.""   
(Ermm, isn't the point that his boycott will NOT affect his patients, since there are med equivalents available to substitute?)   
.....   
""Novartis, meanwhile, said it was monitoring the situation and would try to   to people's concerns.""    
(Always good to have an appropriate reponse to people's concerns.)          This is really misleading information!! A generic can only be called a generic if its   and directly   with the originator product. There is no ambiguity or confusion here, a generic is an identical copy or its a different drug. Perhaps the situation you describe in the US involved an importer bringing in v.poor quality or counterfeit drugs.
		    only if you poo'd to protest against Novartis / bank bailouts / gay marriages ...
		    Well, I   protested a bit but it was such a relief....
		    Well maybe in Switzerland, but this has not been the case in the US. There is ambiguity and confusion. Some imported  ""generics"" have been shown to be of poor quality. I have a friend who is a psychiatrist and she's seen a lot of variation in efficacy in her patients taking some generics - patients essentially end up experimenting with their dosages to reach the same efficacy.     
And again, I've also heard that some patients don't do well on some generics due to different fillers in the medication, but again this is in the US. So maybe it's different in Switzerland.    
But of course, I don't have a scientific paper to cite here, nor am I familiar with the manufacturing process. I take several generics myself and don't have a problem with them. I've heard a lot of patients complain and I don't think it's all in their head. But again, this is US, not Swiss experience.    
Are you saying that a generic drug has exactly the same composition down to the fillers? If that's the case, how can they be different colors and sizes when compared to the original.
		     
it would be a headline cause girls dont poo       Actually this is a misconception. We do poo but we don't smell.   
Oh, and we don't fart, we pass air.
		    The generic component refers to the active ingredient, how thats packaged up may change between manufacturers but they should provide pharmacokinetic data to show bioequivelence i.e. the active ingredient is distributed and taken up by the body in a similar fashion. These types of studies usually involve a clinical trial where one lot of patients are given the generic drug and the other lot the originator drug, and then there is a cross over where they change over to other. So basically the regulations are very stringent, especially in the US which is why I'm surprised by what you wrote.
		     
maybe the local uses teenagers to write the (not so) news
		    I'm guessing I've incensed some pharma workers. And I didn't mean to ""mislead"", although some patients are sensitive to certain fillers in generics. And OK, so maybe it's splitting hairs,  but I'm not saying that most generics aren't good enough.    
As an example there's this:     
This was dealing with epilepsy drugs - So generally speaking, in 99% of cases generics are fine, within 15% of the brand name in terms of bioequivalence.One of the points these guys bring up is that within generics, however, if you switch from generic A to generic B, it's possible to have a larger variation in bioequivalence. And then there's the issue that bioequivalence, measured in the blood, isn't applicable for all drugs (e.g., ophtalmology meds).    
 In the US, the requirements may be stringent for the initial approval, but the quality control of the ongoing process varies, and if you're like many patients you may have a different generic every month and that could result in some problems.  Also, I was reading something about the Waxman something law - once you demonstrate bioequivalence you don't have to have intensive clinical trials (this was put in place to encourage the growth of generics).    
Also, the inert portions of the drug - for example, a gluten intolerant person may have a problem with a filler made of maltodextrose.    
But anyway, I'm going way OT here, and it doesn't really have much to do with Switzerland as far as I can tell - I just wanted to defend my initial statement.
		 
			
			Will it make any difference?  Really?   If Novartis have made up their mind already, which they have, then no amount of action will have an impact!       Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending generics. I've always worked for innovator drug companies and so generics are a thorn in our side   however I wouldn't want to unfairly malign them with innuendo or pseudo science. The whole concept of generic medicines are that a patient can expect the same efficacy and safety from a generic product as they would the originator, and this is what the health authority assess before granting a generic compound a licence. The study you quote above is interesting, as it does show that the margin for similarity may be wide enough that a patient swapping from one to another, may lead to differences in efficacy/safety. However the study is based on modelling and simulation, as opposed to real clinical trial data. A general rule of thumb is that if a doctor places a patient on a particular drug, the patient should stay on that brand (originator or generic) and not keep changing between them.
		    I don't consider patient or provider experiences to be innuendo. Nevertheless, for the vast majority of patients generics are fine.   In the US, if your doc writes on a script that generics are permitted, then the pharmacy will provide the generic based on what they have. I was on omeprazole for a while and the manufacturer of the capsule changed several times. Not a problem with this drug for me.

			A 23-year-old man known for his passion for weapons shot and killed his girlfriend with an assault rifle in Saint-Leonard, in the south of Switzerland, on Friday night.         
			
			Face shooting. Don't google that.   
Dear The Local, we love you too. A thought for the victime, though. Lots of suffering before it comes to that extreem and now after it too (not talking about The Local any more, though).
		 
			
			A bit of a frivolous headline to be reporting the death of somebody's daughter, no?
		 
			
			Again, a DailyMailesque headline and a more than questionable choice of news by The Lolcat. In addition to what   said, this is not only old and of local and/or sensationalist interest only, but also of no specific interest to the expat community.
		 
			
			In addition it shows Nordic/Swedish bias in the way it describes ""with an assault rifle"", without clarifying it was with the standard issue Swiss Army rifle most Swiss keep at home, as if having an assault rifle was exceptional in Switzerland.   
What I find worrisome in the story is that apparently he had already help up a McDonalds, and was allowed to keep his weapon.   
Seems like a ""I know you have a conviction, but you must still practice shooting every year as per the law"".
		    I hear ya'   
Knowing The Local headlines i thought it 3 times before opening this thread      
Sad news tho'
		 
			
			Oh brother, I thought I was just being paranoid, but I guess it's true, The Local really does have a webcam hidden in my lair.   
What can I tell you? I did help her clean up afterwards though.....      Really? This is something you are joking about? Women are killed every year by their partners and are more likely to be hurt or killed by someone they know and trust than a stranger. Not joke-worthy.
		 
			
			What a brutal thread title    
			
			One one hand i understand the criticism of the post. Murder does happen in this country, and not all of it is reported here. A lot of suicides are also carried out by weapons   
However, I do thing the nature of the murder is something to be reported. It does affect the expat community as domestic violence is not only prevalent in the swiss community, or the balkan community here, but even among the expats here. Thus I think its a fair topic to discuss

			""Swiss to post budget surplus for 2011""     
So has The Lolcat decided that ""Swiss""   indeed the name of the country now?
		    A)  WHO exactly stated this about the  ""budget surplus""  ?    answer:  the Finance Ministry.  And who is chief of the Federal Finance Ministry ?  answer: Mrs Widmer-Schlumpf who on 14th December needs every single vote in her favour to stay in office   
B)  I expect Mrs Widmer-Schlumpf 
>  to raise the PEG in the first week of December to 1.35 
>  to hand out good news in the first week of December 
>  to make it clear that HER ministry had to act due to the lack of success of the Federal Ministry of Economics 
>  to make it clear that Economics Minister Schneider-Ammann is a person the Swiss Confederation can do very well without          Well it's not up to her to choose a peg. It's a BNS independent decision. And besides, I think Switzerland is one of the few countries where I would trust a government politician even in this reelection situation. De toute façon, she has already the support of most of the population and politicians, so staying or not in the post depends solely on third-party decisions (whether to give a second seat to UDC without taking away a seat from PLR)
		    I thought they spent over 100 Billion defending the franc not 870 million?
		     
Two separate things. The slightly less than 100 Billion were a) from the Swiss National Bank and b) not ""spent"", while the 870 Million were used by the government to help firms who struggle with the high franc.
		    I suppose it's a headline and it's supposed to mean in full  Swiss. They often do that in headlines of newspapers, you know.
		    So how often do you see ""Britons post record budget deficit"", ""Germans announce record exports"", ""Greeks nearing bankruptcy"" or ""Irish in new bank bailout""? It's ""Britain"", ""Germany"", ""Greece"" and ""Ireland"", since all these headlines are about the respective national economies.   
Nice condescending tone BTW.

			The strength of the franc and the unsettled global economy have seen economists predict a bleak 2012 for Switzerland's tourism industry.                 
The reports today make it obvious that the SNB will shortly raise the <>CHF rate from 1.20 to 1.30 or 1.35 or even 1.40 .  Leading trades unionists recently demanded 1.40, so that a compromise might be 1.35
		    They won't need to, the recession created by the high CHF plus the cost of supporting the Peg, will cause the CHF to collapse on it's own.
		    The almost undecent net-profit of the SNB on one side may give wrong signals to people in the world and on the other side shows that there are lots of reserves just to be used. According to specialists, the costs of the PEG were astonishingly low. Before the PEG, the speculators did not care about the actual situation of the CH economy for a second. So that, right now after the successful crisis management of Mrs Merkel, it is high time to act.
		 
			
			It's not clear that the peg has been successful , the crisis is not over, it may not have even begun! it's too early to be drinking cool aid yet!
		 
			
			That pretty much puts the nail in the coffin for me if SNB does raise the minimum peg.       
And I sure as hell wouldn't return as a tourist if I'm driven out by a devalued salary.  Europe was too expensive before.   It was just starting to become affordable again.
		    Depends on what you mean by ""successful"". It has been successful in getting and keeping the CHF down at a halfway acceptable level.    
True, more may well come. BUT, it rather is the other way round. That the SNB will be forced to raise the  level to at least 1.30 shortly, in order to stabilize the economy. The whole exercise up to now was almost free of charge, but this may not last forever.    
But the SNB making heavy profits is absurd, as the SNB has not to make profits but has to be in service of the national economy.
		    The SNB WILL raise the minimum-peg. The question is not IF but to what level and when   
Few inbound-tourists are interested about salaries, they just care about their personal bills as tourists
		    When the Swiss companies have to raise salaries to find the right people, then there will be wage inflation, not such a clever strategy.
		    Few salaries are to be raised, but rather lowered. And there were reports about all this on TV at 21.50 out of which it became clear that the  level will get raised to at least 1.30, possibly 1.40, either very shortly, or right after the federal government elections in early December   
At a time when even CS reduces its workforce, nobody is to raise salaries
		 
			
			I got a pay cut of 6%  about three   months ago, the company blaming strong CHF. They promised (written) to revert back to the old figure once Euro reaches 1.30 level. So I hope what you say turns out to be true..           I don't know what happy pills your taking but 1.40 is not going to happen any time soon. If the Greek people do not vote in favour of the cuts & Greece defaults 1.00 would likely be the new peg.
		    No, I do not know what pills YOU are taking, but the PEG will not and cannot be lowered as it already is too low. A PEG of 1.00 would ruin the CH economy entirely and so will not be accepted. If the Greeks vote NO, true, this will cost the SNB some 2 billions of CHF. and even 3 or 4 as soon as the PEG is raised to 1.30 as it will. Even if possibly only AFTER 14th December, with the approval by whomever then will be Federal Finance Minister, but possibly very shortly if Mrs Widmer-Schlumpf faces rising pressures and decides that raising the PEG to at least 1.30 will get her the votes of the Social-Democrats
		    Sorry Sir, but do you really believe that ?  Do you really believe that they will ""revert back"" ?   I already now can tell you what they will say next time ""oh sorry, but the state of the economy has deteriorated""      
If ""experts"" interviewed by Swiss TV without feeling embarassed state that the PEG ought to be raised to 1.45 to reflect realities, and then state that it in fact at best could be raised to 1.33 ......  you feel a bit dizzy.   Then, they at length compare the finance-markets with the merchandise-markets etc.     
			
			So, Wolli..just out of curiosity because I'm just an armchair tourist in the theatre that has become the euro drama, what happens when Greece bails on the euro? I can imagine what will happen in the euro countries but am curious what will happen here. Will the peg hold? It's so hard trying to follow all the daily drama that I'm not sure I should follow the news anymore. I'm just hoping I've made the right choices and will hope for the best.
		    Well they will never keep the promise! Are you new to Switzerland?   
They will find an excuse and if you complain you will be sacked, or worse, bullied until you leave
		    Just because you feel the peg is too low, does not mean it's sustainable. The Titanic could not sink, or so they thought at the time!
		    A)  what matters most for Switzerland is that Greece which for decades was a good customer of Swiss industry is unable to pay  
B)  let's look at the courageous Greek Prime Minister. The man apparently has two plans 
plan-a-: Yes, and he can go forward 
plan-b-: No, and he has to drop out of the -zone. This does not mean that his country will launch a new currency as it cannot. It means that Greece just like Montenegro and Kosovo (and Turkey to some extent) simply will continue to use the   but without being a formal member 
C)  the PEG will not hold, it HAS TO be kept, and that is a difference. And this may become an expensive affair, but necessary 
C-2)  let's realize that Greece has the size of Bavaria and is far smaller than NRW 
D)  the  will not fall as a result of a Greek NO, even if dropping a bit for an interim period.  As a result, even more money will flow to Norway and Sweden. Sweden, with its heavy dependence on the export industry will have no alternative to establishing their own PEG with the  
E)  the perfectly justified defence of Switzerland and Sweden may of course cause some turmoil in the international ""finance markets""  (a noble name for a kind of Mafia), so that you, in case you are an investor better place you assets in Eastern Asia        A)  No, the present PEG is NOT sustainable. It has to be raised. This is not some ""feelings"" but a fight for the economic survival of Switzerland.   
B)  The Titanic btw. would never have sunk, hadn't the captain out of desire for a new record taken a far too risky course. This in fact was the reason why the cautious 1.20 PEG was chosen, in order not to embark on a too risky course.  
C) Facts show that A) the PEG really IS too low,  B) the upkeeping of the present one did not cost much at all,  C)  the present PEG has to be given up in favour of at least 1.30
		    Once the Euro starts crashing (or just losing considerable value against USD, JPY, etc.) the SNB will have to abandon the peg immediately unless it wants to impoverish the whole country!      In case you haven't noticed: The Eurozone's problems go way beyond Greece. Italy's on the brink, Portugal, Spain and Ireland aren't in great shape either, France is in danger of getting downgraded, the EFSF is basically full of hot air, German people are getting angrier day by day, etc.   
The peg would make sense if this were some temporary overvaluation of the Swiss Franc but unfortunately the current situation is much more serious.
		    The cost of the peg may bankrupt Switzerland, you think it's a price worth paying?   
What facts are you talking about & can I have some of your happy pills?
		 
			
			Franc devaluation has consequences. Lots of them. More than we can enumerate in a single thread. They usually last for very long as well.
		    A)  you for some reasons assume that the  is to start crashing.  Because of what exactly ?  
B)  German people getting angry ?  This is not new. Already Adolf Hitler moved ahead on the ""Volkeszorn""   
C)  the PEG does make sense exactly because the situation is serious and not just a temporary thing
		    No, the costs of the PEG may cost lots of money but the loss of the PEG would RUIN Switzerland.  There is a price to be paid to rescue the national economy and to avoid the country getting bankrupt. I am in favour of a ""flight forward"" and that is to even RAISE the PEG.
		    Devaluation ?  You mean the urgently required correction of the exchange rate ?  Which has not yet been implemented in full, but will be implemented before Christmas
		    I do not assume anything. I just see a considerable risk of a major flight of capital out of the Eurozone which would probably cause the Euro to drop like a rock.   
Why these things happen? Usually because of investors losing trust...   
Or what would you do if your savings were invested in some PIIGS government bonds? just wait and pray?
		    You can be sure that the CH specialists know this as well. THIS is why I speak about heavy costs coming up. Right up to now, the whole affair has been astonishingly cheap. The SNB neither had to buy lots of crap money nor to go heavily into printing money, but this of course is subject to change.    
You may realize that it is not the job of those in charge here to consider the fate of people who invested in lousy government bonds, but it is their job to rescue the SWISS national economy. Even if risking some of those who lousily invested going bankrupt or being driven into suicide.    
The SNB has to do everything to drive those speculators into ruin or into suicide at the earliest convenience         
It is not just a ""considerable risk"", it is practically a CERTAINTY.  Germany and some other major  countries will have to stop the  ""dropping like a rock"" as this would, while improving their exports, making vital imports like oil too expensive.    
Most of the trade of Switzerland is done with the  countries, so that Switzerland has to keep in line with its markets. As simple as that.
		    And what if they just       Switzerland made a decision not to join the Euro 10 years ago. The markets will ultimately decide the value of the CHF & Euro, governments can't control unless they make the CHF a currency that cannot be freely exchanged, rather like the £ till 1979.

Use you loaf and look around- pick the smaller, less known resorts, but part of bigger areas if you are intermediate and above (like Veysonnaz, part of the 4 valleys, but 1/3 rd of price), or Torgon, part of Portes du Soleil, but practically unknown and with incredible prices.   
Look out for special offers - if you are not stuck with half term dates. For instance ski passes in Arolla will be half price for the whole of January- with small hotels at very reasonable rates in Les Haudères below.
		 
			
			Interesting as we're not flying across the Atlantic but nothing I saw in CH was anything I'd consider a deal....maybe I just don't know the right places to look.   Still, the Swiss should be asking the English tour operators why they're warding folks off and offering deals instead of getting angry. It's no secret that travel here, aside from the packages, is a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Half-price here is normal price elsewhere much of the time.....
		 
			
			Look in Aldi Reisen.  Last year 5 days in Arosa, 4 star hotel, half board for 2 with ski passes and bus to ski lift cost ... 1250 Chf.  The same hotel is already in the brochure with similar prices.     
			
			Agreed that knowing where to look is a great help - but there are great deals around, honest.
		    The packages here arent cheap either. A couple of friends from the UK wanted to visit me and ski in Jan/Feb and they were appalled by the prices of packages of hotel in Adelboden I pointed them to - yes its popular but it isnt Klosters or St Moritz. The hotel was offering a ski package which included half board, ski passes etc - HOWEVER, when I told them not to think about package and re-look at cheaper hotels around the region and just pay for the ski passes, it worked out to be a good 50% cheaper!    
I am always sceptical about packages. It happened to us when we went to the Maldives recently too - we were encouraged by our British friends who have been there to take up half / full board packages but we didnt and it worked out so much cheaper! I noticed that some people tend to just go for the entire package rather than shopping around and getting flights/hotels/ski passes separately.   
But it is what it is - Switzerland IS expensive compared to the rest of Europe not just for skiing. We all know that but it really pays to look around.
		 
			
			This only surveyed 8 resorts in Europe? I mean how many resorts are there in Switzerland on its own.    
also   
'Adelboden emerges as the most expensive of the eight European resorts survey, thought it is slightly less costly than Killington (USA) and Banff (Canada).'   
Switzerland has the strong franc to blame. What excuse do the US and Canada have?

		    Can highly recommend Aldi Reisen as they offer excellent holidays at extremely fair prices. Just come back from our second holiday with them, it was to Austria mind (first was to Oberstaufen, Bavaria).  We are now keeping our eye out for a suitable deal to a Swiss resort for just after New Year.
		 
			
			I have rented apartments for dirt cheap in Saas Fee for a week. You don't get daily cleaning but you can cook your own meals. Maybe not what people want on holiday but it can be done at a reasonable cost.  This is what Swiss do.
		    And the child reductions are brilliant ... often 50% reduction and sometimes 100% for children under 12.  We chose the Arosa holiday last year because just one adult was going and this hotel offered a reduction for child when with just one adult.   
They also have a Last Minute function which we used for a great half term deal earlier this month.  And yes, Austria is amazingly good value on this site .. but CH is also not bad.
		    Yep, that is the main reason we go with them as we pick resorts where our two kids (6 and 2 respectively) go free.  We just stayed in Seefeld in Austria, 4 star hotel, half board, and it was just over CHF 1000 for the week for four of us (resort, hotel food, location, room was perfect.)  Oberstaufen, Bavaria was a short break stay, b&b basis in a huge apartment in the Hotel Mondi in Oberstaufen.  Again the kids were free.     
My Aunty is coming over from England for New Year and we would like to go away with her, so keeping an eye out for hotels offering sgl rooms and free stays for the kids.  Seen a couple, just gotta get definite dates from the lady in question...;-))
		 
			
			Used to meet lots of Brits on the lifts at Whistler in British Columbia. Definitely cheaper, a much better resort than just about anywhere when the snow's on, and a  lot cheaper for them given the exchange rate. You could get a condo room with a nice kitchen in it for a good rate and food was cheap so you didn't spend a lot of money eating out (unless you wanted to). I don't blame them. I miss Whistler. :-(
		 
			
			Whistler flight 12 hours, or more + transfer- great if you can take 2 weeks off. Would you really go to Whistler or lake Tahoe for 1 week, honest? Much rather go more local (even if France, Austria or Italy) and enjoy 6 days skiing without jet lag. Kilington is only 8 hours + transfer, but very cold, windy, icy.   
Even Verbier does great lift reductions for families- for the 4 of us we just paid 2 full passes (passports needed - we tried to take the daughter of a friend once and were caught out).
		    Don't know about Canada, but skiing has always just been wicked expensive in the US.  Keeps the riff-raff out    
We go to Serfaus in Austria - but it is far from cheap but brilliant for the kids. I can't do Seefeld again - the downhill too limited.  But I think the cross country is really great there...maybe some year we'll try a Swiss resort now that we're here!
		 
			
			The great advantage is my Chamonix Season pass will cover Verbier & hopefully there will be less queues & more powder. Stay positive every cloud has a silver lining.
		 
			
			That Killington, one of the places I used to ski, and where my nephew is (or was, due to flooding, don't know how it is these past days) a ski bum for years, is still MORE expensive than CH doesn't surprise me at all.   
When I came here, I was surprised how cheap it was compared to anywhere in NE, and far better, no lines, etc.   
Now I'm lazy.  Nice weather on a Saturday, I'll drive an hour or two, and have a nice day, then drive home.  Cheap.   
Tom
		 
			
			Ski passes in the US can be very expensive compared to CH, if you can't get a discount (though season passes are ridiculously cheap in the US compared to CH). Lodging on the other hand can be found at a lower cost in the US (at least in Colorado)......though as I noted above, with some effort you can find lower cost lodging in CH also. I would not recommend traveling to the US Northeast from Europe to ski. You might as fly to the West if you are already on a plane.   
Apres ski is way better in Europe. Especially in Austria. Though, Killington probably has the best nightlife of US ski resorts.
		 
			
			We use Interhome and have found some great deals in appts/appthotels . Have stayed several times in Crans - your own appt but really reasonable, and Ovronnaz. 
A lot of the appthotels offer your own apt but with pools , restaurants if you want them on site and some have got great nurseries for the children.     
			
			Great thing if you go local (ish) by car - take lots of own food, make you own filling breakfast, take packed lunch and then cook simple dinner. This allowed us to ski for 12 days instead of 6 when kids were young- especially with a bit of research to get a great family discount on passes (like in the 4 Valleys, Thyon 2000, Veysonnaz, Siviez, Haute Nendaz, Verbier- but others too).
		 
			
			It may be expensive, but according to our good old Martin Horat it'll be a good winter!       
			
			Have you all not read the artical? It clearly states that the snow quality is simply better. There's no arguing with that, not in Switzerland :-).
		    And, yet, lots of Brits and other Euros there. Lots. And not just the wealthy types either. I don't make this stuff up you know. Do you just like to go around disagreeing with people because it makes up for some yawning void in your life? And I never have any problems getting discounted tickets in the US or Canada either, so never go by what the listed price is.
		 
			
			Yawning void in life - surely there is no need for this type of comment. Not disagreeing that lots of Brits go to Canada or Co, or even East coast, just that it is not necessarily cheaper than staying in CH or Europe. 
Are you denying that Whistler is a very long flight away- and too far for a week's skiing? Not anti going to Canada or Colorado (can't see the point of East coast, due to extreme cold and icy slopes) - we've been to Colorado several times, as we were getting free ski (as friends volunteer as ski ambassadors/guest guides) passes and were hosted by friends (sadly no champagne powder in Steamboat despite the adverts) - but to enjoy a good weeks skiing you need to go for several days either way for travel and jet lag. All I am saying is that travelling half way across the globe is not necessarily cheaper when you take all into account. Flight to Denver about 10 hours, then several hours transfer takes its toll and expensive - even if other things are somewhat cheaper. Do you know of any family deals on passes in CO?
		    My 13 year old niece attends a state school in South Manchester and for her first school ski trip is going to .... Whistler with a 2 day stop over in New York.   
Yes. Plenty of people are doing it, it would seem!   
90 children are going from her year.  If you pm me, I'll let you know which flights in and out of Manchester to avoid.
		 
			
			Great news, more room on the piste for us ""locals""       Would be very interested in the cost per pupil- could you check with her. 
And I can bet your bottom dollar (or Chuff) that I can beat it hands down here in CH. How many days skiing are they getting, and how many hours lessons per day? Will eat my ski hat if I can't.
		    sounds like a good boondoggle to me.  Hope my kids have some of these in their days and I can annoy them and chaperone    
			
			And of course a great example is sensible ecology- flight times 8 hours to NY, then 4 (? 3) to Whistler- so about 10-12 hours x 2 for a short ski trip. 
As said, I'd be really interested in the price (with all meals, insurance, ski hire and lessons- all inclusive).   
When I questioned teachers at my daughters school re a similar trip - the teacher said 'but it's great value, they have jakuzzis in their room! She was wearing the Sweatshirt given to her on the free recky some of the teachers had been on at Christmas to 'seal the deal' (: 
Sadly many ski trips are run for the teachers and not for the kids.
		    Pretty sure AGGS are going there as well second week of Feb.
		 
			
			I grew up skiing in Ontario, Quebec and Vermont. I'm a CSIA qualified instructor and coach and I've lived for several seasons in BC (Whistler and Red Mountain). Let me assure you that people who are getting on a plane and flying over there, especially school kids, are doing it for some reason other than better/cheaper skiing. I had a mate that went to Whistler a few seasons back - he was sitting at the base, looking up at green slopes while we were skiing waist deep powder at St. Anton.    
As others have said, there is plenty of opportunity to find good quality, reasonably priced skiing here in Switzerland and ticket prices are, for the most part, reasonable - assuming you stay away from where royalty/russians like to play.   "	31	British skiers warned off Switzerland	2978

I know what the star of david looks like.........i dont know what   of it looks like.   
So i clicked on the link to read the artical expecting to see a picture of what they are planning to use. There is none.      
cheers 
SC
		       
			
			This is not that big of a deal considering Jews, Christians and Muslims all believe in an Abrahamic God. We all believe in the same God. The rest we just disagree on. So the Star Of David belongs to all three religions.
		    I'm sure there is discrimination, but I wonder just how much- I bet a Schmidt gets passed over in favor of a Schmid, or a Golay gets preference over a McSullivanshire. Whether or not Schmidt or McSullivanshire get passed over in favor of a Muslim (sorry couldn't think of a Muslim last name) I've no idea- guess we'll know more after the star-studded rally.   
I always get a kick out of comparisons that are so stretched though. Hunting for apartments and apprenticeships is so similar to death camps, yeeeeah, alright.

			Silly, both sides of it.   
The more one protests that one is different, the more that one will be percieved to be different.   
The more one criticises others for being different, the more they remain different.   
With fundamentalists and media, we are well up the creek I tell you.  I can see common sense, empthy and decency being taken out back and shot in the head for not fitting in with the agendas of these two groups.  And the worst thing is that those of us that can think for ourselves are not doing enough about it.
		 
			
			Protest against Islamophobia? Are they going to mention not to take the S-Bahn in Berlin when you are not a Muslim, because you might get hurt a lot? Or is it about the Copts in Egypt that were run over by a military vehicle after protesting peacefully because a church has been set on fire? Or the Islamists winning elections where ""dictators"" were removed? Or is it about the fact that churches are burned in Islamistic countries but subsidised in western europe? Or was is the parallel Scharia system already established in western Countries making local law look like a child asking ""Can I have more?"". I think they will not talk about those issues. Since Islam is todays modern religion of freedom those facts can only be lies. I like how they present themself, shows even more how incompatible they are.
		 
			
			Hunting for apartments and apprenticeships.....   
Apart for the 'real Swiss' aren't we all discriminated? maybe all the x pats trying to settle here should also protest!    
If people are not happy here, then they should go! Go to a country that is more tolerant and less discriminating!    
I hear property in Bagdad isn't doing too badly, maybe Libya, or Egypt, what about Pakistan or Afghanistan! Morocco is looking good! Tunisia not too bad, not sure about Somalia? Am sure all the protectors will be welcomed with open arms there!

			I work with one Swiss guy, he takes a day off for hitler's birthday every year, hates Muslims, Jews,blacks, foreigners, anyone with curly hair.   
Being a Jew myself,  I don't feel victimised, he doesn't actually discriminate, he just hates eveybody!  I think there are plenty more like that....
		    Chuck Norris said he was cool with it anyway. So lets just all go back to doing what we were doing before this all happened.           The Copts in Egypt were run over this month by the military.  If you ask any Egyptian activist or revolutionary what happened was the military trying to divide and conquer, then they blamed it on sectarian violence.  Muslims may be guilty of a lot of things but what happened in Egypt this month is not one of them. Don't put all Muslims in the same basket.
		      Here we go again....
		    All what you mentioned is ""not in the teachings of Islam"" and is more of a political agenda in those countries and is based on ignorance (lack of education and understanding of Islam) of the people. If they did something wrong, you can't justify your act because of them and people do realize that it is the same extreme mindset working on both sides (with a hidden agenda).   
Watch this:           What an idiotic statement, the Koran is full of teachings how to deal with infidels. Since you seem to understand what it really is go ahead and teach them the ""real"" Islam. Just be careful, they might kill you cause you are not living by the ""real"" Islam as per their rules.
		    And who do you believe ""the military"" is? Copts are a minority, Copts are leaving the country in masses, so are you really so blatantly naive to believe Copts were driving the vehicles... Herr lass Hirn regnen   
The amount of leftists in this forum is astonishing.      And what would be the correct title to above all else remain politically correct, since this is what is so important to you? This is exactly how Islam is represented, and not every few talkshows having one brave and integrated Muslim claiming he / she stands for the real Islam. Thats a minority and you dont perceive them, you perceive the Councils and groups screaming tolerance for intolerance.      Here you go, the purest of Islam         
who are you to tell what ""purest of islam"" is? please tell us about your credientials in islamic theology
		    Quite offensive and personal attack from you. I am ignoring it.      Everything is in a context in Quran and if you remove the context then the meaning changes and that s what you are doing.      There are people in lots of parts of world (non-muslims) like that as well.
		 
			
			Fawad, that is a very interesting choice of avatar you have there!

			Driven to desperation by the financial crisis, a mother and her son agreed to transport 600 grams of cocaine to pay their bills in Madrid, but were caught in Geneva before finishing the job.         
			
			Just another dumb excuse for committing a crime. Stealing bread is one thing. Smuggling crack is another. I dont know where to buy or sell cocaine. The mere fact that these guys label this as a ""last resort"" is pure bullocks. If you know where and how to buy drugs and then resell it, youre a crook. Period...          I dislike The Local as much as you do. But I wouldn't go that far.        I have to agree with you.    
See above for another solution. 
And to get the son to do it, tsk tsk...
		    I can see you never felt hunger, homelessness and desperation before.....where the minds stops to think and survival instinct kicks in......you might wanna go give this speech in-front of people that are so desperate and see what their opinion will be.
		    I see you have lived in Switzerland too long. I not only grew up in an all black neighborhood on welfare, but I was homeless at the age of 20.    
I stole food from farms. But I never did anything as stupid as smuggling drugs. $2,000 is ALOT of money for a homeless person.    
So I guess YOU have never been homeless or starving or in need, to tell me what you THINK its like to be destitute.
		    Was she desperate, hungry, or homeless?  Maybe, maybe, and no.  She still had a roof over her head (read the story, she did it to pay utilities).  I would contend that she wasn't so desperate, either, as she asked her son to swallow the cocaine (she was sick); in my mind a truly (and altruistic) desperate person would've done it herself and not endangered her son so.  The article leads me to the opinion it was 'convenient money' for her.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't find it from what I've read.   
But I can think of a lot of other things I would do first before resorting to criminal acts- like living below my means, even if by the smallest amount, so I could save some money for the 'rainy day.'  If I became so desperate, I had to spend that money, I would find whatever temporary legal and gainful employment I could to make my savings last as long as possible.     
If I was that in debt that I could not see a way out, I would pursue bankruptcy?  I don't know how that works in Europe, but in the US, you can simply walk away from unsecured debts and obligations.  Sure they could sue you, but that's like getting water from a rock.  Your credit rating would make it hard (not impossible) to reestablish these services, but it can be done.   
Truthfully, it sounds to me like someone who made several bad choices that lead to making one final bad choice, for which she got caught.
		 
			
			dont these people find you?   
You see it with the cops shows many times how desperate these people are (mexicans in this case)    
Would I do it...I dont think so but then again I have never had that feeling of desperation....

			The far-right Swiss People's Party (SVP) could claim almost 30 percent of the votes in the October 23rd federal elections, a milestone that no other party has ever reached in the history of modern Switzerland, a new opinion poll has shown.            No they did not - in fact they lost over 2%       
			
			Great news. Glad to see that their dreadful and fraudulent poster campaign turned against them at last. So relieved.
		 
			
			It is rather the voters turning their backs on conservative parties in crisis times. At least that was one analysis some time ago. But SP didn't gain...
		    The SVP in the elections of 2007, and THIS is the comparison, arrived at 29,0% of the votes in regard to the National Council, And 29% IS ""almost 30%"" .  That they dropped to clearly below 27% which means by more than 2%, THIS is the surprise today.
		    Really not ?   They originally were forecase to suffer a heavy loss and now got away quite nicely.  In view of particularily the GLP being active in what is the right wing ""area"" of the SP and even the CVP playing the ""Social"" card, their result is far better than I expected.
		    Latest numbers show SVP dropped by over 3%; I fear they will continue even more with their dreadful poster campaigns which will not win them more votes but will feed greater conflict between their supporters & the victims of their campaigns.
		    I'm calling your bluff on that.    
Where?  Which serious commentator forecast a ""heavy loss"" for the SVP in the last month before the elections?  Or even the last six months?   
Even if there were isolated cases, trying to paint that this was the consensus is nonsense.  I can give you articles from pretty every major German and French language news outlet predicting the SVP would at least stay constant, if not slightly increase their vote share.
		 
			
			Also, if you were inclined to add the BDP share of the votes to the SVP's share you are still looking at an increase... (above 30%)
		    That is the result from corrections made in the predictions: Until now, the share of SVP votes was underestimated almost every single time, presumably because some people had a problem admitting that they vote SVP to the interviewers....      Which would be utter nonsense, looking at the candidates and the postitions of the BDP...
		    I cannot imagine the SVP would like that       
Maybe 10 or 20 years in the future when the BDP are larger than the SVP then the SVP might have a change of heart & seek an alliance        Apart from the fact that the BDP is a split-off from the SVP and most of the established candidates on the national level were voted there as SVP members last time round....   
And both the SVP and BDP consider themselves conservative parties.
		    That is utter nonsense: So you'd add up the income of an ex couple after a very nasty divorce?  There was a reason for the split-up after all.    
Or, are you insinuating that Widmer-Schlumpf rightfully represents your party? You might want to tell that to Blocher and Brunner   
IMHO there is a difference between being monothematical  and being conservative. Plus, until now, the BDP had positions which are far closer to those of the CVP or FDP than those of the SVP.
		    Spot on ... accurate reporting ! 
Finger on the pulse then , or just really, really lazy journalism?          Quark, you seem to misunderstand. Yacek and Wolli referred to the SP, not the SVP.
		    No. But I would lump the Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Church together as being ""Christian Churches"" despite them having a had a very nasty divorce(s).        Whose party? Assumptions, Assumptions...       The fact that the SVP has been concentrating its marketing efforts on the same 2-3 themes prior to the elections does not make them monothematical, it just makes them focused (as compared to the FDP...).   
By the way their party programm does list quite a few areas in which you'll also find in the party program of the BDP.           Actually post Fukushima a lot of people were saying that as the SVP wasn't prepared and their pro-nuclear policy didn't go down well.
		    I disagree.   
There are two different tendencies to be watched in elections.   
One is the left/right didvide. As in do the sum of all right of centre parties gain or lose versus the sum of all left of centre parties.   
If you are a left-winger for example, you celebrate a shift towards left wing parties, even if your own favourite left-wing party doesn't get the biggest part of the cake.   
And then on a secondary level, you look whether your party did well. But even if it didn't, you prefer that to the opposite, ie, your party gaining but the overall political wing losing, as that means your policies have less support.   
Think of soccer. What is better? Your favourite player scores but your team loses, or your favouirite player doesn't score but your team wins?
		    If you want to add them as parties right of the center, fine. But You were saying that one could add up the votes for the BDP to those of the SVP, which is still utter nonsense.       You don't seem to deny it though.       Focused, as in: Monothematical.       If you look closer, you will find huge discrepancies such as: The BDP wants to have a clear and enforced policies regarding immigration which encompasses active integration. The SVP wants less foreigners.   
The BDP wants Switzerland to play an active role of Switzerland in UN and other international bodies. The SVP wants to stay out of international organisations    
etc. etc.   
Personally, I am not to convinced by smartvote, mainly for methodological reasons, but this graphic sums it up quite clearly:       
Finally, the main difference between the two can be summed up easily: Anstand.      That would be true in a two-party system. In a multi-party system such as Switzerland and in a time where the left-right axis is but one of many, that model seems a bit ""dated"".
		    About ""No. But I would lump the Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Church together as being ""Christian Churches"" despite them having a had a very nasty divorce(s).""   
& your point is?   
They all have differences in theology, structure, rules &&&.  You might as well add in the Jews & Muslims & lump them all together as the ""one God"" worshippers?
		    That category would also have to include Apple.        And why would I have to?       While on the other hand the BDP was focused on trying to portray itself as SVP light...        Hmm... are the discrepancies and differences really that huge? The SVP wants clear and enforced policies regarding immigration and the foreigners should actively integrate themselves. Or in other terms: the BDP wants limited immigration, the SVP wants less immigration...
		    If they were totally different they wouldn't have co-existed in the same party for so long.   
I still believe that in the long term the BDP is going to attach itself to another party or vanish.   
Most of the centre and centre of right parties don't care much for Widmer-Schlumpf for example. The left wing loves here of course for having stared down Blocher. But what use are admirers who won't vote for you?
		    If you don't see that there is a difference between the two, you are still in denial. Accepting does take some time.      Depends on what you mean by totally different. Centre-right and and nationalist-conservative are certainly more similar than centre-right and communists. I'd agree, but whats the point.      Yup, my guess would be a unification with CVP within the next 6 years.

			British tax authorities are targeting some 6,000 British-based holders of HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland in a clampdown on customers who may have failed to report all their income and gains.         
			
			good to see action being taken here. the names of all tax cheats should be made public and HSBC should face tough sanctions if they have helped people evade taxes
		    UK tax is self assesment, it's upto individules to be honest. HSBC have not 'helped' anyone.   
There is a very good chance that people living & working here may be affected as the Revenue will say they never 'left' the UK, they are just working abroad for a couple of years.
		    Jesus... offshore banks helping people evade taxes... what is this world coming to? Seriously ....
		    If you were wealthy & wanted to evade tax you would have a numbered account. No details of the account holder are stored on a computer, the file is kept in a safe with very limited acess. The bank would not know the account belonged to an English person so this would not get reported.   
It's just the tight skinflints who want to save money will get caught      not the case at HSBC
		    which is fair enough if they plan on returning to the UK
		    It's only like that in the comics. 
In the real world, all accounts at all banks are listed on their IT systems, and several ppl have access to that information.   
Most of who can figure out how to copy that data on to a CD ROM.
		    For numbered accounts that is indeed the case, the account holder is just a number.........   
Everyday customers have a name to their accounts, if privacy is the aim you do not want your name & address printed on statements or letters. Letters will be sent in plain hand written envelopes, with a stamp from a little post office.
		    Numbered accounts are listed in the computer , however the owner is a number not a name. It's a bank within a bank, if you turn up with your account no at the holding branch you will even be turned away as it does not mean anything to the clerk on the desk. You will usually have to go upstairs & behind closed doors for assistance.
		    Only in day-to-day business. Holders of numbered accounts are not anonymous to the bank, though they are anonymous to most of the bank's employees.       
Page 55
		    That is correct, you will find charges quite high as transfers in & out would be CASH transactions & not transfers so there is not a paper trail. The statements would be written to customer CO.67823.AK c/o Post Box which is the bank. 
Usually used to prevent family members knowing how rich 'daddy' is, especially if he does not want his wealth distributed as required by law, in countries such as CH & FR you don't decide how most of your estate is disbursed. Obviously such accounts are not listed on tax returns!   
Austria actually had some Secret bearer passbook accounts-
		    Right. But none of that actually prevents the UK government from tracking down tax cheats using numbered accounts, as the forensics trail is still there. It makes the information harder to obtain for people that want to sell CDs to foreign governments, but it's just as easy to obtain with a court order saying ""give us all documents pertaining to so and so.""
		    The bank won't be able to identify the bank account to a name they ask.   
The code names are not linked to names other than in the paper files.   
It's also possible that the registered owner died a long time ago, the power of attorneys on these accounts don't stop at death, so account owner & beneficial owner may be different.
		 
			
			I'm sorry, but that's simply not true. I don't know where you get your knowledge, whether you've worked in a bank or such, but I have first-hand knowledge that the account holders are identifiable. Read the link above, or do some of your own googling; account holders can be identified if necessary. The difference is really just the number of people who can do the identification.   
Oh, and regarding the paper-only thing.... Even if there are some banks that don't digitize information, you do realize that forensics were done prior to computerized systems, right? It's harder work, perhaps, but quite possible.       I have worked on several numbered accounts systems. Including security , design and implementation. I doubt very much that any numbers identify individuals. The correlation and resolving systems are simply too secure. It's the bread and butter reputation of the bank at stake.
		    The account holder CAN be identified however his NAME will not connect to the account with a reverse look up. These are 2 very different things.   
I do know a case where a bank gave money out of the wrong account, the cashier did not understand the account no & asked for a passport. Reverse name look up gave her somebody in Paris. She gave out 10K, the guy noticed the error & returned, the cashier said this is not possible,, several phone calls later matter resolved!
		    /sigh   
Of course the numbers identify the individual. It's in the freakin' Code of Obligations. But only a limited subset of people have the mapping, or rather, access to the mapping between name and number.   
Most bank systems will not have access to that mapping by design. Clearly, the system that manages the account balance has no need to know who owns the account. But the bank is required to be able to identify all accounts belonging to an individual, and has been since 1934.
		    Depending on the Canton, they will even ignore court orders. I suspect they can't identify beneficial owners on a huge no of accounts, they knew the person who opened the account & they know who holds a POA, often a lawyer acting for a client.   
Beneficial ownership is something else.   
Can you confirm there is no requirement for pre 1934 accounts, that is very interesting to know.
		    Ok, I give you that the name will not show a link to the account at an average teller's desk, if that's what you mean. The manager can make the link, but most staff not.
		    The manager of the actual branch where the account is held   
The UK revenue will not contact every branch of the bank. A main branch will say there are no accounts held to their knowledge, which is true.  
In either GE or VS Banks are the most difficult to get info from, as even with a court order it's a criminal offence to comply.
		    Sigh all you want, your source is hearsay at best, bar and beer bullshit at worst.   
No bank will leak or sell the link. They will have had a list of numbers from the authorities , contacted the account holders and negotiated a settlement without ANYONE outside of the numbered accounts system having identified who was involved.  The are at least two people involved in the mapping, no single person can do this. No one person knows what the the other person knows.
		    so how does that change anything? it just reduces the number of people internally who have access to the information ..!! Court orders do not land on your average teller's desk...
		    Court orders get chucked in the bin in 2 Cantons, know where to bank & sleep well at night.
		 
			
			Aight guys, I'm out. If you're going so far as to say banks will disregard a court order, then you and I are obviously discussing in different realms of reality.       As it's a criminal offence in 2 cantons to comply, they have little choice. Banks in some cantons comply automatically, it just depends on where. However I am sure you know this-
		 
			
			I have to agree with Corbets on this one.   
The bank I work for (quite a big one, with plenty of branches in every Canton) has the code of conduct which applies to all branches and employees saying that no customer details are to be revealed UNLESS instructed to do so by relevant authorities.  It certainly in NO WAY precludes releasing customer details to relevant authorities.   
Having developed and supported our high-net worth CRM tool, I can assure you, for the handful (ok, maybe closer to 300 out of 80,000 employees) that have access to the tool, they can see both account numbers and customer names in most instances and where it is a numbered account, there are certainly identifiers linking it to the client, such as address or contact details.     
I think it is James Bond fantasy to think that these clients are invisible in the modern age, but, their details and net worth are only available to a few people, and certainly no-one outside of Switzerland.
		 
			
			if you want anonymity, you'd be an idiot to register it to a bank under your name no matter what their claims are regarding confidentiality.
		    Which is the reason for an SA / AG, the share holders are anonymous
		 
			
			account holdersdetails clearly can be copied to CD accroding to this story -        
on which planet are the AG shareholders anonymous??       ...and which canton is Luxembourg in ???
		    Any company that issues bearer shares in CH. only people with signing rights are registered, not the shareholders.   
The French SA is a giveaway, even if  you don't speak much French.

		    ...er, not much cheese you'll be getting from this one.    (Zottel is a billy goat.)     
Latest is that Zottel is being put on trial before a   (does that have the same, er, associations in German as it does in English? or is it just a normal word, like   and  ?) for alleged misdeeds including the 'promotion of racist paranoia' and 'general antagonism to the proletariat'.  Naturally the trial will be private and only the verdict published.    
More here (in German) for those bent on enjoying this slow news day to the full:         Volksgericht = communist Kangaroo court 
Volksgerichtshof = Hitler's Kangaroo court   
This being a leftist Kangaroo court, I would suspect that Zottel will confess and asks to be executed to atone for his heinous crimes.
		     
how can it be a kangaroo court when its a goat
		    The law is an Ass      
I'll get my coat
		    The first person to be tried there was a kangaroo perhaps?       Seeing Australia used to be a penal colony, it doesn't surprise me.
		    Probably but there is an outside chance that it's been staged. The peeps party have been known to play the Victim card before now and it was effective last time.

			The parents of children who attend a primary school in Valais in southern Switzerland have complained over the use of a game entitled ""Who's afraid of the black man?"", a hide-and-seek game they argue is 'racist"".         
			
			""The Bogeyman is known as   (the black man).  ""Schwarz"" does not refer to the colour of his skin (most Germans had  never met a real black person during the time these legends developed)  but to his preference for hiding in dark places, like the closet, under  the bed of children or in forests at night. There is also an active game  for little children which is called   (Who is afraid of the black man?) or an old traditional folk song   (A Bi-Ba-Bogeyman dances around in our house)"". (Wikipedia)   
However, in modern times the title of the game should be changed, I think.
		 
			
			YAWN!

			I don't think it should be changed. I remember how irritated I was when my Niece didn't learn Baa Baa Black Sheep but Baa Baa Happy sheep at Nursery.

			When it comes to socks, one is more likely to find a French or Swiss man wearing a smelly pair than a German or a Brit.             
			
			This is why I dumped my francophone Swiss boyfriend.  Stinky socks.  Thanks for the informative news information.

			It seems some would thank The Local for   form of Swiss bashing.       Because white cotton socks are washed hot.    
			
			Have they not heard of foot powder?
		 
			
			This entire thread feels so....off topic            
Well, doesn't that stink?  (groan)
		 
			
			Changing socks DAILY is an absolute MUST!!!!!!! 
Same socks  - yugh! 
No wonder nail fungus is SO prevalent!   
Maybe the Germans socks dont smell so bad because they mostly wear sandals with their socks?..... letting some air in...?
		 
			
			It's not just swiss men! My girlfriends feet can   (and her sisters too!)
		 
			
			Smelly feet is not a laughing matter!   
It`s bacteria that causes the smell.  And bacteria/fungus thrives in dark humid warm conditions.   
Dry feet would never smell.   
Even changing shoes is important.  Alternate shoes ..... letting each pair have at least a day to ""dry out"" .... preferably spraying the insides with an anti-bacterial spray beforehand, or wiping out with a disinfectant.   
Those thickening toe-nails need to be treated too, before you end up in old age with malformed toenails and have difficulty walking!   
In the ""olden"" days, airline stewards were not allowed to wear deoderant underarm sprays (no perfumes allowed - might upset the passengers) ... and their instructions were to scrub their armpits with a nailbrush and disinfectant soap!  It worked!   Same applies to feet! (and keep them dry)
		 
			
			Like a lot of people, I had the impression that all French stink and wear too much cologne to cover it up. Not true I find. My French guy not only changes his socks more than I do - he even IRONS them!!   
The Germans may have sweet-smelling feet but they have the stinkiest armpits I've ever had the pleasure of encountering    
By the way, the article in NO WAY mentions that the French and Swiss have the smelliest feet. Just that they change their socks less frequently......what if Germans and Brits have smellier feet thus making it necessary to change frequently.....hmm???
		 
			
			Swiss OH shoes smell BAD, nearly died one morning when I walked out of the apartment (he keeps them outside our apartment door).    
God knows what the neighbours think    
Needless to say, the shoes now live in the garden and I secretly plan to wash them when he is not looking    
			
			The article says: 
""The frequency of changing socks may be related to the number of pairs owned. 
 German men were found to be the biggest sock owners, with 24 pairs on  average each. Austrians came just after with 23 pairs, followed by the  Swiss with 22 pairs. 
 Frenchmen own the least pairs -- just 17 on average each, the survey  said, adding that it could explain why they kept their socks on for a  longer time than other nationalities.""     
Sounds like they have cause and effect mixed up. Doesn't it make more sense that the French buy fewer pairs of socks because they change them less frequently?    
			
			Or that they are just doing the laundry more often so don't need as many socks...?   
Gotta love journalists jumping to conclusions       It's because the French can do laundry on Sundays

		    In the Canton of Zürich it is free-of-charge, and the mushrooms specialists generally enjoy the opportunity to spread their knowledge
		 
			
			The vast majority are not paid. The service is always free, but sometimes only for residents. Some experts carry out inspections from their house, others are employed by the police.      a website that lists the contact details for the dozens of experts in each canton.
		 
			
			I know a couple who offer their services at this time of year:   
Hal and Lucy Jennicks - they're magic at collecting and often don't have mush room left in their basket.
		 
			
			The Lugano Mycological (Fungal) Society had their very impressive annual display in the City centre last Saturday. It was very well attended with great interest shown by the old and young alike.

This, at the very least, should make people think before eating a wild mushroom. 
Another message was that people should enjoy and respect nature.

			A painting looted from a Berlin Jewish family by Nazis has been found by US authorities at the Kunsthaus museum in Zurich, museum officials said on Tuesday.             
			
			NO WAYYYY!!!   
You gotta be kidding me?!   
Who'd have thought...
		 
			
			At least the family of the owners have been low-key about it.  They could've raised a huge storm around it, had they wanted to.
		 
			
			Well ...... the painting(s) have to end up somewhere eventually, and they ended up being public ... and in a respectable venue .. at least!
		    Wow, that is beyond naive.        Why?  They were looted.  History has extended.  Histories forgotten.    So the new ""owners"" put their paintings on exhibit, and discover they were looted.  What is naive about my observation on that?   
Is everyone totally aware of the history of every possession of theirs?
		 
			
			Not possible! The Swiss? With Nazi loot? Can't believe it.
		    It's called provenance, and, yes, ESPECIALLY if one is a museum, one is aware.
		    There are people who are rich but far from noble, but this Sommerguth-Family apparently is noble and intelligent. I hope that the museum lives up to their demand in full. It is good when museum visitors also learn a bit about some tragic aspects of internationally shown art.   
**************************************************  *********************************        Had they really been aware of the facts about this, they would hardly  have used it in a special exhibition in 2009. The Kunsthaus just as  other museums has hundreds of exhibits in their vaults. But according to  the story they got it inside a whole collection in 2006 .  To be  praised are the heirs of the Sommerguth legacy who turned the picture  over into a donation. There of course will be plate below the picture  with the statement ""1939 Alfred Sommerguth von den Nationalsozialisten  entzogen. Geschenk seiner Erben und von Frau Hannelore Müller, 2010"" .   Also this in a decent language.
		     
Yes, there's provenance, but in this case, consider the situation-   
Would the Nazi government want to 'document' where they got the painting from?  ""Painting X, stolen from so-and-so.""  Further, is it possible the documentation might've been destroyed in the war.   
Would someone fleeing the holocaust, risking their life, worry about carrying a document that says, ""I own such-and-such a painting?""   
Museums do their best to determine provenance for anything in their inventory, but, as has been pointed out, the painting was one in a collection of many that were donated to the museum by an individual who *was* able to demonstrate proper ownership of the collection.
		    The NSDAP-government of course used a dry bureaucratic style to describe such things like ""rescued by the German Imperial government from ownerless fortune""      
			
			I am by no means an art expert, critic or anything of the sort. But I do like to take in the major museums when I can. Half way through the second day at the Louve, it really hit me, that it was essentially full of the plundered culture from around the world. Albeit, many were donations, 'properly aquired' and put on display at a central location for all to enjoy and compare, I actually was a bit disgusted at the end of a few days, it really started to fee like pillage from all around the world, horded into one facility. Again, just my personal opinion.
		    True, apparently there is a good type of loot (the type we collected for ""scientific"" reasons) and a bad type of loot (which is what the Nazis did).   
There is actually a lot of artwork that was raided from Nazi Germany by allied troops and ended up in private collections and musea in the US (including stuff that the Nazis had raided from Jews). The Americans are rather less willing than the Swiss to talk about it though.
		    True, this is what struck me most about the story. They would have been in their rights to ask for the painting back and to hang it in their living room or sell it to the highest bidder. But they chose to leave it where it is in exchange for recognition that it was in fact theirs. What a very noble gesture.

			A Swiss court has cleared a man of wrongdoing after he failed to jump into the water to save his date from drowning in Lake Geneva.            This raises an interesting question:  
1) are there any countries which have a law that states it is mandatory to aid someone in danger? 
2) a 22 min response time to an emergency call is pretty shocking, isn't it?
		    1) I believe France does (weren't those papparazzis in court because of Diana) 
The closest or overall term is ""duty to rescue"" if I remember correctly. 
2)Sometimes (not that I have done it) it might be easier to say that Someone has been shot on armed robbery. Although you might get thrown in jail for wasting resources.
		    I thought Switzerland had a  , but the article only mentions France briefly.
		     
Good samaritan laws are primarily made to incentive the rescuers to help without the threat of a lawsuit for ""wrongdoing"". At least that is my understanding of them.   
EDIT: Aha... the link provides the answer       I believe I read once that UK health & safety laws inhibit police from jumping in & attempting to save people; or maybe I dreamt it.   
No did not dream it        Yes, it does - ""non assistance à personne en danger"" is punishable by up to 5 years in prison or 75,000 fine (source for the figures is Wikipedia).
		 
			
			I recently read that pharmacies here will shortly be selling inky rubber stamps that patients can use to write ""Do not resuscitate"" on their chests.                
Excellent idea, but an expert states that rescue services are committed to saving lives, and that the stamp would be ignored!    
Google translation:  
In addition, legal questions remain unanswered. They would therefore ""currently reanimate despite the stamp,"" says Portmann. Marinello will, however, ""take every legal track, which revived me against my will.""  
Clear instructions for doctors and paramedics are therefore inevitable. Because in a few weeks will be able to buyIn addition, legal questions remain unanswered. They would therefore ""currently to reanimate despite stamp,"" says Portmann. Marinello will, however, ""every legal track, which revived me against my will."" Clear instructions for doctors and paramedics are therefore inevitable. Because in a few weeks it will be possible to buy the stamp in pharmacies.
		    stupid law.  i suppose you need to specifically ask for a lifeguard when dialing emergency services in the UK in the case of a potential drowning.
		 
			
			the other day, i read a blog post about a lifeguard trying to give first aid to someone at a restaurant while 2 nurses refused to do anything because they were too scared of litigation if the man died.   
in the end, we all pay for the lawsuit culture.
		     So true and in a much harsher way.
		    Cool.  I'll use indelible ink and stamp it on people I don't like.
		 
			
			I took the first aid exam with the Samaritaner earlier this year and one thing we were taught was that here in Switzerland there's no ""duty to rescue"", meaning a person cannot be held liable for failing to aid someone in peril.    
At the same time, the ""Good Samaritan Law"" applies as well here in Switzerland, meaning that if a person does in fact help, he or she will not be sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death.    
In summary, you  help, and if you do, you   face prosecution if things go amiss. It's a way to encourage people to try their best and help, there's nothing to lose and you may save a life.    
Please bear in mind that even if you don't know what to do, it doesn't mean there's no use for you. Let someone more experienced/skilled do the technical stuff if you don't know what to do, but do stick around. You may be asked to call the ambulance, or fetch a blanket, or keep a nosy crowd at bay, and so on. That too will make a difference.    
BTW, I'm going to specialize in water rescue, if anyone has specific questions about that, let me know, I can ask the ""experts"" as soon as I start my training.
		 
			
			The Local startles us all with more amazing headlines and wizard journalism. Could the literature prize be waiting in the wings.....?   
			
			If someone is in difficulty in the water, and you dive in to save them, unless you know what you're doing, there is a significant risk of two deaths instead of one.    
At least, that's the logic applied in the case from the UK.
		 
			
			I now have to carry a GTN spray in case of a heart attack.   
If I happened to be with someone who had an attack I wonder what the repercussions would be if I sprayed it under their tongue to open their arteries?   
If they survived that is great, but if they did not- would I be prosecuted?
		    I can't reply for sure, mostly because I know nothing about GTN and its effects and how dangerous it can be. Based on what I was taught so far when training in first aid, my guess is that if you have reason to believe GTN helps in such circumstances (i.e. you're acting in good faith) you shouldn't be prosecuted.     
Personally, my biggest concern would be whether or not there's a risk I may kill or hurt that person whose life is already in danger. I'd rather play safe - I wouldn't feel comfortable administering a drug not knowing how that person may react to it. As I said, I don't know anything about the GTN spray. We were taught the aspirin trick, though: in case of heart attack aspirin helps opening the arteries. However, there are risks, again, so you first need to make sure they are not allergic it. And even if they're not, administering aspirin means the standard procedure can't be followed and a different kind of medicine has to be administer once the ambulance arrives. (Medical staff must be immediately informed that aspirin was administered to the patient).    
Based on that, I assume the same caution should be taken before administering GTN. If you happened to be with someone who had a heart attack, the first thing I recommend doing is calling an ambulance. When you do so, mention you suspect a heart attack and ask them whether the use of said spray is advisable or not, then simply follow any instructions you'll be given.   
(Hopefully someone with medical training can offer further advice)
		    For me, I wouldn't personally administer a controlled substance even if it were in good faith.  Over the counter medicines like asprin etc ok, but prescription only products, I think may be a difficult one to argue if they ended up dying as a result.  If it is their medication fine thats a different story.
		 
			
			It is quite common that someone drowning will, in panick, pull his rescuer down with him. My trainer told us to always have a safety gilet and if not, to first knock out the person before to bring her back to the shore.
		    It also happens often when people try to save their dogs. 
Sometimes, the dog somehow survives while the owner drowns, sometimes both die.

			Switzerland's spell of sizzling weather seems to have left Alpine cattle a bit hot under their cowbell collars. For the second time in a couple of weeks, hikers in Canton Graubünden have been attacked by cows nursing newborn calves.             
			
			dear dear, look at the size of that baby. No wounder it attacked, so would you if you just gave birth to that.
		    That is a ridiculous, sensation-seeking headline. What is   about mothers protecting their young against a possible threat?     
Hikers (of whom I am one) need to remember that they are intruding on the cows' territory, and give them a wide berth especially if they have calves with them - as the article correctly says. That headline is terrible though.
		 
			
			That should read ""Alpine cows attack crazy hikers""
		 
			
			Crazy Swiss cows? I thought this thread was going to be about breaking Rule 1...    
			
			Yeah, silly headline! Back to the drawing board - uh, writing board - you, whoever you are, The Local sub-editor!   
Be careful around swans with their young, too.
		 
			
			Alert the press! I was once dive-bombed by a mocking bird.
		 
			
			Bad take on it, but it never hurts to remind people that cows aren't completely harmless. I've been charged at by a herd of cows twice (on the Isle of Wight - I don't know if IoW cows are different from Swiss ones...). I wasn't expecting it either time and now I have a bit of a fear of the buggers, to be honest!
		    Snap ... and in my case it was young bullocks ..   .. Welsh ones .. does that also make a difference??? probably not.
		    ""Don't talk about fight club""? I thought that cow fighting is not really an issue here - people accept it as a cultural asset. Hardly any tree-huggers fighting against it.
		 
			
			Mother cows are not to be underestimated.  My sister-in-law lives on a farm and one of their mother cows charged at her and her daughter.  She ran across the field, crawled under the bobwire fence and managed to save herself and her daughter from an attack.   
So it's just not tourists they attack.
		 
			
			The article has another error, other than the title.  It says the cows used their horns.   
Everyone knows that Swiss cows have bells - because their horns don't work!        
Boom Boom !!!!!!!!!!   
Actually, you should be double careful if you walk through a cow field with your dog and always keep it on a lead - that really upsets them as they perceive them as a real threat to their calves...
		     
Yeah, our postman used to complain about dogs attacking his calves.   
Except for great danes, of course. They'd go for his thighs.
		     
Ha !!! Off topic, but once I got a letter from the post office informing me that they would not deliver as my dog apparently chased the postman, snatched the letters from his hand and chased him out of the garden 
The next day I waited and took a video of my lazy dog , fast asleep , postman delivering and all my dog did was lift one eye up. I called the postman and showed him the evidence. 
Needless to say, my delivery remained intact   
			
			My sister was chased by a herd of cows when we were young and on a walk in the country with our parents.  She must have wondered off into a field to pick flowers, or something.  Anyway, the next thing we saw was her running really fast past a gate, swiftly followed by loads of cows.  She then disappeared behind a row of hedges, before reappearing at full pelt past the next gap in the hedge, still followed by the cows!  My father legged it up to the next gap and whipped her out of the field.   
It was hilarious to watch, but not so funny for her.  (Luckily, she was ok)    
			
			I was two and couldn't move at much more than a waddle (plus ça change) when I escaped our back garden and headed off into the fields beyond. My mother, frantic, searched the house, called the neighbours and police before noticing the peculiar behaviour of the cows beyond the hedge.    
Abovementioned bovines had formed a gentle circle to stare down at a small child singing nursery rhymes in a Welsh accent, trying to make a daisy chain out of clover. When the local copper, next-door neighbour and my Ma came to rescue me, the cows tried to chase them off.   
Sometimes I still wonder what my Mowgli-life, running wild with Welsh cattle might have been like. Just think, my ethics, culture and world-code could have been dictated by a herd of domestic Friesians. I like to think they'd have called me Ermintrude.
		    Welsh you say?  Probably wouldn't have been much different    
			
			I think people in Switzerland does not know nothing about nature.   
It is like dogs that not bark. Only here.   
People attacked by cows. Lucky them. In my country could be a bull. Or you know how to handle or you won´t be here to tell the story.
		    In my country could be dinosaur!
		    It made you look though!! And me too. If it had said ""Hikers reminded to stay away from cows"" I wouldn't have bothered clicking.
		    Why were you stalking cows on the Isle of Wight?  were you trying to access your Channel Islands Bank Account that the herd was paid handsomely to guard?
		    hmm - if in your country everyone knows how to handle a bull - what does that say about your country?
		    A) I was not stalking them - if anything THEY were stalking ME! On both occasions I was having a leisurely walk in the countryside and I went over a stile into an enormous field (well away from the cows) and they went out of their way to charge at me!   
B) The IoW is NOT one of the Channel Islands! Common error, though.
		 
			
			So it's true, the army has trained a cow to conduct covert operations.
		 
			
			Terrible. I was mocked once, by a dive-bombing bird.       
			
			Those crazy cows.   
They really do need to kalb down.           I'll get me coat....      Sounds like you caught yourself a summer cold.   
(Yes, a coat might help.)
		 
			
			Cows protecting their young are no joke. One time I was mountain biking near St. Cergue and rode out of the woods onto a hillside filled with cows. They all   and I had to gun it down the hill, avoiding rocks, with the ""cling! cling! cling!"" of the cows' bells behind me. It was surreal and scary as hell. My mountain bike wasn't very good and pretty heavy, I usually had trouble picking it up. Yet once I got down the hill and to the 1.5m-tall fence, I threw my bike over like it was a pillow, due to the adrenaline rush, and then jumped over myself. Cows arrived a few seconds later. We just stared at each other for a few minutes from both sides of the fence while I recuperated. These days, whenever I eat a burger, I think of them.
		 
			
			Aye, there's a lot to be said for taking young calves away from their mother and stuffing them in a crate.
		 
			
			The level of wit in this thread is udderly despicable.....
		    In a word: VEAL!   (Yummmy)   
In fact, that's what I made for dinner last night (with tuna sauce).   
Tom
		    Not everybody because you do not have bulls in cities. But in countryside every knows about cows, sheeps, bulls and wolves.   
In a Country where hiking is everyday life not knowing animal behaviour is unacceptable to me.   
So what does says to me? That people are more aware of the risk of the activiy. Maybe here people think animals born civilzed. I just do not know..tel me more about this.
		          The Swiss have no problems with cows (or anything else), it's all the English speaking foreigners that do!    
Tom
		    Imagine my surprise at being attacked when most of the cows on the Isle of Wight wear tuxedos and listen to Mozart.
		          I thought it was the Bull that lost its load? Or loads.   
Anyway, on the internet its a different type of BS we have to deal with.
		    Anyway... it was a sticky situation and somebody knew how to handle it...
		    Come again?
		 
			
			It's not as warm outside anymore.  S' het kuhelet.  (Swiss humor)
		    Maybe here animals think   born civilised.
		 
			
			LOL, and  we thought we were the only ones attacked. 
I have seen cows do not like to get themselves clicked. 
For example, this one, tried some kung fu moves     
kinda remind of this wonderful video     
			
			I love your story and humour!          Yep they must smell our pure sweet blood a mile away ! .....................

Personally I would not want to be a glove puppet but horses for courses as they say.
		 
			
			Very interesting article, thank you. It is strong not just in the German speaking cantons. Here in Geneva too they make a lot of noise, and it does not give a particularly welcoming picture of Switzerland, in sharp contrast with our personal experience, every Swiss we've met (properly)having been friendly and welcoming. I also feel sorry for the ""transfrontaliers"" who are not only the target of the UDC but also of the MCG (even more extreme, it would seem!).   
Let's hope the Swiss in their majority will not forget the values they stand for and fall for cheap and easy propaganda.          One of the major factors which helped the SVP to grow was (is) the weakness of the CVP. Catholics in Catholic-rural cantons of Switzerland no longer identify themselves in politics with the Catholic Party. They however by majority dislike the Social Democrats, the the Liberals in Cantons like Luzern were the Party of the Protestants, so that the BGB-SVP became the obvious choice for the Conservatives among them. Much now depends on to what extent the BDP manages to position itself. And the upcoming elections will tell whether the Green-Liberals are able to continue the successes they got in recent Cantonal elections or not.    
What you talk about was, back in 2003 on her 95th birthday in the Hilton Geneva, suddenly made a topic. Having been of Hungarian Jewish origin she had seen how in the German Empire (a republic then in fact) the NSDAP with the SVP-like Deutsch-Nationale Partei moved up into leadership and then ousted the DNP in 1934, and so clearly warned us about the impending danger of the SVP. As two persons at the table were having pro-SVP sympathies, a cousin and me mediated and calmed the situation. But when we were alone with our aunt somewhere in the afternoon, our aunt smilingly told us  ""thanks for your efforts to calm the waves, but I know of course that you share my opinions ! ""  The good lady passed away a year later.   
The MCGE of course profits from the union-widely bad reputation of the Cantonal Police of Geneva and apparent security problems in Geneva. The situation in reality may not be so much worse than elsewhere, but is a nice thing for some disgruntled rightwingers.  They might have joined the SVP but that would have meant to co-operate with some Vaudois, something rather NON-Genevois
		 
			
			Not again...    
Why don't we just rename this forum ""SVP-obsessed.ch"" and be done with it?
		 
			
			Also the ""Local"" is SVP obsessed. I mean, the SVP does NOT dominate Swiss politics. It may at times dominate the headlines. But in the Swiss media it is not halfway as important as on the EF !     Switzerland has a strictly proportional system, which means that a 30% party is NOT the government party. I still fail to get why so many EFfers are so much fascinated by that party. Add to this that the really important aspects in CH politics will be the results of GLP and BDP in the upcoming parliamentary elections
		 
			
			It's so far-right that it's almost Austrian.
		    A forum that is comprised mostly of expats seems fixated on a rabidly anti-immigration party that makes a point of advertising frequently and offensively against the presence of expats and holds a plurality of seats and you can't see why said forum is obsessed? I don't think it takes a big leap of imagination.
		 
			
			Thank you! I think if you live near a border (French or German), the anti-foreigner feelings get stronger and it is therefore more palpable than perhaps elsewhere.   
And as arelatively new comer to CH, I would not classify it as obsession to find out more about the politics of our host country (even though I have another 7 years to wait before being allowed to vote in any election!)       
			
			...and, dmay, if you thank me, I too will have been thanked 100 times on this forum!          Huh? In Basel where we share borders between 3 countries, I never felt this anti-foreigners feeling. Even, Basel is known for not being a good SVP supporter.   
SVP is just a noisy party who spend more than anyone else in ads and in useless debates instead to sit down and really try to bring the country forward.   
The Local is using headlines to be on the top list when people google informations. Just to bring attention on this forum. Instead to use the good stuff in here (  and trying to promote the forum with its content, The Local prefer to play the Gossip Girl.          I thought that ""plurality"" was a majority ?  But the SVP does not have a majority of the seats in any parliament in Switzerland. Sure, in a parliamentary republic, the leader of the largest party in the lower house of parliament, Tony Brunner, would get the appointment to establish a coalition government, just as it happened when in post WW-1 Germany, Imperial President Marshal Hindenburg did do so. BUT this is NOT a parliamentary republic        But an obsession it is if all really relevant aspects and developments are ignored, if all the campaigns and positions of the other parties are ignored, and if in case of the heaviest party, only their negative aspects are looked at

			Swiss banking giant UBS announced on Saturday that chief executive Oswald Gruübel has handed in his resignation, which was accepted by the board of directors.                   
			
			REM breaks up , UBS down the toilet. What a week
		 
			
			(Reuters) - The following is the text of the letter to UBS staff from Oswald Gruebel, whose resignation as Chief Executive of the Swiss bank was announced on Saturday. 
Dear colleagues, 
I have handed in my resignation as CEO to the Board of Directors today. That it was possible for one of our traders in London to inflict a multi-billion loss on our bank through unauthorized trading shocked me, as it did everyone else, deeply. 
This incident has worldwide repercussions, including political ones. I did not take the step of resigning lightly. I am convinced that it is in the best interests of UBS to approach the future with a new leader at the top. 
The precise circumstances that led to the loss are being investigated by an independent body. Many questions remain open, and it is vital that they are cleared up in a comprehensive way. What is certain is that, as CEO, I bear full responsibility for what occurs at UBS. 
From my first day on the job I placed the reputation of the bank above all else. That is why I want to and must act according to my convictions. I hope my resignation makes it possible for our clients, our investors and the public to return their attention more quickly to the quality and strengths of our bank. 
We achieved a great deal together in the past two-and-a-half years. The bank's core businesses are well positioned in every important market, and we enjoy strong relationships with our clients. 
The loss represents a significant setback in our efforts to rebuild trust in our bank. However, you should have no doubt about the fundamental strengths of UBS. Because of you, the bank has made sustainable progress, which is something you can take pride in. 
As I've always emphasized, a lot of work remains to be done here. So don't let recent events distract you from your work. Continue giving your all and keep your focus on your clients. 
I am certain that UBS can carve out a strong place for itself within the fundamentally changing financial industry. 
I want to extend you my sincere thanks for your strong commitment and support during my tenure. It was a privilege to be your CEO. I wish you and UBS only the best in the future. 
Yours, 
Oswald J. Gruebel
		 
			
			Strange business when you consider the alleged illegal activities allegedly began 1 year before Grübel joined UBS         But they did not incur any losses, the losses are very recent.
		    Fixed that for you        you mean not spotting an ongoing fraud for 3 years is not such a crime?
		    fixed it there, the way it really happened...
		    I cut and pasted this Reuters news item from one of the websites as a matter of information. Wonder what was there to groan about?
		    A very good resignation letter. But good resignation letters already were issued by outgoing CEOs of Swissair in the years before its collapse        I was so shocked I fainted into my curry.   
That's me in the korma.
		    Agree with your statement except that it comes in a time when Mr Grübel already is forgotten by most people. That happened surprisingly fast. He was one of those technocrats nowadays dominating the boards and managements of big companies. Personalities like Messrs Bruggisser, Moritz Suter, Corti, Jacobs stayed on in the memory of people, regardless of whether they failed or succeeded. A rare exception is Swatch, where the great personality of Nicolas Hayek got replaced by the equally rich personality of his son Nick Hayek.  Another exceptional personality is Peter Spuhler who started his career as a professional icehockey player     
-  These two in real terms are neither the richest nor the most important businessmen but two real personalities. Most such folks are grey mice like Mr Grübel, who arrive in position, do business, and retire.     
I cannot say anything about those musicians as I had to google them just even to know who they were/are

			Good for her - about time. Switzerland is still way behind is wage equality. Bravo.
		    I suspect male pay will fall, with a high CHf is could easily be used as an excuse.
		 
			
			Men are expected to provide for their family / wife / kids and are expected to be chivalrous when out and about which comes at a price...   
You don't see us complaning!    
So this is another example of equality when it's convenient!                
Some ""men"" don't do anything       Strangely I think everyone agrees...       Oh no.... I have a lot to answer to you but my mouth is full of popcorn...
		    You don't have to answer to anything darling...    
As long as the kids are looked after and you look as good as that picture... the rest is on me...         I know I should groan........ but it makes me laugh!       Same here Nil- how about you and me get together and duff him up      Ha ha only messing of course...   Or am I?       C*ckblock!       I think we will take a risk with him.... he is The Love Doctor after all...
		    She's a keeper!    
			
			I will support your campaign to remove these onerous social obligations from men  once women are no longer making cents on the dollar of their male  colleagues (or rappen on the CHF, in this case).            Well you can start by making me sandwhich...            
			
			Resisted the groan- had a laugh- but now wearing a bit thin. 
Fact is, women are still paid much less for the same job in most parts of the world, and for most of them, the reality is that when they get home after a hard day's work, the majority still have to take the brunt of childcare, cooking and all household tasks. Well done to those here who disagree with this statement because YOU DO your fair share.
		 
			
			Reminds me that I have to be become a manager so I could know what my colleagues earn...and then secretly envy them and work their butt off, so they could finally deserve that dam' wage.     
			
			Look, I love despair.com parodies as much as the next person, but surely this sort of ""humor"" is not okay in 2011.     
It's a system that rewards women, who bear the brunt of societies' ""domestic"" responsibilities, with fewer opportunities and less pay.   
The real question here is why does women wanting equal pay for equal work threaten some insecure men to such an extent?  What are you scared of?       
			
			I had a blistering row over a very similar issue with an ex of mine a few years ago.   
I did all the cooking, all the cleaning and paid 2/3 of the rent.  She never did any ironing at all as it was against her ""feministic principles"".  Whilst I will happily joke about feminism, lack of equality etc, I do think it's unfair that people aren't treated ""equally"".  Be that with pay, promotion etc etc.   
My argument with my ex over this topic led me to believe that a number of ""feminists"" and indeed feminism in general is on a par with male chauvanism.   
People should not be campaigning for better rights for one group or another.  People should be campaigning for EQUALITY in it's true form.  Equal rights and everything that entails for ALL, regardless of sex, colour, creed etc.
		 
			
			hmm 
I don't believe in absolutes... and even though equality in principle sounds good... in practice it doesn't really work... I think an equal porportion of inequality may be needed from time to time...   
			
			Well the door swings both ways.....       
			
			Last I checked, it's not like education costs less for women, whether it is vocational schools or university degrees, the schools charge the same. Of course, there are some special grants or scholarships, but usually those come from groups not affiliated with the schools in question but special interest groups, so that's not quite the same.   
As soon as the majority of co-ed universities are saying ""Well, Ms.Jones, since we know you'll only make 70 - 80% of what your male colleagues make, we'll only charge you 70 - 80% tuition fees"" well, then perhaps the women will stop pushing for equal pay. Our bills are the same, why should our wages be different?
		      She must be terrible at negotiating. Don't know if I wanted someone like her working for me...       Hope you ironed sharp creases in her knickers      
			
			Nice one!....   My other half (female) is considering moving out here so we can be in the same place, but is seriously worried that if she does then she won't find a job . It seems strange that in a country which has so many good things (animal welfare, low taxes, high employment, good food,  blah, blah, blah ) unlike the dump formerly known as England... that the system covertly discriminates against women by deliberately NOT having laws that prevent it, and sustaining a culture which limits opportunities ...  I thought that most civilized countries had moved beyond the 1950's mentality of expecting women to be 'hausfrau'.  My other half has had to be very assertive to attain a decent level of career.  Do Swiss women just accept these cultural anachronisms ?  why ? sexual discrimination is just a form of latent racism.
		    Swiss [sic] is a traditional country with traditional family values... Which means the family roles have been precisely defined and women here know where they belong...    
			
			Yeah, there is a hausfrau mentality out there.   
We asked our concierge for a different laundry time (it is Wednesdays 1 to 5 pm!) b/c we work.  Her response (to my husband, who went to talk to her): ""Where is your wife?"" (as in, during that time)   
The schools have a two hour lunch break for the kids during which time they are expected to go home.  Some people have to get an au pair just to make this work with a dual income home.  And another friend of ours looked into local daycares just to discover that these places just take your kids for a few afternoons a week, a setup which seems to be good for stay at home moms but not people with a 9 to 5.  Very weird.      "	28	Court win for woman paid 40% less than colleague	2304

			A Zurich butcher shop has received a rap on the knuckles from a Swiss advertising standards authority that deemed as sexist a suggestive picture of a leggy woman depicted alongside the slogan: 'the best meat in town'.             
			
			Granted, showing a sexy lady combined with the slogan ""best meat in town"" could raise some eyebrows.   
What I find ridiculous is the statement of the lady from Terre des Femmes. Apparently, according to her a woman dressed in a short skirt and high heels is a whore? (sorry, sexworker)   How odd.
		 
			
			Is that the wurst he could come up with?       Well, um, welcome to the sauce-age    
			
			I'm a woman & I think it's a great add! Very clever, very clean (design), nice legs, nice cleaver, nice steak... and last but not least nice butt.
		    Switzerland has an Advertising Standards Authority?    
I would never have guessed it    
			
			The second pic is ok, but the first one certainly lacks subtlety.  I mean, purleeese!!!       How is that lacking subtlety exactly? - The girl clearly enjoys a bit of sausage.
		    Me too.  But I tend not to eat mine like that.
		    What, have you never watched any porn? My god, man, you're on the internet! Go watch, you'll figure it out real quick.    
			
			I think it's despicable. It's suggesting that all women love a bit of sausage. Don't think men aren't subject to discrimination and type casting. We don't all love bananas, for example          LMAO!    
""some fell on stony ground""   
At least the butcher did not get hauled over the coals too much - in the UK, the (over) PC brigade would be in their own version of (religiously neutral) Heaven.   
Sure, it is a tad suggestive. But an inspired ad campaign!    
P.S. poptart.......do you know any decent sites for the suggested research?       OR sport facial topiary.
		    I enjoy cheeky innuendo as much as any other woman, but I think the offense on the ad has more to do with taste. It's just...meh. A little too unsubtle. If that's only 'a tad', I'd hate to see what would be overt. Perhaps a woman pleasuring herself with a sausage? Yeahh....classy.   Mmmmmm...pass the mustard, would ya?   
As for research my warm blooded male friend, use the Google. Go boldly, but don't say I didn't warn you.       ""Sometimes a banana is just a banana, Anna"".... And it looks a little limp, really.   Perhaps a cigar?
		     
Many Thanks indeed for the tip! (the word ""tip"" used carefully as not to cause  offence) 
I truly believe that the ad should be taken in the context intended. I am certain that the butcher involved was not either condoning prostitution or indeed offering it as an additional service for his business - although I am suer it would be a USP.  
Furthermore, I believe that the innuendo is perfectly acceptable - should one want to investigate the offence that it MIGHT cause, and in effect second guess the reaction of thousands of advertising targets - well go for it, and good luck.   
As for your suggestion of a woman pleasuring herself with said product - I too would find that FAR too much for open display to the public - no matter HOW much Colemans' mustard is used, and would be sure to cause offence, as well as potentially considerable discomfort to the model/sex worker/Jezebel (or whatever people might compare her to) involved.   
{comment omitted as not to provide another angle}   
Regards.
		 
			
			Please excuse the typo. 
I was preoccupied with the suggestion from poptart that I should use google - simply brillant.
		 
			
			Think of the trouble he might have been in, if he had used the ad to sell mutton! - inconceivable, but deserved.
		    What says he isn't trying to sell mutton?
		 
			
			His website. lol
		 
			
			The lady looks cross-eyed       That don't matter, but the fresh meat in her hand is not very appealing...why, oh why...I like the recent tv spots on papet vadoise, hands making sausages.
		    Indeed!  And that is only a chipolata!!
		    You RETARDS, ""best quality"" is hardly ""best meat""!    
Take some English lessons, you morons!    
Tom
		    Innuendo, by its definition, means 'subtle'. Show me the subtle and I'll buy you a beer.    
I'm not offended by the ad, but it sure as hell doesn't make me hungry for the sausage. And, since women are generally the ones who buy the groceries....   If I want to chomp on a sausage the way they're suggesting, I have one at home for free...UNNERSTAN? Or do I need to break out a sausage and illustrate the point? ;D   
Hope Google helped!       Uh?  You have lost me there (and I am English)       Am i the only one who finds that word (capitalised) extremely offensive? Maybe its a cultural thing....

			It definitely says "" "" - in  no less.           Tom, did you read the article? 
An excerpt from the article for your perusal:   
But butcher Urs Keller said he found the SLKs decision absurd, arguing that just ""wanted to do something modern"" instead of always advertising with a dead animal. Keller has since removed the offending tagline from his delivery vehicles, although the pictures are still on show.   
I am sure that the ""best quality since 1934"" slogan - which I am assuming that you refer to(on the rear RHS of the traders vehicle) is...well - not displayed in any kind of English that I was taught.
		    but that is only so that the locals don't understand it!
		 
			
			OR ""Finest Quality"" - forgive the error.
		    Goodness...i got groaned for merely asking the question!    
			
			LMAO - we were clearly looking at differing photographs. I stand corrected. 
Apologies. 
I was referring to the vehicle shown at:      
			
			One could love or hate this ad, but the advertiser got much bigger coverage thanks to this scandal   So it works. And the image IS sexy       Yeah, but if she was born in 1934, she's not the youngest meat in town.    
			
			Some advertising placement fail:         
This one for ouchboy's lolcats     
			
			Well, I have to admit... I actually kind of appreciate the ad -- but only because it is one of the very few things I've seen here that really takes a risk and stands out from the norm.    
Besides, I think I'm less offended by this ad than I am by those obnoxious Rolex ads or furniture ads that boast a cheap-looking chair being sold for only 2,000 CHF.   
Yes, the ad is tacky. But it was intended to be.    
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a sausage calling my name...    
			
			Being a woman and a vegetarian, I won't worry about being politically incorrect.... this ad is funny and its forte rides precisely on being controversial. Benetton brand has skillfully mastered the fine art of creating targeted controversy to expend brand's longevity.
		    There was a time when that would earn you a ban believe it or not.

			Prostitutes from Hungary are increasingly being sent to work in the red light district on Sihlquai in the centre of Zurich, but they don't see themselves as victims of trafficking, according to a Swiss researcher.             
			
			damn... that wasn't the picture I was hoping to see.
		 
			
			I use to live right near Sihlquai, where they would all stand along the street... and I was just amazed at how these women could act so proud of what they were doing. Maybe it's some kind of self-defense mechanism, I don't know. But then again, I guess -- who wants to buy a shameful prostitute?    
Anyways, I always wished I had the time and ability to do a little documentary about them with interviews, etc. I would especially like to know how willing most of these women really are to be doing... what they do.    
It's so sad...
		    why shouldn't they be proud? it's a more honest profession than some.
		    like tax consulting *shiver.
		 
			
			Well at least its a job that they do not have to speak Swiss  German for !
		    What exactly are they proud of? The money or the work - or both?   
I support women who go into the business freely without coercion & intimidation but I think the EU countries seriously need to crack down on trafficking.   
Big Difference.
		     
That's true... I guess they're ""screwing"" their customers at a much fairer rate than most corporations do!    
			
			Can we assume that this is because the resident prostitutes did not reduce the price as the CHF got stronger v Euro?
		        Quote: The Local      Prostitutes from Hungary are increasingly being sent to work in the red light district on Sihlquai in the centre of Zurich, but they don't see themselves as victims of trafficking, according to a Swiss researcher.                 The article says, ""Out of 56 applications recently submitted by sex workers in Zurich to the Office for Economy and Labour (AWA), all but one were from Hungarian women.""     So that headline should read:          I partly agree (they shouldn't be not proud), but isn't it a bit hypocritical too?   
I guess it's one thing to say:"" Well it's a normal business  etc."" and another one to say (and think) I'm totally fine with that  (e.g.) my little sister or best friend is a sex worker. In this case we would try to get them out of it. Why could that be?   Maybe because we can imagine that street prostitution is nothing like heaven.    
But if a care taker smokes a cigarette on a balkon, it causes a small riot. (nothing against it/ just considering the dimensions)   
It's just that we are more careless with people we don't know. This is natural but in some cases it's a tiny bit sad too.
		    true. i think few people would take it as a career option if they had the choice because of the social stigma, which is why i think it would be nice for the rest of us not to shit on them some more* by calling them shameful etc.   
*insert scatological joke here.
		 
			
			I guess that my biggest problem with prostitution is that I see so many women (even still today) base their identities primarily upon their sexuality (regardless of whether or not they are prostitutes). And so I feel like prostitution only perpetuates this warped sense of female identity. Of course, I have absolutely no problem with women ""embracing their sensuality,"" but when they exploit their own sexuality in lieu of their intelligence or integrity, then as a woman, I am rather offended.    
Sadly, though, many of these women probably come from societies in which the men already treated them that way (according to their sexuality). And so they are just vicitms of their own culture (as perhaps we all are).
		    is it really so warped? women have always been valued for their beauty and men for their power/wealth. it might be an ugly truth, but the truth nonetheless.
		    Christ, now I'm wondering to myself...how does one say, ""Oh baby, me so horny!"", etc. in the local dialect. I need to go find a bottle of wine pronto and get rid of that thought...      Beautiful women do not solicit tricks on the street (as if they're really beautiful, they'd be making more money for a call service). Not to mention a lot of these women are substance abusers. It's an ugly truth, yes.
		     
I agree with you.    
But on the other hand I think that a lot of people are taken advantage  of because of their economical or psychological condition. And just  ignoring the abusive character of some of the sex work might be  political correct nowadays, but I worry often about the girls. It's a  bit of russian roulette out there when it comes to their treatment.  That's all.    
I think there is a lot of damage produced to some souls and only few care about it.   
And saying: ""It's a business like every other""  is a bit rich.
		 
			
			Yeah, come to think of it...   
I guess I myself had a rather warped ""sexual identity"" back in my early or mid 20's -- thinking I could use sex to get love, etc. because all men seemed interested in, then, was my sexuality (the big boobs didn't help  ). So maybe I was just too stupid to charge for it?   (kidding, of course).   
But I do think (and hope) that, for most intelligent women, they do eventually come to learn that they need to revolve their identities around things other than their sexuality.
		    *passes brain bleach*
		 
			
			EXPLICIT CONTENT 
If you cant handle it dont watch it (no nudity)    
This video shows the other side of the coin and that indeed they are not all victims               
			
			So the big question is who uses all these prostitutes, are they here for other foreigners or is there a big home market?
		    My friend wants to know how can he get in touch with the one in the denim shorts?    
			
			How are they flooding *TO* somewhere?  At least proof read the headlines, even if only for grammatical errors and not factual accuracy.
		     
my ex boss was in this business (brothel and strip clubs) and it was mostly Swiss people (old drunks that had lost everything in the course of their lives....then again this is in bulle so not to many internationals here    
			
			On a serious note I find it all sad. I really don't know how anyone could call them names or treat them bad.
		     
I don't question that they aren't all victims. But street prostitution can be quite risky. I'm just annoyed about the double standards when it comes to  prostitution.
		    beautiful women solicit themselves in clubs, at social functions etc. not PC, but the truth is that throughout most of history women have essentially just been selling themselves to as rich/powerful/handsome a man as they can get. it is really only a very recent phenomenon that women have the option of being independent - and even now, it is arguably not so easy from a social point of view.
		     
I think we all know the answer to that one !   
			
			Watched a documentary today on UK TV about the 25.000 young women on wedding sites in Russia and Ukraine - girating in bikinis in front of groups of older men that go and oogle them and more, and sometimes marry them and bring them back. Made me feel so uncomfortable and hopeless about the future.    
You can talk all you want about the 'oldest and honorable profession' - but I do NOT know of a single man who would wish this for his daughter, his sister, his niece, or any woman they respect. Many men will pimp the women in their lives, and others,  but never for love nor respect. Or do they?
		    We're conditioned to have a morality blind spot to it. Many things like prostitution and porn are guilty pleasures. People don't particularly like guilt mixed with their pleasure, so we rationalize away our guilt by ignoring some of the ugly truths of the industry.   
The fact of the matter is, it's an industry that is largely built on the backs of desperate, troubled, or mentally unstable women. This is where the rationalizers jump in and say ""Prove they are troubled or exploited!"", and replace what they know (and what their common sense tells them) with what they want to believe.   
I am not trying to guilt-trip anyone, we're all slaves to our basic instincts. I would just prefer that we stick to the line of ""I don't care"" and be honest with ourselves instead of trying to rationalize it.
		    I would like to give you a big thank you for it, but I can't agree with the last two sentences because I do care. And I don't see sense in just ignoring it, when most of us get upset about minor problems. 
There isn't a big lobby for these girls I think. And I believe that partly the reason is, because it's kind of unpopular. And many people like to be popular.
		    Yep! I actually care but not enough to do anything about it.
		    Nice to see a single honest assessment of what guys say when they try to make prostitution into something a bit less tawdry than what it is.   
I once asked a guy in Finland who was a militant customer of prostitutes and who used the usual disclaimers as if the profession was so noble and so safe that would he be expecting his two daughters to get an advanced degree in the trade. He fumbled in all the ways you'd expect but I think that's the hardest part for me to understand when it comes to guys poking these women, saying it's a great profession and, yet, don't see how the attitude towards these women is any different than women in general aside from the transaction being a lot more streamlined.    
But it is a curious tidbit that the Hungarian women register where many/most of the others don't. I'd be interested to know why.
		    Don't worry about that. All men of all tongues know the English sex vocabulary. After all, more than 90% of all Internet porn is made in the USA (no, NOT China for once!).
		    But at least it's something.
		     I know, I have that with sneakers. I have a much higher morality since I don't do sports anymore. I am now looking the ugly truths of the sneaker industry in the eyes. I feel very moral.
		    What's worse, selling your body, or your mind?   
A body is just a body (and a bath will clean it just fine), a mind is who you are.   
Think about it.   
Tom
		    If I didn't appreciate the sexuality of women, it would make far more sense to become gay rather than put up with male wannabees!    
Tom
		 
			
			I think it is a big reflection on how uptight we all are about sex. We pimp our bodies out in many other ways - professional athletes, body guards, gold diggers, strippers, architects, scientists - but it's the sex that we object to. If we found ourselves in the unfortunate (and highly improbable) situation of having to decide whether our child should be a prostitute or an assassin I'm sure at least some would consider killing strangers to be the lesser evil.    
What women who choose - completely different from those forced into - prostitution need is support and resources to make a choice to stop if they want to. I think legalised prostitution allows women to access those resources without the stigma and judgement they face from most of society. Maybe that's what registration helps with? Belle de Jour, the blogger who wrote ""Diary of a London Call Girl"" worked as a prostitute while finishing her PhD. She had the options to allow her to decide to stop when she wanted to, but then again, she wasn't your typical street prostitute.   
And the same applies to men in prostitution too, although their numbers are much smaller.
		    yeah but we live in our body...    
that's the reason why many people think, we can't 'make up our mind' anymore once we are dead. Body and mind are connected.   
Think about it! With what do we think? The brain - part of our body.      
On another note: 
I guess there is also a difference between prostitution and street prostitution. In latter case, there is a higher probability of assaults.
		    Very interesting video   
So, it shows a very nice and educated lady of the night who has a good experience with this business and makes decent money.   
If what she said is true, 500 average per night..... That is equivalent to a professional job in Switzerland 500/8=62,50 X 1824= 114'000,00 / year   
But then she says, 250 for 30min and also the whole night 3500 and with the hotel another 1500   
Well, I sense some inconsistencies here, but      
(I think in Tenerife: 15 min is down to 30, If I remember correctly from the personal advertisements found in news papers)   
In any case, the money must be good. it beats 25CHF/h for cleaning toilets.       
I just read Paulo Coelho's book ""11 minutes"" . According to the book, Maria, the main character, was getting 300.- per client in Geneva (her clients paying for the hotel).    
This was perhaps for one or two hours of her time. In total.  With perhaps two or 3 clients a night (?)   
The truth may lie somewhere in between.     
But, here in Switzerland,...... where perhaps the clients are nice, respectful, considerate, and hygienic oriented.... For some ladies this may be a good professional choice. And then again, it is a matter of choice.
		    These men are clients of   How ""nice, respectful, considerate and hygienic oriented"" do you think they are likely to be?
		 
			
			Mind, body, soul and heart - for most of us all go together.   
Daddy, I've got excellent news. I've given up Uni and am going to be a prostitute.   
Arrghh I am so happy and proud daughter- this is what I've always dreamed for you.   
Have you ever known a dad who dreams of her daughter becoming a prostitute, and who will say 'no worries, just have a bath and wash it away?' 
I haven't.
		    Do you think selling your body doesn't affect your mind?   
Think about that.
		    Perhaps, but far less than selling ones inner self (i.e. mind).   
Tom
		    This is how the clients are presented in the book....... and Maria worked in a bar.    
Now, you don't read too much about street violence toward prostitutes do you?    
My impression is that if that were news, we will hear about them.
		    Well, certainly FAR more respectable than being a currency or commodities trader!    
And FAR more honest a profession.    
Tom
		    I sold my mind to a multinational corporation for a 6 figure salary per anum.      Maria made Geneve seem so much more interesting than it really is...   
(loved that book though... it's a great read)
		    Oh, well if it's in a  , then it must be true! Especially a book by  !      I suspect my irony detectors may be faulty...
		    And this makes you different from a prostitute in which way?   
Tom
		     
this is how they get treated in many of the prostitution areas.  
Belgium is like that and I suspect this is berlin 
I also know they have the right to say no.... 
(btw this is not talking bout street prostitutes, dont know really how that goes...       
ps dont know why I have a video for everything haha
		    Are the 2 mutually exclusive?
		    Of course they are. The industry is, by definition, exploitative. It doesn't matter if he's the bleedin' Dalai Lama, if he's visiting a prostitute, he's a .
		    Does sellIng your mind affect your body then ?
		    What definition is that?
		    There was no need to hit that guy   People are too violent for my taste in this world.
		    I'm not getting into a sophistic argument about the exploitative nature of prostitution.   
It's a shit industry, and anyone who sponsors it by visiting prostitutes deserves having his knackers put in a vice.   
How's that for a definition, Socrates?
		    Perhaps you know something I don't. Perhaps the abused prostitutes do not report their abuse to the police.    
All that is possible. I am not trying to sell prostitution as a real choice for women or men. each person to their drama.    
But, there are very good points in this discussion.... as for example selling your body, your mind, your time, or your soul (maybe prostitution combining all these)..... To the job you do....   
What I am not completely sure is about the amount of money a prostitute really makes. and from my little math exercised, if it is correct, it could be quite good money for most standards.
		    Perhaps they don't.   
Fancy that!
		    Well, it can certainly lead to stress!   
Tom
		    exactly my point.
		 
			
			The original article talks about trafficking - and that's what my concern is here. I could care less if a woman is making 500+ a night FREELY - kudos to her - but if she's trafficked (& btw most of that profit going to most likely a man in her life) then that's bad for society PERIOD.      A friend of mine in Germany worked freely as a prostitute in New Zealand  but when she got to Germany trying to start her own legal business, she was threatened for going solo and ultimately ended up being pimped, beaten, slashed, and gang raped by her pimp, his friends, and her ""respectable"" clients. She said Germany was a nightmare for her and countless other women and I suspect similar situations here in clean, lovely Switzerland.   
I'd just like to see more focus on getting the pimps out and supporting the women to run their own businesses.
		    You normally have to pay extra for that.
		    Fold.   kmv'kfsnknsfkn      Which is how it works under Swiss law (pimps are not allowed), at least in theory (i.e. the laws get enforced).    
Enforcing the already existing laws is what needs to be done, the laws are already there.   
Tom
		    No surprise there. 
The business is largely controlled by organized crime (from the Balkan or elsewhere, not necessarily Italy). 
Do you think ""Fat Tony"" would sit by and watch if somebody would set up a competing business in his neighborhood and slowly lure away his clients?   
If you want romance, go and buy a romantic novel...
		    Everyone is entitle to their opinion.    
Some food for thought, though:   
Are all prostitutes in Switzerland force into this profession?    
Isn't it possible that a nice, considerate, respectful, and hygienic oriented person will prefer to pay for sex.... and good money?   
If you choose to be a prostitute as Maria Magdalena (perhaps for a while, while paying for college), but then clean up your act and stop, wouldn't you as well still go to heaven?   
and what about Judah the fourth son of Jacob, who has sex with his son's widow Tamar who pretended to be a prostitute.... It was a big drama... he wanting to kill Tamar, but admitting being the father of Tamar's twins.... He repented, of course... saving his  , and perhaps now in heaven too.....    
			
			I'm normally pretty liberal when it comes to what women do with their own bodies, but...    
After seeing films like ""Born into Brothels"" (about the forced sex trade in India), it's hard for me to accept prostitution on any level. Because I'm not sure which situation I find more disturbing -- the woman or child who is forced into prostitution by men and/or poverty... or the woman who does it so she can afford a Gucci handbag and who tries to glorify it and convince herself that it's a compliment to be paid for her sexuality.
		    Whuh whuh?       In case of these Roma women, it's difficult because above all, the pimps are usually relatives. 
And it's not that they can go to even-school and start a career in banking. 
I suspect they usually have no education at all - neither have their male relatives. So, it's one of the few jobs they can do and earn money for the family.
		    No, it isn't, because if he is paying for sex, he isn't nice, considerate, respectful and hygienic oriented. He's just a .      I haven't a clue what any of this has to do with the price of fish. Perhaps you should go and find a priest to ask all about it.       Unfortunately Odile, this brings us back to the original post, where the article said that many of these women were introduced into prositution by family members.    
The women may not see it as being ""trafficed"" to Switzerland because of their perception of what is normal,  but that doesn't mean it is not happening. I have no doubt that many of them come from families where, sadly,  females have been abused one way or another for many generations.
		 
			
			Which came first, the chicken or the egg?            Nice in the sense that he is not going to beat up this person or abuse them. just performed a business transaction and pay for a service.   
And regarding the priest.... don't you know your basic bible trivia? classical examples of prostitution offered and used....   
Judah after the act, left his staff and went to get the sheep he agreed to pay. as any nice customer would.   
He got all self-righteously when he found out Tamara was pregnant, but then was confronted with the truth.... he fathered the direct line to Jesus, how holy can that be.... and from an act of prostitution...... (hey, he was also the father in law.... er.... would this also constitute  ?)   
Ok, is late.
		    again basic bible trivia.....
		                  Ha! Sucker!!!    
Any time I've had sex with a sheep, it was for free!      
Jajajajajaja (or Hahahahaha) , You guys are cracking me up.
		    And what if they don't speak German? don't have parents but little  brothers to feed back home?  Of course it may exist some kind of  trafficking for some of them, but i  don't think it's nice to judge  someone ignoring the problems he/she may have.   
Anyway i have more respect for escorts(i don't consider mafia prostitutes,wannabe gold diggers) than for Gold diggers.. You know why?  
Because they know the true value of independence and  they  prefer(or atleast they try) to ""sell"" their body without faking some  kind of love(Gold digger,high maintenance GF/spouse) to live a rich life  doing nothing!!    
p.s: if they work ONLY to afford iphone, fancy shoes or clothes, then it's another story.
		    When i was working as a model, i knew this beautiful brazilian girl who happened to be a friend of my ex GF. I didn't know she was/has been an escort until my GF(who knew about it) discovered she had 90 000+ euros in cash in her house. Of course tax free and all this after only 1,5 year.   She then sent(i don't know how!!!) that money in Brazil to help her family and to open a small business.    
But i suspect, street prostitutes will earn significantly LESS and are more exposed to diseases/crime.
		 
			
			I understand thought the worries expressed by some female members here. 
When waiting for my friend to go clubbing, this Albanian girl approached me and wanted to offer her services. I was(still i am) broke and was engaged too so nothing.    
The next weeks i was waiting there in the same point and i always shared a laugh or smile with her. She was 25 but looked like a 38 years old woman and started to tell me about her life, how she would have loved to come to dance with us, etc..    
Then i saw in a car behind me, a guy who was without any doubt her PIMP. Everytime she serviced her client, she would go in the car, give the money to the guy, and wash herself(she told me that).  I was so sad that night and didn't enjoy at all the party. I wished i could offer her a better life, another opportunity, and of course arrest the pimp.   
I hope the situation in Switzerland is a little better and that many of these girls are not forced -using violence-  into this business.   
p.s: Sorry for my broken English..

		    Even the Swiss ?       And pray how do you know that???      Hey, hey, easy there...      Na....DB doesn't even need words...... you just gotta get it !    
Look a bit closer!      It's not always like that trust me.  
Many many many of these girls/women didn't receive an education or can not work(but have too).   
I think that someone have to grow up in some poverty to understand some of them and how they ended there. And with all due riespect, i think this forum is not the right place for this kind of things because most of its members have always had at least a ""decent"" life and were free to travel and go wherever they wanted(Not everybody come from UK, USA, EUR-the rich part-).    
By the way i'm a guy.   
__ 
I agree with you ONLY if there is some kind of violence(physical or mental) involved between the prostitute and her PIMP.
		 
			
			I have a few good friends from around the world that have moved to Greece to work for an organisation called A21, an organisation that works to abolish modern slavery, ie. human trafficking. One in particular works on the front lines, physically rescuing women from the sex trade. He has told me a few stories, and it is NOT glamorous, not sophisticated, and definitely NOT safe.    
There are so many things that go unnoticed, or unreported. Many women claim to be doing it out of freedom, or whatever, only because they'll be beaten or killed if they say anything about their pimp. Especially because these pimps are more likely than not, ""respectable"" people in society, that work in pimping and trafficking without ANYONE knowing, including their wife and daughters! And it's not just people that don't have any other choice, but to work in that trade (of pimping). A lot of the time these organisations can't go to the police, or government, because they are full of people that are either within the industry, or willing to turn a blind eye for cash (which then makes them part of the industry!).   
Women that are pimped make VERY little money, having to pay their pimps from 2000euros a week, plus the costs of being in a particular location.   
Even though we asked my friend to tell us about it, we all nearly brought up our lunch when he did.
		    What has that got to do with their clients being exploitative, selfish bastards?       The picture doesn't illustrate the article. It's a stock photo.
		    It's when people start using words that this thread goes horribly wrong.
		    I have personal stories of my neighbours(grown women) in Africa who came here in Switzerland when i was a teenager to do this kind of ""job"" for 3 months and go back home with the money for 1/2 years for their family.   
_ 
Whilst i understand worries about the business, but peopel have to ask themselves how is this possible? are they all stupid?   
I know many of them are abused but their PIMP and in that case i agree with you.  
But there is also a lot of these girls who choose to ""work"" like this to have fast money(to invest, feed little brothers, or buy crack i don't know). 
If an alternative existed, many of them would not be in the streets.
		    Fascinating.   
What has that got to do with their clients being exploitative, selfish bastards?
		    I guess that my biggest problem with politics is that I see so many men (even still today) base thier identities prmarily upon thier power (regardless of whether or not they are politicians (or lawyers or bankers)). And so I feel like politics only perpetuates this warped sense of male identity.  Of course, I have no problem with men ""embracing their power,"" but when they exploit their own power in lieu of their intelligence or integrity, then as a man, I am rather offended.   
Sadly, though, many of these men probably come from societies in which the women already expect that of them (according to thier power).  And so they are just victims of thier own culutre (as perhaps we all are).   
But then I guess understanding that allows us to raise above it.      Where's Hoppy when you need her?        Stop wearing your nike shoes, stop using your computer.  
You may not know but you are indirectly ""exploiting"" someone somehere who built your item for 2 francs working in some dark room with no break and lunch. 
_ 
Selfish? i don't get this part.
		    Yeah, because  comparable to the humiliation of being buggered by a businessman in the backstreets of Zurich, isn't it?    
			
			I don't get how you don't get it - really.
		    Seriously... it's not like this..  
I have spoken to plenty of them. Whilst they don't like their job and are ashamed about what they do, they don't have your background and don't come from where you come(don't underestimate this part). 
_ 
You don't get that i don't get it? Give permit to Nigerian prostitutes and they will be the first to open some small business.
		    Is this some new form of gay prostitution. I've seen all the bankers in Armani suits but didn't realise that was their trade.
		    Seriously, it    
I can't believe you are excusing the clients' behaviour because the prostitutes are poor... next you'll be justifying the transatlantic slave trade because, well, we was saving them negroes from gettin' eaten by their neighbours in Africa...       I thought we were talking about the 'selfish' part here.
		    You are talking stupid things and being offensive now.  
Slaves were ""forced"" and i don't know or recall any volunteer between them.  
_ 
Don't confuse things, i am against prostitute slaves and i have said it in all my posts.
		    It would be delightful if you could explain how the fact that many of these women are poor  the clients from being selfish and exploitative.   
Your argument is  comparable to some of the risible arguments made for slavery in the 19th century, whether these girls are ""willing"" or not.
		 
			
			Women don't grow up wanting to be prostitutes. Fathers don't raise their daughters to be prostitutes. And with good reason.    
In every thread like this, you'll see attempts to justify prostitution that use the powerful, confident prostitute who rest assured is surely not being exploited. No, she is a career woman who knows what she wants and gets it. But do you really think this kind of woman represents the average prostitute? No.    
And why would it? It's a system of disadvantage that leads most women into prostitution in the first place. Poverty, abuse, lack of education and the sense that there are no other options all pit prostitution as the way out. Rarely is prostitution a first resort - as I said, women don't grow up with the ambition to be prostitutes. Rather, it's a last resort when no other option seemingly exists. As a crisis volunteer, I saw what welfare and budget cuts did to women who relied on government support. They felt prostitution was the only way to prevent homelessness.   
People like to buy stuff that makes them feel good. They buy a dinner out, they buy a new car or they buy a holiday. So too do they buy sex. But where the dinner, car and holiday don't harm the seller, sex does. Now comes the response citing sweatshops in developing nations. And sure enough, we as a society acknowledge the problems here and have many organizations and movements to eradicate child labor and so forth. Why do we accept prostitution and harm that comes from this commodity though? Should we care less where those prostitutes are adults? In no other profession do we see so many men attempt to justify a type of labor that can clearly cause harm.   
I had a flatmate in his early 30s and married, with a 5-year-old daughter at home. He lives in Zurich weekdays and goes home to Germany on weekends. Little does his wife know he regularly visits prostitutes. It's easy sex. He'd be horrified for his daughter to prostitute herself. But herein lies the crux of otherwise 'moral' men visiting prostitutes. It's pure selfishness. Prostitutes are necessary but my daughter should never be one of them. Let someone else's daughter satisfy the needs of men.   
We talk about the body as though it's so insignificant to the soul. So let's for argument's sake agree that it is. But here's the thing. A prostitute is treated as though she is only her body. She is treated as though she has no soul. And this makes it easier for a pimp or a customer to rationalize violence and abuse of a prostitute.   
I started this with a few thoughts and now it feels like a thesis. In fact, I sound like some sort of feminist even. I dunno - I think my experience supporting prostitutes or women considering the profession has made this subject feel really personal.
		    Explain why you think they are selfish because i don't understand it sorry..
		    Please,don't even dare to compare them.  
Many Afroamerican don't know their origin because of slavery and how it was done.
		 
			
			I know of no little girl and neither do you who grows up wanting to be a prostitute. Everything's relative and there's exploitation everywhere but as a global society I think we need to make a decision about where relative exploitation stops and where absolute exploitation begins. We also need to make a decision about where freedom of choice stops and where freedom of choice in the context of absolute desperation from deprivation begins. Switzerland has so much money, perhaps they should stop making life so comfortable for the pimps who make all this money and start taking care of some of Europe's most vulnerable people.
		    You're determined to avoid the question, aren't you?    
I'll try again: please explain how the fact that many of these women are poor  the clients from being selfish and exploitative.
		    Of course it's comparable. Show me a prostitute who's rolling in cash. Prostitution is done out of desperation, and many prostitutes would be killed if they fled.
		    Well, I would say that having prostitution legal is aimed at getting rid of pimps and violence. To actually recognise that prostitutes are human beings, equal to the same protections as anyone else under law.
		    The very act of prostitution constitutes evidence of failed state protection of the vulnerable. Protection of prostitution is a nonsense. There should be absolutely zero tolerance of prostitution in the same way as there's zero tolerance of child labour.
		 
			
			Popular culture glamourizes prostitution, while in fact it is mostly human trafficking and modern-day slavery. This is a sad fact and a dark shadow of humanity.  
  The social order which allows certain things to happen is a reflection of the human nature in general. Are we, humans, inherently violent? A number of influential thinkers have answered positively to this question.
		    But isn't this about the visisble versus the invisible. 
Every time we go to Langstrasse to get a kebab or shop in the ethnic stores there we see prostitutes, and usually they are the same ones in the same places so after a while we get to recognise them and ask ourselves, who are they? why are they here? what terrible things must have happened to them that they have to do this? are they trafficked or are they here of their own will? will they ever get away and have a normal life? Nobody with a heart can pass them by without thinking such things. They affect us because we see them and know they are for real.   
Now the kids in China and India how make your Adidas shoes and Dolce and Gabana handbags and iPods are not visible in the same way. You may have heard about them but they're distant and more theoretical. It's more difficult to feel emotional about them because you haven't seen them.   
But just because you can't see them, that doesn't affect the right or wrong of it. It's not difficult to not use a prostitute. But it is more difficult to not buy clothes or electronics. There are alternatives, such as fair trade products etc, but these are more expensive. How many people let the budget decide what they buy and ignore the suffering they are supporting?
		    Legally, maybe. Reality, doubtful. It doesn't change that a man is using a woman for her body and nothing else. If he knows her job is legal and there are police involved, he may be less likely to show violence. But that's out of fear, not because he sees her as a human being. Don't assume that less violence stems from a changed perception.
		    Too many. But you point really isn't relevant. Saying that exploitation happens everywhere doesn't excuse exploitation happening anywhere. Some of the worst exploitation imaginable is happening in our own neighbourhoods. We'll get to China when we get to China, but let's start right here by accepting what's unacceptable.
		     
Many children don't want to grow up to clean toilets either, many, many people don't grow up to be what they want to be as kids.  While prostitution has a massive seedy underside that needs to be tackled severely, it's never going to be done by pretending prostitution will go away.  There are women who see it as a quick and easy buck, despite what their fathers might think about it.
		    You are not interested to contribute to this thread but only to be ""right"". 
I know a LOT about this world more than you do(i'm 100% sure) and really   of the prostitutes are ""exploiting"" the rich men, not the other way round.      
They are not all exploited. This was my point. 
_ 
Don't bring slavery in this thread because it's different. My poor English unfortunately don't allow me to write 20000 words papyrus about it.
		    Seems many folk today don't have a heart then...
		    Child labour went away, so could prostitution, if the people that made the laws weren't 60 year old white men who dream of sleeping with 18 year old Eastern European women.
		    What, because all women are vulnerable in the same way as children?
		    Come in Milan and i will show you an ex prostitue who now have many businesses in Brazil.   
p.s: Do you know some men became ""trans"" because the market is BIG?
		    Well, there we are, then.   
Argument won because you know more about the world than what I do.    
Now, how about answering the question?   
Please explain how the fact that many of these women are poor   the clients from being selfish and exploitative.
		    Doesn't any job redce us to one aspect of ourselves.   
Isn't a cashier in a supermarket reduced to her ability to scan codes and handle cash? Does anybody care for her poetry or her philosphical vision?   
Isn't a bus driver reduced to his ability to drive a bus? Does anybody care about the person behind the man behind the wheel?   
Isn't a fund manager reduced to his ability to understand economics and the stock excahnge and to deliver the ebst benefits for his customers? Does anybody care about the other sides of his soul or want to know who he really is?
		    Wait... are we now playing ""I Know more about the underworld than you because I'm from.. X""?   
Coz I'm from Tj, and I tell you those donkeys don't seem happy at all....
		    Cleaning toilets doesn't put a woman and her family at risk the way prostitution does. It doesn't put a woman in a vulnerable position that strongly exposes her to disease, violence and financial exploitation (I can only wait for someone to compare it to a crisis worker in Zimbabwe or a nurse now). It's precisely why arguments trying to rationalize prostitution by attempting to draw comparisons with hated jobs such as cleaning toilets just don't work imho.
		    A 20 year old woman who has sex with people for money is more vulnerable than most children, especially those from supportive families. Your narrow, naive logic is making you blind.
		 
			
			On a side note taken form a quality newspaper-     
			
			I see the word 'exploitation' used a lot in these posts. I also see a common and somewhat fashionable wealthy western view of these women as being 'slaves' or human traffic. The reality is many of these women consciously decide to come and solicit business in Zurich and other wealthy cities - just as almost all of us on this forum do. Perceptions vary hugely depending on life experience, background, personal morality and geography.   
I am aware that there are parts of the world and of society which regard working in the current financial sector, pharmaceuticals industry, tobacco trade etc. as being less morally acceptable, and the employees of such as no less 'exploited' than prostitutes. Yes there is generally a huge stigma in western society surrounding paid sex - but how about turning some of the moral scrutiny on ourselves and our aquaintances and the way we earn our livings? The reality is a lot of it is far from pretty - I would argue that morally dubious undertakings occur on the Bahnhofstrasse as well as Sihlquai.    
As far as the women go I find it easier understanding and empathising with their life decisions and motivations for following this trade than I do trying to understand the thinking (lack of?) of many of their clients.   
Porsitution is not known as the oldest profession for nothing. Make it illegal and it certainly won't cease. At least the way Zurich handles it, if I understand correctly, there are non-profit organisations who offer support to these women which just would not be there if the activity was forced underground.
		    You view is also very narrow.  Why don't you pick a career for her?  Making prostituion illegal is not going to make her any less vulnerable.
		    Not sure about that. Both are vulnerable but a child is vulnerable on a much greater level I would say.
		    exploitative and selfish? i asked you to explain the ""selfish"" part since english is not my first language.
		    No to all of the above. You're missing the point. We still treat these people like human beings. Prostitutes are treated like whores. It's not about wanting to know who somebody is. It's about accepting that they are somebody without knowing anything about them. And a cashier, bus driver and fund manager get this basic human respect in ways that prostitutes do not. Even the police are guilty of this conduct. A beaten prostitute will not garner the same attention and care as a beaten cashier, bus driver or fund manager.   
Treating someone as a human being is not about caring to know all about them. It's respecting that they're someone without needing to know a darn thing. Prostitutes are susceptible to abuse and violence because they aren't seen as more than a body. They're whores, not people. And prostitution as a whole perpetuates stereotypes and treatment of women that shifts them into subservient positions in the home and the workplace (that's a whole extra can of worms though).
		    I'll bite. What about Judah? Well, since we're quoting the   Bible, do you remember why Tamar resorted to prostitution (to just this one man on just one occasion)? I'm sure you do, but since everyone else is dying to know...   it was because Judah was denying her the right to protection that should have been hers. Quick run-down of marital law in ancient Israel: if your husband dies, his brother marries you, so that you will not be destitute or have to resort to... er, prostitution. Tamar had been married to several of Judah's sons, who all died one by one, and Judah was more or less withholding his youngest son from her (afraid he might die too, presumably). So she threw his selfish exploitative behaviour in his face by doing exactly what he was supposed to protect her from. And then showing proof that he was the one who had exploited her. Thus completely ruining his reputation - how's that for knackers in a vice?   
The fact that he repented is neither here nor there when it comes to the fact, as DB said, that people who use prostitutes are . They were in Judah's day and they are now. (Incidentally, if I murdered one of your loved ones but then repented, would that make it ok? Life isn't all about who goes to heaven y'know, so we can leave that aspect out of it.)    
All done. I'm not American, what's the British equivalent of Alabama?       Sorry mate, my toilet is dirty. I was going to have unprotected sex in a dirty room far from my village with a sweaty businessman for 50 francs but I opted to clean the toilet instead. Which is roughly equivalent.
		       
There are plenty of people who make a rational decision to sell their kidneys to organ traders, but that doesn't make the industry  . Some industries are just plain nasty, even if some of the participants are taking part ""willingly"" (whatever that means).   
Rather than wittering on about all these happy prostitutes who are busy exploiting their rich clients to pay for their college education (or whatever), perhaps we ought to focus on the filthy, selfish bastards who are ****ing them for money?   
What about them? Are they absolved of all wrongdoing because the prostitutes are making a killing at their expense?   
Come on, Pullrod, you're a man of the world: justify       Now it works also for men you know.. wealthy women who pay handsome men for their company(like Lady BMW did).
		    Of course it does. However this almost never happens. It's exclusively girls who I see standing on street corners. And you know this. So why obfuscate? Why defend this? Do you have skin in the game?
		    Don't take it personal. I just think you could may be make some new friends to have another perspective.   
_   
About the selfish bastards, most of them last not more than 3 minutes.  
Of course they will find the rude guy, just like you will at your job place. 
Anyway, women know how to fake and men are stupid enough to be fooled.
		    What about ladyboys?    
People who exploit women as clients or pimps are both scum in my opinion.
		    Lol. i have did, i will not be here.  
It's true that most of them are on street corners, but there is also a large part who work at home.     
I'm not jusifying them, i only think if they is no violence and they choose to do that, i see nothing wrong.
		    That's nice for you, are you going throw the ones who opted for the other choice in jail?  Deprive them of legal protection so they can't turn to the police if the client refuses to use a condom? or gets abusive?
		    I don't like the word ""exploit"" associated with client. Because he is a client because he pays. Prostitution exists because clients exist. If you/we want to stop it, you have to take care of the ""clients"".   
p.s: I'm talking about Switzerland and not Thailand or Russia.
		    Funny how much you seem to know about me... do I know you?      Are you missing the point on purpose? It certainly seems that way.   
I'm done discussing this with you. Your childish innocence might be endearing to some, but I can't be bothered with it any more.
		    That's very funny..  and i'm not surprised.. You don't know me, what i have acchieved, and what i have done.  thousands posts or age don't always come with wisdom.
		 
			
			Sorry to go OT, but Pulrod could you please join us on this thread    
Just curious like.   
OK, carry on folks          Are you so sure? There has been so much public debate and emphasising of prostitution that I expect the police to take a beaten prostitute very seriously these days and do everything they can to help her. In fact I think there would be an outcry if a story emerged that they hadn't. There have recently been a number of quite high profile court cases against pimps. I see no evidence of abuse being systematically trivilaised.      You can reduce somebody respectfully but you're still reducing them.   
But maybe you should talk to a cashier and ask how often people don't act respectfully, how many people hurl abuse or try to take advantage. A friend of mine used to work as a store security guard and he says some people do the sickest things.      No, they are susceptible to violence because they deal with people who are primitive and violent. That's not the same thing.      Then you should also ban MTV.
		    uh? you don't get around much do you?    
clue: not everyone who wears girl's clothes in cetain streets is a girl.
		    Three years with Victim Support and many more with other crisis agencies has burned heaps of evidence into my brain.   
Did you ever hear of the Robert Pickton case in Canada? I strongly  recommend you read about it and see how seriously the murder of  prostitutes is taken. Were these women not prostitutes, an aggressive  investigation would have occurred immediately and properly.      You're on a tangent here. The comparisons people are making in attempts to rationalize prostitution are absolutely mind boggling. The level of abuse and violence that prostitutes face regularly (and the system of disadvantage that underpins their work in the first place) is not deserving of the recognition you're giving to a cashier who has a disrespectful customer.    
If you feel that's the case, however, why don't you start a thread to draw attention to the very serious issue of cashier and security guard abuse?    
We aren't simply talking about individual incidents here. We're talking about a widespread perception and system that defines prostitutes as whores rather than human beings. Such a system most certainly does not exist for cashiers and security guards. You're on a micro-level here, I think, and missing the big picture.      Are you for serious? Abusers don't abuse everyone around them. Indeed, they direct their abuse at those they hold contempt for and believe deserve no better. So many functioning abusers are seen as pillars of society in many public capacities but in private they are primitive and violent with those who are vulnerable to people just like them.
		    Freud would have fun with the order of that sentence       Indeed. Nor you me, so let's leave the personal crap out of it from now on, eh?        Not in every instance is an act of prostitution evidence of failed state protection but probably in the general I agree with you.
		 
			
			Made much worse here in Ch but prostitution is still legal for 16 year olds. (changes are on the way, thank goodness). Anybody got 16 year olds daughters who think that they wouldn't be 'damaged' by selling themselves at 16, for whatever reasons, pimped or not?
		    I heard it was just Canton ZH - but I agree it's outrageous.

...these threads started by pointless, rehashed, juvenile, ""cut and paste"" cod-journalism of the worst kind started by The Local......   
....that they will keep doing it, don't you?
		    Well, I for one have always loathed private security of any kind, store or other.  They are scum.      +1, or at least make them return to showing music videos!   
Tom
		    Good day, I dont see at all what makes you so uncomfortable with it? People are and always will be different, some women recognize things beyond their sexuality - some dont. Many people operate on two chakras only and feel happy that way. For the majority of women their sexuality is the only chance to get their rightful position on the scale of values our society has... ""ugly truth"" as it was said here - but nonetheless
		 
			
			I'm surprised no one has touched on the subject of how prostitution can also affect the health of wives, girlfriends, and sexual partners.   
There's never a guarantee that condoms are being used in prostitution so what if a woman contracts an STD from her partner? Mind you that STDs in women can cause infertility and rob her of ever having a family. Plus, male-to-female transmission of STDs are 8 times more likely than reverse.   
We can argue all we want about whether or not prostitution is considered violence toward women, but in the above scenario, it most certainly is.
		    You accuse me of going on a tangent but you cite a case from Canada. If it was relevant in Zürich, why wasn't it brought to trial in Zürich?       That could well be. I was merely responding to the cue that prostitutes are reduced to their bodies, which I consider to be a meaningless statement that people repeat a lot without really thinking what it means, and nothing you have said so far makes me think otherwise.       So what you're saying is that people in general don't like prostitutes very much? I think that's a well known fact that nobody would dispute. The question is what do you want to do about it? Criminalise them or protect them?      I don't really believe these Jeckyll and Hyde scenarios. If somebody is nasty and evil, it generally shows through on all levels. In all these cases where people say ""we would never have thought it of him"" people were usually fooling themselves and closing their eyes to the truth. Prostitution is an extreme form of jungle capitalism in which everything is allowed because it is possible and there is nothing that power and money can't buy. Civilisation is all about taking the jungle out of human beings but there are always dark corners where it creeps back and power and money are dangerous things in that respect. Prostitutes who deliberately seek out the rich and powerful are playing that game to get a share of that money.
		            They just make the initial post and never check back.   
Journalism isn't a two way street.
		     I wanted to give you green for the above comment then I saw the last part - violence is not the same as risk. If one INFECTED partner KNOWINGLY has sex without condoms with another party - as per the recent case in Germany where a female celebrity infected with HIV got off scot free - then the case could be made - otherwise it's a risk involved in engaging in the act.
		    I disagree. If I knowingly have sex without condoms outside of a relationship, yes, there's a risk that I could pass an STD to my partner....and I consider that knowledge of the risk the actual violence.
		    You mean to say there is a way having sex without knowing it?       make money and have sex - thats what life is about? you don't agree?   
ehe he he he he he he
		        The point being that the violence here is also to the wife/girlfriend (who is not aware of the risk of having sex with her long-term partner because she doesn't know he also visits prostitutes), right? I agree. And I have friends to whom it has happened. There's nothing like suddenly discovering you have an STD and you know you've only had sex with your partner of ten years to completely mess you up in every way.
		 
			
			Another great debate caused by the local.   
Would any mods be willing to take bribes to ban this bunch of trolls?
		 
			
			(I thought the local was a bot?)
		    And that has exactly what to do with prostitution?   
Tom
		    This is a globally relevant discussion, no? No need to be anal here. I used an example from a westernized nation because that's best case. Now think about it in third world countries. What part of this thread dictated the discussion should not be taken into a global context, particularly as we're talking about Hungarian workers in Zurich? o_O      Neither per say. Prevent women from becoming prostitutes in the first place. Address the systemic disadvantages that highlight prostitution as the only choice. All the rest - protection and decriminalization are part of a multifaceted strategy that *must* be based on a model of prevention.   
Personally what will I do though? I will continue to support them from a person-centered perspective.      Sure. It's why abusers, pedophiles, thieves, serial killers and the like are so easy to spot. Riiiight.
		    Although I had a chuckle from your comment, yes, there are cases where this happens - people drugged or drunk, recent story about the nurse assaulting female patients under anesthesia, etc.
		    thats right. typical situation: she is at home with children and he is a busy businessman who is always traveling... she is lucky if he is clever and responsible enough to use contraceptives   
otherwise you may get infection at the same time with pregnancy and your child will be born sick and struggle to survive, like it happened to someone i knew...
		    My post prior to that one mentions the connection to prostitution. I was simply disagreeing to a comment on my post.
		    Surely STDs are not only obtained from prostitutes!   
Tom
		    Rightful position??? What is so ""rightful"" about a woman's position in a society in which she values herself and is valued only according to her sexuality?   
This is precisely why I had said that I fear women basing their identities solely on their sexuality only perpetuates the problem.   
Just because something   ""such a way"" doesn't mean it's right and that people should just continue to turn a blind eye to it.
		    As is he if SHE is clever and responsible enough to use contraceptives with all her liaisons (milkman, plumber, etc.)!   
Tom
		    Most of the prostitutes don't kiss, don't allow you to touch their breast, don't perform oral sex without protection(ok not all of them, but ""normal"" girls usually don't request you to wear a condom).   
yes you can catch easily some  diseases from pubic hair, crabs, human papillomavirus and some sort of bacteries. But normal girls are not different.
		    some time ago one of the more trashy gutter newspapers had an article about a travelling businessman whose wife found a packet of condoms in his luggage and filed for a divorce. He pleaded that the had been handed out for free by some anti-AIDS do and that he had no intention of using them. A lot of the cynical comments at the time were saying he was screwed for having tham but would have been screwed for not having them.
		    Woman is not a man, Tom, everybody knows that   
she thinks abt sex much less than a man especially with 3 children on her hands...   
or have you been lucky bumping into women nymphomaniacs?
		 
			
			Isn't this like   or something?   
Oh well, with nothing new to add I'll stir the pot on comma usage.          I was going to ask but I'm resisting the temptation.
		    No, she's much smarter.   
And she knows how to get those men to fix stuff the way she wants.   
I'll let you fill in the dots.
		          You've obviously never been with a monogamous ho.
		    Yes.  
two of my ex GF, but particularly the last. At the beginning she was normal, i don't know what happened, but after few months i could not touch her hair without any consequence.   
Don't think that only men dream about sex everytime.
		    It's your opinion...        Actually it is a question.       Lucky or unlucky, depends on your point of view.    
Why, are there women who are NOT nymphomaniacs?    
Tom
		    That's your mistake.   
Normal women are a waste of time.   
Should I tell you about mine? 
Or would you prefer to hear about this fish I caught yesterday?
		    Well... you work all the time, she does nothing, no kids, only waiting for you to come home and you are so sexy!! these combinations exist, but are exceptional
		    i bet there would be much much more if they could get their hands on handsome sexy guys!
		    Define 'normal'!    
Tom
		 
			
			Ok, if you think you have been exposed  to some kind of ""dangerous"" sexual activity(or blood infection) with a potentially HIV infected partner, there is a treatment  called  .  So go and speak to your doctor.   
Countries have diverse  regulations on this matter and in some cases it's available only for nurses/doctors and girls who have been abused sexually; so i don't know how it works in Switzerland. 
_         
			
			So we're all agreed that prostitution is fine because:  
a) men commit adultery with ""normal women"" anyway and therefore paying to do it is (also) ok, and  
b) women are all nymphomaniacs who cheat on their other halves but are just a whole lot sneakier about it, and  
c) you can catch STDs from anyone you sleep with so it doesn't matter if you pass it on to your other half, and finally 
d) most prostitutes love their jobs and chose it themselves, and it doesn't matter if you can't actually tell which ones didn't.   
Did I miss any?
		    bible says it's ok to be a prostitute. you still go to heaven. 
Which I guess it's good. if people are going to spend eternity there, someone must have some skills.
		    I have experience on cases where women were being trafficked as sex workers.  Some 'friend' of a 'friend' of an 'acquaintance' of 'some guy' will pay their way and promise to cover their food and lodging to get them set up in a ""better life"".  They always travel in pairs, but pretend not to know each other.  In exchange, they understand that they will have to work.  Even though they in the new country as tourists, they think the work is legitimate and honorable -- but somehow don't question whether they need permission to work.  Probably due to the young age.  Perhaps they think they will be working in a restaurant or a grocery store, as examples.  What ends up happening though is that they arrive to a life of indentured servitude as prostitutes.  The guys that are trafficking these women are the scum of the earth, and really they are quite cowardly when confronted with the dehumanizing nature of their craft.     
All that said... I don't think it's necessarily wrong if someone wants to become a prostitute by his or her own free will.  Nor do I think it's wrong if someone wants to patronize one.   That's his or her own morality to deal with -- not mine.  However, when free will and choice are taken away from someone, and the person is indentured and enslaved, that's where it becomes criminal, degrading and outright disgusting.   Prostitution isn't the problem; human trafficking and slavery are.
		    I don't think it works that way. If you are forced you sell your body, you are also forcing your mind to accept that this is what you deserve or what you really are. Emotional and physical abuse go hand in hand in cases of coerced prostitution.    
Unsurprisingly, those women or girls who are abducted or tricked into the prostitution business are, first of all, repeatedly raped and persuaded they are nothing but scum by whoever ""owns"" them. This breaks their will to fight or try to escape. Often their passport or other personal ID document is withheld, and other form of threats (real or simply ""psychological"") are used to keep them in line.    
Of course not all prostitutes are forced into the business. I knew a girl for instance who had been a hooker to pay college. In her case, yes, she really did sell only her body not her mind. To her, it was really nothing but business and having met her later, when she had already given that up, I never thought there was something shameful about her past. She has never given up her dignity. To be honest, I felt nothing but respect for her intelligence, iron will and personality. She was one of the most interesting and intellectually stimulating people I've ever met.
		 
			
			So I wonder how many men give the girl/s a proper interview before the deed- to ensure that they are no trafficked or pimped by bas***d/s- and that they are one of the very few who is happy with their choice.  Or do they think that because 1 in every umpteen 0000s is free willing, it's OK to assume they all are (especially the 16 year olds).
		    I think you are taking the  D biscuit here ! We all know DB is the D......B..........ks when it comes to discusions, but of course you must have known that already since you know more than him.      I've just noticed this, and feel obliged to comment.   
Many years ago, when working in a rough part of Wolverhampton, I was approached by a prostitute looking for 'business'. I was neither broke nor engaged. I politely refused.   
I refused because paying for sex with strangers who  be enjoying it/minting it/writing a book about it/doing it to pay their college fees is wrong - to some extent because most of those strangers are  enjoying it/minting it/writing a book about it/doing it to pay their college fees - but mainly because it's just plain   But absolute morals are a bit unfashionable these days, so I'll leave that argument for a while.   
So... returning to the notion that some of these women might be enjoying it/minting it/writing a book about it/doing it to pay their college fees, could we not argue that, by extension,  is fine, too? After all, many women, supposedly, fantasise about it, enjoy it, want it.   
Never mind that most of them  surely it must be ok, going by the logic used in support of prostitution presented by some people in this thread, no?   
As Odile observed above: if you visit a prostitute, do you interview her first to establish that she's one of these mythical creatures who are enjoying it/minting it/writing a book about it/doing it to pay her college fees, or do you just get down to it without regard for the irritating and inconvenient facts of prostitution?   
I eagerly await your responses.
		       
Those are some words in one of your precendent posts.    You have no intention(as i said before) to contribute to this thread  and are laughing to people who has been involved directly(or indirectly)  with this kind of stuff. Your only intention is to have the last word  and prove that your were/are right.
		    Awkward question for you, eh?       I respond that this is clearly a topic about which you feel very strongly, and you argue very coherently and passionately....but I think we have gone around in circles on the main point several times, and your extrapolations here are getting a touch tenuous to me.   
I see it in a very black and white way   
1. If a woman is having sex with men and being paid for it and it is truly her choice, she is safe, healthy, morally strong and happy, its ok for her to make that choice   
2. If she isn't, it isnt   
3. Since nobody can ever truly know if the first case exists, and since in 99% of cases if probably doesn't....its probably best to not take the risk of condemning the woman to a life of deepening difficulty.
		    I need to take lessons in concise writing from you, old chap.   
Well said.
		    Sorry to interrupt your rutting though.....
		    Well, alright, I'll take the bait.   
Why? Why is it wrong?   
If someone wants to pay me to rub their back, that's fine; if they want to pay me to rub their johnson that's not fine? Or only wrong if I let them put their johnson in a bodily orifice? Why?    
Is this a common decency thing?   
Yes I know there are women who are coerced and forced into a sex slave trade, which is clearly wrong. But someone who turns tricks, pimp or no pimp, because they  - for whatever reasons- they  ; why is it fundamentally wrong to pay them for their services?    
""What father wants his daughter to grow up to be a prostitute?""    
I doubt that any caring father wants that.    
What father wants his child to grow up to foreclose on family homes? What father wants his child to be CEO of a company who shuts down their factory and ships production to a sweatshop in a 3rd world country? I know I know- we can't bring that sh!t into this discussion, not allowed. Wrong. We're talking about sex here. The destruction of families' lives and child labor and all that is another discussion (funny we don't have biannual threads dozens of pages long on those topics  ) So TF what? If someone chooses to offer sex for money, and someone is willing to pay, why is that wrong? On a fundamental level, I ask? Common decency? I suppose? And I'll bet if we get a foreclosure thread going there will be plenty of comments like,'Oh they should have planned ahead, it's not the bank's fault they missed a few payments', or a sweatshop thread,'well, business is business, one has to do what's necessary to compete in a global market'. Yeah yeah. So a chick decides to take a job selling her bod rather than be a cashier at the Relay, now the world is really going rotten. Ha!   
I wouldn't be a customer, I find it distasteful and it turns my stomach. I would probably have reservations about dealing with someone who frequents prostitutes, as I would about many other people, because I find certain things incompatible with my personal moral code. But to declare something simply wrong invites a bit more discussion. So on with the dead horse (which I find delicious BTW, but many others find unacceptable and morally wrong to consume  ).
		 
			
			I realize that the tl;dr effect is great on posts over a few lines and without pics.       
The above is right. I think we all agree.       
The above is wrong. I think we all agree.     
But, is walking past a burning car and  helping the bloke underneath right or wrong? Probably wrong? If paying for sex is wrong, is it not also wrong to not   save the girls on the corner? How much distance is needed to justify inaction?
		    Genuine question: why does it turn your stomach then? I mean, I know  various reasons why it turns mine, but then I also think it's wrong to  pay for sex.  
Other things that turn my stomach include cleaning up vomit and  force-feeding a disabled child (and yes I do both of those periodically) but they both have a yuck-factor that as far as I can  tell isn't present in buying sex.      Of course there will be those comments, but is this thread actually any different? Several people on here have made the same sort of comments about prostitution. And also, this argument in other words says ""people do other dastardly things and some of us probably think those are ok so none of us can take the moral high ground on buying sex"". Um, some people thought the IRA was alright so the rest of us can't really complain about Al Qaeda? Or maybe we could all just get wise about both.       All right, here's one reason: most people in the world agree  that sex is something you give (by your own choice) and that is in some way related to love.  Even people who go in for one night stands will probably expect  faithfulness from their partner when they later have one. Even cheating husbands are horrified to find out that she is cheating too! (And presumably vice versa). Why? You don't expect your partner to  only ever cook for you, and no one else, or only ever talk to you and no  one else, etc. So there   something special about sex, somehow. Maybe it's just evolutionary hardwiring, but it's still there. (Maybe saying murder is wrong is just evolutionary hardwiring too, after all, but we don't argue with that, strangely enough).   
Selling sex makes it cheap, in my view. And 500 dollars an hour is  cheap compared to investing your time and energy into a relationship,  even one that only lasts a few weeks. It's the perks of love (well one  of them anyway) without most of the downsides. Funnily enough, when  people in other areas of life want all the perks without any of the  responsibilities, many of us tend to call them ""scroungers"" or in the case of  CEOs ""b*****ds"" and, yes, consider it wrong. (That is probably a grossly  inadequate comparison but with a toddler pulling on my arm going ""Wii  Fit! Wii Fit!"" it's the best I can do for now).       Good video!   And I agree, it is. Maybe pointing out that using their services is supporting the human trafficking industry, as in this thread, is also part of the active saving? Like someone else said, take away the demand and the supply should eventually dry up. (And none of us know what each of the others is doing about it in real life - perhaps we all run safe houses for ex-prostitutes!)  
Can you suggest some ways people could help? I know of one good place to start:    
			
			I'd happily kill a pimp if I thought I'd get away with it. Why aren't blatant pimps hassled by police more? 
 I get the feeling that if you as a private individual intervened you would end up in prison for a long time. Lets face it, there's no persuading these types of people to start ""being nice"". They're just cold predators. So what is the answer?   
 So far trying to paint prostitution as moral, well, a lot of you are exposing how many assumptions you make in life. Money is not a natural phenomenon so when dealing in moral philosophy it (ironically) has no currency. It's just blackmailing someone to have sex with you, you may as well wave the money in front of them and go ""nah-ah-ah... you know what to do..."" it's sick behaviour. If I find out someone I know uses prostitutes, well, I lose ALL respect for them.  
 Look at the suicide rates amongst prostitutes and porn actors/actresses, FAR higher. The emotional and psychological damage of being consistently treated like an animal... and having to act like you agree is NOT a healthy behaviour and the damage is huge. The only women who see no issue with it are those already so damaged by previous abuse that they cannot feel much of anything anymore anyway. Either than, or they are sociopaths solely concerned with money and for whom physical intimacy is nothing but another commodity. There is of course a big difference between sex slavery and independent call-girls but that doesn't necessitate one is forced to accept the latter as acceptable or moral.   
 An experiment was done with chimps. Rather than simply being given food they were trained to turn a lever in order to earn credits which would then be exchanged for food. The chimps... like our ancestors in the very ancient world, adapted to this slave system quite quickly. A certain gender imbalance began to show however and the foolish scientists couldn't figure it out.   
 The males were becoming very thin and weak whilst the females appeared to be getting fat, the males also seemed to be earning far less credits than the females. Cameras were installed and surprise surprise, rather than turn the lever to earn credits the females had simply invented prostitution, screwing the males in return for credits. Quite hilarious at first but upon reflection a very disturbing experiment.   
 Lesson 1) Money IS the root of all evil. 
 Lesson 2) Men who frequent prostitutes are no better than beasts.
		    I'm not sure whether you aren't confusing cause and effect here. Maybe mentally instable women are more liley to slip into such professions (which is yet another reason to accord them the protection). On a recent business trip I was bored late one night and zapped through the about 1000 TV channels the hotel had on offer and on one there was an interview with an ex-porn actress who told her story of how she got in and how she got out and her apparent total lack of understanding of what was going on was just so embarrassing that I first thought it was some sort of comedy spoof, but it went on for way too long for that and there weren't any punchlines. I really can't magine that any type of work can numb your brains to that extent so can only assume that she was born like that and got easily exploited by hanging out with the wrong folks.
		    In many primate species, sex is not just a means to reproduction but has various other aspects which is why it is so hard-wired into our brains. In polygamous groups, the alpha male gets the most females  and the females associated with him are the higher ranking in the group which is why they compete for his favours. For the females, sex is thus a means to better their own position. The other males get less sex and mostly with the females who aren't attached to the alpha, and if any starts attracting too many females he is a threat to the alpha which is why power struggles ensue.    
Much of our primitive hard wiring has been cached and re-programmed by civilisation and education. But some of the patterns are still there. That is why for example rich and succesful men tend to be more attractive for women (think of Tiger Woods). A woman who trades ethics for riches and decides to become a gold digger is popularly considered a whore, and that's because she's just doing a more sophiscticated version of what a prostitute is doing, ie courting males with low moral values but enough spare cash to get a share of that cash.
		    Uhmm, also, this example seems to show that it's actually men who are the losers in prostitution, not so good for the ""all the women are victims"" argument.  There's always the argument that a lot of anti prostitution vitriol is sheer jealousy and hurt egos.   
I won't deny that a lot of horrible stuff goes on in prostitution, and it needs to stop, but if you think you can police what goes on between 2 (or more) consenting adults, you live in cloud cuckoo land.
		    Comparing murder to selling sex is streeeetching it a little. (the hardwiring bit)   
If I get you right, sex is part of love, and everybody with any common sense or decency agrees. Never had a one night stand have we? Sex on the first date? Did you marry the person?    
Prostitution turns my stomach because, like you, I keep sex in my little life cupboard where I keep love as well. But I wouldn't be so bold as to call sex outside of love, or more specifically sex for sale, as fundamentally wrong. I believe a human should have the right to do whatever they please with their body.
		 
			
			*sigh* You asked, I replied. What's wrong with dissecting a post, you had three points I wanted to answer so I did, I clearly had no points you cared to consider so you didn't, big deal.    
The short answer: It's not such a leap.  
Evolution => murder = bad idea (who deserves it? and who decides that?). 
Evolution => unfaithful partner= bad idea (whose kids am I raising? will he desert my kids for the kids he fathered over there?). It's hardwired into us. 
Or, alternatively, it's something to do with love   
I think most people do link sex to (erotic) love, at least in a long-term involvement (and what I said made actually that perfectly clear, if you read it, it's nothing to do with decency blah de blah). Last time I looked, when you love someone you tend to want to have sex with them and for them not to sleep with someone else (fantasy threesomes excepted). Or maybe I'm just some sort of freak in that regard. But well done for reading my entire post and actually bothering to try to understand what I was getting at.       Most of these Hungarians don't speak any German AFAIK apart from the handful of vocabulary needed for their work.   
Few go there for talking, I imagine....
		    I got you- it's just that, you know, people are different, you know? Lots of people don't want kids. Lots of people don't want to marry. Lots don't want a girlfriend or boyfriend. Lots do want all of the above. Lots frown upon pornography (and then look at it anyway  ), lots frown upon prostitution.    
Ya dig? So it becomes tricky to say something is wrong. Universally fundamentally wrong. Thus the handy visual aids with the burning car. Save man from fire= good. Put man in fire= bad. Hurt children= bad (memories of the 16 year age limit for hookering thread...). Tell people they are not allowed to do something with their body that they choose to... this camper says: bad.
		    Well, I certainly won't deny that there seems to be a correlation between politics and ""prostitution""    (especially when considering campaign funds...)
		    I would say personal choice. I personally would be directing rescue efforts from a safe distance because I just can't risk my loved ones ending up without me. I commend the people on their bravery though.
		    Uh? Your failure to cite a case relevant to Zürich would seem to support my argument that Zürich police do take it seriously. The fact that your example doesn't come from anywhere remotely near Zürich but had to come from Canada would suggest an extreme paucity of better examples and hence strengthen my argument rather than yours.       Statistically speaking and percentage-wise, there are extremely few people in those categories (except thieves, but I don't don't see how they are relevant here). That is why they hit the news in such a big way when they do. When a paedophile gets caught the press can go on for weeks. If a burglar gets caught it probably won't make the newspapers at all. It's the extreme rarity of the event that makes the newsworthiness. But apart from that, my original statement was that prostitutes get abuse becuase they deal with absuve and primitive people. I don't know how your diversion here proves me wrong. So I really don't know where this argument is taking you.
		    ah, a politician.
		 
			
			Visiting a prostitute is wrong for the same reason that shagging a hopelessly drunk woman is wrong: you cannot be sure that any consent given is informed consent, freely given.
		    All you need to know...           What about : I have total respect for the person who does several low paying menial labour jobs rather than engage in this practice. My Mum helps the kids of prostitutes and a more abused and neglected bunch of souls I've yet to encounter.
		 
			
			Sorry but this bites right back to that thread you started on Religion, commerce....     
In which you stated ""if there is a demand for something, someone will offer it.  It doesn't matter what the product is...""   
So, here again we have a legal industry, as I pointed out in the other thread even with underage prostitution (16-17 years), and people bring out morals, religion, or whatever to counteract it.  On the other hand, rape, I believe is illegal.            What about the handicapped and people who otherwise have liitle to zero chance of ever getting casual sex or starting a relationship. Aren't prostitutes providing a service there? In Holland health insurance will even contribute towards the costs of the service in certain situations.   
I would say it's morally wrong for people in a relationship to visit a prostitute. But for others the argument is weaker. Just because some or many are slaves, does this mean that it must be that way. Isn't this a problem for the law and the police to sort out? Slaves used to pick cotton but cotton wasn't outlawed because of it.
		    That is excellently observed, but I don't think we can really compare kosher chocolate to an industry which is founded on the abuse of women, can we?
		    Here we go again.....      DB, you should know EF is like the Red Queen, and we have barely passed breakfast...
		 
			
			Some of us were hoping (yes I know - how naive) that in the 21st Century commerce would be about 'things and services' not about 'people'. Yes I know, many will consider prostitution a service - but for me primarily it is about people - and just another form of slavery. Slavery to drugs too, or even for some who choose to do so, slavery to label consumerism (Gucci bags and luxury goods).
		    Isn't the whole concept of consumer capitalism about being enslaved to desires that somebody else is putting into your head?   
That's why I don't have a TV.
		            Isn't the whole concept of religion about being enslaved to ideals that somebody else is putting in your head?      Some people could also say that making woman wear a full headscarf in public is the abuse of women as well.
		    and therefore consumerism is a religion?
		    ... because having to wear a bit of cloth on your head is comparable to being buggered by a businessman in the backstreets of Zurich, isn't it?
		 
			
			Isn't this what the movie the Whistleblower was all about in Bosnia? (trafficking) with alleged UN complicity via their outsourced employees?   
One issue is the local attitudes where they come from and prospects.   
Another is the legality in Kt. ZH for 16 year olds to sell themselves here legally. (But let's focus on muslim buildings eh?)   
Additionally the fact that rates for ""tricks"" here are high, and there's a lot of ""repeat business"" amongst the local population, therefore a business case.   
Also the lack of enforcement of existing laws on the street vs. legal studios.   
Finally the credit given for the new boxes like in Holland in the area just socializes it all.    
I guess the Swiss are happy for the market to decide. Morality is personal, if you have a choice/employment alternatives.   
Would it be effective for frequent roundups to check on trafficking? Or is the flood too great?
		    Facing being beaten (if not killed) by your father and brothers for refusing to wear the heardscarf may be comparable though.   
Yes, and there are also women who wear headscarves because they are making a political statement or researching a book etc etc. 
There may also be some who don't care one way or the other but wear them because they always have.   
Can you extrapolate from individual cases to the majority?
		    You know, I'm sure that if the SVP launched a campaign to stop it all we'd have people on this forum moaning about how that is so racist against Roma and Hungarians.
		 
			
			How can we end up comparing a headscarf with prostitution is belong my understanding....   
Only seen on EF.   
Beaten up a woman, for what matter the reason: To wear a headscarf, because an other man talk to her or because she didn't cook his steak enough is one thing that concern all women in the world no matter religion, culture and origin.   
Prostitution compared with headscarf only is lazy and ''The Local'' mindset of provoquing an empty debate.   
Why no comparing Prostitution with a married woman beat up by a jealous husband? Right, it doesn't bring the same drama into the debate than adding the good old religious card.      "	242	Hungarian sex workers flooding to Zurich	14144

			Not close enough to the city centre?  Their businesses taking a hit?
		 
			
			CHF 2.4 M to erect a row of sheds in the middle of wasteground    
			
			Huh huh huh...they said 'erection'.       Somebody's getting screwed.            Equations of the Modern Age

		    EZ in 
EZ out                   
			
			They want people to climb on top of these & vote on referendums from there?
		    Was this sentence written by a native speaker of English?    
			
			I am always   amazed that the SVP always, always, manages to think the impossible! I always have an opposite opinion to these people.    
The sex stalls work in other countries, everyone is happy there, so why, oh why, does the SVP have to spoil everything?    
We had a thread on EF describing how the street ladies were crapping in peoples gardens as their pimps wouldn't let them take the time to find a toilet. These stalls raise their dignity and give the street ladies more protection. Once the city of Zurich get the stalls they can ban prostitution from the streets, or will the SVP object to that as well?
		    It's called a wind-up.   
It's what SVP are best at.
		 
			
			Well, looks like the SVP have got things in hand, and will be putting up stiff opposition.      
I've also heard rumours that there's a big back passage connecting them all.    
I haven't heard anything about the ""sex stalls"", tho'...     
			
			Oh great, another thread to discuss the morals of prostitution...and with the added benefit of the SVP thrown in for more spin. This could get interesting.
		    Now we only need to find a way to start a threaed covering all those topics plus brown sugar and salaries, all combined.   
The ensuing meltdown would cause the EF to implode and form a black hole.
		    Or from a runaway satellite.
		     I'm confused. Are they toilets?
		    There was an old fart from Mirfield, who groaned a young man from Basel. When questioned he said, I fell outta bed      Just in case you were serious... the stalls are like a Swiss car wash. You pick up the lady from nearby, drive in, do the business in relative comfort, drop the lady off and take the mess home with you. It protects the lady from the customer, but not from the pimp.    
There are probably police cameras watching out for dangerous situations, so if anyone is murdered they have the car number plate and the driver on video.
		    Then here's my donation to the melée...          So you pay them to crap in your car so you can clean up the mess. Interesting. 
Whats to stop the bus load of tourists taking pictures.
		     Oh thanks ... that was my laugh out loud for today!   
The videos ........ what came into my head reading that was ..... oh oh ......  what if they make their way onto the commercial market .....?     
I have this mental image also of the police ""checking"" those videos ........
		    and any good action gets sold on the porn channels, so generating extra income for the police?
		    Put up a Dönercart and name it the chew & screw.
		       Sorry, old chap.  Finger trouble.  (I'm getting old, you know)
		    Or the Binge And M-aybe I'll get my coat, shall I?      .   .      ah, a purveyor of hot meat.
		 
			
			According to my dictionary a stall is: sudden loss of lift that results in a downward plunge. Is that when she takes her bra off ?
		 
			
			I wonder, if they have problems building the stalls if it will be termed an 'erectile dysfunction'....  The Local really is good for a giggle.
		 
			
			does there have to be a prostitute in the party or can any couple, trio or group wanting to find a place to shag use these stalls?
		    are you suggesting an EF event?
		    I wonder how they handle queues if the stalls are all occupied; & how long are people willing to wait & able to maintain their ....... enthusiasm.

			Poorly researched (not to say ""copy pasted"" ahem article, ahem).   
What the author should know (well, if she had researched instead of Ctrl-C Ctrl-V ing the article that is) is that   justice cannot sentence you to   jail time unless a prosecution is made by a civilian prosecutor in a civilian court at the request of military authorities. She should also know that military justice is free so the soldier could have appealed any military gaol sentencing by his CO with no financial implications.   
Load of bollox article as one would expect from the Blick.
		    Hm, are you sure? I know we never have been explained the complete rules, but a company commander can issue a ""disziplinarstrafe"" - if that happens at the end of the service, one has to do the time after the service.. or so I remember. In that case one would have to appeal to the commander for a review   
Military justice is only involved for heaver offences, no?
		    Military commanders have no saying over your civilian life. If your marching order releases you by day such and such they have no business keeping you. Unless maybe if you're in hospital or have killed someone.   
Disziplinarstrafen involving gaol can be contested by means of military justice. What the recruit originally complained about was that he didn't do it because ""he can't afford it"" - another indication of piss-poor research (haha, research... it's the blick i forgot) as military justice is free.

			In unrelated news, I'm thinking about organising my first EF event. The theme will be ""Baseball Bats and Balaclavas"" and you are expected to come in a suitable outfit. It will be held on Saturday night, let's say 11ish, at my place in Zurich. It's the big building that says ""Central"" on the top. Just loiter with intent until I show up to let you in.
		 
			
			The spontaneous riots are actually   weekend.    
The riots of the last two weekends have merely been practice riots.
		    In that case they must have stolen all of 200 grams of beef, just enough for one steak...like your thinking Adrian of london, so true.

			Switzerland has maintained its position as the richest country in the world, according to the Allianz Global Wealth Report 2011, which estimates Swiss residents' personal wealth at almost 207,400 (250,113 francs, $286,215).            So is that total wealth? Including property etc? Does not seem that much does it? Just saying cause I got million CHF burning a hole in my pocket.
		    Considering most people don't have any property...it's a whole lot
		    So on average Swiss have approximately $290k saved up you say?
		    I never said that no
		    What you saying then?       Wouldn't seem all that surprising, to be honest. Your pillar 2 contributions will grow fairly quickly over the course of 10 or 20 years.
		    By adding contributions rather than investment growth.   
They seem to have left out Luxembourg , a friend tells me is richer per capita then CH.   
Does Monaco & Andora not count?
		    A wealthy entity does not always hold all of it's/his/hers wealth within the entity's country of residence, so the referenced statistic likely is based on wealth held within the country by residences. If the statistic is based solely on the county's citizens, you will get still a different figure.
		    Are you sure they just don't take figures from tax returns, which no doubt are hugely understated here.
		    Are you sure they just don't take figures from tax returns, which no doubt are hugely understated here.   
In any case many assets held by banks here are foreign stocks, I just don't believe they could separate accurately.
		 
			
			I continue to fail to understand why would anyone give any relevance to such kind of number. I mean, the average. An average is worth nothing, if 9 guys have 1 franc and one has 2,499,991, on average each person has 250,000. Wow, great. I would rather use the mode or the median, but that might be asking too much to a journalist       Is that Swiss RESIDENTS or Swiss CITIZENS, because there's a big difference between the two.
		 
			
			I fail to understand how those figures are found. 
To get a precise idea, you would need to compare the comparable.   
The world's richest country does not = the highest consumer purchasing power.. or does it ?   
The Big Mac index seems more relevant in assessing a population's wealth (or lack of) via the purchasing power per capita.   
Seems to me that once you take in consideration the high cost of living (rent food, insurance etc), people are not wealthy at all, just average.... or at least not the common mortals.

			I have yet to meet any Swiss person who will admit how many guns they have. They are not texans. Typically every man in CH has a gun or two that he tells no one about. Its not something they brag about. 26% sounds like a low figure to me.
		    from my purely anecdotal experience that would seem about right, actually. most of the men i know in the urban areas when they get out of the service return their weapons to the arsenal and are glad to be rid of them. But oh you should hear about the one uncle they have on a farm out in glarus who has his, his father's and his grandfather's in a safe and goes up to the ranges on the weekends... i could well imagine, like in the US, that its based on lifestyle: the urban swissys probably dont have firearms in the same numbers that the rural people do.   
i collected old rifles from ww1 and 2 in the US and was connected with the collector circuit there; the infrastructure here for collecting seems much less advanced and despite the relatively low barriers to entry seems to be a relatively seldom hobby here. but perhaps since i live in the urban areas myself this is kind of andecdotal as well, perhaps if i lived out in a more rural area there would be more of them about.

Dear The Local,    
Having read your article, I think you should explain to your ""reporter""  
Tanya Hogan that, in English, the phrase ""more and more"" does not  
mean the same as ""shooting up"".   
kind regards  
   WJ
		    But shooting down would inevitably take out her foot. Which she wouldn't.............     
............oh she already has.
		 
			
			Mommy! Mommy! 
There's a Swiss hiding under my bed...       People with guns should not be ""shooting up"". Drugs are baaaad.
		 
			
			Just joined this forum (literally) and read your response.  Thanks for the laugh! 
Imagine if everyone who owned guns were shooting up!  YIKES!  he he... 
Had no idea there are people in Switzerland trying to increase regulation surrounding gun ownership.  I always thought of Switzerland as the last, great bastion of truly uninhibited gun ownership. 
I can see that this website will prove very enlightening! 
And as you can read on the bumpers of many pickup trucks out here in the western US,  ""When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns"".

			That wasn't referring directly at you at all!!  
You'd want to see me when I really burst out! 
Lots of people use references to the most famous Swiss charachter in the most famous Swiss novel.  
And there is an area of interest to the tourist referred to as Heidiland!    
But I was talking about the endless threads started on this forum referring to gun ownership.   (and perhaps you know that?)   
			
			Dear Mabern - I apologize for misunderstanding your remarks....  Call ME paranoid!     
As I just joined, I didn't realize that threads on this site regarding gun ownership were frequent and getting harder to stomach - Good heavens - I didn't think there WERE any gun ownership ""issues"" there!  So much for what I know....  Gun control is a HUGE issue here in the US these days, so finding an article on gun ownership being on the rise in Switzerland of course immediately aroused my curiosity.   
My name really IS Heidi and my Great-Grandparents were from Einsiedeln.  Hoping to get over for an extended stay in the future.   
Joining this group is a small reconnaissance mission on my part.  Info about learning Einsiedeln's Swiss German dialect is what I'm shooting for.  (FORGIVE the pun - he he - sorry, couldn't resist.  )  Do I understand correctly that it is its own language?

We've been able to get the product ""Frosty Paws"" ice-cream treat for dogs in the US for YEARS. So, this is not news...    
What would make it news (but inaccurate) would be IF it had been made by someone else and now Nestlé is carrying it ""too"" or ""instead"" or perhaps Nestlé took over that company and decided to continue producing it or whatever... that would make it (semi) news.   
Signed, 
Peg, the pedantic today.     
Oh, and another thing.. Why does The Local ""care,"" or think we in Switzerland care, what Nestlé sells in the US (and exclusively so) anyhow?
		 
			
			to answer your question Peg,   
coz it's A Bot.       
			
			Gads Frosty Paws' been around for ages!  Its kinda messy though.     
I think the ""lactose intollerant"" was a bit inaccurate, too, as most mammals become lactose intollerant in adulthood.    
Now that's a news story... lac operon genetics..... mmmm.
		    I realize it is a bot that is taking it from their ""newspaper"" and posting it here but why was the story included as part of their current news in the first place? That's more along the line of what I'm questioning.
		    coz Local admins are Bots too???        
Well if the OP had actually read the article, he would be see there is no point in posting this here. The article states: ""However, only American dogs will get to taste these ice-creams, which are only distributed in the United States at the moment.""

			Swiss political parties and labour organisations remain divided over whether or not to ratify an International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention that offers more comprehensive maternity leave protection for working mothers.   
As the curtain fell on the national consultation process on Wednesday, left parties and trade unions emerged as supporters of the move, while conservative parties and employers oppose ratification.   
The ILO Convention 183 secures maternity leave for all employed women, including those working in atypical employment conditions.   
Opponents say Swiss law already fulfils the vast majority of internationally agreed maternity leave requirements.   
Since July 1st 2005, 60 years after maternity benefit was first enshrined in the Swiss constitution, all women in employment in Switzerland qualify for a minimum of 14 weeks maternity leave at 80 percent of their normal salary.    
However, ratification of the ILO convention would mean extending payment to 16 weeks. It would also require pushing through a legislative amendment.             
			
			Sadly, this could potentially cause more discrimination against women in the workplace since they'll ultimately be too expensive if they're considering children.   
Is this total maternity leave before   after birth? If so, it would be great if there was a bit more - maybe extending it with a lower salary percentage. Some women have difficulty working after 7 months and it takes about 6 weeks after birth for a woman's body to normalize. Then there's the breastfeeding issue.....   
I'd like to see more paternity leave offered too. My husband will only get one day to go and register the birth - um, I'd rather he stay with me on that one day. And what if it takes longer than a day for labor & delivery? It's a juggle with his holidays since he needs to schedule them in advance so it's very possible he could be faced with having to be at work or being with me for delivery. Hoping his employer will be generous at the time.
		 
			
			I dont know if I would call it discrimination against women. But I will say it supports an influx of immigration. If the birth rate drops because people cant afford kids then the only answer is immigration. Unless you want to turn the country into Japan (who has been in recession since 1990)...
		    Here, maternity leave only kicks in after the birth.  If you need to stop working prior to the birth it comes under sick leave.  In some ways this is better than the UK because your maternity leave starts ticking from when you stop working.
		    If that's the case then I do find it to be already quite generous. And I do think it will lead to more discrimination against women in the workplace. Germany is already facing this challenge as more and more women are choosing either a career or family, but not both.   
As one former female German colleague put it: ""If you're between 20 and 40, you might have children so you're expensive. And if you're over 40, you're too old to hire.""
		    The irony is that the SVP wants the best of both worlds, lower immigration but no proper support to encourage Swiss population growth.  They can't have it both ways...
		    are you sure? My friend stopped 2 weeks before due date and those 2 weeks were part of her maternity as she chose to - as i saw it you can work right up to due date as I have seen some women do and if you're not feeling well then the doctor will sign you off and then yes it will be sick pay - but if you chose to finish at any time before due date then it does eat into your leave
		 
			
			Well...coming from a system that in the name of supporting birth rates gives 4yr of paid maternity leave for chicks, with kid's health insurance paid till 26, I can safely say, while it may boost nation's population numbers, it is not so conducive to chick's career and independence. On the other hand, while women might be expensive to hire because of this, their salaries are lower than guys', so perhaps, it evens out..Who knows.
		    Yep, sorry - thanks for the clarification.  I meant if you are signed off by the doctor.
		 
			
			Oh please, all of this for an 2 extra weeks! COME ON! Pathetic.
		 
			
			Some dude at UniGe ran a study a few years back about Swiss ladies and how late in pregnancy they push for work, resulting apparently in high number of preemies. He warned (the research was in our local papers, and I know WRS also reported it, there might be a program in Health Matters archives, still) that while we worry about impact of obesity, smoking and drinking on babies, we ignore the fact these moms here work just until they deliver, more than in the rest of the Europe. I wonder if it is because life here is so expensive, who knows. CH also has older ladies giving birth to their 1st kid, it may have something to do with it, too (again, I heard those stats from WRS, Health Matters and Kids in Mind are great programs).
		 
			
			Scandinavia has very generous parental leaves and least discrimination against women in the job market. So no, one does not necessarily lead to another.    
The difference is a proper child care system after this leave though - if your employee just takes a break, it's manageable. If the child care is inadequately organized (not only kindergartens, swiss school hours are impossible) and/or horrendously expensive, then many employees will disappear from the job market after they have had kids. And this is what leads to discrimination.
		 
			
			My opinion would be that the paid maternity leave offers virtually nothing to counterbalance the excruciating cost of childcare in Zurich...and the pressure to return to work 'full time' is very different to where I come from - in Australia there's not much 'paid parental leave' but there is a guarantee that you can have your job back after 12 months (which can start during pregnancy, often around 6 months...) - and the pressure is on employers to provide flexible work arrangements (part-time, jobsharing etc). Whilst off work, low income earners get access to government payments towards the cost of raising a child - not a bad deal in my experience - although living on minimum income is quite a challenge at the best of times...   
I would rather see more support for flexible, subsidised childcare, and the security of having a job back after 12 months, with a push to provide part-time and flexible work, than payment of maternity leave from the employer...   
On the other hand, in other countries, access to maternity leave of any sort, is a human rights issue, and being able to take perhaps the final 8 weeks and the first 8 weeks after birth, has a big impact on infant and maternal mortality...   
I worked right up to the due date with my third child, but it was by choice, with a supportive employer, and mostly done working from home with my feet up.       It does have a lot of very generous benefits for families, including paternal leave up to six months in some countries (which studies have shown many don't take advantage of due to fear of damaging their careers in some way), but I know a lot of women, particularly expat women, who had a difficulty finding or changing jobs when in the range of childbearing years because not only do the employers have to keep a position for the women up to 3 years after having a child they also have to pay for her replacement while on leave. AND the woman can stack those years together if she has another child. I knew a woman who had 5 years maternity leave when having two children spaced apart, 2.5 of those years were at some fraction of pay. Of course, the level of taxation there is far, far greater than here to help pay for all that, but it does lead an employer to weigh hiring a woman much more carefully, especially if there's an equally qualified man. It might not be discrimination in the traditional sense, but it does present a hurdle for hiring and advancement.   
Even with all the benefits offered to families though, the birth rate is still fairly low which also supports the problem that, even with leave and easy access to child care and excellent education, it's difficult to have both a family and pursue a career.
		    The reasons for their financial issues being completely unrelated to immigration.    
			
			We have stackable maternity leave, and with 4 years, and more kids...  Leaves businesses having to pay for replacements, and not being able to hire brand new staff due to holding work places for their preggo/maternity leave women. Gov just started to issue extra gov bonds...Socialist it still is, great for kids and extended nursing, but still leaves families with lower income, frustrated ladies, but happy kids. I don't know. Old school. Gov pays a sum after delivery, for giving our country a brand new baby. Then you get special child money every month, you have free health insurance if you take care of your kid and stay at home, too. But population is still dicreasing hard core. It's still difficult to juggle all. Plus those who do decide to mix work and having kids, are always branded as incompetent moms.
		    I think that it depens on company policy, at my work you can leave up to 6 weeks before your due date but some other places might not ???
		    Here you also get military service for the young men. The young ladies are maybe off work for 4-6 months in a year having a baby once/twice/maybe 3 or 4 times in their career but the young men are off for weeks at a time doing military service     year.   
The article is talking about just 2 extra weeks of maternity leave. Big deal. What's great here is being able to add on your holiday and take sick leave before the birth instead of eating into your maternity leave (unless you have a specific workplace maternity agreement). My doctor was very tough though on signing ladies off - I needed preterm-labor.
		    they are not just off for a few months though. for many women, the childcare problems and school hours make it pretty much impossible to work for many years - there are several threads about it here on EF as well.
		 
			
			While absence is absence for an employer, obviously, being home due to being incapacitated through labor and all, and taking a few weeks off every year to go shooting and boot camping is incomparable. Those are two completely different country services..Army here gives you great opportunity to network, career-wise. Staying out of work to take care of babies gives you nada, career-wise. I just cannot see maternity through uber pragmatic filter. I think it is a societal duty to take care of their moms and babes. And not push moms to work too early, but also enable moms to go reconnect with their career. I would fix day care situ first, since it is just blackmailing families, then offer better maternity leave and paternity, too.
		    There are plenty of mum's working in full and part-time positions that don't find it a problem. There's kinderkrippe that are open all day and for school there are supervised lunches (Mittagtisch) and after school care at an Ort. I work with a few mums, one who commutes from Zurich and another from Luzern. There are many mums who   to work and just get on with it.
		    This is not strictly true. In our area, for example, there is NO Krippe, and we can't go to surrounding ones because they give priority to their own residents. Add the waiting list to the priority list, to the extra fees for not being resident and you need to be a banker to make it work. School supervision offers 10 places for the entire community and costs 80 sfr per day. Have one child in school, and another in Krippe, and you're paying 230 sfr per day for child care.  
IMO it doesn't matter how much you need to work. It matters how high level your job is, how wealthy the area you live in is, etc. I know several women who need to work in our area. They can't afford to have children, and don't have any.
		    I think the point being made was that the employer needs to replace the staff in both cases. At the end of the day if you're missing from work than you're missing from work whatever the reason.
		    Wait..shock...you could move to where there is a kinderkrippe and more after school places. A colleague that has no choice but to work moved recently so her son could easily walk home from school. She was widowed with a 2 year old.    
I was the only earner when my second child was born. I applied for a kinderkrippe place well in advance and had to change my son's kinderkrippe to a different town. I'm not a banker, yet it works. I always knew we would have to pay child care costs living away from our family and child care is our biggest expense.
		    But it is an immense challenge, especially for folks just relocating and struggling to figure out how it all works.   
What do you do for child share for the kids old enough to be at school, but not old enough to be alone, over the school holidays?
		    On the subject of daycare, i.e. pre-school Krippe, the alternative (which I know many mums do, myself included) was to find a daycare near to where you work.  You don't need one just round the corner from where you live - it's actually better having one round the corner from your office.      We just signed up for ""Ferienhort"" holiday care for the October half term.  Apparently they do all sorts of stuff; go on outings, try out new activities, etc.
		    When I say someone can't afford 230 sfr per day in child care, or 130-50 for one baby, I'm talking about women who earn less than that and would lose money by working and paying for child care. The same women may find it difficult to move to an area with more services, and thus higher rent.  
That is why I say they don't have children because they need to work. I appreciate your demographic, but not all women in Switzerland have the same mobility as others.
		 
			
			I work for a Dutch organisation and they give the husbands / partners with Kids Daddy Days, I am not sure whether this is one day off per week or one day off per two weeks. How about introducing that in Switzerland      There are many holiday camps that take the kids all day. My son spent 1 week on a farm where they had activites every day. One day they dug up potatoes, washed them, made potato stamps and pictures with them and the kids all had some potatoes to bring home for dinner - he loved that. The farm also did daily horse riding, as it was usually just a horse riding place that offered holiday camps. CHF 80 a day including horseriding is a bargain IMO. The geminde or school would be the places to ask about what your area has during the holidays. Look in the local paper or just use Google.
		 
			
			the best way to promote female equality in the workplace is to enforce mandatory equal maternity and paternity leave so that both husband and wife MUST leave work for a certain period when the baby is due.   
then there's no reason to favour men over women in the workplace (except that men are more awesome).
		    The commune does not even know how many they will have free for next year, how should parents then know where to move to (it's not easy to terminate all contracts, like work contract, renting, etc.) in order to find that specific area with enough child care places, and a few years ahead since the lists are often 2-3 years long, and when you enter, there are hundres ahead of you (who will me moved up quicker, since they work in the commune/or are single/or have low income). Flexibility means different things, to locals, to new comers, to different communes, etc.       If you happen to be a sole earner with 2 parent family (extra sets of hands for pick ups or chaufering kids to their day cares, or sitting, even), or owning your own place, that will also make things easier, or should people have their families near, without necessarily having to be a banker.    
Sometimes things work, sometimes they do not, and not because people do not plan well, but because they may have been here only shortly or they happen to decide to have kids without giving themselves enough time to match the day care years long waiting lists. The day care situ in my opinion in this country is penalizing moms.
		    It must be different conditions in different cantons - here in Zurich city, any child in state school has a place at a lunchtime and afternoon care and holiday coverage.
		    Are you sure?  My understanding was that Gemeinde has to offer a Hort, not guarantee a place for all children.
		    Absolutely, that was my point. Not all conditions are the same here, and not all people can flock together in that particularly user friendly ZU commune (I want, haha, for sure). Conditions are not only different in cantons, but from a part of town to another part of town. Moving might be a solution, but when a family is busy keeping a job and figuring out the expenses, contract that have super long cancelling periods, it gets tricky. I have a feeling it will become similar in many regions, in order to promote mobility and keep unemployments rates down, but it just takes time. And, people without family and network have it the hardest.
		    I also applied for a spot in Krippe well ahead of my second daughter's birth.  I applied BEFORE I went to the doctor (I was all of 6 weeks pregs).  I also had priority as a woman working 100% at the ETH (it's the ETH krippe) with a husband working 100% at the ETH and a child already attending the same krippe 100%.   
I got a full-time spot for dear daughter...when she turned 1 year old.   
So, yeah, it works,  but it isn't easy!
		    Depends where you are.  This is Zurich city I am referring to.   
It doesn't apply to the whole canton, however, hence the reason we are NOT moving from our place at any price...       Well, I   going to thank you on your post.....until that last bit           That's a relief-I guess I'm not moving out into the country either!   "	37	Swiss divided over maternity leave upgrade	2963

			A German etiquette group has divided opinion with its calls for a ban on greeting kisses  in the workplace, which it labels ""too private, too intimate, and too unprofessional"".   
The recommendations come from the influential Essen-based Knigge-Gesellschaft, an etiquette association whose pronouncements are followed with interest by German speakers in several countries, including Switzerland.   
But not everybody is enamoured with the group's rules of workplace disengagement. In an opinion piece published by the Tages Anzeiger newspaper, Annett Altvater from online magazine Clack.ch takes issue with the calls for osculatory restraint.     
“If the greeting kiss in the workplace is to be banned, it seems like we have been afflicted with a prudish American ‘cover your ass’ campaign.”   
In these recessionary times, the association is trying to lay down the law, arguing that tactful behaviour in the workplace has become fashionable again.             
			
			Depends , although I do object to my male boss sticking the tongue in.
		    There are several studies that show kissing spreads fewer germs & viruses than shaking hands.
		 
			
			...and then there's the one kiss? two kisses? three kisses? dilemma...
		 
			
			I think ""bots"" should be banned.
		    Maybe...But just who is this secret poster ? Is it a Mod , or an Editor or another Forum member ?
		    Not sure why you should - you may learn something...   
But then again, from my experience, women do kiss better than men.   
*edit*.. sh*t(!!) now i've oversalted the spaghetti sauce(!!) dam you       & where to plant them.......
		    aw well... if you can't beat em...   
I've always been a fan of the ""aussie kiss"" ..it's like a french kiss... but....
		    Hmmm...how did you find that gem out ?
		 
			
			Liquid spills in the corridor could severely ruin your day in case you slip.   
On that basis, I'd say that condoms are a must when fornicating on your desk or the photocopier.
		    would that then apply to the fax machine as well?
		 
			
			Is this about kissing arse?
		    well by extensive testing, of course. And I agree with the statement.
		 
			
			If they ban kissing, what about sex in the toilets at lunchtime? Work could get really tedious without any distractions.
		 
			
			Ah, the joys of telecommuting....   
			
			Personally I hate the whole kissing thing.  I refuse to do it.  If men would greet me at the office this way I might feel differently about it, but usually they only greet the women this way, and I feel left out.
		    You might like the French part better!
		 
			
			I find the kissing thing bit too sensual. I feel as if I am cheating on my girl by kissing other girls       Aren't you confusing that with shagging ?
		 
			
			I dont like it either and usually somehow avoid it. especially 3 damn.
		    I usually find to start with kissing & the shagging follows!
		    Must be a fun place to work...
		    Yes but cleaning the photocopier can be tedious...............
		 
			
			Kissing should never be banned  
And it's a good thing we're in Europe, it would be so boring to spend your life politely shaking hands as they do on the other side of the pond.
		    but?   
It requires a small aperitif consisting of 10 pints of lager first ...... 
Good night      
			
			I prefer tokiss than shaking hands. Beurk! You don't know what the person touched with those...
		 
			
			If kissing stays, we gotta clear up the issue about which side to kiss first - I've had a few accidentally end up in mad passionate French kissing.
		    Fibber.   
(which is apparently too short *sigh*)
		 
			
			Can't stand the three kissing myself.
		    Agreed. We don't need that American political correctness over here, and the kissing helps make it feel ""culturally different"" here from back in the States, thus interesting.   
Although, when I was new here, I did misinterpret the kissing thing once or twice. Worked out pretty well though.       ... but you are sure where their lips have been?
		    Indeed.  I've seen broken noses resulting from such confusion.
		    Lips could have been used to shine cheesy helmets   Just saying.
		     
Careful, we'll be back on the herpes subject soon.
		    How is a culturally different form of greeting considered 'politically correct'. People in the US and in the UK have been shaking hands for quite a bit longer than that. Is bowing, then, as is done in Japan, also considered 'politically correct' or is it 'cool and culturally interesting' because it's not American or British?       But you feel reassured about where their mouth has been?   Not to mention all of those people with bad teeth and bad breath?  blech.  There are some people I can't even bear to sit next to their breath is so horrible.
		 
			
			I much prefer the British way.  A vague nod in someone's direction, while mumbling ""wrt"".
		    Ya doing it wrong, KF.  You don't meet with mouth to mouth kissing, it's just cheek to cheek with a squeaky kiss noise on each side.   
Cheeks aren't normally laden with bacteria, are they?
		    Two in Italy, three in Ticino (really).   
Tom
		    Then you should work in Italy, men do kiss other men there (yes, even straight ones).

			Those communists knew how to do it:          Communists?

		    Dow Low Brothas'
		    And four if you are hip are living near Paris...
		 
			
			Who cares what they think. I would give em a Glasgow Kiss. That would shut them up.
		    Banning it is a bit harsh - but I've always found those Swiss ""brother and sister kisses"" to be highly disgusting and am abstaining from participating in those.
		    Well let me ask you this then...do you have a Swiss brother or sister?
		    Ummm, no, actually that would be a  .    
Tom
		 
			
			The real cheesy situation is asking a question when you 3-kiss: 
How...kiss...do...kiss...you...kiss...do?
		 
			
			Definitely not a social kisser---especially in the work place---that's sexual harassment! Also not a office hugger same deal.   
But having to adapt to 'social norms' I find myself uncomfortably doing it more....just gotta watch out for the herp!
		    How do you figure that?    
Tom
		     
Because that's how it's defined in North America, and I've worked primarily there for most of my life and that's what I'm used to. If I go back and expect me kissing co-workers to be accepted, I can expect to be cited for sexual harassment, fired and with possible legal consequences.
		    And what about offering to briefly hold your cow-orkers' hands?           Or handily hold their briefs.      Any unprofessional physical contact is a faux-pas for me at the work place.    
By professional, I define it as hand shake. Perhaps in extreme cases, the hand shake with secondary arm grab for emphasis-but that's already running into borderline areas.
		    Well, last time I looked we aren't in NA, so how it is viewed in NA is of no consequence.   
Hell, we have one client who stops by with her family, and even her kids come for kisses! (I shake her husband's hand, though)   
Tom
		    North America doesn't give a flying f about how we define things here. Conversely why should we?
		     
Sexual harrassment in the workplace has nothing to do with geographical generalizations. It has to do with coworkers feeling comfortable to get their work done.    
It's fairly ignorant and disrespectful if you believe you can go kissing people in you office at random. Especially in a country where there are so many expats.   
And it goes both ways too.       
This is Europe Angela, this is allowed, stop being such a freak!!!!
		    And thank the gods that we don't have to work there!!!  Constant PC bull.  Makes me want to go       Maybe you should suggest burkhas and hijabs as standard office dress. To prevent anything untowards from happening, you know.
		    So many?   
Hell, the largest group is from a kissing-country (Italy)!   
People from stuck-up NA are definitely the minority (in fact, in 25 years I've never worked with one  ).   
Tom
		     
So you're inferring that the way someone dresses is an invitation for physical contact and kissing and the such?       
Very true, but I guess North American's are a bit more respectful of different opinions and beliefs--and would rather make up such absolute rules (yes I agree that they are a bit extreme) so that all can feel comfortable and accepted. We all know from many threads that the swiss are not very good at this at all.   
Where are the limits? though? If a new co worker would 'whip it out' and start playing with it, and defend it saying, at his last place of work this was acceptable, and I should just continue working without any hesitation---I would be uncomfortable, and my productivity would be affected.
		    No, not at all, but I did expect this inflamatory PC reply. After all it is you who infer kissing as a greeting can be construed as sexual - not me.       And how do they respect the century-old European habit of kissing? By trying to ban it and equating it with sexual harassment? You ""think"" you are ""respectful"" because you have been brainwashed into it. Fact is we've been kissing each other's cheeks for quite a while here, and nobody seems to feel harassed, nor instantly attach perverted sexual meaning to pretty much anything one might do in his/her day to day life.      If you equate a perfunctory ceremonial kiss with lewd exposure then there is really nothing to discuss, is it.
		    Again, many don't find it sexual or personal but many do have a bit of extended 'personal space' (I really don't think 'nobdy feels harrassed') and again, I'm not disrespectful enough to infringe on their boundaries. Plus if someone comes at me with a herpy attack (or an upcoming one) am I expected to contract a viral disease just because it's a century-old tradition? Will I be treated the same way if half way through the approach, I push the person away?    
Would I go up to a stranger and kiss them hello? Not acceptable. Can I go up to a stranger and shake their hand---never had a problem with it.   
on the same level, you consider my extreme example to be lewd (yes, I do too)---So do other cultures when they see kissing in a place of work.
		 
			
			I think some people are doing this greeting thing wrong. If you watch its more kind of a hug a pretend kiss on the cheek. No lips or tongues involved. Your more likely to catch something from shaking someone by the hand as they have been shaking somthing else and not washing their hands.       
This shaking hands being dirtier than the face proof has been going around a few times. But most things you can get from shaking hands, you will also get from opening doors, using common computers, pens, tools. These items don't normally come in contact with the face very often.
		    So instead of simply abstaining from such practices there should be a general ban?    
			
			Let the BCBG show you how to do this kissing thing properly           You don't live in another culture. You expect us to conform to the North American culture - fair enough if this were North America.
		     
Well this is where it does get a bit more complicated.  
I'm not a fan of absolute bans---because, then where are the limits. But there is the discussion that: Some people will feel uncomfortable with it (being forced into the greeting ritual or being excluded from the greeting ritual) and you will get a loss of productivity from them. Or, if it is banned, will this have an effect on productivity.   
My end opinion is that if you allow it, problems might arise, if you ban it, there will be less (if any) of a negative effect to the company's bottom line.
		     
I don't expect europeans to conform to other cultures, but I do think it shows respect and sophistication if one requires workers from another culture, to makes steps and ensure they are content and happy. The happy worker is the productive worker.
		 
			
			*shudders at the thought of sexually harassing granny all those years*
		 
			
			Im off to invest in Oxygen tents. Safe in my own bubble.
		    As opposed to respectful and sophisticated North American employers who go to amazing lengths to conform to other cultures and make their workers happy and productive? Ha ha.
		    Well yeah, there's a bottom line, there's standard rules to be applied. There are pros and cons of each decision. You make the rule on the side of the excess pros. That's how responsible, logical and successful decisions are made.
		 
			
			Am I right in thinking then, that if you saw two colleagues kiss a greeting while you were all working in a US office, you would be obligated to report one or both of them for sexual harrassment?
		    Personal discretion would come into play for sure. But that's the reason for an outright ban. If you saw it, and all workers are aware of the rules in place, you could conclude that either they are both breaking the non-kissing rule, or one person was focibly kissing the other (which could be considered sexual harassment).    
Being obligated to rat on your co-workers is not a standard rule across the working world from my experience. But if you wanted to be that diligent workers, you could report it to HR, they would investigate. If it was a simple euro-style greeting consentual by both, they would be reminded of the 'non-kissing' rule (or whatever first infraction dicipline is). If the investingation (really just a quick chat with parties involved) showed that one instigated the 'kiss' and the other uncomforably complied out of fear, or whatever..then further steps are to be taken.   
If there was no 'non-kissing' rule, the second situation could go over looked very often causing all sorts of issues to the victim on a psycological level. Not good for business.
		    The limits are when as a man you have to climb out of an elevator if you are alone because a woman climbs in. (As per published as advise in American anti-sexual harassment handbooks.)   
The limits are when you make your culture so bland to be as politically correct that vanilla is considered too scary a flavour at work as it could be sexually provocative.   
The limits are when you can't meet people half way but expect everybody to follow your way because it is the least obtrusive possible thing to do.   
The limits are when the Swiss change their culture to put up with American litigious nature and politically correct bull shite!
		    I sense you have a long, bitter history not shared by many others.
		    Yes, I am English.  Okay and I tend to rant.       
I agree with all these points, it is not a perfect system by any means. In the american working culture I feel the exact same way (but obviously I comply professionally). The difference comes down to protecting the single possiblity that someone in the 'unlikely' situation, where definite harassement happens, is protected.  
Yes, you are right, the litiguous nature of North America produces some questionable byproducts of such general rules, but when/if you are the victim of true sexual harassment, culture, country and corporation are irrelavant, because you have been violated, and the psychological effects of such are not easily fixed with a payoff or settlement. The after-effects can possibly last for years with many further negative side effects to yourself and those around you.
		     
But culturally kissing friends is not really an American thing. I don't find it so hard to work in American office, we don't go around not trying to offend anyone, it just comes naturally that you do things differently in the office than not in the office. But most of it is obvious, like not telling a female co-worker how attractive they look in a dress. You hear silly rules but it is mostly common sense. Act like you would around your conservative grandparents and you will be okay. And don't make steretypical comments about nationalities, things like that. Just basic common courtesy.   
I heard things in Swiss offices that would not be said in an American office. Basically, lockerroom talk is what we would call it. Obviously the legal system is far from perfect here, there are too many lawyers who need to make an income.
		    Very true--and I understand it is a european thing (although I've met many in Switzerland and in Europe who aren't comfortable with it), my point was just that if a company has the requirements to hire numerous North Americans (or other backgrounds of course), they need to make regulations such that they are receiving the maximum work quality of said employees. If they're all Swiss, or European or are all cool with a big work orgy (yes, this is obviously an exaggeration for poetic emphasis) go for it and prosper!. But if a company needs employees who happen to come with with different beliefs and interpersonal interaction boundaries, they should try their best to respect them and keep the business flowing smoothly.
		 
			
			I cant't be bothered to read this thread. I wouldn't kiss any of my office colleagues under any circumstances. end-of.
		 
			
			We aren't doing a particularly good job of ignoring threads generated by The Local, are we?? I think it won't stop if we respond so enthusiastically!
		 
			
			I don't have a problem with other people greeting each other however they see fit in the workplace. I am not clear why an NAer would be uncomfortable with that, if they don't want to participate that is fine.
		     
5 pages isn't close to enough  !!   
My placebo (homeopathy  ) thread went a good 14 pages AND Godwin status, all with circular, redudant arguements       Hahahaha! So what excess pros does excess PC foster and encourage? The decision has only one pro as far as those who signed it are concerned - fear of litigation. If you really think US companies do it to keep the employees happy, keeping a account of ""excess pros"" and that it is a ""responsible, logical and successful decision"" then obviously you haven't been much on the decision-making side so far.
		    Alas, the last time I worked for a company that had more than one person of North American descent (i.e. ME), it was in NA!    
Tom   
P.S. Legally speaking, I am a Swiss of North-American descent!
		     
Litigation is a very serious con. As I mentioned it's a comparison of pros and cons. Yes, the pros are not huge but relative to ruining a person's live coupled with litigation, it's a no brainer.    
Successful companies in the US and world wide, follow such ideology, just because media hounds like to sensationalize poor corporate decisions, doesn't mean that the entire corporate world is the same. It just feeds the fools who read the generic media and build regional generalizations from such garbage. I've been on the decision making-side for well over a decade now, and the companies I've worked with have all prospered regardless of competition or 'financial crisis/recession' simply by making logical decisions base on best overall outcome. It's really not my fault that I associate and work with people and companies who can reach their bottom line goals without victimizing others....you would probably have heard of them, but again, that doesn't make good media headlines. Respect for others and success are not mutually exclusive.
		    I think that gave rise to the "" "" warnings on McD's apple pies and other bleedin' obvious advice, didn't it..?       So boring, yet over-excitable?
		     
I'm also Swiss of North American Decent. Where I work now, there are very few Swiss (albeit extremely intelligent ones).   
The 'NA' rules of 'sexual harrassment' definitely don't apply here at the same extreme level--but definitely moving in that direction year by year. Things do seem fine---but the rares issues that these extreme rules protect are very often hidden. Perhaps contributing to the higher sucide rates I hear about here.
		    I have six motorcycles than can exceed the Swiss speed limit in first gear!    
If I were excitable, I wouldn't have a license!    
Tom
		    I fell over the other day, and exceeded the Swiss speed limit...
		 
			
			dunno about everyone, but i personally like the 3 swiss kisses on the cheeks. fewer germs than handshakes <---something i learned in haiti during the height of the cholera epidemic.
		 
			
			The French just kiss the air.. no germs there.      So people of NA descent are boring and over-excitable ?  
How many have you met ?       Tom, if you've haven't met any like yourself (Swiss of NA descent) you don't get out much.. There's lots of us     
Anyway.... the European way is so much better. The attention and appreciation, the chivalry, the polite consideration for women. In the US, holding the door disappeared with Grandpa, as for a warm 2-kiss hello, it's just unheard of !    
Now everybody in the NA seem to hug.... which seems quite strange to me. It's rather new isn't it ?
		 
			
			I don't mind the pseudo hugs, I really prefer a nice, professional and strong hand shake..but I dislike the pseudo kisses. Hugs and handshakes are for everybody, but only chicks get bothered with the pseudo kisses. It's too long, and...well, pseudo    
Nose rubbing, much more interesting.

baiser /verb   
after one of them wrote 'les Français baisent partout, meme dans la rue'   
(wanted to say 'The French kiss everywhere, even in the street' but said 
'The French   fu** everywhere ..)
		    That's what he told  , anyway...    
			
			So you're inferring that the way someone dresses is an invitation for physical contact and kissing and the such?   
I know it's one of the many things I am thinking of before I get dressed and spray on 130 CHF cologne instead of wearing pure body sweat.   
And just for the record, I find the birka's and head dresses to be kinda' hot. Leaves more to the imagination, so I don't think just because you are more covered makes you less kiss-able.
		    You might have to explain that one to me...              I think this, and all these citations on North American so-called conservative PC-ness is ridiculous, and I really don't see how it has anything to do with what a poll in Germany is all about.    
The kiss on the check, in any country, isn't supposed to be a slobber or an attempt to slip the tongue in, and people know that. It can be awkward for Americans to be challenged with something we aren't used to, but I think that goes the same everywhere.   
In France when I offer a hand shake instead of the peck on the cheek, it can be an awkward moment in reverse, but it amounts to about the same for the polite kiss in the states.    
And to be fair, in the US, men, whether at the office or outside offer each other FAR more bear hugs, then any other culture, and I know when I would give relatives in France or Italy the hug, I know they felt weirded out by it, and would feel far more comfortable with a kiss on the cheek or the mouth-also between guys.   
Why is it because every time there is an issue in europe or Switzerland it naturally reverts back to USA cultural bashing even though the USA has nothing to do with the original topic?   
It's all cultural differences...I know far more men in back in the states at work and out of work slapping each other on the ass when they are happy about whatever, and while it's not a kiss, it's still cupage.
		             
For example

		    It's the pre-emptive strike so that your own pathetic culture isn't attacked.       The thing with the first lady is you kind of expect her to have kissed a LOT of other guys before she gives you the same exact look she gave them.   
Now, we could also assume she is yours and only and dress up like this for your own pleasure.    
Which one you'll prefer?   
The second lady seems like a very conservative woman. But take the Burka off and she may be a wild lion in the bedroom ready to give you the best shag a man can dream of.   
My point? Don't judge by the cover.
		    I am not sure what kind of  setting you would think about hello kissing a lady dressed like this...
		    I'm working on it...bear with me.
		    I think there are many  'Professionals' settings in CH that will cater for you!
		    CV sent by PM.
		    Got your PM. Are you sure the skirt will fit  ?
		    mirfiled in a skirt?    
What's going on today...Well, anyways, don't forget this thread is useless without pics.       I know. It was a rhetorical Q.       Yes, but were you in first gear?    Is there any proof that she is a lady?  Looks all woman to me.       
			
			Colin, that's just  
to each his own, but the gent really should consider a decent support brassiere !   
Nil, both the pictures and the interpretation bring up an interesting point: 
- they're not being considered/discussed from a woman's point of view, but from a man's 
- men seem to have more difficulty with female sensuality than women do. It either becomes an issue to control, or one to demonstrate.
		    Oh thank you, I am sleep easier now in my complacent culture.
		    It wasn't the specific 'you', it was the generic 'you'.    
			
			I don't like it. You start with one, like a good friends or family and I like to give them a hug, but then this line forms with some people you really don't want to kiss, but you know that if you don't they'll get upset. You can wash your hands, you can't keep washing your face.
		    Huh, why not?  Wash hands, wash face at the same time.  Works every freaking time for me.
		    Um, wait. Trying to figure out the logistics of this. Climbs in? Like in a stalled elevator? Why would anyone do that? Have I got it wrong?       Do you also get the make up running all over?           No, I don't plaster gunk all over my skin.    But you raise a very good eeeeewww point of view....that women don't wash thier faces during the day.  Gross, I now know which side of the fence I sit when it comes to the kissing thing.  Handshakes will be it for the girls from now on.      My girlfriend's lawyer's secretary is generally dressed like that!    
Tom
		 
			
			I was wondering whether to post here or not.   
I don't know about you guys, but during the common day, my face is usually not in dirty places that would demand a thorough washing like hands do...   
Coming from a country where a woman very rarely greats with a hand shake, it has been quite difficult for me to deny 25 years of kiss on the cheek ""hello"" or ""goodbye"".   
Kissing on the cheek greeting is an art, has different variations, most of which there is no contact between lips and cheek itself. This horror of ""not being able to wash your face"" is completly alien to me. Which cheek are you actually thinking about and how exactly do you think a cheek kiss is done? You do know there is not tonguing, right?      
People on Thursday nights in the Viadukt already know it freaks me out to shake hands when saying hello. To my culture, and as a woman, it's like an insult. It means I mistrust/ am disgusted/ am creeped out by you.   
Good think sexual harrassment rules change from country to country!
		    I was also wondering what the big to-do was all about.  I guess this is the outcome of the super-clean, disinfecting generation that we have become.  I watched a documentary quite a few months back and it featured a woman who did an experiment where she didn't wash or bathe herself for 8 weeks.  She had kids and was allowed to wear gloves when preparing their food or dealing with medical issues for them but otherwise not.   
After 8 weeks they took swabs from her from a range of areas (hands, feet, hair, armpits, etc) but they couldn't find bacteria on her in sufficient quantities to cause harm to herself or anyone else.   
We share door handles and all sorts of stuff on a daily basis where hundreds of people have touched or sneezed or coughed.  It's only if someone is actually ill with some kind of transferable sickness that we run the risk of getting sick and even then it has to get through our frontline defences.   
We weren't equipped with an immune system for nothing!  Although some of us seem to be intent on destroying it with a constant obsession of removing any kind of bacteria from our person and immediate area.
		    Which, of course, makes one MORE susceptible to disease as one won't build up anti-bodies!   
Tom
		 
			
			For me it is not about catching a bug from a door handle that freaks me out, it is to know that someone goes to the bathroom and doesn't wash his hands after.    
You'll be surprise how much poo and pee they found on hands after a study on the subject. I don't remember which documentary it was on ITV4.   
And people go around and spray their urinations and defecations all over the place.       
			
			There is a complete disregard for cleanliness   
and   
There is an obsessive approach to cleanliness   
Both are equally as bad in their own ways.
		 
			
			I suppose it is a cultural thing.  In many Muslim countries  women and men are not even supposed to shake hands. One of the biggest insults is to be offered the left hand. I hate the act of a cheek proffered in expectation of kiss in the wind, it seems so pretentious to me. If I like someone I'll kiss them. If not Ill just say hello.
		          hmmm, something about ""when in Rome.......""   
Of course when I am working in Riyadh, I would never dream of even talking to a woman let alone trying to shake her hand or kiss her on the cheek.  In Thailand you put your hands together and bow.  In England shake hands.  In some cultures kiss on the cheek.   
Don't like the local customs, I would suggest that living somewhere else would be a good idea as telling people that thier local traditions are pretentious can result in them being quite offended.  I know I would be.
		    OK, Ill try. 
Maybe I should start a new political party based on office etiquette like the one which wants to ban power point presentations in favour of white board 
. I haven't figured out how to paste links on my phone, but google and you'll find it if interested
		       
Don't get me started on that....lol.   
Sorry        
I'm not too familiar with many foreign workplaces, but I have heard that in some oriental countries, the short bow/nod is the respectful way---I personally think that's a very good standard to adopt.
		     
now how about smartboards--they are essentially white :P
		    Sorry, once again, why would we (I am going to include myself as a resident trying to integrate) want to adopt some practice or peice of culture from the other side of the planet.  What is wrong with the culture and practices here?   
I love the bowing when I am there, I love the kissing when I am here.  Diversity is a GOOD thing!!!!!       
For culture in the country--do as the country wants. No issues there.   
I'm considering in an international workplace, which has to cater to various foreign workers with different cultural expectations. Certain rules of conduct need to put in place if your country can't seem to find enough workers from your own culture.
		    I would......
		    Why?   
I don't see the need for incessent rule making, policy making and law making.   
Surely it is best that the culture of the location of the office is followed?  That is the culture that is going to be on the street around the office.  Why does there have to be a different culture at work and on the street or in public?   
I don't treat my friends, family, shop assistant, bank manager or co-workers with any less respect than anybody else....do you?
		    Would what?       
Seriously?   
you think people should conduct themselves the sameway on the streets as in the office?   
I drink beer happily on the streets. If I did that at work, a good part of Zurich would be in danger.
		 
			
			I have a former co-worker who was always on Face-Book.... All of the other people in the office were on it too and had him as an online friend.    
People started to notice that he would get really REEEAAALLLLYYYYY nasty stuff from his gal pals online (mainly women he met at the bar the weekend before).   
They would post stuff on his wall (he has perhaps 1000 friends) like: Why dont you f__k me in the A__ with your big black C___K.....        
Literally it would be EVERY DAY and it would be multiple women. He was eventually fired for ""distracting co-workers"" as it was the part of the morning work load to check his homepage on face-book.    
Some of the really bad ones were kept for "" training purposes"" when new employees ask ""why cant we have face-book pages?""    
Office etiquette can be on many different levels. It should all revolve around keeping your personal life private though.
		    We have beer in the office as do most Swiss company canteens.  The consequence of behaving like a larger lout at work is that you get fired.  The consquences of behaving like a larger lout on the streets is that you could get arrested, thrown out of the place you are in or run over by a tram (realistic Swiss scenario).   But really, sorry, beer is not the issue of discussion, is it?  Respect, traditions and culture are.  Keep in mind that in Russia you would not be allowed to get down to serious business before having a shot of vodka.   
Yes, I think that you should behave with a very similar amount of respect in and out of the office.  My office is a fun environment.  I dress differently when I am working in the office than I do for formal meetings or client visits, just as I dress differently depending on where I am going in my private life.   
I still don't see why we need all of these rules to make ensure, guarentee, promise and legislate that nobody from a different culture is offended by what may happen at work that is part of a everyday culture where the office is based.      Wow!!!!!  Where is the culture in the world where that is acceptable?   
Can you tell me why we do???  What benefit do they bring other than catering to the fact that somebody does not want to adopt local customs and fit in with the people that choose to live and work with?
		    But E F is OK?   
There is a new law on the U S which bans teachers from having facebook contact with students. I decided to do that myself before the law. 
But back on topic, research shows that it pays career wise to follow office etiquette, even copying your boss, unless you have enough influence to instigate change
		    He was offended that the boss didnt like it! He was very mad. But he is from Belgium and said that it was normal there? Of course this was when I was working in London and the English have a different opinion of whats acceptable. He is now gainfully employed at an Italian firm   According to his cousin (who runs our office in Goma) he is still at it with the ladies.
		    He's not on ef... Im basically retired to be honest. I work for my former employer when I feel like it. I have a couple offices with no co-workers. So I use EF from time to time to kill the silence       There are significant efforts to overturn the states where that law has been implimented as it is seen as creating artificial barriers between students and teachers and does not help the situation at all.  Just another example of legaslative madness winning out over common sense, common decency and society have expectations about how our neighbours behave.      He was offended?  Fair enough surely if the people at the office were offended they should have unfriended him.  I do that to anybody who consistantly posts religious stuff that winds me up.   
The point is that I would not behave like that on my facebook page anyway because I have friends and family that it would offend.  There is an air gap between my two lives but that is generally because I don't want to misrepresent my company in my own opinions, not because I am embarressed or having anything to hide from the public or work.   
Nobody has been able to explain to yet why we should create rules or change behaviour that may in some silly way offend a minority.   
I find over legislation, too many rules and gross stupidity offensive.  I don't see people changing that for me anytime soon and thusly moved to Switzerland where I tend to find less of those things.
		    But I think its just self control. I dont want to see people in the street kisses, let alone the office. People need self control or else the government will try to control it.
		    What is wrong with people kissing?  I think you would find that you are in a very small minority of people that are offended by other people kissing, be it on the streets, at work or at home.  I very much doubt that the people of this country are ever going to have a referendum where banning kissing got passed.   
Please remember that the government in this country do not get to arbitarily create all sorts of controls.  Those are put in place by the people or got rid of by the people.
		     
Nothing wrong with people kissing---although it might make some uncomfortable.   
But regardless of how one feels about it, generally it's on a different personal level than a handshake--for many, this can be an invasion of personal space...same with handshaking, but not as extreme.
		    Again the ""workplace has to cater"" utopia. I can tell you exactly what ""the international workplace"" will tell you - you don't like it, bugger off. Most of Europe doesn't care one way or the other about the kissing thing - you shouldn't be too hard to replace.
		     
Well apparently if they're hiring non-swiss non-eu employees, it hasn't been the easiest position to fill.   
A responsible workplace should cater (yes, most don't), if they keep their workers happy, they will get better work out of them--not all employers follow such idealogy, but the ones who implement it properly are usually very successful.
		    AAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH   
The whole point that I am trying to make here is that kissing on the cheek here is not on a different level than shaking a hand to the  .  Just because it is different for you does not mean that it is different for everybody else, and   why should we make laws or     a   that something is different when the majority don't think it is???   
Put it to a referendum....but I doubt you will be able to gather the already very small number of signatures to get the ball rolling on this one.....although you might actually improve people's humour as I think most of the folks you ask on the street will have a good laugh when you put this one to them.
		     
This is where I dissagree.    
If one were to walk into a playground and greet a child with the 3 'air kiss' how will people react? If one did the same with a handshake, would it get the same reaction?   
As comfortable as most seem to claim with the kissing----there's no denying that it lies in a higher level of personal interaction than a handshake.
		 
			
			...meanwhile, what are the norms for exchanging pleasantries in EF gatherings? is there a secret handshake? kissing, touching, licking, ...?
		    Co-worker's 3 year old comes bounding into the office the other day. Here I am a total stranger in a new office. Kid runs up and presents cheek for a kiss.  I am like, uuuuuuuuuuuuummmm what the hell does cute kid want. Father grins at me and shows, give him a kiss on the cheek, it is the French way.   
Kid is happy as Larry afterwards, father smiles, I smile....I think I made a friend (the kid that is)   
Anyway, stop trying to wriggle out of this one.  Not much formal work action going on at the playground and a hell of a lot more fart jokes, at least that is what my office is like.  At the same time I think we were talking about the work place which is somewhere that other than the above situation that I don't often have to interact with anybody who is not considdered of the conenting adult age and can make thier own decisions about kiss or shake...      Buying the member with more posts a beer.        
Good point. I would like to think the same---unfortunately I hear far too many stories here of new female workers who feel obligated to partake in these rituals and are extremely uncomfortable just before, during and after.   
I don't have the same uncomfort level as they do, but I try to take a bit of empathy and try to imagine a work setting where my boundaries were over-stepped. For sake of arguement, it would be very extreme, but if it still bothered me weeks after, I would hope my employers would takes steps to improve the situation.
		    mmmm..er..no 
just lots of kind, compassionate care and friendship 
EFers are a rather polite bunch
		     
In my experience, it's usually a proscht! or cheers of the alcoholic beverage.....but again, this would also be unacceptable in a work place      really? there are so many threads, where people growl at each other. i would have though, the meetings would be a place where they settle their disputes.. vendetta, duels and stuff ;-)
		       
I feel obligated to be offended when somebody tries to shove some religious bull crap like Christmas down my throat, but I don't make it their problem or demand that it be removed from the local traditions.   
I mean come on, in the fairness of equality and equal rights, the majority have an equal right to their rituals. Nobody is forcing anybody else to take part. They may not feel you don't fit in if you don't but then they have a perfectly valid point and it is their country.       
All these stories you hear, please tell me more. I am fascinated as I never hear any of them except for sometimes from expats on Internet forums. I have certainly never heard one in the work place.      Once again, not in most European companies that I have worked for where an occasional beer over lunch or a beer or two in the evenings with your co-workers is not only considdered to be traditional but also helps build great teams and good work environments.      Wet kippers at 40 paces is another fair standard.
		 
			
			Hi,   
I am not totally sure if the kisses should be banned from the workplace because that would depend on the culture of each worker.   
Arigato
		    I agree. If you work at a whore-house you should keep kissing..... It might hurt business otherwise.      Indeed, which is why my private corner office looks like this:           
Tom

its not 10,000 bankers, its 10,000 bank jobs, thats everything from cleaners up
		    That is quite a naive viewpoint.  The vast majority of any cuts will be back office staff.  The aim will be to influence the share price by reducing the liability in the salary bill. In the medium term this will make little difference in actual spend as the work will be covered by contractors.     
The overpaid group you mention will still be there  .
		 
			
			Oh, another ""The Local"" thread drumming up a storm.  I wonder if this one will be as much of a tea-cup event as the end of days hail, thunder, lighting and calamity that we were expecting from Friday?

Not too much need for Murdoch style reporting here I don't think.  If you at the local are reading this, perhaps you could try and be a sensible paper???
		    What's with this ""user"" local who only posts links about ""actuality"" which we are already debating for weeks?     
Incredible news: 
Exclusivity!!    here:     
Anyway is not a kind of spam or unwanted attention?   
Edit: ha I see it's some kind of newspaper ""linked"" with English Forum... ha business, business...   
PS: You don't have any ""fresh news"" rather than the 2 week old thing?
		    Unless those back office staff are on big salaries, it won't make a huge  difference, I expect that whole trading desks will go along with the overpaid #ankers.
		    1. I don't think most of the back or middle office are on huge salaries, at least in my experience. 
2. It may make a big difference to those people who loose thier jobs and thier families and the communities that they live in.      I generally find that a trading desk that is loosing money will be shut down no questions asked but one that makes profit stands no chance of being shut down.  Imagine that, economics and logic at work in the banking sector.      With bank's taking less risks, many desks won't have enough at risk to make the big profits they were. True at GS, so I am sure the smaller players will suffer as well.
		    Yes, profit must be viewed over the long term and calculated with the risk at the same time.  That is correct.  A desk that runs at very high risk may not seen to be profitable over the long term and may get shut down.   
By the way, I don't want to get into an ethical discussion about banking as that is a whole other can of worms but why do you call them overpaid?   
How much profit do you make for your organisation?  I have generally found with traders that the salaries are very reasonable, possibly even low compared to some fields, and bonuses are based on say a nominal percentage of the profit that they bring to the organisation.  The more you profit you make, the more money you take home.   
How does this equate to being overpaid?
		    What I object to is in a downturn, when the bank makes a loss then large bonus's still get paid, they are not related to profitability. They are not taking any personal risk, it's a win ¨- win situation.   
If bonus's were paid after the shareholders were paid out for their risk taking, I would be perfective happy, unfortunately it's not the case. Bonus's have become expected regardless of performance.   
EDIT if they were not overpaid, they would not be decreasing staff, they would be increasing staff, pure matter of supply & demand.
		    This website is owned by a company called ""The Local"" - a Swedish expat news site.   
They bought this forum to move into the Swiss expat market and start writing news on Switzerland in English for the local expats. Well, guess what: Their writers probably have the same news sources we do... but since they need to write proper articles, they need more time than we for a simple post.   
The continuous re-posting of topics just to push the local newssite version of an old topic is still stupid IMHO...
		    So, improperly paid would be better than overpaid.   
By the way, the executive management who take big bonuses during down times, I agree, but I don't see them as bankers.  They are professional managment, no bankers.   
Most of the other people in the bank don't get bonuses during bad times unless they have negotiated them up front in thier contracts and then they cannot be considdered overpaid or if they made a profit for the bank and then I don't considder them overpaid.

			Election candidates for the far-right Swiss People's Party, Switzerland's biggest, signed a ""contract with the people"" on Sunday promising to deport foreign criminals and halt ""mass immigration"".   
The ""contract"" also promises to fend off any moves for Switzerland to join the European Union.     
About 200 party candidates for October parliamentary polls signed the document, printed on parchment, before a thousand party loyalists at a ceremony in Zurich.     
A similar document signed ahead of federal elections in 2007 had slightly different priorities -- the top three then included tax cuts, now replaced by the promise to turn back immigration.     
""We have the feeling that what concerns most people at the moment is immigration,"" party candidate Christoph Moergeli said at the ceremony.

			Zürich police have released two previously unseen videos showing violent FC Basel fans attacking riot police in a coordinated offensive outside Zürich-Letzigrund stadium in May.                Clearly those are all Serbians...    
			
			Oh wow, look at that! UK society is a mess. I'm so glad I left. All you lot whingeing about shop closing hours etc, just look at that video! It's not safe there any more everyone is just trying to kill everyone else!   
Oh wait.
		 
			
			damned scum of the earth.   
I honestly believe soccer or footbal whatever you wanne call it should be banned.
		    Banning football is most certainly not the answer, the locals will find another way to represent there city and the violence will continue.  
The swiss police usually have it more in control especially when compared to what was seen in England where there was no control
		    Casual racism that is   
i) repeated from another thread and 
ii) followed by a smiley   
doesn't make it less racist or more acceptable IMO
		 
			
			It's not racism. It's irony. That's what the   indicates. Rightly or wrongly pointing out a perceived tendency among some people to blame all anti-social acts on the immigrant population, you see.   
Aren't Swiss riot police armed? Why didn't they just shoot them?
		    Because it is not Kadhafi's police!
		    I don't know that shooting is the answer, but a few broken ribs, maybe the occasional collarbone, would go a long way towards preventing that particular batch of scum from acting up again.
		    Im not allowed to give you the Swiss view? Every time there is a crime in my area thats what all the locals tell us! Get a sense of humor.
		    Maybe you're right and I apologise if I reacted strongly.   
I get sensitive to it though as I'm not sure where humour and racist stereotyping can acceptably meet. Jim Davidson and Bernard Manning used the same defense thirty years ago.....but people don't think Chalky White is funny nowadays...   
Anyway, I apologise again if I misread your irony. Something of an exposed nerve for me        a prejudgment, an assumption made about someone or something before  having adequate knowledge to be able to do so with guaranteed accuracy    Being funny would help.
		    What would have happend if I said ""I blame the Americans""? Would that have been racist? Everyone from our nanny to our uber liberal neighbors (yes I have two of those!) blame the ""serbs"" or ""albanians"" before there is ANY knowledge of what actually happend. My wife and I have made a joke out of it. I highly highly highly doubt that anyone in that riot was Serbian. But I know the locals were quick to assume they were foreigners.    
FYI, Tom Tulpe follows me around and complains about everything I say. So just ignore him. He's jealous of good looking black men in Lingerie...       Yes, but we never think of it in that way because they aren't typically the victims of racial stereotyping as it relates to criminal behaviour.   
Anyway......thats kind of another topic. You posted something that you tell me I misinterpreted, I apologised....and MOTD is on   "	13	Police release shocking hooligan videos	1197

		    When I have a good feeling that equities have reached good value levels I will come back in.   
I also sold all equities in 2008 & came back in on lower prices in 2009. I did OK but I should have waited longer before I came back; bought ever more in 2009 as the prices decline continued so the average purchase price was actually not bad at the end.
