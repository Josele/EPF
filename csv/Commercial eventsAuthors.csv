			Here are the guidelines for posting commercial events.        
You probably know already that your event is commercial, rather than social. In short, if you're advertising your business, charging a fee or hoping to sell something, then it's a commercial event.   have no commercial interest.    
Examples of commercial events are comedy nights, wine tasting, salsa class and advertising concerts. This also includes clubs that charge for events or membership fees.    
Commercial events should specify if there is an entry fee or other price attached. They should preferably have some angle of interest for the expat/englishforum community.   
Example: If I invite people to meet in a pub to watch Chris Black sing, then it's a social event. If Chris himself makes the invitation, then it's commercial.        
There are now two calendars: social (default calendar) and commercial. This helps to separate the different types of event. To see the commercial calendar, look at the bottom right of the calendar and use the “Calendar Jump” field.    
Commercial events should only be posted in the commercial calendar.        
In order to post an event, you have to have a little forum history. Most people qualify pretty quickly. The reason for this is that we want to encourage people to be an active part of the community and not to use it just for free advertising. The qualifications are as follows:

			So just a few days to go and preparations well underway. Based on a message received I just wanted to clarify that this will not be a ""choir boys and organ music"" type of carol service - simply a small congregation opening its doors to anyone who wishes to join in on the festive spirit. Everyone involved is really looking forward to it and we hope it will be a great success, as it's the first time this particular church community is doing this.

			I was there a few days ago for dinner.    
It's really good farm to table style french cuisine. Sort of what you'd get in taverns and bistros in paris.    
Heading back tonight. The food has a lovely homemade taste to it and when it's gone, it's gone. I wouldn't know where else to go in Zurich for this.    
Oh and I had the tiramisu shot for dessert - perfect in taste and size    
The prices are also reasonable. They were less than Zurich prices at the opening night when I went.

			Hi everyone!   
I have started a new meetup group called  , and if you have a sense of adventure, I invite you all to join!   
We are snowboarders, splitboarders, skiiers, and hikers. Above all, we like adventures and love a good time. I will be organizing small events throughout the year with winter sports focusing on freeriding lesser known gems as well as the more well known ones. Powder is powder, right? We can still ski the pistes, and you better believe we will wash all that down with a beer or two   Spring/Sommer/Fall is all about trails and ales   
It is a group dedicated to the pursuit of outdoor excitement. I hope to foster a real community half as good as this one.   
@admins, please move this post if it is not in the right section.

I'm still on a protein rush from all the oysters    
It was a pleasure to meet new faces and old as people made their tour of Kreis 4 and the launch of Tribeka. Props to the Beat Pirates for the tunes and the good nature of the guests.

			Evening all,   
About a year ago, I arrived in Switzerland & placed an advert on English Forum looking for like minded musicians.   
The eventual result of that initial advert is the band RAGDOLL SUNDAY; highly listenable original classic rock / grunge influenced music with soaring vocals; marked as one of the hottest new rock bands coming up in Switzerland, with an album due to be released Summer 2017.   
Saturday 26th Nov at 20:30, we'll play a   show at  .   
It'll be one of the only shows where we'll play all the songs which might make it onto next year's album over a 1.5 hour set. All for   You can hear a taste of our music  , from our demo we recorded in May this year.   
There'll be food, drinks & a rocking night all around, & all are welcome!

			Thanks to all who came last night and boogied until 04:00. We had a real mixture of revellers and the mood was very friendly.     
I'm impressed with the general behaviour of guests: gallons of booze drunk, dancing around tables and rarely a broken glass. Best of all never any hassle - thank you!    
We were curious how an Electro night would go down in our usually demure bar but are delighted it was enjoyed by all.    
There are various upcoming events if you're looking to expand your social circle here in Zurich, including an evening of Soprano / Mezzo Soprano singing, readings, improv, our birthday party, more DJ sets...   
Next Thursday - Nov. 17th - we host the opening celebrations of   Zürich. It would be a pleasure to welcome you. Do introduce yourself, especially if you come on your own. We have loads of English speaking customers coming in and our staff love to be hospitable. Customers always end up chatting to each other, too, which is deeply satisfying.    
Cheers!
