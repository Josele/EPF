			+1 for Miki, almost like being back in Tokyo, the Ramen (Tonkotsu) is that good.  The same people run the smaller ikoo too.   
Had not yet heard of Ooki, look forward to giving it a spin one lunch time (I imagine if I arrive late or earlier should not be a problem...).

Vegetarian restaurants only have carbs so they are not for me; they also have soy products which I do not eat at all.      Nuts are not for me unfortunately. I eat high fat greek yoghurt but not often. I eat a lot of kefir and plain yoghurts. At the moment I am on medication that I am trying to get rid of just through being careful what I eat.

I don't smoke and drive. I usually smoke, read a bit and head to bed so I can sleep. The other day, I was driving home from Mulhouse and realized, I haven't driven after dark (it was 5pm) in so long that I questioned my sanity! I am menopausal age and don't party like I was 20 anymore, although I do miss that sometimes. I'm more of the smooth jazz gender. Thank you for sharing that story. It's surprising that you had to pay so much. I don't drink and drive either because I can't handle alcohol like I was 20 either. If my spouse and I go out, he drives (because he won't drink and drive either) and I co-pilot. Thanks.

			You should try   which is always a sure choice.    
They do a fantastic hand-cut steak tartare and their midday menus are great  value for money (a good place to have lunch after the Saturday market shop).

			6th-7th August in Prégny, Geneva:   Sonalp is a ""yodelling Rock band"", quite alternative in the world of yodelling. There'll be plenty of beer and Bratwürze! The female yodel choir of Geneva will be there too.     
23rd-24th July in Nendaz, Valais:      
Amazing Alpine horn and yodelling competition, all ending with the qualified horn players playing together around a mountain lake. Even if Alpine horn is not your scene, it is quite breath-taking and ticks all the ""stereotypical Swiss boxes""!     
And of course on 1st August in Cologny, from 18h00 onwards, your humble servant McTAVGE will be yodelling for Swiss National Day celebrations as part of the Alphüttli choir, and perhaps even a second EF member will be joining on stage (Peter????)

In Geneva there is an active improv comedy group called Renegade Saints Improv:

			The Velodemo held in September is the nearest to what you're seeking. Boom boxes, beers and babes rolling around the city. The police escort the group and close roads. A pleasant way of seeing the city for a couple of hours. I find the critical mass rides a bit raggedy but certainly friendly.    
The style ride baffles me completely but it's harmless.

			Le Port de Fribourg (Basse Ville) should have options - although the menu changes every day/week:    
Otherwise, l'Hôtel de Ville has excellent food - and I've seen the chef shopping at the market on Saturday mornings, so the food is definitely fresh! Their lunch deals are really worth it, but you often have to book ahead of time.

			Not sure, ATR may even be free to watch the replays these days.  They cover 27 of the UK's 60 racecourses.       
Then there's the Jockey Club courses - 15 of those and none of them covered by ATR as well.         
So between them you'd get 42 of the 60 courses covered.    Unfortunately Hereford and Folkestone both closed in 2012, but Hereford is going to open up again in October and ATR will have that.

			Hey there EF folks,   
I've been aching to play some indian music for some time now and am looking for form a small group to play on weekends or occasionally. I can do the vocals in Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, so we'd need one percussionist (could be simply using a cajon) and one person on acoustics.    
I have european friends here who really want to listen to some live Indian music (and it's not BOLLYWOOD music for god's sake). Covers of some pop yes, but I associate bollywood with a lot of garbage, so refrain from using that word.   
You could PM me if you're interested.   
Cheers,

Thank you for the update and information regarding Teoh's. It is good to know that Uncle and Auntie Teoh are well and have decided to retire. We just moved to Switzerland 6 weeks ago and were wrapped when we found Teoh's restaurant. We felt so lost last night when we saw the restaurant vacated. Your description of them is spot on - Uncle Teoh gave us his clock parking card 4 weeks ago and taught us how to use it as we had no idea.   
Please wish them well and thank them for our two unforgettable dinners.

			For anyone who wants their oodles of noodles experience to be bankrolled by someone else, the company that does the mystery dining for Wagamama is looking for people to go undercover in the Winterthur/Zurich branches, as and when they open.   
All details  , but the basic idea is that they cover the cost of food and drinks for up to 4 people, in return for you submitting a report about the quality of your dining experience (or lack thereof, presumably...).

			What I miss in Zürich, is a nice grand café like they have lots of in Amsterdam. Hopefully, that's just because I haven't found one since I live here.    
A place to have a good coffee (not from a push-the-button-machine, but for example from a proper Cimbali machine), where you can sit and relax on a Saturday on Sunday afternoon. Where they have international newspapers and magazines. Where a variety of people come, with a lively, colourful, informal atmopshere. 
I asked in Odeon on Limmatquai, where the response was...""ah..a grand café like they have in Paris you mean??"". I do not mean a packed Movenpick at Stadelhofen, nor a Lindt+Sprungli coffeeplace, or a Starbucks which seems to attract backpack tourists and teenagers in great numbers and the coffee really isn't good quality. What I'm frankly hoping to find is a Zürich-equivalent to   in Amsterdam.   
My closest find so far, and recommend people to go, would be the  . Nice atmosphere, mix of people, good coffee machine and nice brunch/lunch menu.    
Any better ideas for places like this or better in or around Zürich?

			Hey everyone! Thought that some of you expats might be interested to try something different. There's a funky Asian pop-up restaurant opening in February for just two weeks! First week will be authentic Chinese in conjunction to Chinese New Year (dumplings!) and Second week will be Japanese.    
The location will only be revealed on Sunday but they are already taking reservations and you can only do it via their FB page. In case you want to check it out for yourself, here's the link.    
Have a great weekend everyone.

			Hi all,   
In Portugal, the public premiere for the movies of the week is on Thursdays and for each film, one or more cinemas (depending on movie's popularity) is chosen for a preliminary premiere on Wednesday. Tickets for these preliminary premieres are offered to people from social media and many entities that then promote competitions for the general public participate and win double tickets. Usually, you would only need to answer some questions or make up *creative* phrases    
I often participated in this and actually won a lot of free tickets! It was great not only because it was free, but also because it was a preliminary premiere and sometimes I was completely clueless about the movie and would always have company even on short notice ( free tickets, hard to resist !   )   
So... Somebody knows something similar here in Switzerland? Do you know entities that usually offer tickets or some page that group several of these contests? Especially for Zurich!

as ""not all there"" says there is an english speaking group who perform a traditional panto every year in Basel.    
This year's show is ""Young King Arthur"", which is the 21st annual panto and it will be performed 6 times from the 10th till the 13th of December at the Scala Basel, Freie Strasse 89, Basel.    
Tickets are on sale from Ticketino.ch ( )

It is like a hanging out place/club that have Karaoke, Disco, Billiard, Darts, Bar and Lounge facilities. 
I am not a Karaoke fan, so cannot really tell if it is good or not.  Just went once, since I happen to know one of the owners. 
I think they charge Sfr10 entry (incl 1 free drink) over the weekend. Normal day free of charge.

			Loads to choose from! Thanks to all for recommendations.   
Zeughousekeller - awesome beer menu. Yes its touristy, but good (if not too busy).   
Johanniter is one of our faves anyway.   
We also went to Mellow cafe in wollishofen - very friendly owner, a bit like an Italian boudoir inside, but great home made food. If you choose the right thing, (which the lovely missus didn't, unfortunately.)   
Adlers Swiss Chuchi in the old town served us amazing wild season boar and deer with spatzle in a Swiss-tastic atmosphere, amid the slightly overpowering smell of burning cheese...   
Going to work our way through some other recommends in the near future.   
Thanks all!

			I don't know how many of you Zürich folks know about this already, but we attended last month and it was a great event.  Basically you pay one entrance price (CHF 25) for an armband that gives you access to transportation and all the participating museums, galleries, etc. located all over Zurich.  It's just one time per year but all there were so many places to see that we barely hit 1/2 of the places we planned.     
It's not just art venues, the Zürich Zoo, Corbusier house, Botanical Gardens, Paleontology Museum and Tram museum were just a few other venues participating.  Everything stays open late into the night and there are films, tours and talks at most locations.  I would definitely go again!!

			For the animal lovers, SRF1 is airing a documentary on Oct 25th, 3pm about  , a British writer, whose story inspired the Hollywood film ""We bought a Zoo"".   
On the topic of touching animal stories, I felt compelled to share two tales of unusual animal friends that just made my week.      met and became friends when they were both one month old. After Fum sadly passed away due to a renal obstruction, his owners took in a new cat, Glac, who also befriended Gebra.

And of course any food that was dropped on the floor (accidentally -- we haven't even hit the throwing stage yet) suddenly becomes 10x more appetizing than when it was on the plate, so add in two toddlers doing their best human-vacuum-cleaner impression on the smashed food you are trying to clean up (and being shooed away, and when they finally do go away leaving a trail of mashed banana footprints into the living room, resulting in that floor having to be cleaned too...)

			At the Klubi you can find anything really, from fringe HipHop to eardrums-smashing Polish Noise bands (I-was-there-and-it-was-cool).   
I also suggest to keep an eye on this:  
it's an art collective that open their space for drinks every now and then with interesting musical acts. 
I am biased as I went there with an ""interesting musical act"", true.  
Take your pick.

			Hey Sara,   
I was wondering if you had any luck finding a guitarist? I have been living in Zurich for 6 months and I am wanting to take up singing again.. I started taking lessons about a year ago back home in Australia and really enjoyed it.   
I love to sing gospel, blues, r'n'b, folk, funk, soul, jazz and country style but don't know if my skills are any good really but I would love someone to jam with and see if our voices go well together    
Anyway, let me know what you think. I am in Zumikon area, Zurich.   
Thanks!

So I moved recently to Zurich and as I understand, the trance parties around here are usually in stairs club... I don't know if there's another club with parties like that but at least in stairs club I know they have them. I don't really know a lot of people here and I don't know anyone who likes trance, so I thought about asking if someone here usually goes to those parties (in this club or others) and if I could join in some time   "	earned some respect	Join Date: Dec 2013	Groaned at 16 Times in 12 Posts	Stairs club in Zürich	Jéssi ૐ	Posts: 101

			Helloooo hello, 
was wondering if there was any bass player around, they appear to be a rare catch over here  
I am looking for (or well, my better half is..) a bass player into rock/goth/metal music to join a band based in Switzerland (Aarau Area).    
Even if the overall commitment might look very easy (no weekly reharsals - just before live shows/ no writing sessions) we're actually looking for someone who's extremely serious and passionate about music as he will have to learn tracks on his own and ensure a certain availability for tour and gigs, aswell as promotional photoshooting and video shootings.   
No lies, gothic rock is about the looks aswell hence looking the part / looking good is indeed a plus, tho not the main requirement.     
So please: come out come out, wherever you are!

			Ok, ladies and gentleman... I have just got back from the very restaurant described in this thread, so lets not waste any time and get on with a frank and honest review from someone who LOVES their curries...   
Well anyway, .  I ordered a take-away from the place and took it home... only to find that what I had thought was a Lamb Rogan Josh, was actually a Lamb Stew, which tasted like it could have been cooked in any one of a gazillion English cafes.   . It was for this reason that I desperately wanted to find somewhere tonight that could change my opinion that Zurich curry houses were not all this bad.  So, I searched the English forum and found the Tandoori BBQ House... and then proceeded to give the manager Sandeep a call to check if we could have a table... but also I mentioned that we were from the English Forum, and I was very encouraged to hear him not only recognise it (as he would, since he has posted in this thread, duh), but that he was open to giving us whatever we wanted curry-wise in order to make it as ""UK-like"" as possible.  Game on!      .  The place is located literally around 5 minutes from my house on Bleicherweg... the funny thing is that i've walked past it so many times and never give it a second glance... it kind of just looks like a generic cafe form the outside... there's nothing ""Indian"" about the external decor that would make you think: ""Ahh a curry house"".  Inside,  .. still no ""Indian identity"" in the way that many UK indian restaurants have, but then again who gives a crap, it's the food that matters... right?   
The food.... ah... the food.  To start with me and the lovely lady I was with had the usual popadoms and dips, standard fare at any curry place, right?  Well as much as I never usually even take notice of such trivial things as popadoms... these were noteworthy.  We got a good portion of them too, around 10, all perfectly crispy and well-shaped... but the dips?  Well,  , UK included.  One was a thick and rich mint yoghurt, the other a sauce of unknown name and origin (delicious, but can't remember what it was, all I know is i've never tasted it before), and the other was the managers own special ""blow your socks off"" home-made jobby that literally left me gasping for more... as well as air...  **** me it was hot!    
Anyway since this is dragging on a bit (sorry, but i'm just so happy i've found a good curry house) i'll go on to say that after ogling the menu we ordered a Chicken Tikka Massala (Tandoori style) and a Lambsomething Gosh and were given a choice of ""semi-deadly or ""deadly"" (heh)... we chose ""semi-deadly""... best be on the cautious side to start with eh? After an acceptable wait (not too quick, not too long) it arrived... and  .  After getting it served we tucked in and I swear that after three mouthfuls I almost had my first multiple foodgasm.  After 8 months of nary a sniff of a good curry, I was treated to one of the most delicious i'd had in a   time... UK included, which for me is saying a LOT.  The meat was tender and succulent, and  !  In fact I ate well past the point where I felt comfortable, even if only because I felt guilty for leaving it.    
After the meal we were offered two glasses of ""Grappa"" to aid digestion, which after two beers (which were also delicious, from southern switzerland, never tried that type of beer before, was VERY tasty and smooth) and a mountain of curry actually left me feeling like I was going to collapse... I don't think i've ever been so full in a long time, it was almost situation critical.   
The service from Sandeep was faultless (though to be fair it was a quiet night, being a Sunday, so he had time to spare), and it really helps that he speaks very good English, because the entire meal was fantastic from start to finish in terms of taste and ambience... and even my lady friend, who is possibly one of the worlds anally fussiest people, had nothing but good things to say about it.   
Sorry it's turned into a mini-essay but I really wanted to make a point of writing how happy I am about this place...  , and I was almost full to bursting when I left, which is what I look for in any Indian restaurant.   
9/10 from me...  !    
EDIT - Bolded bits for skim readers who want a quick overview of the place without reading the first chapter of Gone With The Wind.

			In Korean culture the first birthday is very important, it's one of the big 3, the others being marrige and 60th birthday.    
The OP is Indian, maybe same culture, although the guests are usualy family, maybe in this case family too difficult so go with friends.   
I think the culture comes from the parents celebrate the fact the baby has survived for at least a year, so all should be ok from now on, and from another post by the OP, i see things nearly didn't turn out so good.    
It is more tradition now than fact as most babies do survive, but traditions arte hard to kill off, just look at the UK !!   
Have a big party and enjoy it !

I am looking for karaoke bars in Zurich! I loved the one that recently closed down (Lauschuli's?).

Example. If your husband is of East European origin and the location of the place is central you might turn the place into a Russian or Hungarian Restaurant, as there were such places in the past, popular but in case of the two Russians apparently MISmanaged and in case of the Hungarian at a bad location

			Here's a general point, albeit a bit left field ....... over the years, and two locations, my daughters have, between them, belonged to three different tennis clubs - each one having a restaurant. These appeared to be of good quality, not overly expensive or formal - and well frequented throughout the week. In fact one (Düdingen for those from round here - link below) was always banged out at the weekend, and offered several themed events and live music and always had a good ambience.   
Whether it is the same in the area(s) you're considering, those with local knowledge will have to say.      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Apr 2010	Groaned at 19 Times in 18 Posts	HELP! Lavaux/Vevey people !	McTAVGE	Posts: 2,000

			Dear Forum Members,    
There is a concert this Friday (22th of May) at 7:30 p.m in the Kirche St. Jacob (Stauffacherplatz, Zürich). The music will include two pieces from Bach's 2nd partita for violin, Piatti's Andante religioso,  pieces from Radiohead arranged for piano and others, played by very good musicians. 
more info in flyer and on fb    
The admission is free, and donations are welcome. The donations will go for humanitarian assistance to Eastern Ukraine.   
My colleague is in organizing committee. Thus, I can recommend it without any doubts :-).       
Enjoy! 
Kinga

			I have recently been to George Bar & Grill on Sunday - very pleasant place and glad they are open Sundays too now! Aaaand, they offer amazing Sunday roast!! The menu is CHF 68, including starter, main and dessert, all yum and so worth the money! plus, there is live music on Sunday afternoon, amazing bonus. 
Highly recommended! 
Cheers

I have no affiliation or tested it so don't blame me if you don't like it , just thought I d let all the roast lovers know when I saw this advertisement.

			The ""Rheinfelder Bierhalle"" near Central is an amazingly cheap place to get some decent Swiss food. It's not very stilish, to say the least, but you get all kinds of strange and interesting people in there.

			Le Cerf is a bit like an old fashioned British pub- and as said by BM, don't think they serve food at lunchtime. Do you like Thai? There is a great little place at the pretty Rue de Chavannes, on left towards the top, which is really good and excellent value for money.

			On my way to searching for something else I stumbled across the Swiss Tavolata website, and am intrigued. These are Swiss farm women who will cook a traditional 'Landküche' meal for you, made of their own or local products, most of the time you dine at the farm with the family.    
Sounds like a fun way to meet folks all over Switzerland - have any of you ever done this?      "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Sep 2006	Groaned at 18 Times in 17 Posts	Swiss Tavolata - Any Experience?	meloncollie	Posts: 7,683

			Are you looking for mat pilates or reformer-type? I was a reformer pilates devotee, and had trouble finding one I liked (pilateszone in Enge has at least one English speaking class a week, but you have to commit to going to the same class every week, which was hard since I travel so much for work).  I started going to   near Wiedikon -  which uses a 'megaformer' -  all their classes are in English, they have like 10 a day, and you can buy a bundle of classes and go to any of them.  Your first class is free, so definitely worth trying out if machine pilates is your thing!

			Thanks a lot. I think this may be the same game as the ""3 language"" version, just with more accurate (well, hopefully more accurate) information. The price for the game ranges between 70 to 90 CHF, depending on the supplier. So if anyone can still confirm that their CH version worked in English, I can buy it at the 70 CHF price instead.

			""Pho"" is one of the most well-known Vietnamese dishes to the world.   
Probably ""Pho"" is available in many Asian restos, but I am sure what you can find in Europe/Canada/USA is only of less than 80% of quality of what you can find in Vietnam   
Once you are in Vietnam, go to Hanoi to taste ""Pho"", since ""Pho"" of other provinces in Vietnam is much less good.

			Have a look at your local GZ) Gemeinde Zentrum / community center to see if they have any activities that interest you. Or find a club for some sport or hobby - swimming? book club? meet-up for dog lovers? card games? dancing? It's much easier to meet people if you have something in common. You might have to work at it a bit more than you have to in other places where you can meet folks just by hangin out in your local pub or cafe. Good luck. Just give yourself some time. As you know, you can't force these things.

			Playing or listening? There are plenty of choirs, amateur orchestras, opera societies - even in English - in Geneva, Lausanne and in between. As to concerts, check out your local Conservatoire, keep an eye on La Cote, the local paper, use a website like tempslibre.ch. Cheaper tickets to professional concerts can sell out quickly, and otherwise tend to be eye-poppingly expensive, but there's a good standard of non-professional concerts out there too, which tend to be more reasonable or even free. Have fun!

It's not impossible to get a decent sit-down meal for less than 100 for 2 people. You just need to choose the place carefully and be a little practical. Share a salad (or starter) and the dessert. Get a carafe of tap water and order open wine, and keep your mains under 30 Francs if possible. Hubby and I meet up with the Bern group once a month for dinner and I don't think we've spent 100 yet on any of those meals (thanks to Sbrinz for making affordable choices).

			This website lists a heap of wedding locations in Switzerland, you can choose the area and what type of location (in the woods, on the water etc)   It's in German but you can easily navigate with the pics.  They also list florists, caterers etc   
If you can understand German the website also has a great blog giving you everything you need for arranging a wedding in Switz:    
Good luck!

			Adding another option to this old thread:   
Del Sole at Löwenstrasse between Zürich HB and Löwenplatz. It's an Italian restaurant, some tables outside, prices are fair, service is OK, great choice on the menu with  of course  a focus on pizza and pasta.

			Schiff bar in the old town is okay for a few drinks, it's just off from the cobbled square, up the stairs (though they have a ground level section too). It's small though.   
About 11pm try Widder Bar which is also in the old town, just at the top of the cobbled square next to the Widder restarant, through the wooden door and up the stairs. It's also small though.   
Mantra across the road from Mr Pickwick's does the cocktail's thing, its not too bad I guess.   
Or if you REALLY want to feel out of place try Juanita's down on the lake front. The regulars there all seem to know a syncronised dance routine (not unlike billy ray cyrus style line dancin') and all take to the small dance floor when a certain song is played. Felt very out of place!  Won't go back till I've learnt 'the dance'.

			If you are in Lugano then I would highly recommend this restaurant which I went to at the weekend. The food/wine leans much towards the French style as was the best meal (tasting menu & wine pairing) I hace had in a few years. 
The French owner is friendly and says she gets people from Zurich going for a day trip/lunch!       
The SBB have a railaway offer on just now so it is 50% cheaper to get to Lugano as well !   
In Zurich I would try Il Casale for good cooking      "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Mar 2009	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	French restaurants in Zurich	Jayne83	Posts: 15

			Having seen this show, and been blown away by the uniqueness of the experience and the effort of the performers, I can recommend seeing this show, if you are looking for an activity to fill an evening. It was especially nice that the sun set during the performance.   
Here's the official website of the Basel show:     
And the info from the Kanton's website: 
The successful play, CYCLOPE, will be coming to Basel as open-air  theatre performance from the 10th of July to the 21st of September. The  play with its impressive 17-metre stage is a tribute to the Swiss artist  Jean Tinguely. An international troupe will combine acrobatics, theatre  and live music to create a memorable evening and bring Tinguelys ""Le  Cyclop"" to life with an exciting show. 
 Following the successful  open-air season on the shores of Lake Biel in 2012 and the successful  indoor staging of the play in Winterthur this year, CYCLOPE is now  coming to the hometown of Jean Tinguely. The production is being  supported by the Tinguely Museum in Basel, where the model of the ""Le  Cyclop"" is on display.

			If you are a big meat lover, you can try this one   
It normally has real big portion of meal but i don't find the staffs very friendly. Always crowded though...   
The below Vietnamese restaurant has quite authentic choice of food. Particularyl the ones where you wrap things in the rice paper and dip them in some sauce... super good... And yes, very friendly staff. You need to know what to order though.. dont order the menu du jour      
Below Chinese restaurant is good food at very affordable price. But again the service is not so great...     
Indian cuisine can recommend. Quite authentic. There is not so many places to sit and eat though... but you can always do a take away.     
Another Indian restaurant with quite a good buffet for lunch on week days...

			Hi everyone,   
My name is Van, I just moved to Locarno and was lucky to have caught the Ascona Jazz festival! What a cool festival, beautiful New Orleans tune... BUT: no one danced! What a shame! I'd like to go to Lugano for the Estival Jazz tomorrow and maybe Saturday but I've learned the lesson so would like to ask around first if anyone would go there and maybe dances a little swing too? Would be cool to meet up and swing!   
Saluti, 
Van

			Suan Long at Stadelhofen which was excellent got replaced by Ly's Asia which means a downgrade. No longer any wines but just beers, uncomfortable seats and rather lousy cuisine.    
The Restaurant Bahnhof Stadelhofen, right across from the station since 1989, has disappeard (regrettable) but the WEISSES KREUZ nearby with good food and good wines is still in business.    
The cafe-restaurant on the square between the station and the Seefeldstrasse will be upgraded into a serious garden-restaurant. Details are not yet known .

			Well, we finally made it to Conny-Land today, and we all really enjoyed it.    
I was surprised that it wasn't busy, especially since we went on a pleasantly warm, sunny Sunday. We didn't have to wait at all for most rides, and any rides that we did have to wait for, the wait was only a couple minutes or less. My 2 1/2 year-old was thrilled that they have bumper cars as well as some coin-operated cars that he was surprisingly able to drive all by himself. It seems like they are much more relaxed here than they are in the US about height requirements for rides. Of course, though, our little guy wasn't able to ride the roller coaster or a couple of the large rides. But there were still lots of rides for him to enjoy (including both of the water rides).   
It was quite sad to see the empty dolphin pool  , but if they weren't treating the dolphins correctly before, then I'm sure it's best that they no longer have them there.    
The cost was 29 CHF per adult and kids up to the age of 3 are free. The restaurant had a surprisingly nice selection of food at reasonable prices.   
We will definitely go again. I highly recommend this cute little amusement park for anyone with small kids.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Nov 2009	Groaned at 96 Times in 64 Posts	Conny-Land -- lots to do for a 2.5 yr. old boy?	Pancakes	Posts: 2,901

			The size varies depending on the pizzaiolo(a) (person who makes pizza), the heat of the oven, the type of wood used, the weather outside...etc.   
All seriousness aside - usually one pizza is for one person, don't be shocked when they bring it to you and it is extending over the edge of the plate, this is a THIN CRUST pizza as mentioned previously, you will be able to eat it all.   
I  a   costs around 18CHF  - more if you want buffalo mozzarella instead of regular mozzarella. Prices go up to around 25CHF if you want special things like porcini mushrooms. 
There are not that many different types of pizza, simple, with top quality ingredients is the highlight here and they usually have a seasonal pizza.   
Wash it down with a Turbinenbräu -  heaven.   
I forgot to mention - ROSSO is not a Pizzeria, it is a modern funky restaurant with down to earth good food, mostly locally sourced, you WILL need a reservation unless you want to try your luck at getting a seat at the bar (you can eat there too). If you are more than two persons, you should really reserve.

Just remember to book your camping well in advance. 
IIRC there is an option of taking the slo-train from Bellinzona (Giubiasco, Cadenazzo, etc) to Locarno , and then back to avoid having to negotiate the inevitable traffic gridlock (hence the aforementioned helicopter jokes).  
This would give you the flexibility of choosing a camping ground somewhere else in the Magadino plain or in one of the lateral valleys. 
If you choose to stay close by, riding your bicycles from the camping to the town would make even more sense IMHO.   
Films usually aren't overdubbed - be prepared for some extravagant, exotic, NSFW flicks, hehe... 
and if you're looking for a nice messy hubbub, well, you'll see plenty during the Film Festival.   
Oh - and you'll probably get yourself drenched by some of those famous evening thunderstorms so have your wellies and ponchos with you     
Ciao   
Paul

			Cheers everyone,   
We ended up going for a pizza (boring I know) but it was the closest one to where I live and it was pouring down with rain.  I walked past the thai place this morning, Ill probably try it out over the weekend.  The Schwan looks really nice, but a bit pricy.  Ill wait until one of my parents comes to visit me and then we can go there and they can treat me.  I think that on the 16th of october there is going to be a whisky and folk night at the schwan, Ill be there if anyone fancies it.     
Cheers,

			I am looking for a small bar or restaurant for my birthday organization in Lausanne center or somewhere close to it which can be accessible by public transport.  I am planning to invite around 30 people and want some place at least segregated from the other customers, or ideally a floor/section for us. I am ok with some down-payment or offering couple of hundreds for the initial drinks to the owner.    
Ideally, I would like to find some place which is new in business or not very popular,  so that they might be interested in making guaranteed couple of hundreds for that night (which is going to be a Saturday night, unfortunately   ).    
Do you have any suggestions for me?    
Thanks in advance for all!

			I can explain the ""Indian Thai fusion"" bit: The guys are from Myanmar... right between India and Thailand, not just geographically but culinary as well. For some reason does ""Thaifood"" sell better than ""Burmese food"" in the west. Probably going to change with the wave of tourists going there now...

			Hello all,   
This is an effort to correct a gross injustice that has  befallen us Zurich-folk. If you, too, have been awaiting to see the new Veronica Mars movie (coming out tomorrow),  only to be disappointed by finding out that it will not feature in  Swiss cinemas, then you are cordially invited to join me in scheduling a  private viewing in one of the many cinemas in the city! I guesstimate  that it will cost less than a normal cinema ticket (per person), but will revisit these  calculations once I get more feedback that allows me to assess the public  interest in this. Booking to -of course- be handled jointly with all interested parties, and to be scheduled preferably soon & on a weekend.   
Bestest,

			Thanks, all.. I may have a line on a gigs in either Zurich or Geneva, so I was trying to gauge how rambunctious things can get. I loved living in Shoreditch in retrospect, but absolutely loathed it whilst I was there. (Exactly as Sandgrounder described and then some.. perhaps we met there?  )   
I'm also trying to gauge if my wallet in ZH can handle my level of sustained alcoholism^W entertainment. I get that drinks are expensive, so that's going to be a no-brainer.   
As an aside, are there any speakeasy-style bars or nice cocktail bars in ZH? (Comparing to, say Nightjar/Artesian/Savoy in London or PDT/Death & Co in NYC)? I would have a great sadness if I moved there and couldn't at least feed the liver quality ingredients. I absolutely loathe the ""see and be seen"" type celebrity bars, so those are dead to me, FWIW...   
Thanks again

 - I really hope not. He's one of the few actors I will watch before I read any reviews. Mind you, there were more compelling films than Wolf of Wall Street this year (the overrated American Hustle not being one of them).

			Hello everyone! 
Love it or hate it but the Valentine's day is almost here. 
I hope it will wake our sleepy Neuchatel up a little on friday  
So, in case you have no idea where to take your significant other for a romantic drink or you are not yet decided where to cry over your ex or where to possibly meet your new bf/gf I can recommend one place. Join me in the bar Au Metro this friday night and have a pink pina colada or some of the other more or less valentine's drinks ( with more or less alcohol in them...your choice )    
Well that sounded awfully commercial like...but the main point as always is to meet you english forum peeps  bars are the best meeting spots and because i happen to be working in one i'm obviously suggesting that one. It is also because my shifts rarely allow me to visit any other establishment  )   
So , thank you for reading this and hopefully see you soon in Au Metro (or anywhere else in neuch on sundays haha) .   
And in case i won't see you peeps, I wish you all the best Valentine's day possible....cheesy as it sounds, the love really is out there )    
Byeee

I used to have the Mueseums Pass, which gave a lot more choice for a local distraction on a rainy day.  For me Fondation Bayeler and a fair few French and German museums would swing it for me.

			Sup.   
Ceramico, in Basel.    
- 8/10. Would go again (been twice now). 
- Interesting. Educational. Open, welcoming, and child friendly. 
- Price.. expect to pay ~15-20CHF for about an hours entertainment. So ok there. Of course you can go for bigger peices or more advance offerings. 
- Parking.. *sigh*  
- Public transport, always a simple pleasure in Basel.   
Been twice now. First time was for simple hand prints on 10cm^2 tiles to tile around the main toilet basin area as the bog standard painted wall was/is getting too stained and dirty from all the endless water play. *sigh* So I saw Ceramico.. I think on this site and went to check it out over the Xmas holidays. We, 7 of us, went on New Years Eve (afternoon.. although there was a later evening session).   
Long story longer, we got some hand prints but the kids were so enthusiastic that there was little left of the hand prints once they got into the painting. My eldest liked it so much he had a tantrum when it came to leaving.. not seen one of those from him in a few years. *ssigh*   
So we went back a few days later, today, and did some of the more, child, interesting shapes such as a penguin, a crown shaped bowl, and a lizard. One of the children shattered a display piece but the owner/runner was coolish about it although it was made clear that the piece took some hours to make.   
I'll post pics, perhaps, once the pieces are fired and picked up. That seems to take 1 to 2 weeks.

Anyone know of any good club parties tonite? What would be perfect is a place with good music (i'm thinking house/electronic/hip hop) where i could buy tickets online and thus avoid all the b/s of the NYE super-scrum.   
saying that, paying on the door would be fine although maybe you could tell me how likely out of ten i would get in if i rolled up late (coz that's how i roll).

			Zürich is quite the only place for nightlife on hundreds of Km around   
people from Baden, Glarus, Rapperswil, Aarau, Luzern, Basel and Liechenstein come regularly to Zürich for nightlife on weekdays.   
on weekends there are some local partys around, but they still come to Zürich, because on their own words, Zürich is the best place to go out.   
I am speaking about Latin nightlife BTW.   
As many said, Zürich is the bussiest place for nightlife in Switzerland, but it is provincial and small compared to other european places, and costs 2 or 3 times more, for less in return.   
You can find a lots of people there, you'll find the good, the bad and the ugly.    
There is something for everyone, it depends on which ones you feel comfortable with.

			Hi, Jubilatka   
There is no real dress code. You will see some people in complete evening attire and some in more casual clothing, maybe even a few in jeans - even though I have just checked and ticket prices are from CHF 38 to 270, tomorrow, i.e., on the upper end, so there will be not as many jeans as on other days. Also, it is Nabucco and the pre-Christmas season, so that I would expect the dresses to be a bit more festive than in the summer.   
So, wear something nice and a little festive you feel comfortable in.   
I hope this helps, 
Idgie

I am sure your hamburger si fine however, I disgree as I am a hamburger traditionalist   If the beef is good enough and cooked right you don't need anything else, salt is okay. I have the same issue with steak and people who use steak sauce, of coure I like the Florentine steaks which involves some added flavors on the outside.

The food is amazing! A mix between Mediterr&amp;Asian. Great Chillout Sound. Good Prices. There is no Menulist existing, Chef Anthony is just cooking every day fresh dishes. Also Sushi &amp; Sashimi available. Try it yourself or Take out.

			Seeing as this seems to be far slung, I can recommend the meat in the Marco Polo in adler which is in Bad Säckingen.    
By the way I have absolutely no idea why it has a spanish domain address but there you go...   
They also do Bison which is something different. Note I am only recommending the meat as the ambience leaves a bit to be desired, reminds me of pizza hut

			Can't go myself, but tomorrow (15th November) is Movie Night in Basel.   
45 CHF gets you entrance from 1800 to 0600, including a midnight snack and coffee and gipfeli.   
The program is   and there's plenty of English language stuff to keep you entertained through the night.   
It's worth the money just for Gravity, Thor and Captain Philips. If you've not seen Rush yet then that's well worth seeing (don't worry if you're not an F1 fan. It works for normal people too) and Escape Plan should be a giggle. It's just a matter of seeing what will fit in with start and end times.

			Hi Ewan,   
I'm a DJ/Producer and I've recently moved to Switzerland. I'd be very interested in meeting anyone who might be up for a collaboration; either DJing together or producing. I'm very into ghetto funk at the moment, but I play all sorts of breakbeat as well as other types of electronic music, (proper) hip-hop, northern soul, indie dance and so on. Drop me a line sometime if you fancy a chat...I'm very keen to find out about the scene here.    
Cheers.

A restaurant with tables right on the lake side, you could feed the ducks from your chair! A reasonable daily menu for lunch (Fr 17,--).  
A VERY friendly waitress, resulting in a perfect meal.    
The lunch on Friday was: salad, fish with vegetables & potato, crême brulee & cream, plus coffees, & we both had a beer.  
 Total cost was Fr 52 for two meals. (The lunch menu changes every weekday)

			The 90th birthday party's HIGHLIGHT was the surprise performance by  Nancy Lee  and her violinist friend,  Barnabas Nagy. They played three pieces from my father in law's composer father (1889-1949), which reminded him of his childhood. The musicians made a HUGE effort to learn and practice the scores, to perform in less than one week.   
Thanks so much for your help, dear Nancy, and EF for her contact.

And @Mag, great to hear you've found some places to accommodate a gluten allergy in Fribourg. I would love to hear about them and add them to my blog. We're flexible with the type of restaurant, most important characteristic is allergy-friendly.

			At my son's kinski, they came to collect the birthday child at home with a chariot to pull the child, dressed as a little prince, all the way back to school.   We lived the furthest from the school ..    i walked along to give them a little help!   
A cake could be provided - or bread and chocolate bars in a couple of instances.  The no sweet things rule was waived for a birthday but people usually kept it very simple.  I did a spongebob squarepants cake and it was the talk of the village .. I was asked by several mums if I was actually a trained patissière .. in the end I had to let on about my secret stash of ready coloured fondant icing brought back from the UK!

			Have you been there? 
People are bbq-ing there all over the place. 
On sunny days,  the place is like the 1960's  . 
It's a bit of a nuisance at such a scale IMO. 
While a BBQ is always nice, ask yourself if the place needs another throw-away BBQ being lit-up. 
And please, take all the trash with you afterwards...

			We were thoroughly entertained by a heartfelt acoustic rock and blues band last weekend. Guitarist Steve  
Lunt, originally from Kent,  decided to bring along his band ( Sandy, Ivica, and Reto)  as a present to the birthday girl ( 40th). It was really enjoyable!  I thought to pass it on to fellow EFers.   
Have a listen:     
Apparently, Steve is the highest level of karate teacher, in Switzerland. He and his friends are weekend musicians, and are available for gigs.   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Sep 2009	Groaned at 23 Times in 8 Posts	Sticks n Strings acoustic band available for gigs	Susan57	Posts: 886

			We are planning a (quite extravagant) roaring twenties themed party in St. Gallen and are struggling to find a bar/Raum/Mietobjekt which we can rent out for one night in late September and kit out as a Speakeasy. Must fill the following criteria:   
- 150-300 person capacity room and second, smaller cellar/room (or the other way around) 
- External catering  
- Possibility to play loud music until at least 3am (on a weekday) without complaints.   
If anyone has any ideas/tips in general for kitting out a room in speakeasy style, we would be really grateful!   
Thanks

I can't suggest a suitable reception venue/ location, but wish you the best with your plans.   
Should you decide you want some different entertainment for your reception, I can provide Palm Reading/ Tarot reading, tailored perfectly to both the walk around and table-to-table environment. I also perform Close-Up magic. See   for full details.

			My best guess would be Hotel Restaurant Meien which is on Dorfstrasse 49, in Tuellingen above Loerrach.  It has a room with panorama windows - memorable views.  Good menu and quality.  You get to it either from Weil (easiest) or from Loerrach, each way going up a hill.  Hope this helps!

			Pasadena is a good place for partner dancing. I've been there on a few Fridays, and they play different styles of music through the night, with a slight bias towards discoswing.   
Silbando and Downtownswing are very good, too, although I only know them through lindy hop. On a similar note, you should check El Social ( ) and the open air dancing on Bürkliplatz, there are different dance styles on different nights.   
Btw, if you want to check Pasadena, I have posted an event for this Friday (17.05). I will be going to Pasadena, and it would be great to have other dancers joining, the more the merrier!

for my PhD defense, I am organizing an apéro. I am looking for a traiteur in/around Lausanne that offers good verrines/canapés. I prefer something sophiticated with maybe an Asian twist.  
Unfortunately, the traiteur I wanted to book already has too many events on the given day.

as mentioned by many Le Cedre is the best in taste but that's only if you haven't tasted the real lebanese food.   
last week we also tried a Lebanese/moroccan restaurant Maison Blunt somewhere close to Langestrasse. the place is not wow but the people are very nice and they do try to please customers. Some of the dishes were very authentic but some others were all mutated versions (not bad but just not the lebanese taste).   
For me the ambiance is as important as the taste so I'd opt for cedre for now until i've tried the others.

			...and looking for a little advice on the club scene.   
So far, I've only had one proper night out in Zurich that involved dancing and one thing I'm keen to ask you all about now is where people recommend to go? All kinds of music as I'm into all sorts of stuff, but not big on shiny commercial things; e.g. Swedish House Mafia, U2 or their equivalent in each scene.     
Does it always cost half a kidney to get into clubs & gigs here?    
What types of music are popular at the moment?    
Is there much of an underground scene?   
Are DJs usually contracted/promote their own nights/paid cash in hand?    
Are there any English speaking DJs out there that may be interested in trying to get a night sorted out somewhere sometime in the future? You can find mixtapes of mine here   and here   please drop me a line if there's anything there that might sit well with what you play and if you'd be interested in having a chat about things.   
Anyways, thanks in advance to anyone who can pass on their thoughts about the above.

			I went to the Sitara 4 years ago - the food was very good and authentic - the atmosphere, very laid back and family run -i'm sure one of the servers was around 14/15!      is very good, as is   (ate here last Thursday and it was excellent) would be hard to decide between them - the Hafenhale also has a huge informal biergarten in the summer which is constanly full with people drinking beer and enjoying big meals from the self-service grill station.

			Edit/rant: scratch Barcas off the list of good places in Luzern. My recent experience with an apero there was being charged CHF 2,50 apiece for 42 small, thin slices of white bread with some scant and less than average quality toppings. A 'cheese plate' consisted of 2 kinds of cheese, both of the worst quality cheese I have ever had in CH. (Kraft american singles and velveeta would have tasted better.) The service was substandard and the host was rude.  
On a brighter note,  a recent dinner at Zum Wilden Mann makes it, in my opinion, the best restaurant on earth!....

465	22.10.2009, 15:34	Junior Member	Thanked 6 Times in 5 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    In my opinion the whole idea of an Irish bar is not about cooking a certain type of food or anything. It is about providing a feeling of Irish hospitality. I'm sorry but Irish people do Irish hospitality the best. I have no problem with him owning a pub, I do have a problem with him using a country which he appears to have no connection to which happens to be my home country as a means to making a quick buck.    
I've been to Irish bars which were owned by non Irish and they tend to be perfect plastic paddies hang outs. The best Irish bars in my opinion are ones that are actually run by people who are Irish.    
I know I'll get groaned for this, but its my opinion and I'm entitled to it.

			Don't want to rain on your parade.... but in Switzerland you must have a civil ceremony, the church bit is optional. and unlike the UK, for example, it's rare for a church or other venue to be licenced for doing the civil bit as well as the 'social, ceremonial  part' of a wedding.  
So you need to check if there's a list of places that   do both (if that's what you want) with your local Mairie or town hall. Or decide if you just have the civil part, and arrange a big party elsewhere.  
And just to be doubly difficult, they won't usually make bookings for the civil part more than three months in advance, so people often get married and have the church ceremony on two different days!

I also came across a place called Samurai which I thought was pretty good. The spicy tuna was great and the rolls had more of the non-traditional flare to them, which being from Califorinia is a bit more of what I'm used to.

			As international cuisine continues to expand in Zurich and more and more Indian restaurants popping up everywhere; here is another new one I came across last week:      
I had a quick glance inside and it looked quite nice. They had a lunch buffet (eat as much as you want) from 17chf, and also a normal a la carte menu. I didnt have time to try it out, but if anyone goes or has been, it would be good to hear your feedback!

			1.  P rime Steakhouse (Rebgasse 8, 8004 Zurich)     Whats it like inside? Exactly like the sort of place that sells a 150 chf steak; trying to be as elegant as possible in what is basically a carnivores moshpit. Thus we have low lighting, dark-wood banisters, well-placed orchids, and a massive painting of a bull-in-a-noble-situation i.e. not with twenty lances sticking out its arse.     Atmosphere: but you can dim the lights, slice your serious-white tablecloths, and put price lists in brown-leather binders all you like, you're a steakhouse, and the moods delirious: high-pitched yakking, lots of laughing, and etc behaviour inevitable when basically everyone is drinking blood.     Bit weird: the steaks get cooked behind the cramped bar on a smouldering charcoal grill which sounds more 'pre burned-down beach shack' than weighty restaurant in Zurich, but fair's fair it's their place and they can cook their steaks where they like, as long as it's not next to my table like some places, like wtf, give me a mariachi band any day.     Food: theres nothing I can add to the STEAK! RAH! debate, just to say theyre  experts here. So instead its time for todays Most Poignant Thing Ever: although most death-row convicts choose steak for their final meal, most meals are left uneaten.      Service: friendly, smart, relaxed, let you get on with it.     Score: 8/10. Points off for overcharging for dessert (take that Prime Steakhouse). What they didnt know was Id have paid double for their sorbet and vodka in a big glass (take that Prime Steakhouse). Seriously nice vodka used too; drinking only top quality alcohol forever is reason enough to greedily conglomerate your own fortune       Top tip: book well in advance for weekends (like a week plus). The only Zurich steak place you can walk into on weekends is that one in ye olde towne, coz its shit. Weeknights at Prime are busy too.     Directions: Tram stop Stauffacher; named after Werner Stauffacher who in 1307 was Schwyz cantons representative at the legendary Rütlischwur. This is where the Switzerland we know and love began and in typically Swiss fashion, with everyone agreeing to terms and conditions.

			Well after the above posts I decided to verify it myself & visited the place personally today. And I can surely say I wasn't disappointed. The place was awesome. It was completely packed, buzzing with vibrant energy with an very modern aesthetic Indian outlook.    
Met Jay - the owner & could easily feel that the spark at the place has been surely inspired from his personality. He was kind enough to offer us a glass of complementary wine. Loved it. Would surely recommend this place to anyone!   
Also the website domain has changed from ch to com.

			Do you have some acting experience or just wish to act? I am looking for a few English speaking natives who would like to participate in a staged reading of a longish one act. This would be done in a (or several) locales in Zurich. Only a few rehearsals, maybe 3 or 4 would be required. Prefer middle aged folks, in 40s or 50s. Please email me at  , or use this site.

			Hi all !   
I wanted to bring together all restaurants and markets that serve or sell Turkish food for new comers, as well for myself    
Here's the google map for that :       
I appreciate if you let me know if there's any other places you know !   
I heard there are some Turkish groceries in Gündeli as well, but I don't know where..

			Hi - does anyone know of and can recommend a caterer/person who would be able to come to our house and cater raclette and wurst outside for an event? There will be around 40 people or so, and I was thinking of something similar to the guys providing the raclette and sausages at the Christmas markets around Zurich.    
We have 2 large BBQs, but not one of the larger raclette cheese grills.    
Has anyone ever done something similar for a private event?   
Thanks in advance

A group of us hockey players fans are travelling over from the UK to catch a couple of National League games in January.

			Hi JustRose,   
If I remember correctly, you said in an earlier post you recently moved from from NYC. Comparatively, there are few really good restaurants in Basel, and very few do anything particularly interesting, adventurous or different on their menus. That said, they are rarely bad either, mostly just good average.    
I would however recommend the following to go to with out of towners:     - Portuguese influenced food in a pleasant setting. It is a little on the pricey side though.     - Indian (obviously) and done very well. Just make sure to reserve well in advance. Also a little pricey.      - run by sight-impaired people, you eat in total pitch darkness.c Food was decent here, as were the prices, and if you go for the surprise menu when you order, you can try guessing what are eating and find out if you were right agfterwards when you leave.      - inexpensive (by Swiss standards) Asian food. Great for a quickish meal that's tasty.      - new-ish piza place that's run by the Piadina Bar people. Great, choose-your-own-topping pizza.   
One place to  at all costs is  , just off Gerbergasse. It's the one and only truly abysmal place I've been to in BS.   
E guete!

			I would like to give two thumbs-up to Typisch Thai in Lachen.    
We are expats from Asia living couple of years in Lachen (working in Zurich) we are grateful for the decent Chinese cuisine at Beyond in Zurich town, and the little Korean eatery off Bahnhofstrasse. But we are most thankful for the superb authentic Thai cuisine in our ""hometown"" of Lachen.   
Typisch Thai is run by Bo (Thai) and her Swiss husband Lukas. Lukas is a professional chef in his own right but leaves the cooking to Bo -- and what wondrous pad thai, larb, som tam, tomyam soup etc she turns out with her staff. You are assured of great Thai dishes daily... or go on Wed and Fri for the eat-all-u-can buffet. Good value with unlimited noodles, rice, spicy soup,3 or more curries, salads etc.   
For a special event though, Lukas can be persuaded to create great desserts like his lava chocolate cake. And if you have a party for 17 and above pax, they will put on a buffet spread. We had a birthday celebration and they made it a special occasion.    
They also run a little lebensmittal shop next door. No need to trek into Zurich for fresh tofu, coriander and other vegetables, curry mixes, frozen seafood supplies...it is such a boon for us that we felt we must share with other expats in the area.

Tibits is unique in that it's the only vegetarian buffet style restaurant in Switzerland, or at least, it was when it first opened, I'm unsure if anyone has noticed it's success and jumped on the bandwagon.    
I do not recall anything about being bio, only that they do stress how FRESH it is. Given the cost differences at the grocery store for bio vs regular, I tremble to think how expensive Tibits would be if it were all bio. As it is, the pricing structure is in line with the other restaurants in the area, as I'd think is only sensible from a business point of view.     
It's a good thing you're vegan, if you were more like the rest of us, you'd have already choked on how expensive the food is, even at lowly McDonald's.

But not the best with debutant(s) in tow, who want the rules & tactics explained. A bit small, odd layout, relatively small screens (although these may have been upgraded) and, for England matches, seems to be not a few hooray Harrys.   
Paddy's was mixed. I arrived with the lads about 10 mins before kickoff.  
Place was rammed and they had the Wendyball on the big screen until it finished and a couple of the small ones.    We managed to bag part of a table opposite one of the small screens (also with good sight the one with the Sweatty-Saffer  match on) so ok, but bascially surrounded by footie supporters who, as we know, are another breed entirely. by the time my GF arrived the footie crowd had well taken over our end of the place; had to employ a few League-style barges to make a lane.   
Coldest Guinness I can remember having since the USA.........   
might have a 3rd debutant in tow on Sat and may well revert to the REd Lion where Freebooter's masterclass can procede in relative calm.

Really, at this point, I am just looking for a room, any room, close to Loz, where people can stand around and drink/snack and chat for a few hours, whether we bring the booze or we pay the owner of the big room to serve it to us.

			This coming Thursday ( November 22), the Kantorei hosts a Turkey Dinner with Swiss trimmings. We dined there last year after watching the Christmas lights spring into action in Paradeplatz. Strolled across to the Niederdorf,  sipping warmed spiced apple cider and tasting other festive morsels, provided by store keepers. One of the best nights out in Zurich. Kantorei is at Neumarkt 2, 8001 Zurich, Tel: 044 252 2727. Like everywhere in Zurich, best to book.

			I would actually get out of Zug, head to Luzern, go up Pilatus, take the boat ride on Lake Lucern.   
The above posters cover probably the best things to do in Zug itself.

546	17.11.2012, 21:21	Newbie	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	Location: Milan	"   Having recently ""landed"" in Zurich from Italy as an expat, I would warmly recommend to all the Italians and the friends of Italy in this Forum the small but excellent Pizzeria Trattoria da Michele, whose philosophy could be summarized in the short statement: Italian cuisine with homemade ingredients, without compromises. It is conveniently located in the zone of Binz-Wiedikon, near to the Uetliberg railway station (UetlibergStrasse 109, 8045 Zurich; tel. 043 960 03 46- closed on Sunday).   As an Italian, I am immediately able to understand if the Italian dishes abroad are made according to what our mothers and wives prepare for us at home, and most often the best I can find is something that can be labeled Italian style. When dining at the restaurant Da Michele this is not the case. And the reason is very simple: the key ingredients and raw materials come from Italy or are purchased from Italians which produce them in Zurich, in compliance with the specifications of our ancient tradition. The quality is therefore unbelievably high.   
Just to give some specific examples: Micheles ravioli di magro ( maultaschen (?) filled with cheese, pumpkin or spinachs) are simply amazing, because they are home-made and always fresh. The same holds for tagliatelle, a kind of ribbon-like pasta that is processed in Italian houses according to secret recipes that every mother trades to her daughter, and so on The Pizza section of the menu is very rich and one appreciates immediately the quality of the real Italian tomato sauce and mozzarella, that I have seen badly imitated in Zurich, sometimes with very terrific outcomes. 
I am not a meat enthusiast, but I see that meat dishes are very praised by other clients.   
Coming from Sicily, don Michele (the owner) gives his best in cooking typical dishes of Southern Italy, sometimes very tasty and very different from Swiss food. Who is not a fitness addict should not miss the Italian dessert (a caloric bomb) at the end, and I suggest to conclude the meal with a real Italian expresso coffee and a small glass of mirto, a typical liquor from our islands, made from an aromatic plant (mirth).  
The restaurant has been opened recently and is still undergoing some upgrade, but can host about 20 people in a very cozy and Italian atmosphere. At noon is known and appreciated by the employees of the neighboring banks, while in the evening it is more frequent to find it hosting also groups of Italian friends, driven by the nostalgia for the Mediterranean sun.  
The owner Michele speaks a good German, and is always courteous and helpful in providing advice on the Italian dishes in the menu. He is assisted by Alexandra, a gorgeous, Pamela Anderson-class (or, for the Italian readers, Valeria Marini-class  ) blonde Hungarian lady, who adds a touch of Eastern European charm to the environment. 
Enjoy your meal!   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Sep 2012	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Small, cozy and really italian restaurant in zurich	musander	Posts: 2

			Hello, does anyone know from personal experience or knowledge whether you need to pay for the ticket of a small toddler (1.75 years old)? Let me be clear, I'm trying to go to the show on the cheap. My question comes from knowing she won't want to sit in her own seat and assuming she wouldn't be able to see the stage from her own seat at her size.   
I contacted the group earlier this week with no response. I'm happy to pay the extra ticket if I am supposed to, but I don't want to pay the extra ticket if lap children are par for the course for them.

Only the big German companies could finance their ideas. The German speaking Swiss TV corporation does some shows in co-operation with ZDF and ORF, often in the framework of Eurovision. So that you cannot split things as everything is closely connected.    
Ticino TV (RTSI) in a way is amazing, as that corporation by cable is selling its program throughout Italy. And so is fairly successful.

Really very good restaurant, with prices to match. In resorts like this most places will be open anyway, so you might like to check around.

			I will be staying in Zurich for a single night in a couple of weeks time and I'm interested in finding somewhere friendly for a foreigner (British) to hang out, maybe meet some interesting people around my own age. I'm a man in my early thirties. Ideally looking for a restaurant with bar that will be lively on a week night, but needs to have the right kind of atmosphere. I'm not interested in clubs or loud bars, would prefer somewhere where you can socialise and chat over a few drinks.   
I have no idea where I am staying yet, but will likely be close to the airport.   
Thanks very much. Jay.

			In Geneva we have at least two good thaï restaurants: one called ""Mik-Wong"" (one beside the McDonalds in Plainpalais, one near the station on Blvd James-Fazy), and one called ""La feuille de banane"" in the rue de Carouge.    
La feuille de banane does a killer green curry (also does yellow and red curries). They are  know for their serving speed (you practically get your food before you even ordered it. Perfect for take-away rather than a quiet evening).

			Argentino's is child-friendly, also try Alice ( ) which *should* be open on a Sunday.   
Do bear in mind that it might be a quiet weekend as Ticino has a holiday on Thursday.   
The former Mövenpick now call Ristorante Parco Ciani ( ) is also child-friendly and should be open.  The park is nice.   
Quartiere Maghetti will be closed on a Sunday so forget that area.   
You could find a grotto if you're in a car and if they're open.  Collina d'Oro has a few which are close to town....

			yes indeed look up the sites that were mentionned   
here are my personal recommendations regarding clubbing in general in the Zh(I posted this on another forum not long ago):   
Züri west has loads... Kreis 5 as a whole is fun day or night    
look for flyers for parties in the shops they're everywhere downtown(independent shops and bars often have flyer corners).   
every second thursday of the month at stall 6 (which is quite central, close to the Hbf) the guys from hum records(vinyl records shop in Kreis 4) play soul and funk and great overall music; go if you want a taste of something different.   
Club Q dress to impress and to dance   
Supermarket Club next to the Freitag shop.   
Zukunft. The place is so nice. And it's got that nice little strange underground vibe(it is underground after all ah!)    
there is so much going on, some would argue there's too much for such a small city.     
extra that I don't really know well 
Alte Börse, techno minimal and such 
Rohstofflager, lots of drum and bass, house music etc 
Hive club   
Rote Fabrik has the one off parties but it's mostly concerts.   
There is a LOT going on. If you want more detailed recommendations please give more info as to what you are after.

			Just a small update, I've been to Irrsinn bar on Friday (Rebgasse 43, in kleinbasel, next corner from Hirscheneck). 
Mostly metal, punk and HC was played from moderately bad sound system. Decent price for Appenzeller and fairly young alternative crowd. 
Down sides: fumoar and a tad too fancy looking for an ""underground place"" (yes I was expecting chains and skulls). 
Bottom line: I think it will become a regular stop for me.   
But I'm still looking for more places like this, so if anyone has anything similar to suggest I'm all ears (erm, eyes).

			Hi all, just giving my new little social effort in Basel here a shameless plug. Please join the group at:   if you are interested in a social dinner club and lets see what happens.   
The idea behind the Social Dinner Club is that I firmly believe that eating alone all of the time is not good for one.  ...To solve this problem, I propose a group where people can create an event and mention how many people they would like to meet up with, when, where, what sort of form the dinner would take and then others can join. 
 Not only would we all get to know new people but also would be able to experience new foods and have enjoyable meals more often with great company. 
I am sorry, but I am only running this on Facebook due to limited bandwidth for organising things on multiple forums.  If anybody is keen but not a member of Facebook, I will also offer to send out email invites to events so please drop me an email if you like. 
Ciao.

For my part, I am more and more looking for non-smoking restaurants. Any good tips anyone?? We currently avoid eating out as a family as the kids can't wait to be out of the smoking environment, which has a tendency to create some tension in what is meant to be a pleasant experience!  When available the non-smoking section still tends to be located in the most unattractive part of the restaurant.

			On Friday night we ate at the  in Fribourg to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were a large group of 15 (inc. children), some of whom had only basic French. However, the staff were incredibly patient, friendly and efficient despite some mind-changing over orders etc. 
I chose the seasonal salad starter and a main course of Steak Tartare Italienne, with slithers of fresh parmesan, flavoured with truffle oil, and served with a small salad and chips. It was bloody delicious; good quality chopped beef with that tasty earthy truffle flavour   (could have done with a little more toast though) 
Other people had the house speciality, entrecote served in the pan with a taragon-flavoured café de Paris. I had a taste of someone's and that too was excellent, cooked by you to your own preference at the table. the moules marinière were also delicious (had a quick taste of those too  ). We'd brought our own birthday cake which they were happy to cut and serve for us. 
We paid 100.- per person, including the wine (which was quite a few bottles, as I recall  ) and are planning to head back for my birthday next month. 
Highly, highly recommended.

			I've encountered a lot of people recently who write, read, work with words in some way or another. The common complaint is that they feel isolated, alone and all Angsty Artist in the Garret.    
Thing is, loads and loads of wordy folk are out there/out here, all feeling lonely. So I've made it my mission to corral them into one place -  . It's a FREE ezine which comes out every two months, rounding up reviews, interviews, literary events, workshops, blogs, competitions and various distractions for the perennial procrastinator. Our main hunting ground is Zürich, but we include interesting nuggets from Tasmania to Tromso.

			Schloss Wülflingen, just outside Winterthur, is good, but if you're looking for something special, I really recommend Schlössli Wörth. This is right at the Rheinfalls so has a great view in addition to great food.  It's about 20 minutes drive fom Winterthur.

			There are many excellant cinemas around Switzerland that, thankfully, show films in their original language. This most important when the script is central to the film, unlike action films etc.   
So I thought I would start this thread for those who like drama, especially in its original language.   
Yesterday, we went to see Wuthering Hights at the Movie Kino Zurich. 
The best redition of the book that I have ever seen. 
For those who don't know the story, it is tragic in the extream. The setting was perfectly chosen and I think it was extreamly authentic.   
Have seem any good drama recently. 
Please let use know what you think.

			Fork and Bottle come to mind. They have a little stable across the road. Fantastic food and definitely kids friendly. You can get there by bus or train though it is just outside the city.       
There are also parks like Josefwiese right by the viaduct that has a little cafe and a good playground with wading pool. It's full of family with kids. Baeckeranlage is another one. Smaller park, more centrally located. Has a tiny cafe and small playground. Also filled with families and kids.   
If you can't visit them, I would google these two parks/playgrounds for pictures. Josefwiese is really very nice. The Viaduct Markthalle is right next door and makes it easy to get a picnic together. The kiosk mans its grill at 17:30. There is also a restaurant from the viaduct that spills into the park, if anyone prefers something nicer.

			I am not sure that Café des Arts would be a good place for a hen party. It, and its clientel, can be a little on the pretentious side. I think a group of ladies out on the lash might raise eyebrows, if you know what I am saying.   
Plus, for a bar that thinks of itself as a somewhat ""sophistiqué"", there is no excuse for serving mojitos made with Rose's lime cordial, like they did to me a few years back...!   
Cargo Bar, down by the Johanniterbrücke, might worth stopping by, at least for a while. Eo Ipso in Gundeli is a pretty relaxed place and they do fairly decent cocktails. Unfortunately, it's just a little out of the way.

			Hi there,   
A group of friends and I will be in Lausanne this September. It turns out that after a few drinks we always end up looking for a karaoke place. So just to be prepared, we are kind of wondering if there are any karaoke places in Lausanne.   
Does anybody know a karaoke bar in Lausanne?   
Any other suggestion about the nightlife in Lausanne would be nice (clubs, bars, live music venues)!   
Thanks!

			just wondering if this place is still open or not? i ask as i walked past the other day, sign outside says live music 1 night only  but that was in december!    
i assume its shut as no businesss would leave a sign outside for 6 months after the event happened.... or maybe    
i went in once shortly after it opened, the owner or manager had an attitude he was doing you a favour allowing you to be there, have heard similar reports from other people, never been back.

			Hi, 
Just reviving the thread, I went to this place last Saturday and the music was great (Deep/Tech House not mainstream dance/house music), I really enjoyed it, very recommendable  if you like this music.   
Cheers,

			I've been about five times, often when I have visitors. It is quite expensive, but an interesting experience. You have to book months in advance, but sometimes you can call on the day and get cancellations.   
CNN ran a story about a place in New York which has basically ripped off the idea. They way they told it the place in the New York was a ""world first"". This was utter rubbish. The waiters wore nightvision goggles and it was not total darkness. In the blind cow the waiters ARE blind, and there is absolutely no light allowed.

			Hi Sarah,   
This sounds like my dream night out as I love Band of Skulls.  However I have not yet moved over to Switzerland (4 weeks and counting)    I'm a little worried about meeting people of a similar age or with the same interests as there doesn't seem to be many of them in my field of work (pharma)!   
Enjoy the gig even if you go on your own!

			My favourite wine bar has to be Rossario's. The selection of meats and cheese is also nice    Sadly, it too is still a smoking bar and as it is quite small it can get quite smoky.  Best bet is to sit outside in the summer and enjoy the fresh air!

Anyone else any recommendations? by the way, I'm asking for kids menus not just because kids can be picky sometimes but also because it's much cheaper. We have three children, and if we have to pay for full meals for them, it gets very expensive..

			Just come back from the Auberge du Bon Accueil, in Malbuisson, by Lac St Point, just over the (Jura) mountain from Nyon. 1 Michelin star and 15/20 at Gault&Millau.   
As it was to celebrate 2 birthdays (missed the opportunity in Feb/March) we pushed the boat out and took the best menus - 87 Euros- for about 7 courses, including 4 different puddings, and 1 glass of fantastic wine with each main course, including Mersault, Fleuirie, Loire Bourgeuil and yellow vin de paille- beautiful decor, mix or rustic and modern and very attentive and yet friendly service. Would highly recommend it. We had Comté feuilletés. wild garlic and cream soup, fera (fish) with mange-tout,  lamb with cabbage and orange zest, a gentian and mandarin sorbet... then pistacchio ice-cream, followed by a choice of amazing desserts then ... sesame tuiles and madeleines with fruit salad!!! All small but perfectly formed portions- fantastic.   
 I asked Mrs FAivre to show me the rooms. The cheaper ones are en-suite but a bit dated and (quiet) roadside at 65E, but the Junior suites are really lovely and on the quiet side, large, mix of rustic and modern, nice bathroom. More expensive but still very reasonable. A couple of minutes walk from the lake, about 10 mins to Pontarlier (and 15 mins from us).   
2 minutes away is another great but very different restaurant  at L'Hotel du Lac, très 'vieille France', Louis XVI furniture, chandeliers, and a fabulous view of the Lake, with rooms with balcony facing the Lake. Visiting both would make such a pleasant contrast. Enjoy. The lake is great for swimming, canoing, windsurfing, sailing, with several rental/school places, and of course a fab area for walking, cycling and cross-country skiing in winter + skating if the conditions are right.

			Leiter is all pictorial, no or hardly no words. Just black and white ink. 
Do tell me what you think if you go. Leiter is one of those Swiss who is very critical of some aspects of Switzerland, money, large companies here for tax reasons and plundering the world, etc. Acid humour- and so often spot on.    
Google him for an idea perhaps.

			The Hotel Montana in Luzern is great for this - fantastic views, great food and a cocktail and jazz bar as well.    
In Zurich maybe try the Widder hotel with cocktail bar and restaurant.. you could make use of the free limo pick up and drop off service for the Zurich area, or there is La Salle in the schiffbau with a rooftop cocktail bar.   
There's also the garden restaurant or the main restaurant at The Dolder Grand.   
 I guess it all depends on your personal preference of food, bars, price etc!     
I can highly recommend both the hotel Montana and the service at La Salle although we found it hard to get served at the rooftop bar.    
We haven't had the chance to try the Widder or the Dolder Grand yet.    
I hope that helps and that you have a fabulous time wherever you go! x

			YES! It was possible! I'll recommand ""Cote Parc"", 3 rue du Parc, near Rive. Got there at 6.15 p.m., very friendly service. Lots of gorgeous pasta dishes (the home made ravioli with curry sauce a must), still a bit stiff price wise (20  CHF), but we were in and out within an hour, with time for a coffee, then jump on to water bus across to theatre. Great! And I have noticed quite a few other small restaurant (L'Envers du Decor...) nearby, open for business at 6.30)

			Hi there, 
Does anyone have any restaurant recommendations for Lutry? Preferably something that has vegetarian options - unfortunately not many of the restaurants seem to have online menus which is not very helpful!

			I am a carnivore and enjoyed going to brazilian steakhouses and such while living in the states.   
Is there anything comparable in Zurich? I read about La Cote, unfortunately they don't offer their all you can eat to single guests...   
Any recommendation as well as ""stay away"" warning is appreciated.

			Well depending on how much you would like to impress her, we live in the Lauvaux, there is a place called Le Deck at the Le Baron Tavernier in Chexbres, about 15 minutes from Lausanne (we also take visitors there to impress).  If you take the autoroute there is an exit for Chexbres.  The view is incredible over the lac and mountains and it is sophisticated.  If you call ahead maybe you can reserve a tent like space for the two of you that looks out over the view.  There is parking right there.  We love it for a drink and try to get a time when the sun is setting.  The food is better in the restaurant at the Tavern (in fact it is one of the best restaurants we like) than outside on the deck.  So if you decide to have dinner go to the tavern.  You can google and check it out on line.  Also good for a nice romantic walk.....

			I discovered this place a couple of months ago, and I really like it. They have all sorts of teas and they're famous for their hot/cold chocolates! Inside is cosy, every table, chair, etc is different, and you can buy everything in the restaurant, from the lamps to the tables, decoration, etc. They sell lots of different teas, cakes.

Hope you can enjoy better meal there around as well, enjoy your holidays

I'm dancing Salsa since maybe 1 year, and I started to learn Bachata lately, and I'm looking for a dancing partner, or someone who likes to dance it a lot so we can practice dancing. Anyone interested? 
I go sometimes to Salsa clubs, but I don't like random selections 
I need someone some how to be fixed to improve dancing faster   
Cheers,

the Helvetiaplatz morning market is a great place for sourcing meat for me with a huge variety from bunnies, pigeons, wildpork, chicken, beef, etc.. the Familie Fiechter , every Friday   
there-s one fast food, Hua Thai at Escher Wyss Platz, authentic thai restaurant can b found at Langstrasse area

And Ege, if I'm also not mistaken, usually has a nice variety of baklava and other nice turkish goodies on hand.  I do like the butcher there too.     
Never eaten at the resturant part, is it nice homestyle cooking like Ferdinand, or more things like doner kebab?

brilliant but still simple recipe,keep that one in mind. 
However before I have all the ingredients gathered,I rather pick up some Indian from Sawasdee or Sushi from Kaiten. It's a bit of a walk but well worth it anytime.

If you google map the Hallenstadion area, it's very near Sternen Oerlikon where many restaurants are along Schaffhauserstrasse

749	16.01.2012, 04:24	Newbie	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: zurich	"    I think it is all to do with overhead. If you have table service, the ration is around 6 tables per waiter, so how many more people they have to employ? can they afford to charge the same if they have table service?   
I personally do not mind self service, as I can order and get what I want rather than wait for someone to come and take order. It might be the same amount of time but the feeling of ""just 2 person ahead of me"" than ""I don't know where the waiter is and how long would this be now?"" then you have to wait for someone to come and give you a bill!    
with the customer service being bashed in CH so much, I actually think self service may not be a bad thing. I once was in a restaurant for a leaving do and we started at 7, some of us are late so 7:30 when everyone arrived. The waiter did not bother to come and ask for order until 8 (despite he taken the extra order for drinks), then the food did not appear until 8:30.. on and on.. took another half an hour to pay at the end because he cannot work out who has what. So for a school night that a meal taken 4 hours is crap.

			Try and look for LUMA Beef. It's an innovative Swiss product which is not too easy to come across.   
Hand picked cuts of Beef are dry aged on the bone 5-7 weeks with a special Mould which matures over it under laboratory conditions. You can compare the results to how wine and cheese improves with aging. Not cheap though but good!

			Hi JustRose,   
If I remember correctly, you said in an earlier post you recently moved from from NYC. Comparatively, there are few really good restaurants in Basel, and very few do anything particularly interesting, adventurous or different on their menus. That said, they are rarely bad either, mostly just good average.    
I would however recommend the following to go to with out of towners:     - Portuguese influenced food in a pleasant setting. It is a little on the pricey side though.     - Indian (obviously) and done very well. Just make sure to reserve well in advance. Also a little pricey.      - run by sight-impaired people, you eat in total pitch darkness.c Food was decent here, as were the prices, and if you go for the surprise menu when you order, you can try guessing what are eating and find out if you were right agfterwards when you leave.      - inexpensive (by Swiss standards) Asian food. Great for a quickish meal that's tasty.      - new-ish piza place that's run by the Piadina Bar people. Great, choose-your-own-topping pizza.   
One place to  at all costs is  , just off Gerbergasse. It's the one and only truly abysmal place I've been to in BS.   
E guete!

			I've had some really great times at Bleu Lezard in Lausanne, on three occasions when I was back home for Xmas.     
Upstairs in the resto they convert it into a disco, and the regular disco/bar downstairs plays more younger generation stuff.   You can slide up and down to both areas.   
Probably too late for a table in the resto for eats, but when they finish the meals the party really begins, and they open the doors for an entry fee for both up and downstairs. Party lasts until dawn....   
There is a great view too to Pont Bessier and the Cathdral all lighted up.   
I have been known to dance on a few tables to some great old funky tunes, so if you see someone acting way too foolish for his middle age, that'll be me,  if I can get over from Oxford that weekend.

			The only Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurant that was worth visiting (IMO) with any regularity in Zurich closed a number of years back...that was Poco Loco.  We never really tried much of the menu beyond the fajitas, but those were definitely worth the journey to Letzigrund.  I understand there's still a Poco Loco in Lausanne, but I've never been to that one.  Come back to Zurich, Poco Loco, we miss you!   
I haven't been to Tres Kilos in a few years, but I remember that it was just ok, so maybe 5/10 IMO.

			Hey, I know this is a little late now but thought I would post a couple of places in-case you visit again.   
The Felsenegg is great:       
Off the beaten path and chilled out. I am a UK expat and have taken lots of friends there.    
Alternatively, check out Opus:       
Bit more in town and busier. When you reserve ask to be seated in the wine room/cellar, better atmosphere.   
Both are on the pricey side but in these cases you get some great food in return (not always the case in Switzerland!).   
Have fun.

			On Sunday night, a few of us decided to go for a snowy walk and reserve a table at one of the remote auberges in the Jura.   
Our experience was SOOO fantastic, that I have to give a special recommendation, and thought I'd do so by leaving space for others to rate their own experiences of mountain restaurants.   
There's no website, but it's called   and is about a 30-45 minute walk from La Givrine train station.    
A friend recommended this place to us and claimed that they had one of the best fondues. Against my better judgment (due to the fact that the Buvette le Vermeilley just up the road had a range of different fondues, and even had a three-in-one-pot option), we put it to the test and we have to agree. The fondue was far better than anything we've ever had before.   
Also, a special insider's tip which some of you may have heard about, is to dip your bread in some kirsch (schnapps not liqueur) just before drenching it in fondue. Out of this world!    
The staff here were also extremely pleasant. We were four: 3 Germans and 1 US/Canadian, and so languages were being thrown around left and right. Although they normally do not stay open on Sunday nights, we chatted with them for hours and they treated us to schnapps and wine on the house as well as a lovely jar of jam.    
In terms of the ambience, it was very warm and cozy - perfect after a few hours of hiking in the cold. Candles light up the entire room and the dining room is a very personable affair. We would have stayed longer if we hadn't a train to catch.   
If you do visit, tell the owners that the Canadian redhead and 3 Germans sent you   "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Mar 2011	Groaned at 43 Times in 28 Posts	Mountain restaurants/auberges in the Jura: reviews	M. Ploymi	Posts: 899

I have also seen Zurich's fireworks. You are correct that the fireworks in Zurich and Sydney don't compare however Zurich's fireworks would struggle to equal 1 of the 3 barges used in Sydney.  Ziurich has a lake Sydney has a massive bridge that is used to support the show.   
Sydney is the benchmark for NYE fireworks. I admit bias, yes but Zurich's fireworks don't come close to Sydney.

			OP, I'll be brief as I'm on my phone. I think I've seen a few of your events, and forgive me for being blunt, but the ones I remember are quite gimmicky and kitschy... the Spanish night, I'd rather go to a Spanish restaurant, same goes for the Mexican and Indian nights.   
These are the sort of theme nights that'd work well in provincial English town back street pubs but you must remember that most expats in CH are quite sophisticated. Speaking as a food pro I really suggest you up your game.... try a proper traditional English food night, and I'm talking serious quality, Rabbit Pie, Lincolnshire Chine, proper Fish pie etc etc, the type of food that Brits should be proud of and spread the word to the locals as well, they will be surprised!     
I host ploughmans lunches in Rapperswil which is much further than Zurich than you are, we use very high quality ingredients in a simple English way, no gimmicks and I rarely get less than 100 people, some from afar away as Geneva.   
If you'd like me to host one at your pub in the spring get in touch and we can talk. It might help to find out if it is your approach or just location.

			I was at Mojito's in Schlieren (so Canton Zurich not Stadt Zurich) and I really liked the ambience. You didn't feel like you were in Switzerland. So much so I kept answering the staff in Spanish although they were speaking German! The food was decent as well. Definitely more Tex Mex than Mex.....light on the manteca de puerco!

			When I met my (Swiss) husband, he would put mayonnaise and/or mustard on just about anything and everything. But he has since converted to BBQ sauce... even on hot dogs!    
I myself prefer to slather my steak with this funny little substance called ""A1"" steak sauce. I have no idea what's in it (and I'm not so sure I   to know), but I likey...    
Anyways, I remember my (tyrant) step-father once yelled at me for using a sauce on my steak. He seemed to think that it defeated the purpose of eating steak since it overwhelmed it. Hence, I *strongly* believe that anyone and everyone should be able to put whatever they choose on their mmmmeat and should no longer live in fear of the Steak Nazis!

			Just to let any home-sick people know that the choir of St Andrew's Church, Zürich, will be singing ten very well-known English Christmas Carols tomorrow (Saturday 26th Nov) in the ""Singing Christmas Tree"" in Werdmühleplatz, central Zürich, first at 5:30pm then at 6:30pm (two half-an-hour sets).   
If you want to come and join in, you'd be most welcome, provided you can sing more or less in tune (you can just sing the melody) ! We are meeting at St. Andrew's, Promenadengasse, above Stadelhofen station (about one minute's walk from tram-stop Kunsthaus) at 4pm, where music will be handed out. Then we have to meet next to the tree at 4:45pm to put on pixie cloaks, hats, scarves and gloves that are provided by the organisers. Please PM if you'd like to come, since we need to prepare enough copies for everyone, and we're also supposed to tell them roughly how many people will take part. Also bring a black A4 folder. We have the music and a hole-punch !   
May see you there ! Otherwise drop by the Tree to listen. Plenty of videos of this event on youtube. Just search under ""Singing Christmas Tree"".   
best wishes,

I'm hoping it is the Top Secret Drummers of the future.  It starts at 19:30pm at the Stadtcasino.  Tickets are free but you need to reserve your seat online.  You then get a PDF file to print out at home.

(and would perhaps elevate the quality of the evening, making the venue and the night more popular in the long run)     
""Chris"" is the guy who runs the pub and is worth talking to.   
The environment is 'intimate', but a lot of fun.   
The equipment available I assume will depend on what you can arrange in advance.   
Best to either go there sometime and check it out for yourself, or send Chris a PM (link here to  )

			Most of the cinemas show some films in English, just look for "" "" - the capital ""E"" indicates that audio is English and lowercase ""d/f"" that there are German and French subtitles.   
E.T.A.  Sbrinz beat me to it, and that is a good link becasue you can filter to show only films that are in English.

			Thanks for that, Gata. Clubhouse was a mad house with the Rugby World Cup final (fun, too).  Turns out the English pub down the road did a 'facsimile' breakfast - but doesn't open until 12.   
It seems to me that living in the 'French' part of Switzerland, the dominance is on croissants and pain au chocolat to start the day.   
The big find of the weekend was the discovery that 'roti' is rather like 'hash browns' and accordingly, Cafe du Bourg-de-Four (13, place du Bourg-de-Four) was a delicious find. Again, it doesn't open til 11am - but delicious.   
Cafe-librairie livresse in Augustins also do nice brunch.  Not open on Sundays.   
I'll let you know if I find ""the one""... but would be grateful for any and all suggestions.

			Ok, it's not cheap. But I can feel more comfortable with 1 franc tip at a pub then a percentage tip at nicely deco'd, with everyone paying attention to my every detail. In a pub, I am like any other Tom Dick and Harry. I might even come off as an ass for giving to high of a tip in a pub.   
So that makes the cost of the Guiness v. Amarone pretentious wine more balanced.   
In any case, the Guinness does taste like they refile twice the carbonation thru it then a can of coke at the pubs here.

			I totally agree. But I can't be too picky. Unless of course they announce a full line of shows next year, but, based on the last 10 years, it seems doubtful. I saw some online video of the three trying to sell posters of these dates for support of why they are doing the shows, and they genuinely looked so dis interested in being in the same room together. Well, I guess that might be easy to say for the last 20 years or so, as well, at least.

I just want to share the experience of a good dinner for two.  Yesterday  I bought voucher on Groupon to go to Italian restaurant with 50% discount.  there are 2 options: for 59 Chf you choose any entry and pizza and dessert ( for two persons) And for 79 CHF you get 1 entry drink, entry, main course and dessert for two. This is the official part.  
Now not official part. You really can choose whatever you like with no limitations, place is in the centre of Geneva, owner is very nice and sincerely hospitable, cook well and truly Italian cuisine So I can only recommend to try

Or Burger King

			Hi Windycityfamily,   
I've been to the Swiss Christmas but didn't think it was that great to be honest.    
Please note I've seen the Cirque du Soleil which is probably one of the world's best, so perhaps that's why I don't rate Swiss Christmas.   
Perhaps others can enlighten us.

			We've done girls nights out (often Friday) in Lorenzinis, ask for one of their big special rooms upstairs ( it has chandeliers and looks fab) and you can really start your party with dinner and drinks. Then you head downstairs (pretty late!!)and you can also reserve their bar area ( by reserving a bottle of champagne) which has seats and is set off from the dance floor. We've done their 'Celebreighties' over 30's nights but they have other nights other weeks. The upstairs dining room allows for all sorts of fun,(we often have birthday parties with fun 'tasks'..) it's private and I don't think it costs any more. usgang.ch has all the Bern events by calendar so you will be restricted to what's on. We did Liquid too, we had at least 20 for a leaving party and that was wild but ended up really expensive (1500chf!) because they kept filling the ice buckets with drinks!! Whatever you do, have a fab time, good luck   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Jul 2011	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Hen Night somewhere in Bern or Murten	MrsJPS	Posts: 71

			I you want one mixed, with no stop in the beat, you'll need a DJ app and a little time to work it out and put it together, all your songs would also need to be around the same tempo.    is free for home users and is extremely popular.   
Otherwise, it's normally possible to set the cross fade between songs in iTunes or any other player to give a continous flow of music.

			Mövenpick has a really good Zürigschnätzlets. The only restaurant left in Zurich is the Palavrion. More information here      
They actually have a great promotion at the moment. Dinner 42 which means that you can order any starter and any main court and a great ice cream for only CHF 42 - not bad        
They also have a bar next door so you can go for a drink afterwards. Enjoy!

			amazingly enough, Switzerland hosts a pretty large country concert every year with the feature artist this year being Trace Adkins. we got our tickets and are ready for a fun concert this coming weekend, but we are way late in planning and only just started looking into hotels.... 
why are hotels in Gstaad OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive??!   we're considering a ""sleeping on straw"" deal for 25chf a person (including breakfast) but also a 25 minute walk to the concert. other than that, the best we've found is around 250EUR for a small double room...insane! we might just end up doing the drive back to zurich (which would be no fun since that requires a DD) 
any suggestions on relatively cheap hotels in Gstaad??! 
Thanks!

			Hi everyone, 
I am looking for a placer to celebrate my 30th bday party ... with nice music (not techno nor hip hop extremes, just a good mix with a decent dj and a nice dance floor), possibly somewhere nice to eat nearby. To give you an idea for my boyfriend birthday we went to purpur and everyone loved it.  
I have heard of this place called The Loft, I have never been there, but they have a truck at the streetparade and the DJ was quite good. 
Anyone's been there? How is it? Any advice?   
Thanks in advance

			Thanks a million for that. It I checked the link you sent me and I see that they have a lot of matches on. I'm guessing they have multiple screens.   
Do they have the sound on for all the different matches? It's frustrating watching with no commentary or listening to a different match in the background.   
Cheers,

			mexican food here is just strange. sweetly spiced and weird, not at all mexican. there is a columbian bakery just near us that has delicious empanadas, tamales and sweet things. also, there is a new chilean joint on rue de la borde though i haven't tried it yet.    
peg a., i make tamales once, maybe twice a year (christmas and my son's birthday) and you are right, only good if you are making alot- i'll let you know in advance and you are welcome to come join in on the yumminess.   
i'm pretty happy with what we have here in lausanne (especially since i found holy cow with some decent burgers and fries) but what i wouldn't give for a supper of chicken and biscuits. that is truly americana food and down home goodness...

			Dear All   
Firstly, thank you to all of you who responded to my initial Invitation to join me at the Hotel Schwan in Horgen for my Vernissage of original oil paintings on September 8th at 5-7pm and I look forward to meeting with you all and sharing a drink or two.     
As the event is fast approaching I have to now firm up on numbers with the hotel for the catering of the free drinks and canapes.  For those of you who were looking to further confirm numbers when asking friends and relatives can I ask that you please let me know your final numbers by Friday 2nd September.   
For those of you who did not see the initial invitation please let me know asap if you would like an invitation sending to join us for the evening as it is now becoming rather full but it promises to be a lovely evening.   
For example of originals please see suzannecannon.com

			Has anyone been there?  Can't seem to find much about it on the interweb - half of what I have found says that they are showing the football world cup   but other pages indicate it is still running this year.    
Am starting to panic as have a couple of schoolfriends coming out this weekend - had planned a quiet one but their FB posts suggest they are packing for fancy bars   (can't understand it - they've both been to Switz before).  Anyone any thoughts on the sunset beach bar?  Otherwise, any suggestions for what to do in the area this Saturday night.  We're too old for a proper club (pushing 40) but a nice bar with cool drinks and good music would be great.  Will head into Zurich if can't find anthing around here.   
Thanks for any tips! 
Vic 
PS - I had thought of trying Magma in Schinznach since I live near there but other posts on here rave about it being great for smokers and that's put me off a bit.  Not too smokey would be great (though I know that's maybe asking a bit much).

			Hey guys,    
So I'm going to Geneva for a few days for the first time and wondering where the nightlife ""hotspots"" are for a non French speaking tourist.  
Maybe clubs, but bars and pubs with a good vibe (and people who can speak a bit of English) are more what I'm looking for.

Made some big hits on the Dragon Legend lately, of course that is all a luck thing to get the right machine.   
Seen some people drop well over a thousand before any big win comes out of it... then again (as noted earlier) 20 Franks + 2 minutes = CHF 2000.-    
Happy gambling

			Hi,   
My personal experience (I'm a great sushi fan) is that neither of the places is worth the price or hardly deserve to call ""sushi"" to what they offer. Personally I find the one on take-away in Manor better, even if still far far away from decent.   
The lack of a decent Japanese place in Nyon has been torturing me for a while but only hope stays a trip to Geneve or Lausanne.   
Sad, very sad.

			hi Martin, I'm not sure what your budget is, but for the Paradeplatz area Bindella springs to mind:    
I've taken people to Buendnerstube before, which is nice because it's a little roomier than other places:    
I haven't been in awhile (hello credit crunch), but I used to quite like this place:    
Bü's is alright:    
Bubbles is right - Brasserie Lipp is also reliably good.   
I've tried Coco's right on Paradeplatz with work contacts before and it was an epic failure. The food's nice and the service is usually attentive, but it's such a small space and gets really, really loud at lunchtime.

I download most of my books anymore via amazon/itunes, but if I really wanted to go on a treeware binge, it'd cost me less to fly to london and go crazy for an afternoon on Charring Cross. I dunno, I get a bit irritated with touristy blogs that masquerade as 'hey, we're local!', especially since none of the serious bibliophile I know buy more than the very occasional book from said bookstore.

I will go there again, whenever I prefer that nice Moroccan restaurant just two streets towards the lake.        thanks. The Shahi it was. True, the one those folks in Basel right now have on their program is above, but i have been in the Shahi about three times (since 1990) and I liked the place, each time had either lamb or beef vindaloo, and appreciated it. Geneva still is a very good place with restaurants of many different kinds.     
I when in Geneva in an evening always simply walk around in the Quartier Paquis which I like, and I sometimes see that a nice restaurant is gone, but often detect one I did not see on previous visits. I like it that there are so many Arab places in that quarter now, in an increasing way.

			Last Sunday we had brunch at La Ferme du Chateau.      
It was delightful! It is set up in such a way that you are able to keep an eye on your children while seating at your table and enjoying the company of your friends and/or family. There is a square yard with tables around the perimeter and then several farm related rid on toys, a swing set, and a playhouse with slide. In addition, there are many fun animals and birds for the children to see - a parrot, llamas, peacocks, and more. The shade availability is also great, which is sometimes a hassle to find for newborns and infants not yet allowed to use sunscreen.   
I will say that the food was not necessarily ""amazing."" Your standard fare of different breads, cheeses, yogurts, eggs, croissants, etc. It was not bad by any means, just nothing spectacular. However, when considering the fact that I was able to leisurely eat my meal and talk to friends for hours without my toddler or infant pitching a fit, they could have served a crap meal and I'd probably still go again.   
Anyhow, two thumbs up. Now I just need to find the equivalent experience in Canton Zurich.

			Hello! My husband and I are planning our 1st anniversary party for July 31st, I know, leaving it a bit late but we've just found out that my parents and grandparents are coming over from Australia and the US so we thought it'd be nice to throw a party so they can meet all our friends and the extended members of my husbands family.   
Anyway! I'm searching for a venue with very little luck so far- any ideas? It'll be about 30 people, and we'd love an outdoor location, or on the lake or river.   
AND catering! Any and all recommendations are greatly appreciated! Our budget is about 5000chf for the whole thing.....   
thanks!

			A bit out of town, local fare, stunning spot:  .  
A classic, if you don't at least stop for a drink you haven't been in town:   (horrid pizzas though, but the plat du jour at lunch is quite decent).     - overpriced (like all) but tasty, good international style food. 
The T-Bar is a nice café/sports bar, where you can stop at lunch for light fare (and Bruce is a fun guy). 
Le Chalet d'Adrien is the local 5 stars, but the café side (le Grenier) offers a nice tartar steak, not too overpriced. 
Off-Shore of course - off season however - bof bof.

only issue was the wind on the terrasse, as we were sitting in the shade and we ended up being real cold by the end of our lunch.

			I moved to ZürcherOberland last June.  My wife gained employment here and I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to move here.  I've found there is more music happening than I can possibly attend, both time wise and financially.  I happen to like just about every style, yes even the local amateur groups.  I'm a percussionist, used to hanging in classical, jazz and pop circles.  There are a number of sites that post concerts, jam sessions, etc.  Like anywhere else, it's all about networking, which for me is a challenge as I am slow to learn German.  If you can master the language, it will be better.  I have found many musicians in the larger cities speak English.  I've had a couple of gigs so far and the pay is pretty decent.  Good luck!

What is the point of having a night time event with beautifully lit lanterns, costumes & head gear, only to be ruined by flash photos.  It can also temporarily blind those taking part - matching in near darkness only to be blitzed by a flash.       
Note it is not just people with flashing cameras that are not approved of -  they also fine shops who don't switch of their lights and logos and have to be covered up by hand with large ""black bin bags"".

			I see that you are catering for 40 people , how big is the Barbie cake going to be??   What size Barble will they be sticking into it??  They are quoting Sfr7.50 per a piece, which is a bit high.   
Why dont you bake one yourself?  Use a Gugelhupf form - place another muffin on top, you will need a bit of height, cover the cake with marzipan, add some flowers (the sugar ones from the supermarket) and stick the doll in the middle, add the same colour marzipan for the top of the dress.   
And you can serve cupcakes for the others, clearly you wont get 40 pieces from a Gugelhupf.  I made one for my daughter's 3rd birthday, but I dont have any pics, the camera battery was dead, typical.  Here is a link which has instructions

			it was late saturday afternoon so place wasn't too busy and thus not too smoky yet - not sure how they get around the ban but on the day (5th) there was a Davidoff rep there giving out free cigars...and the bartender was chatting to us quite a bit and slipped us a couple of free espresso martinis too...   
I swear i'm not biased because i got all the free stuff though....   
Overall the bar there is quite old school - big comfy seats - older clientèle - we also had food which was excellent and for a place right off Bahnhofstrasse i was pleasantly surprised with the prices....   
So to summarize - Just try it!

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

			Welcome to Luzern!  Only just came across this thread looking for something else.   
I emailed a few clubs I wanted to play at, and one got back to me and now gives me regular gigs.  It probably helped that I knew someone behind the bar at the time.   
For your style you might want to consider going round all the clubs that already play it.  The most popular places for house and edm nights are Pravda, Casineum, Nautilus and the Loft but I think they already have a rosta of Djs.  Rok might be worth a shot too.   
You should also check the more indie clubs, Bar 59 (where I play) don't seem to mind experimenting with different DJs , there's also Sedel and Gewerberhalle, but they usualy just do organised events and don't really have their own DJs AFAIK.   
Also, ask in the bars you like, even if they don't have DJs, they might be tempted.   
Good lUck

			Hi Fingersrossed! 
Thanks for your wonderful recco. We went to Le Baron Tavennier and had the most sumptious meal yesterday! Of course the deck was closed so we sat in the restaurant that really does have the most stunning views of the lake.  
We were initially disappointed because we read on their site that they are closed on Mon, the day of our luncheon. But we still called them and they agreed to open the restaurant for us since we were a large party of 15 people for lunch!!  
We're looking fwd to a great family lunch....thanks again for the recco....   "	annoyed a few people around here	Join Date: May 2010	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Looking for scenic restaurants..Lausanne, Montreux...	rajix	Posts: 30

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just biased because of our friendship. Believe me, he's capable of much better than what we saw on TV last night. He was just nervous (as we saw from his body language and terrible piano playing). Now that he's through to the next round, hopefully he'll relax a bit and deliver the kind of singing I know he's capable of. I think people will be quite surprised.

			We ended up at La Ferme for Christmas Eve dinner.  Great restaurant with excellent food that was a real pleasure to eat and all done in a cosy rustic setting that was both tasteful and attractive.  Pricey but certainly a great place for the special occasion dinner.

987	30.12.2010, 15:06	Junior Member	Thanked 16 Times in 8 Posts	Location: Lausanne	"    I think most cities outside CH now how to throw a New Years' Party. 
For me, it was summed up by the SSF-DRS television coverage of the turning of the year. 
For the hours leading up to midnight, there was the big, multi-national Germanic-speaking TV extravaganza that is Musikantenstadl -- then 5 mins. before midnight, it switched to a Swiss village church with an organist and a girl playing the alphorn - everyone else had forgotten to turn-up. Then it moved to a restaurant, with a few oldies dancing about a bit, and the younger ones swaying from side-to-side on their chairs, with the traditional Swiss ""oom-pah"" quartet playing away in the background. Ten minutes later, it went back to Austria (Musikantenstadl), and people having fun, again.  
[N.B. I was subjected to this for the benefit of the wife - the London firework spectacular, was obviously an hour later]. 
When I questioned that this was maybe a bit staid for New Year, my wife replied that this is what the people want and are used to. 
Hopefully in ZH, GE, and BE there was a bit more of a party.

			Thanks a lot for your replies, and for the correct spelling of ""Charbonnade"" with double n  
- Yes it is meat grilled on a table grill. I remember it as very thin slices, and as being very delicious. I dont think it will be the same as ""Heisser Stein"", which I have only had as 1 big piece of meat.   
With the correct spelling, I also find Hotel Restaurant Bahnhof in Glattbrugg and Tommisalp in Mesikon.

			Hi,   
Last year we were in Giesserei which isn't a club but a restaurant and I must admit that it seems that in a lot of Zurich's restaurants all the evening is organized (a nice meal-in Giesserei in Oerlikon was superb-and then a dj) so you have a nice evening with everything (even fire works). I personally didn't like so much the concept ""all-in-one""except the food that was delicious.... If you want to go to a club I can only advise you some I like (but don't know what they do on New Year) : the Exile, the Helsinki, le cabaret. These are more or less ""underground"" clubs, don't know what you are looking for. Sure that the ""big"" clubs must be overcrowded and maybe not the best choice.... 
Well hope you will find what you are looking for!

			Hello,    
I am organising a dinner for 20-30 people in Zürich. 
I am looking for ideas for a venue.  
The specs:   
- CHF 50-70 budget per head (comprises an apero drink like a glass of wine or a beer, a main course and coffee / some people having dessert) 
- No need for a private room but could be a plus 
- Central-ish location, accessible by tram easily 
- Decent food and atmosphere 
- For the wine tasting: same budget including maybe some nibbles   
I have done the Reithalle in Kreis 4. Looking for somewhere different.    
Thanks

			There aren't usually any fireworks. It's a bit odd really, during the summer, there are fireworks seemingly every weekend and occassionally mid-week as well. But at New Year, nothing. 
Geneva is a city of ex-pats (I believe about 40% of the pop) so people have either gone home or have escaped to the resorts or their chalets in the mountains. Compared to other european cities at this time, it is very quiet.

			Ah MathNut, you disappoint me. I would have thought that you, of all people, would have calculated what proportion of heat goes up the chimney instead of into the room when using an open fireplace. The parsimonious Swiss need something far more practical to warm their cold hearts - er sorry, to warm their cold hands and feet.    
They, in their great wisdom, prefer a ' ' which is often fired from another room (less dusting to be done in the living room) and this warms up slowly and gives out its heat for hours and hours and hours. Often it has a little tile bench - paradise after an afternoon skiing in sub zero temperatures...    
Even the old blocks of flats without central heating used 'Ofenheizung', the metal 'chimney', large in circumference gave out masses of heat as well as the   itself. Ours looked less stylish with metal doors which obscured the flames but it gave off a whole lot of heat. Open fireplace indeed. Bah! Anyway, what was it that  ?

			Hola!   
It's quite a big change Gran Canaria for Vevey, at least it was Sevilla to Lausanne xD   
I don't know much in Vevey, but if you don't mind the small trip to Lausanne there are a few places for watching sports, I would recommend: 
-The Great Escape, just above Riponne plaza.  
-Darling, near St Francoise. 
Both are usually full of expats and there is quite friendly environment, although I like The Great Escape more.   
And if you want to go out, give me a shout, there's always something going on in the city, and a another fellow spanish is always welcome to join    
And welcome  
Jose

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

			Hi Guys,   
i could not post this in the Social Events sections for some reason......   
Anyway, at work we have just been speaking about arranging a few more social events to help employees integrate in to Lausanne.    
Has anyone ever tried to set up a Sports and Social Club in Switzerland? Can somebody give some tipps about approaching companies, bars, shops etc. for small group discounts?   
Any help would be greatly appreciated.   
Many thanks   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2010	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Sports & Social	Grounded	Posts: 4

			I'm sorry but my brain doesn't appear to be in gear this morning... please clarify:   
 Was there a german speaker with you?   
If not - I would guess there was a communication issue. I base this on the fact that you quote in German a simple tourist guide that this restaurant, you claim to have had this bad experience at, serves excellent food and is located in Kyburg village...    
While I do sympathise with you and would be utterly shocked if you were indeed shown the door due to racial discrimination, lets not all cry ""wolf"" untill we are sure.

			No it's not a supper club, but just wondering if any of these are around, perhaps in the Zurich area? They seemed to be very popular in Vancouver among the inside culinary chefs circles so wondering if it a trend anywhere here?    
You have to know someone to get invited and they move from place to place to avoid getting busted for health regulations and non license issues. Usually the chef charges a flat fee.    
Given the amount of complaints about the costs of restaurants here if it's not happening perhaps it should.

Some familly members are coming over for the weekend. 12 of them actually. It's all rather stressful      
I need to book a restaurant where kids are welcomed, preferably with an outside area where they can run around.    
We are not very fussed about the food, anything will do. But it should be in central Geneva.   
I initially thought of the restaurant in Parque des bastions, but they have a function on that day.             many thanks.

The landlady was about 2 foot 6 tall but waded in amongst all the farmers and builders, collared the trouble maker and dragged him out.The place calmed down and we continued to enjoy a cold one. It happens all the time, so I was told.

			Hi all,   
Not sure if I'm in the right section....   
I am off to St. Gallen tomorrow for work and realise that I don't know the place at all and England are playing tomorrow evening    
Does anyone know of any bars in the town that will be showing it?  
Preferably English speaking as my German is non-existant but anywhere will do!

			Chur is a strange place to eat out. Many places close in the evenings. The remainder are mainly hotel restaurants or burger/kebab shops.  
Tonight I went to a hotel restaurant early on and there were four people who had arrived just before me. Not exactly busy. Having had my order taken I gave up and left after 40 minutes waiting for food. The other 4 had finished their meals by then. I know service is not as fast as in UK but this was really bad, or was I impatient.    
I ended up returning to the Restaurant Calanda in Postplatz that I have eaten at on several occasions. Very busy but served good food in about 10 mins.

			Yesterday I went to a concert at Wenkenhof park in Riehen (Basel), and it was really nice. Wenkenhof is a beautiful villa with a garden, and yesterday there were people from the music school playing instruments in the dark. I can't describe it very well in English, I'm sorry, but the name of the event is ""Le jardin magique"", just to give you an idea (it really looks like a magic place).  
Tomorrow they'll repeat it. Here is the  . In case you are around I suggest you to go.

			Glad you liked the Auberge de L'Onde. If you enjoyed that then as I said, you'd probably enjoy the St. Christophe:   
and Café Berra:   
Another excellent one to try is les Ducs du Savoie in St. Gingolph.   
This restaurant is a few hundred yards on the French side of the border and in Summer you can eat on the terrace with a magnificent view of the lake over towards Vevey and Montreux. It has an excellent wine list.   
None of these restaurants is far from Montreux and if you do lunch at any of them you could stop and walk it off on the way back with a stroll along the lakeside between Montreux, Chillon and Villeneuve.

			A year in the merde/Merde Actually/Merde happens etc   
by stephen clarke   
books about a british guy moving to France. It's hillarious if you're either french or british. I'm sure others love it too.  
These have been big selling books. I only read Merde Actually and laughed all the way through it.   
Summer in Genoa by Michael Winterbottom about a man who relocates to Italy with his two daughters after their mother is killed in an accident. 
Quite touching movie, bit thin on the story/plot side of things. Still worth a go.

			Hi there,    
I am from Olten and now living in Basel. Unfortuatnatley, Olten has no such Pubs you are looking for.    
Here the places you could go:    
- Vario (more culturelle) 
- Terminus (dance club)  
- Stadtmix (good drinks)  
- Magazin (young people but okay) 
- Sichtbar  
- Ratskeller (rustic) 
- National (good chicken wings)   
I think that is it about what you can find in Olten.    
The next Irish pub I guess is in Aarau.    
Good luck in Olten.

Welcome to Luzern! i saw your post today about the Luzern Blue balls festival. I'm also a newbie in EF but not Switzerland ( been in CH more than 6 years,moved to Luzern 4 years ago) Though it would be a really great idea meeting new English speaking people in town, i will absolutely join the meet up if we then gather enough people. Feel free to PM me. Ciao ciao!

We got there early, put our jackets on a couple of great seats, and went to eat some Hiltl food with a beautiful view of the Lake.  Thought it was a great venue, the screen positioned well so I don't think there is a bad seat in the place.  We already have tickets to see Robin Hood next month!  Fun!

			I've  also  been there for Regina Spector and Ben Harper! 
I highly recommend to go at least one day to the Festival. Very well organised, amazing location and really nice sound quality on the Auditorium. Be ready to leave some extra swiss francs there, cause food and drink can be quite expensive, as for Montreux area in general.   
Enjoy Phoenix concert! I wish I could watch their concert too!

			We went to the one in Crissier last year for our two years and it's an incredible restaurant, nothing to else say. They have degustation menus for 250-300 francs, so it doesn't have to be   expensive. The splendid 5-6 course meal is worth it. Get the menus, avoid the expensive wines and it'll honestly feel like a bargain.

			I did the 1CHf breakfast thing on Thursday at Aubonne Ikea.     
It's a great deal, but just a warning, you have to stand in a queue behind the 5 million other people, who all turned up and waited outside for half an hour before opening to get their 1CHf breakfast.     
And these 5 million people take all the time in the world choosing which specific croissant they like the look of, shuffle through every pot of yoghurt to ensure they have their most preferred flavour, then rifle through every pack of cheese to choose which variety they feel like eating that morning, then mosey on over to the one open check out in order to count out twenty 5 centime pieces to pay for it.  And then the next hell is trying to get anywhere near a coffee machine to get your caffiene fix.   
It will take all your will power and every scrap of pre-breakfast energy not to scream into this vortex of hell ""HURRY THE F*%K UP!""   
Perhaps, if you are that determined to take advantage of the deal, it's better to have a coffee and bit of breakfast before you leave home to prepare yourself for the ordeal.

			Leave the main station and walk across the bridge to Central. Turn right at Starbucks and walk a few yards up Niederdorfstrasse (the pedestrian-only cobbled lane). On your left you will see a Malay/Chinese restaurant called  . It's cheap, clean and serves very nice food. They also do smaller portions for those on a budget.   
If it's Swiss cuisine you're after, go a few yards further up the street to the   beerhall, where you can stuff yourself with variations on flesh, potato and cabbage to your heart's content, then get horribly drunk on Swiss or Belgian beer.   
Neither of these is more than a five minute walk from the station.

(Even though I wasn't 25)   It is a nice place to chill and relax before 10 or so, and after that is more of a club. Other wise Paddy O'Reily's (Spelling?) Is good, and also Nelson's. Have fun!

			Oddly enough I was in the Nelson tonight drinking their 5CHF/500ml Staropramen , and the good cheap beer made up for the hideous surroundings.   
The Big Ben is a dive. Try Akt4 or IQ Bar a few doors down at Escher Wyss.

			Hi    
Does anyone have any recommendations for an apero band (for a small informal wedding)?   
As for style - we're pretty open, had thought of something acoustic, mellow but no fixed idea.    
Appreciate any pointers.   
Thanks 
Jules

			Seeing there are some of you who are into salsa like me, a recommendation for tonight: a salsa party at Salsastudio in Rümlang. 
The event is not organized by me, therefore not in the commercial section. You can check it out at  
There is a part with slower music and chachacha from 8 to 10pm (for those who are not feeling that advanced) and a happy hour at the bar at the same time, later off to normal speed and a show ;-) Am not sure if this information is on the flyer, I got it through the facebook.

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

			Sonnenberg is a nice restaurant and outside it's a beautiful setting, but it's VERY pricey and I thought the service was a bit ""snooty"" the only time I went there - they clearly thought we ""didn't fit in"" with their usual clientele...   
Also Seerose in Wollishofen is tough to beat as a setting (lake, mountains, good weather) but the service there is probably the worst in the city - unless you turn up in your yacht club jacket and matching loafers...

			I picked up a leaflet today for a company called easydining  . Nothing to do with Stelios for once. It's a membership scheme where you fork out 65 CHF for an annual membership and then at certain specified restaurants two people can eat for the price of one. Debating with myself whether to join and would appreciate input. Anyone already a member?   
Gotchas: 
1. You can only use the offer in each restaurant once per year. Don't know if this will really be enforced though. 
2. They expect you to drink something. Can live with that I'm not a camel. 
3. The restaurants are not high end gourmet class and are mainly North of Zurich. Ok for me also.

			No one is begrudging a worker a decent wage, and I maintain that they should not need to rely on tips. Its obviously up to you when you tip, but for me the whole point of it is to reward someone going beyond the call of duty, often significantly.   
Agreed waiters and waitresses have to put up with a lot, but it goes with the turf.   
I usually tip even in bars by a small amount and significantly where it was a particularly good meal, or more importantly service. To pay the same   every time somewhat defeats the object.   
A friend of mine relates the story where a waitress spilt hot soup into his lap, and when he joked ""there goes your tip"" she was really upset, and honestly expected to still get one. As it turned out she did by getting the sympathy vote from the rest of the group, but its still bizarre...   
Tipping is an emotional response and its often no good to try and analyse it scientifically. How much to tip ranks right up there with the most popular questions from US visitors to Ewe-rope.   
A surly barman who looks right through you and serves the next swiss-talking people through the door, is going to get a different response from an entertaining cheeky-chappy that bothers to ask how things are going... (Bohemia and Kerala , you can work out which is which)   
Waiting an eternity to get served is unforgiveable in my opinion when the place is not busy. Having worked in a bar you learn to read the ""I-want-to-order"" signals. Short of waving a napkin as recommended by Michael Winner what can one to deal with it other than reflect your feelings in what you give ?

			There a place in Geneva called l'Age D'Or (golden age), which is just on the other side of the Catholic cathedral from the train station.  They do American style deep-crust pizza in two sizes, 6 and 12 inch.  It's not Giordano's or anything but it's in the ballpark.   
Mostly what we would call Pizza back home is called Quiche or Ramequin here.   
Personally I've long since come to prefer the real deal: Neopolitan style.  Interestingly the closest comparison with a real Neopolitan pizza that you find in the states is the Pizza Hut ""thin and crispy"".  There's something very interesting that happens with the dough they use in Naples around the crust.  Part of it is the cinders from the wood fire, but there's also the quantity of oil in the dough.  It's really the best (and the original).   
Also, there's a Portuguese bakery on Place Riponne in Lausanne which produces tiny 4"" pizza's which could easily be from Chicago.  And of course there's the brewery Café du Chateau at the other end of Riponne which makes pizza with brewer's yeast in the dough, which I believe is probably how the Chicago style pizza originated.  There are still a couple of places in Chicago that use brewer's yeast, particularly Pizzaria Uno.   
One funny thing about defining pizza is that Romans consider foccacia to be pizza, but in Naples they call it ""foccacia"", so there's some confusion.  In Venice they pre-roll the pizza for you, so if you ask for a pizza you will get something that most Americans will think of as a ""wrap"".  And you know, it's all really really good.

I have a very important question to ask you. As I love theater, I would like to know if there are any theater performances that are set on stage in Zürich except for some in Gessnerallestrasse on April.  
I would be very interested in learning about it more.

There was a time when the only income an employed hairdresser had were the tips he got from customers.  Then the system changed, the prices were increased to include the hairdresser's salary.  However, shortly afterwards signs appeared at the hairdressers' saying:  Service is included but the 'pourboire' is not.  So nearly everybody started tipping again.  Even most of the owners of many hairdressing salons expect a tip.

			Thalwil: 
Restaurant Rebstock in Thalwil is really nice but you have to call them to see if they have fondue (cheese or meat?)     
Resturant Etzliberg has meat fondue (maybe also cheese) and on tuesdays (until the end of February) it is all you can eat for about 40 CHF a person. And it is not the crapy frozen meat type, but the fresh cut meat type. Plus it has a great view over the lake.     
Enjoy

			In terms of the most distinct kebab, there is a hole-in-wall restaurant in Solothurn that is run by a Yemenese-Lebanese-Palestinian man who make fantastic kebabs.  He makes his own wrappers, uses a kind of pico de gallo salsa, spicy yellow peppers and laced with home-made mango chutney.  I suppose the recipe varies over time, but he certainly knows what he's doing.   
It's also a cool place to hang out, with the middle-eastern rugs and throw pillows all around.  Mint tea and baklava is even served.  The owner is pretty cool, though you might want to avoid talking politics.  Unfortunately, I forgot the name of the place and I have not been there for years.

			If you go to the 3D showing in the Arena (sihlcity) do you get those LCD shutter type glasses ? What if you are wearing glasses already ? Is this still comfortable ?

1231	19.12.2009, 00:08	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 6 Times in 6 Posts	Location: Zurich	"    Tickets for the 2009/2010 season went on sale at the end of August this year, for performances to July 2010, so I guess try next August.  We bought all our tickets in September and there were still some goodish seats left all year, but honestly this was a bit late as all the really good, reasonably priced tickets were long gone.   
Don't know about star tenors but they did have some okay tickets left back then for Bartoli in La Cenerentola on 2nd Jan.  We didn't buy at the time as weren't sure where we would be on that date.  Turns out we are here, by beginning Dec they only had listening seats left, but that they had any at all was a surprise to me.    
You can always pop into the box office and ask, they speak perfect English and are happy to help.  Will be open right up to performance start time when there's a gig on, but best to come say 10 minutes before it starts if you have few questions as by then everyone has collected their's for the evening and you won't have an irate queue behind you.  If you do this, get a ticket for the queue even if there's noone else there.  If you don't the staff might be rude to you and may even make you get one.  Pointless, yep, but They Are The Law and will be more helpful if you've followed their rules.      I wouldn't bet on them doing this anytime soon in ZH.  If you buy a programme it's all in German but they always (for all the one's I've bought) have the synopsis in English too.  Seems a waste of CHF10 for a synopsis though when you can Wiki it as WolliH says.  Besides, do you want to be looking at the screen or the stage?  They do some pretty amazing productions here.  Turandot was a spectactular set - grotesque, dark - really brought out the cruelty of the whole play.

This is my first post.  I am a single guy and academic in the UK thinking of accepting a post in Lausanne.  My decision in part will be influenced by the local social scene. Amongst other things I very much enjoy dancing modern jive and blues, and I was wondering if this is possible in or near Laussanne.  Anyone know?  Many thanks.

			If you've chosen a specific wine to complement the dinner, you should use that.  A bottle of wine brought by guests is a gift to the household - not necessarily to be drunk immediately.  What you can do is ensure that you've already opened your wine - that gives you a good excuse not to open theirs... at least until everyone has reached the stage of inebriation where they can no longer tell if it's vinegar.         That's because we don't have a stock phrase.  Some British households might say grace before eating.  But for the non-religious, the closest we've got to ""Bon Appetit"" is ""I hope it chokes you"".  What would you expect us to say?      It's called ""humour"".  hth

			Try with the Dance Academy in Oerlikon (it belongs to the Migros Klubschule).      > Kurse & Lehrgänge > Bewegung, Entspannung und Tanz. There you will get the list of the courses offered, and there is even a Partnerbörse for those who are seeking someone motivated to dance with.   
BTW there is a ""Tag der offenen Tanztür"" this Saturday where you can take free trial lessons, you will find the whole program under    
For going out, I agree 100% with smackerjack, our EF member Salsa Lover knows all the insider tips there are to know.

			Alright, so we ended up going to two restaurants: 
The first was called Steinbock which is located on Centralbahnstrasse 19 , across from the train station or around the corner from the victoria hotel and next to the coop.It was excellent! and the cost per dish was around the 20 swiss francs per main dish -- we tried schnitzel and various types of rosti dishes. the food had incredible taste! 
they have a customer loyalty card where if you eat like 10x , you get a free meal.   
The second restaurant was ""zum alten stoeckli""     
it was ok -- nothing to rave about. friendly service but food i felt was just overpriced and didn't have as much flavor as the steinbock restaurant.

			Well, if you'll support a bit of self promotion for a moment, I have to recommend the restaurant my husband (Italian-Swiss chef) and I (artist from Chicago) just opened in Aesch called Restaurant Schlössli,  . The menu is small, a bit Italian, a bit Swiss, a bit French, but always seasonal and fresh. There's also a la carte brunch with eggs, bacon and sausages made to order on Saturdays from 10 am to 2 pm.   
It's a cozy location with indoor and outdoor seating and a great view. You take the number 11 tram all the way to the end of the line in Aesch and the restaurant is just across the street. There are also great hikes that start in Aesch so if you want to combine some outdoor activity with a nice meal, this is the place to come.    
The restaurant is open for lunch, dinner or just coffee or drinks from Tuesday to Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm. 
Have a look at the website and current menus (in English),  , and hope to see you sometime soon!

			Here I am (corrieorrie) may I just say that flow23 and his friends were a pleasure to cook for. 
I enjoy cooking and am a huge 'foodie' I have a huge repertoire of recipes, especially, good home cooking, think of what mama used to make, Shepherds pie, fish pie, casseroles (with dumplings) Toffee apple crumble, bakewell tart, sticky toffee pudding with a warm whisky sauce. etc. etc. all with really good quality ingredients.  And . of course, Curries.   
I would be happy to do the same again for small groups, or even make a few dishes for your freezer. Maybe you would like to come home to a 'home cooked' meal that only needs to be re-heated? Just give me an idea of what you like.   
My Husband worked here for 2 years before my Daughter and I moved, I saw his weight gain during that time because he was not eating properly ,and he looked forward to his weekend visits home . That's all changed now as he's back to eating wholesome meals.    
pm me please if you would like me to cook for you.

The chilli sauce I made will last over a year in the fridge and is fantastic. It Goes with everything and matches perfectly with Italian dishes.

			Hey everyone,   
I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations on the best places to watch football matches at are in Basel?  I typically go to Mr. Pickwick's to watch English Premier League and Champions League matches.  Is there anywhere else that you would recommend?     
Also, wondering the best place to watch FC Basel matches? and Swiss National team matches, such as the one tomorrow night against Israel here in Basel.  I'm guessing it will be a big celebration if Switzerland qualifies for the World Cup tomorrow.   
Thanks

			Bar Rouge is nice for the views but if you are looking for fun i think its a bit pretentious (and not for good reason).  Of course thats just my opinion.  Also there is a 15CHF cover charge if you are under 35.  The view is amazing though.  I would suggest you start there if you want to try it and then head to the other side of town.   
The main street of bars mentoned above is good fun and you can pop from bar to bar for a while until you hit Paddy's and Red Rocks.  I believe those are open the latest in basel, until 5 or 6am.     
What kind of scene are you looking for?  Their are also a number of but those are located on the other side of town from the above mentioned places.  Hope you have fun in Basel!

Otherwise, Café des Artistes in Galerie Saint-François has karaoke every night except Sunday and Monday, I think.  Beware that their book could be much better and some hosts are not the most cheerful sort.

			On each first Friday of the month, in the Sternen Oerlikon, a nice restaurant with Italian and other cuisine, the Alabama Jazz Band is playing in the evening between 7pm and 11pm. The prices for food and beverages are as usual, and they are really good. The service is always nice. It is a good place to relax and enjoy. The style is NewOrleans/London Dixieland  (ChrisBarber/KenColyer sound) .

			You can try following Indian restaurants:   
1. Restaurant Vulkan ( ) - They have a separate hall other than main restaurant.   
2. Restaurant Tandoor House ( )  -  They can accomodate around 50 people if booked in advance. They also have a party hall close to the restaurant which they can arrange for you.   
3. Mr. Amolk Singh (sher-e-punjab) - 044  4619930. He can arrange very good food along with hall   
4. As pointed in earlier post, restaurant Maharani is also good choice. It is spacious, but my experience with food there is always bad.     
Hope, this is helpful. PM me in case you're still not able to arrange something.   
Cheers,

A visit to Rheinfall (the largest waterfall in Europe) is well worthwhile, although not in Basel ... but chances are your partner hasn't done that trip yet. If you enjoy walking, you can walk from the top of the waterfall to the bottom and back up a different way (or vice versa) in a couple of hours. Actually, you can even do that if you don't enjoy walking, too. It's a full day trip. Google for more info.   
Is that the sort of thing you want, or just activities in Basel? Google will be your answer there, too.   
Or, of course, search this forum for the answers!

			Maybe it was a off night for them, but I was left feeling distinctly underwelmed & quite franky rather ripped off by a fondue night a group of us had up there last year.  
Bland fodue with nothing except a half stale breadbasket. Can't remember exacly how much it was per head - north of 40chf I think.   
Maybe I should give them another chance as it is a nice location.   
(Come to think of it, I've never been that impressed by the prices up there period - 4.50 for a tea & something like 9.50 for a plate of pomme frites last time I stoped in there, iirc -  I mean, it's not like they're in the middle of nowhere is it?)

			Hrm, if anyone finds out about a place with great bbq ribs - either spare ribs or babyback - particularly if they have specials, I'd love to know.

If they are in favour of nature etc, you might get along the Arve and look out for a nice place, or make an excursion with the whole party onto the Mount Salève. If people rather might like the lake, go to the Southern side and drive into France. A cousin of me who lives in Coppet takes his guests to that area and according to him there is a number of excellent and reasonable restaurants to be found just a few kilometers ""behind"" the border. Even if, thanks to Schengen, passengers and private cars no longer are controlled, people ought to have the identity card with them of course. There are also some nice reasonable restaurants down the Rhône almost at that borderline. You might also go towards the airport and almost to the eastern end of it pass through the tunnel onto the French side into Ferney-Voltaire, where you might find some nice restaurants as well. If however, your guests are civil aviation minded, take the road west of the airport into Meyrin and then go right earliest and move ahead to the cosy and nice restaurant of the Aéro-Club which of course is primarily catering for the general public. You there can chose between indoors, outdoors and served plus outdoors /self-service. The ambiance is unique and typically Genèvoise in the best of all ways.

I'm looking for either a place or a group that plays high-ish stakes (200-2000 buy in) cash games in zug/baar or zurich.  I've used   to play some games, but that's more tournament style stuff.  So, if anyone knows of anything, or is looking for a poker player in their own games, i'm interested.

			I recall this Brazilian place in Geneva, somewhere behind the train station. I used to go there some 15 yrs ago when I last lived in CH. It served some of the BEST grilled Chicken I have ever tasted.    
Grilled in front of your eyes in a big wood fired oven. I know the location I have described is very vague, but would any one know where I'm talking about? Does it still exist?   
Is there any such place in Zürich?

			Great post Jack.    
I was just thinking about this the other day. I compared Tiffins on Seefeldstrasse (Thai cafe, very quick service) to my favourite Thai Cafe in Melbourne (Chilli Cafe, cnr of Russell and Bourke Streets). The price difference is pretty much double for the same food.  Sfr 16 vs $8 per meal eg: green chicken curry or chicken stir fry. I've not compared for beef or lamb - I guess it would be a lot more different. The other similarity to these two places is that they are pretty basic, maybe a little bit more with Chilli Cafe - but service in minimal.   
Ok, ingredients are also different but I would say the quality is about the same. I find this fair. I'm probably earning about double what I would earn in Melbourne. So going out for me is about the same.    
I wish I remembered what dishes at indian restaurants cost so I could compare but honestly though, I don't think it's that much more.    
Naturally it's easier to find cheap food in Melbourne (eg) than here but cheap food is here. You just have to know where to look. Just like kebab places - they all cost about the same, but you just have to find the one that has good meat instead of the awful processed slab that they shave off.   
Like groceries - taking a walk to the asian side of town (langstr, badenerstr) you just realise that there are other shops with normal veggies and fruits that are a lot cheaper. Many south indian grocery shops do good fish for less than what you'd pay in Coop/Migros. You just have to go further or live there.  (My parents don't shop locally in Melbourne either)   
I earn higher because my time and effort is worth more. I think it's the same case to pay for the services that I enjoy.

			Lots of options, depending on what you want to eat / drink ... if you get the boat to Zürichhorn, there is a very nice restaurant out over the water there (not the casino - haven't been there, but it could be nice). Had lunch there on my first day in Switzerland, courtesy of my boss, and it was a lovely place to be... sit-down restaurant, though, so conversation will be extremely limited if you're on your own. 
Perhaps it would be worth trying the casino? I don't know... or get some Chinese from the place in the Chinese Garden near there, got some nice stuff on offer (and you can either get it from the takeaway window outside and sit on the grass, or go inside and eat at one of their tables).

Yes, I have.  Its best to get in early on the tables before they get ""broken in"".  Most everybody starts at about the same level.  But later in the evening, some may have massively more, so it gets much more bloody to break in.

			Hi   
Why don't you join us for the next Livers&Lovers drinks night at the Rosengarten on the 14th of May? You can meet the other expats in Bern and I'm sure there'll be people who'll be up for a night out at Mahogany Hall. 
Marians Jazz Room isn't bad either.

			Even though most operas are in Italian, there is a huge number of non-italian singers around. Here in Zurich you can see the light, relaxed style of Ruggero Raimondi from Bologna singing the Mustafa, in Italian, by an Italian.    
Get your break from the Sophrano's New Jersey Definition of Italian identity. 
There is a German translation above screen (helpful, right?).   
Opera does not have to be expensive here, look for the so-called ""Volksvorstellungen"" or ""Migros"" shows. Even in the front ""loge"" positions its only about 30 bucks, they have two white walkways, various arias are sung meters from where you are sitting.    
For the hundreds of lifsci researchers here at the Unispital - check out 
Jose Fardilha, (singing Taddeo brilliantly) - he looks like WHICH Lab Head ? Ok, hint: Mediterranean. Ok, another hint: Who Has the most funding.?..Hint 3, nice guy. hint 4. Think Pathology.

I need a recommendation for the *best* restaurant in Lucerne or that general neck of the woods. Swiss/Thai/Fusion it's all good but it has to be fantastic. 
Price isn't a problem, I'll sell a kidney or something. 
In Lucerne I've been to the Swiss house, and the really super expensive thai place- apart from them what are the options? 
Any suggestions?

			Better yet, go to the Chäsegge, Weite Gasse 6, almost at the other end of town from the train station in Baden, and choose from among the selection of *22*(!) different varieties of fondue mixes they offer.  Borrow a fondue pot from your neighbors and make it yourself - it's really not that hard, even if you are severely lacking in talent in the kitchen. The mix of cheeses a lot of Swiss I know like is the half-half one (often sold under the French name moitié-moitié).

Breathtaking entrance (once inside the door and down the stairs that is!) 
Brilliant food, pricey for Bern but still cheaper than the same options in ZH.  Definately value for money though, as I've been there 4 times over the last 6 years and honestly remember each visit in detail.  Service was always spot on, meaning they are never in your face or pushy but literally appear at your shoulder whenever you want them!!  The anti-pasti buffet is ""to die for"" (Can't believe I used that expression - anyone who knows me, please delete from memory!)  Wine cellar is huge, and they also have a cigar and whisky section on one of the balconies.

			Hi,   
I had my son's 8th birthday party at the Freizeithalle Dreirosen(by tram 14).   
Check this for more info:   .   
It does cost a lot. I took the Sunday option of 11 to 1 which cost me CHf225(Chf150 for the first hour and CHF75 for the 2nd). But we were allowed to stay on longer. The hall opens at 1 to public which means that the bithday kids would not have the area to themselves. But in my son's party no one seemed to mind as long as they got to play. A friend rented out the place on Saturday(when they are actually closed) and the charges are higher.   
Hope this helps. Am sorry the site is only in German.

You might as well stand in a tunnel & play their albums down a bullhorn.   
They can be very good though, saw them at Glasto a couple of years back.

Here's a database of restaurants in Geneva. The ""English"" version of the site is flimsy at best, but you should be able to navigate the site fine. There are plenty of restaurants around the train station. One of my favorites is Chat Rouge, a Mexican restaurant. The food is great and I think they should do birthdays no problem if you reserve ahead of time.    
But, honestly, there are so many and this is just the first one that comes to mind.

			Hi everyone,   
I've put a post in the commercial events forum about this too. Just to let you know there is a new English bar opening in 2 weeks in Kriens, LU. (Luzernerstr. 22) It's the 2nd Penny Farthing pub in Switzerland opening 8 years after the original which is still going strong in Aarau. I went there yesterday to confirm the details of my gig there on the opening night and I have to say it looks like it's gonna be a good one. Nice big stage with excellent lighting. Watch this space for loads of live gigs. Anyone in a band should send in a CD etc.   
Cheers   
CB

			This is my first New Year's Eve in Zuerich and I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for good parties or places to go for the night.  We are looking for a good party!   
Also, what sort of reservations are required?  Are there tickets to buy ahead of time?   
Any thoughts would be appreciated as we might have guests to entertain as well.  Thank you!

			Unfortunately, most restaurants that'll be open will offer a set menu for Xmas day. Generally pretty expensive (around 100.-). If you want to find cheaper, I'd recommend going to France.

			If you're serious about it then I would recommend getting seats if you can and are prepared to pay up. The auditorium is not that big and the popular gigs are crowded and it can be hard to get a good view of the musicians.

Some good Basel bars (in my opinion) to go to are: 
Bar Rouge - Messe (free before 9pm) 
Acqua - Zoo, excellent cocktails and v. good night on Thursdays (live DJ broadcasting Living Room set) 
Ono's - Peters Graben, non smoking (huge brucey bonus) and nice cocktails 
Des Arts and Baragraph at barfusserplatz 
Paddy's and Pickwicks are a bit divey but good for meeting people - but dodgy downstairs so keep yer whits about ya

Everybody does 3 or 4 songs so there's a lot of variety.

			I've only had a chance to listen to ""Carried To Dust"" a few times, but I think it's fantastic, possibly their strongest.  I don't know if you've had a chance to download it, but I think I recommended the free podcast from KCRW Morning Becomes Eclectic through either iTunes or from the  .  They play quite a few of their new songs which should provide a good preview of the disc.  At any rate, the disc is highly recommended.   
We never made it over to the sales stand at the show so I didn't realize there was a tour disc available.  I'm totally bummed now!

It was a Mr Sharwood who invented/created ""curry powder"" - a blend of most of the spices used to make an Indian style dish.    
Victorian British dishes with Indian influences include Coronation chicken (I think it's disgusting) and Kedgeree (smoked haddock with curried rice), one of my favourite dishes for anytime of the day - originally a breakfast dish which might sound odd but the Victorians ate Chicken and Mutton curries for breakfast - now that would set you for the day!   
BTW I heard a while back that there are more Indian restaurants in the UK than in India.

			Fireworks on the lake are fantastic, and there is all the mulled wine, garlic bread and raclette your stomach can take.   
Don't stand on the bridge, though, unless you like being squashed. Views are just as good further down, towards the Zurihorn, and, I've heard (but never been) over on the other side of the lake (Mythenquai?).   
As I recall, they also lay on extra trains in the evening for getting home, but you might want to check with the   first.   
Bit early for this, though, isn't it?

			Went to this event over the weekend:   and can highly recommend it.   
You need to be able to understand at least High German and there is a bit of dialect thrown in as well but the entertainment, food, staff/performers and atmosphere are all magical!   
They move from city to city and are only in the Zürich area for the next few days.   
The event is held in a tent but the tent is exquisitely furnished (bordering on kitsch, but fab anyway).

I`m new in Luzern and am wondering if there are any live music venues around? Prefer bands and/or venues with DJs that play non-techno?? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

			Sud des Alpes in Geneva, the club that belongs to the AMR ( ) has excellent if at times quite hermetic stuff. They also organise a festival in the Parc des Cropettes just behind the train station.    
You can check out Geneva's oldest squat, Ilot 13, a buzzing little place with a nice bar serving cheap food. Another squat, Cave 12, has regular shows ( ) and you can also try the Rhino squat, I saw there some Bulgarian woman choir in the 90's that ended up semi-famous (Mystere des voix Bulgares).   
Le Chat Noir is a cabaret bar in Carouge that has a good choice of  jazz and blues, often with a twist.     
Otherwise Fetes de la Musique in Geneva (orgnanised on the nearest week-end to the official start of summer, on the 21st of June) has countless music stands dotted all over the city.   
That aside, there is nothing to do in Geneva...    "	a reputation beyond repute	Join Date: Feb 2007	Groaned at 29 Times in 28 Posts	All that jazz (and Blues etc...)	grumpygrapefruit	Posts: 5,075

			Not exactly Road Food but rustic and out of the way.       
Walking up to Mt Pelerin from Vevey I found this restaurant.  The place looked like a small farmstead.  It was almost as if the owners were cooking from their home kitchen.  It was very pleasant and unexpected, being in the middle of nowhere.  They also had a local home brew.  I think that the bulk of their custom must be local farmers and the occasional walker.

Film of the week is La Antena. An Argentinian film made by Esteban Sapir in 2007, it's a black and white silent film. 
From what I understand it's set in a dubious village, where everyones voice has been stolen.

			Juhu! I was waiting for the Bionade in CH for months already. It is far better than Rivella and has no artificial sweeteners! The only one missing in Switzerland now is the Carpe Diem ""Ginko"" ...   
These Bionade glass-bottles are part of the German ""Multiple Use Bottle System"" (is there a proper word in English for that or does this exist in German only?), I doubt they will be sold in these bottles in CH ever (the Swiss are mainly using one way pet recycling system (except for some selected beer bottles when I remember right). There are pros and cons for both systems from the ecological point of view  .    
When I remember right the German Bionade has always used these specific glass bottles as they bottle in a former brewery that was using this bottle type....

You will not find bars that sells good, inexpensive drinks and meals anywhere in the city centres. I advise keeping up with and attending suitable social events advertised on this forum. As for eating and drinking, once you know people then if you could arrange some of these done from different people's places then it would work out cheaper.

I was searching for this last year as it was in Berne 2 years ago and I couldn't find it. It was called the International Electronic Music Festival. Same thing ?   
Felix Da Housecat was there 3 years ago (worked with DJ Pierre in Phuture as an Acid House pioneer).    
Two years ago it had Kenny Dope Gonzales (Masters at Work) who was also at the Zurich Street Parade this year. As was Juan Atkins the Detroit Techno originator.   
So I would hold out for a festival with international names you recognise. The electrosanne festival seemed to have only local named artists (who may be good but I wouldn't swear/bank on it unless Yello turned up).

			Hi everyone,   
I'm a day late I know..... Totally forgot to post and let everyone know about the Bout de Brousse festival.    
It's been going since 2001 and has been free every single year and has some excellent bands on, good variety of beers, food etc. free camping onsite for anyone who's had one too many (bring your own tent!).   
Just got back from this evenings gigs and they were all excellent.   
Tomorrow evening, another 3 great bands with The Passengers rounding off the evening.   
The Passengers are 4 friends of mine led by Mark Kelly - originally from Manchester.   
For more info :    
They have a myspace page too and a couple of vids on youtube.   
For the festival :       
See ya there tomorrow!

			Just to add to Pat's response, the Kaserne also has the ""E.G. Lounge"" which looks quite neat.   
Quite often we take a bottle of wine and glasses from home either down to the river or to the grass by the Kaserne - you get your choice of wine and it is cheaper.   
Another one is the Rhylädli (off-licence) on the Rhine on the Kleinbasel side about 50m up-river from the Mittlerebrücke - they sell wine and beer; you pay a deposit for the bottle which you get back on return. We sometimes buy a drink there and sit on the bench to consume.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Not sure if this is too late for you but..   
In the area of Bahnoffstrasse you have Durr at the top near the train station there is also a shop at Paradeplatz and one between behind Paradeplatz in the direction of the river (hard to explain where).   
There is also Casa Del Habano just along the tramline from Paradeplatz towards Enge.   
For the largest selection of single cigars (e.g. you don't have to buy an entire box) try Don Cigaro at RedBox just past Bahnoff Tiefenbrunnen in the direction of Meilen.

			The reason that the choice of beer is getting smaller and smaller every year is because an ever-shrinking number of brewery conglomerates is dominating the market, and because the bottom line is all about economy of scale they are trying to sell more of fewer types of beer.   
This is not a typically Swiss problem but can be found all over the world.    
Being involved in two microbreweries myself, I can say that the market is screaming for more innovation. Most of the big conglomerates don't do enough market reserach and are missing out on their chances. The public is very open and happy to experiment with anything that's new. Both microbreweries I'm involved with have trouble brewing the volume to keep up with demand. They only reason they can't sell more is because of their own logistics. This is why they are both growing like crazy and adding capacity wherever they can. There are new microbreweries cropping up all the time. Okay, some are boring but some are very innovative.   
However, there is only so far that they can grow. If you want to break into the bread and butter sector of selling on-tap in restaurants and bars, it requires some tough negotiations. In the past this was nigh impossible as the breweries were also the real-estate moguls and they told their tenants what beers to sell. Times have changed however with breweries foolishly spinning off their real-estate sectors. Now you can negotiate with most tenants. However, the question is, will they negotiate with you. Gastronomy is in a bit of a recession, and whereas innovation is sorely needed, few are prepared to take the risk of signing an agreement with a microbrewery. For the brewery, this would involve them putting up the funds to furnish the restaurant, provde tables, sunshades etc. This can cost in excess of several 10 000 Franks which may be small change for the big guys but is a substantial risk for the little ones, especially seeing one restauant in three goes bankrupt in the first year.   
So before we see any real breakthrough, the little breweries are going to have to grow a bit more to be able to take this risk.   
I have suggested the idea of making English-style beers at the AGMs of both of the microbreweries I am a shareholder of and the idea was met with enthusiasm but not considered high priority. But maybe some day.   
And if you feel about this the way I do, don't just moan that the others aren't doing anything, but buy shares and bring the topic up.

			Or you can go for Plan-B, and order bottle of suitable spirit. We did this at someones birthday bash at Mantra bar in Zug. A bottle of Absolut was 100chf. A bottle of rum from Movie Bar Zürich is about 120CHF.   
I have no idea if this represents good value: it depends on the size of their individual longdrinks (average price 13.50 in central zurich), but it's certainly one hell of a journey.   
Or....you can go to Kontiki bar on Niederdorf and chat up someone elses Polish girlfriend after several Tequila-slammers and cheap spirits. A most excellent way to spend the evening, as she was really up-for-it and he was a total arse.

			Arrive HB, Down Bahnhofstr, Fraumünster, Bürkliplatz. Kleine Rundfahrt on boat, walk across Bellevue, a spiffing lunch, walk behind Odeon bar up to cathedral, along old town Niederdorf stop for coffee. Buy chocolate etc, cross pedestrian bridge again near Central. That would be a day of sufficient content. Uetliburg is a possibility , but you would need to allocate at least 2.5hrs of your day for this to make the most of it.

			Another good find - Imagine Bar/restaurant at Sihl City. Friendly/useful staff, superb food, outdoors seating. It's got a sister/sibling Imagine bar at the hbf, which also has excellent food.    
The only downer we had, was that the ""moving suitcase"" sculpture hanging under the motorway suddenly blew a bearing, and ended up squeaking up and down until they switched it off...   
I haven't checked out the other foodie places at Sihl City. I know there's a pizza place (self service outside, it seems), and a sushi/asian place with zillions of staff, and another cafe on the other side of the main Sihl City doors from Imagine. Apart from that...

1529	27.05.2008, 17:23	Newbie 1st class	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	Location: Brugg	"    Yeah, I'm looking forward to the show. I actually grew up about 10-20 minutes from these guys and have seen them before (but not for a long time) including a J. Mascis solo show- is that what you saw? His solo acoustic shows are great if you are a fan.  
I just found out today that I know one of the people in the opening band, Awesome Color, as well. What a small world. I didn't expect to show up in Switzerland and run into people I know like that.    
Thanks all for the feedback and advice. There doesn't seem to be a definitive answer, which I suspected might be true- some shows start early some don't, some opening bands take their time to get out on stage, some don't. I wasn't sure if I could expect the same strict adherence to a schedule that you get with the trains etc here. It is rock n' roll after all, so I should have known better. We'll see how it goes. J. Mascis is definitely well-known as a slacker extraordinaire so they may be a little slow to get out on stage. If you are going to the show, I might recommend earplugs too. J. is known for playing ear-bleedingly loud, to the point where in some venues he drowns out the rest of the band.

			Or if you plan on a simpler Party, there are usually Chalets (or similar) in the woods used by different clubs and associations (maybe the ones that have been mentioned) usually run by the Gemeinde. This would certainly allow for the open-night occasion, just make sure everybody brings their sleeping bag (to avoid DUI's) and make sure you got enough stuff (unless you hire somebody for the foods/drinks)   
Those were always fun nights... good luck anyway

			Hi, in Zurich you can join the theater group ZCC  , 
I don't know how they work.   
In Berne a group of the Upstage players   has formed an 
improvisational theater group, see  . They are  
next at the   on June 13.    
Try toastmasters,  , it is a lot of fun.  
Every meeting requires members to give impromptu presentations 
on given topics. And great speeches are often more afting than speaking! 
There are clubs in many Swiss cities and you can attend a few times 
to see if it is for you .    
Best wishes 
Graham

			It's a long time since I last have been in the Nelson Pub as years ago it was known as meeting point for drug-exchange. I had bad luck coming into a razzia in 1998 and not been there again since then. It was on a Valentine's Day and not getting out for hours due to the razzia outside the Pub - you had even to take off your socks if you were wearing some...!!! It was awkful.   
How is the Pub now? What kind of draft beers? May be I will have a look inside next time it crosses my way and try the thai food.   
We usually are in Pickwick Pub down in the Wallgasse (between Bubenberg and Bahnhof). It's owned by a Dutch, and he has been working in the UK before.   
If you like Indian food try the Maharaja. It's near the Bubenberg as well. It's quiet expensive but identic.

			This might be a bit late, but anyway.   
Afak there is no club in Basel where you can go dance Salsa everyday. The preciously mentioned ""Allegra-Club"" has Salsa-Night every Monday (smoke-free), Thursday and Saturday. Besides that there is the ""Fame"" where they play Salsa every Wednesday, the Singerhaus"" on Sundays and the ""Kuppel"" on Tuesdays.    
In addition to that there are always some irregular events and once you get to know some of the frequent dancers, finding out about them shouldn't be a problem :-)

			I've been to Fribourg a few times, but never saw it as anything other than a sleepy swiss town. Then a colleague told me that the Kills were playing their only swiss concert there. The review of them in last Saturday's ""Libération"" (the french Guardian), was the most ravingly enthusiastic I've ever seen. I think I'll go. They're the nearest you'll get to the Velvet Underground in this age of mediocrity.   
The concert hall is called the ""Fri-Son"". They also have the Do and Adam Green in the next few weeks. All great nights out, IMHO. Unfortunately, it's too far from home for me to go to all of them. I wish I could. Old hippies never die  .

			Deep Purple,   
Yes it was Andy Powell's band. Go see Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash if you can in Worthing, from what I have heard on the internet the voice and sound is much closer to the original band. I have ordered MARTIN TURNER's WISHBONE ASH ""New Live Dates Volume 1 & 2"" - they do a lot of the songs that I really expected to hear the other night - ""Lorelei"", ""Sorrel"" and so on.    
If you go, give us your opinion - because I fully intend next time I am in the UK to go and see them.   
Dont forget Martin Turner is the only original member too.   
The Half Brick sounds so English!

			Visit Old city, and climb the Cathedral (you pay 2 francs to go up and take a look, its really worth it, so do it!)    
Chateau Chillon is just outside of Lausanne, about 30 minutes on the train (maybe less) this is well worth a walk thru too, you will not see history like this anywhere else and its just amazing there...well worth the trip.   
Also climb the old lookout tower, made from wood, its got a giant internal spiral stair and is quite an amazing structure in itself.  You can see ALL of Lausanne from here, really good view right up above the tree tops.   
Head to St. Francois (if you are there on thursday, or saturday) there are farmers markets through the streets, and some of the local artisans will have stuff there for sale too, and there is some awesome food to try, spanish olives and all sorts of amazing curry mixes etc, really nice also!   
Before going clubbing head to ""Reflet de Ciel"" in Malley (its just back up the hill about 2 minutes walk fromt he malley bus stop, take the number 7 bus) It just serves cocktails, have 2 cocktails there and you wont need to spend a fortune at the clubs on drinks. I recommend the bucaneer....so good.   
Uhm, for going out, head to the Flon area, and go to ""Mad"", its about 15 franc entry but its 3 levels of different music styles. Not bad. Also there is another club at the Chauderon bus station drop off, just down thestairs on the way to Flon called ""The Loft"" it's also pretty good there too.   
Flon is really the night club district, I think there are about 3 or 4 clubs in this area. There is another club there that has latin dance upstairs and dance music downstairs, I forget the name to this club sorry...Also La Movida which is at the bus stop just before Chauderon which I now forget! (damnit!) AH I REMEMBERED!! It's Bel Air, just next to the bus stop and the Migros.   
Enjoy!!

			I was at a big raclette party the other week and the only problem was that there was only one raclette appliance (the 'real' one, not the one with little pans), so everyone had to wait a very long time to eat and no one could really eat at the same time.  The people in charge of the cheese were also working non-stop. Otherwise it was amazing!  Have a great party!

			A personal favorite is  , which is just opposite Cornavin train station. They  brew their own beer on the premises� and its quite possibly the best beer that I have tasted in Switzerland. If you want to eat there, the Sauerkraut is pretty good too (they make it with beer rather than vinegar)

			You could surely manage a raclette grill. The guests do all the work cooking the cheese themselves. Simply switch it on and provide (already sliced) raclette cheese and a few jars of picked vegetables and some boiled potatoes. What could be easier ?

			I really enjoyed the show.    
Chris is a friendly Brit who sings 5 (yes, five) half hours sets, starting on the hour from 7pm until 11pm. He provides a menu of songs and anyone is welcome to choose the songs they'd like to hear him sing.    
His cover songs are more rock than pop, for example Green Day, Oasis, RHCP, Coldplay, Radionhead, the Killers, but also the Beatles, the Monkees and some other ""easier"" listening.    
He plays all over Switzerland, so you should check out   to find the next gig near you. He'll next be in Zürich on 15th   
PS There's no admission fee, just regular pub prices.    
PPS OK, who has excuses for not turning up?

			Hi,      If your guests are from abroad....why not get yourself a raclette grill, a block of raclette, chop up some veggies and marinade some meats to cook on top of the grill.   
If you eat at a restaurant on New Year's Eve, the place will be packed, you will get crappy service and pay through the nose for the privilege.

I have enthusiastically agreed to host a completion evening for work colleagues in Zurich.   
Its just four people (between 30-40 in age) and they are all Zurchers.  Of course, one of them is a stunning stunning beautiful man.   
I'd like to do something mind blowing for the evening, in terms of food and drink only.  Essentially take them somewhere they would not go and show them a different side to their own city.   
I was thinking cocktails (either from somewhere overlooking the lake or city) followed by dinner (non-Swiss cuisine).   
As you can see the theory is flawless.  The obvious problem being I have no idea where to take them, as this is my third week in Zurich....   
Any suggestions would be gratefully received...   
Thanks

			Thanks to everyone who replied, the menu will be rosti, courgettes and something called 'cut meat Zurich style' - essentially stew with mushrooms. Sausages are extremely hard to find in Bkk and when you do they are extremely expensive. Just going to substiture veal with pork loin and hope for the best. Maybe some chocolate for pudding and cheese too. Yum yum yum  "	considered knowledgeable	Join Date: May 2007	Groaned at 20 Times in 12 Posts	Recipe ideas?	Zug bound	Posts: 864

I will moved in Zurich in 1 month from Montreal, Canada for my postdoc at ETHZ. I found an appartment in the Albisriderplatz area. Any comment about that part of the city (services, parks, restaurants, bars, club,etc.)?    
His that considered Zurich West area which I heard was very nice and quite a hype district?

			I'll be counting votes in the election IT center for most of the day.   
Around 9:30pm I'll go to   to party or drown my anger in alcohol, depending on the election outcome. The resident band   (they play at Helsinki ""every f@ckin' Sunday""; some photos of the club on their website) & a guest play a few country sets at 10pm/11pm/12pm/1am. The club opens 8pm.   
An event not special enough for the event calendar I fear but here you go. Helsinki club is a tiny party location with cheap drinks (about 10 Fr.) and a micro brew lager on tap (Turbine Goldsprint). It is located near Bahnhof Hardbrücke and the entrance fee is just 5 Fr. I'm not a huge country fan but stumbled upon the Trio from Hell at another party and thought I'll give them a try at Helsinki club.    
Oh, and they play both country AND western.   "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Aug 2007	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	[Zurich] Sundays :-(	Su1975	Posts: 8

			This is great... that website was really useful. Thanks. 
I was wondering if anyone would be interested if I organised a meet next Friday (2nd November) evening in a non-smoking (or at least with a non-smoking section) venue? Alcohol and food but without the smoke? How does that sound? In Zug or Baar. I mentioned this conversation to some colleagues and they said the Krone (or something like that) - the Pizzeria near UBS in Baar, also has a non-smoking section. Any other suggestions?

			Not that much. One of my lunch hangouts has a sign saying something to the effect    
""Restaurant such and such is delighted to offer you a glass of water. We will clean the glass for you, fill it with water, and a nice smiling waitress will briing it to your table.  For that service we'd like to charge you one franc. The owner will be delighted to offer the water for free to those who can bring along a copy of the famed ""water must be free"" law.""   
Others just mention that a meal without drinks (read anything else than tap water) will be charged 2-3 CHF extra.   
Really stems from the fact that the bulk of the profits is made on drinks, not food.

Outside the concert seasons you often find free tables without reservation. Single musicians play the grand piano then for no entrance fee, sometimes, on Saturdays (not sure about the frequency because concert season is just starting).      - Opens at 5pm, live music at 9pm. No entrance fee but higher prices during concerts.      - Not only a bar, but Zurich's Jazz Club. Blues, Jazz, Funk and more, nearly every day of the week. I like it!

			The Blue Lezard has some good bands on sometimes, Wednesdays is the main evening I think but there may be more. It's free too...   
Otherwise there is Les Docks in the Flon area, which has a large number of concerts from rock, blues...all sorts really.  The listing can be found here:       
I've been to a few gigs there, and it's a nice new place, with a good atmosphere.  A couple of things I might go to in October actually...thanks for reminding me!!   
Tacos is also in the flon area.  That has pool tables and often live music but it is mainly rock n roll, rock-a-billy and some blues by the look.  Not been there for the music to be honest.  Website and listing here:       
For a younger crowd and pretty much only rock/metal there Le Romandie near the cathedral area.  Pretty specific taste this one but it is very cheap as it is some sort of local collective place.         
For generally finding concerts, in Lausanne and further out, this website is quite good.  Allows you to search by area, or genre:       
Have fun!!

			I think the Schiff is probably the best location personally, other than that I think there was a recent meet up at the Blues Brothers bar in the heart of the Altstadt, but I couldn't make it.   
There was also talk of someone checking out the Chicago bar near the Maserati garage off Baarerstrasse, but I haven't yet had the opportunity to go.   
For me, though, the Schiff offers a nice view of the lake, places nearby where people can get food and then head back to the crowd, a jukebox, and is generally a nice relaxed atmosphere (if a little cramped when busy!   )   
Count me in for it, wherever it may be....

			There's quite a bit of bland food here. What you or I might call spicy, generally isn't.   
I have found a couple of decent local restaurants who offer to fill your plate again once you are done, as long as you stick to the dish of the day.   
When I first came here I struck up a friendship with an American guy, and his comment was that the Swiss can be too fussy - for example they'll insist on providing you with a sauce when you're in the mood for something plain. (Pet hate of mine, both here and in the UK - French beans overcooked and then covered in butter, with small bits of onion; I like French beans slightly crunchy and with nothing on them.)   
Going back to my American friend again, he managed to organize a Thanksgiving dinner (it was important to him) at a local restaurant, and asked a bunch of us to join him. Yes, the turkey was fine, but they'd run out of potatoes and gave us chips (French fries), somehow thinking that we'd prefer them to the roast/mashed potato he had specified. Well, it wasn't quite right, but it was hard to criticize the restaurant staff since they had clearly gone out of their way to accommodate us.   
To be honest, I've spent too much of my life working away from home, so nowadays don't go to restaurants much. But then again, I once lived in France, so much food out just ain't the same...

			I used to have to organize these once in awhile and found that Migros or independent butchers and cheese shops were best and usually most affordable. Migros can do meat and cheese platters, but also have ""pain surprise,"" which are very handy but also easier to budget because they come in cheaper varieties and more expensive ones, meaning cream cheese and herb is a more affordable option than, say, salmon.    
My experience was Globus and anything remotely fancy or unusual was a lot more expensive.   
I always worried about not having enough eats and over-booked wildly until I got the hang of the ""margin of absence"" Aurora mentions. Absolutely right to say it's smart to have some Pretzels or Grissini handy that you can just pop into a bowl or glass to bulk it up if need be.

			ok.. that topic covers a wide range eh? 
. 
but can anyone recommend a nice place for a sunday lunch in the Geneva-Nyon area?   
a terrace would be nice to enjoy the nice weather while we have it, and a view would be super, but what we are really looking for is a nice menu.   
thanks!!

			Yeah sure but I just had to let it out somewhere.... and I may sound quite prudish but I think English is a universal language and if they wanna be a big international city, its the least they can do! All said n done I love Zürich and my life here... but wwry in german for that price...thats like a needle poking you in a part of your body you just can't reach!    
Got tickets for Cirque du Soliel too, Mamma Mia next on the list. You can subscribe to the ticketcorner newsletter and it keeps you updated on all the new acts (u can choose ur language n city).

			Hi Lorenina   
Two days ago I ate in this beautiful and excellent Grotto called ""Grotto del Ceneri"". It's also known under the name ""Socialist Grotto"". It's not exactly in the Mendrisiotto but in my perspective definitely worth a trip.    
It's on the Ceneri oposite side of the Albergo del alpi and then through the woods.    
Cheers!

The aklin in Zug always impresses if she appreciates good food (although I think you can do better with ambience!!)   
The Park hotel in Weggis is a personal favourite of mine.   
Alternatively, one of the hotel at the top of Burgenstock would probably impress.

			I always wanted to see the Dan live, especially since they didn't tour at all for many years.  In 1975 they quit touring altogether because Becker was shy about his voice and they only wanted to do the studio thing anyway.  Then in the 90s they did a reunion tour, and the album from that (Alive in America) is just awesome.  I also saw a recording from what I think was the Two against nature tour which was unbelievably super tight and well arranged.  So I think Steely Dan will be a fantastic live band, because of or despite their obsession with perfection.   
I don't really have any favorites, or rather they change constantly.  These days I'm listening a lot to Aja and The royal scam.

Dave A - no, the Broadgate C&B doesn't carify what I mean - it's the antithesis of it. I agree it's an abomination and I rarely if ever used it. C&B have some decent older style wine bars but, as I mentioned, Davy's is my favourite. If you look at their website,    I mean places like Creed Lane and Chopper Lump, both well known to me, with sawdust on the floor, comfy chairs, no musak, excellent, reasonably priced wine and bar food and, hopefully, few if any pretentious tossers.

Also, for a full-menu adventure, try the Meridien restaurant for whackula menus from Afghanistan (veggie). Other side of the tracks near the Riff Raff bistro / cinema.

			When in St Gallen I prefer to eat upscale or at home (or snack in said focaccieria - i used to live in the building of that place). Nontheless, some cheap central options are     , Marktplatz - italian, pizzeria, its a chain but not such a bad one     , Marktplatz - well, i really prefer more upscale so dont expressly recommend, but they are ok apt at serving tex-mex at reasonable prices and to lots of people at the same time so it is good for groups   , Neugasse - mixed basic menu, some traditional fare, some barfood, good quality for ok prices    or     (same owner) also has food and big outdoor terraces that could be nice. No idea about group capacity though, its been a while.   
If you find yourself without the group and a better budget I recommend   or  . That is good dining.    
Well, enjoy SG.

			Sorry, I can't help you out     
But I made 3 batches of them myself earlier this week following the 
recipe below. I used my bread machine for the mixing and kneading  
part   Before the final baking I added poppy seeds to the outsides of them. Carmen     http://www.dianaskitchen.com/page/recipes04/a40226l.htm     Bagels 4 to 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  2 packages active dry yeast  1 1/2 cups warm water, about 110°  3 tablespoons sugar  1 tablespoon salt  1 tablespoon sugar   In a mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the yeast. Combine water, the 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt; pour over flour mixture. Beat at low speed of electric mixer for 1/2 minute, scraping bowl a few times. Stir in as much flour as you can mix with a spoon.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead in enough flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes). Cover with a clean towel and let rest 10 minutes.  Cut into 12 equal portions; shape each portion into a smooth ball. Punch a hole in the center of each ball and pull gently to make a 1 1/2 inch hole in the center. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise 20 minutes. Broil bagels 5 inches from the heat for 4 minutes, turning once. Tops shouldn't brown.  Heat 1 gallon of water with 1 tablespoon of sugar; bring to a boil then reduce heat. Put bagels in water and begin timing when they rise to the top. Cook about 3 to 4 bagels at a time for about 3 minutes, turning once. Drain. Place on greased baking sheet.  Bake at 375° (190 C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Makes about 1 dozen bagels.    "	null	null	null	Fresh bagel sarnies in Lausanne?	guest	null

I assumed that it was a only because of half-time but based on your post I am a little concerned   	earned some respect	Join Date: Mar 2007	Groaned at 21 Times in 15 Posts	Why I'll never watch rugby at The Lion, Zurich again	Mr Happy	Posts: 413

			The Eurockeennes in Belfort is a big festival with a mix of established bands (this year headliners are Arcade Fire, Marylin Manson and Wu-Tang Clan) and young bands aiming to get an elusive contract. There are finals in various European countries to send a band there.     
This Friday, L'Usine in Geneva will host the Swiss final where you will be able to listen to a heavy rock from Basel, Navel, pop by Soften from Canton Vaud and Dorian Gray from Canton Geneva as well as reggae from Inna Crisis, a band from Valais.

			Yep I've been there. It's ok in small doses. Your enjoyment of it may depend on how much you can stand people clapping along to music. Then again, it does have litres of beer, and the opportunity to see p*ssed locals      
Look upon it as a very compressed Oktoberfest...

			Any one interested in Tango or CI?   
When I was last in Geneva, there was a small Tango scene in Geneva run by Christian and also Alejandro. ALejandro's site is:     
It's in french unfortunately!   
There is also some CI - this is a site (also in french!):       
If any one is interested, or wants to learn - i'd like to hear from you, and we could meet up.   
I'll post here what it's like when i get there - i'll be in Geneva from the 26th and will probably will find an apartment in Lausanne.

			Hi everyone,   
First to the moderators if this is the wrong place for my question my sincere appologies.    
I have not been to Zurich in many years. I will be there in may and I hope to maybe even meet some of you.   
I was wondering if any of you had any recommendations as to where I might eat the following food.   
Blutwurst 
Apfelkuechli, I know the Bierhalle Kropf used to make good ones but any other suggestions would be appreciated.   
Thank you in advance for your time.  "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Feb 2007	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	food question	Cashmere	Posts: 31

I supposed i can start dieting tomorrow        I often do a consideralby richer recipe. It is fast, easy and it has never failled me.... Actually, this the a version of the one that is used in mexican restaurants to do what they call ""mango mousse"" ( technically, it is not a mousse)  You take need: -1 can of condensed milk, - 4 packs of yughurt (light version) or 250mL of cream (hard drugs version) - 1 can of mango pure (or 2 cans of regular mango, and you homogenize it with a thermomixer).  You mix and whip evrything in a bawl. Once it is creamy, you put it in the refrigerator for about 4 hours to cool it down. Done.   An Indian friend gave me this other recipe, that it is a little * lighter * :  You will need 1L of yughurt. Put it to drain on a cheesecloth in the fridge overnight. You do the same to a can of mango pure (or 2 mango cans and then homogenize them with a thermomixer). You might need to discard the liquid a couple of times.   Once decanted, you mix the yugurt and mango pure, and whip untill it is creamy. You can then add 2 spoons of sugar (or whatever you find suitable for your taste), a tea spoon of grounded cardamon and 3-5 threas of safron. Don't forget to ""solve* the saffron in 1-2 warm spoons of water for about a couple of hours.   Once everything is mixed, it goes to the refrigerator for about a couple of hours. It is best served with desalted pistachios on top.    "	no particular reputation at present	Join Date: Nov 2006	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Mango Ice-cream	Impedimenta	Posts: 28

			Yeah it's good for drinks prices certainly, and it is one of the places where you're guaranteed to get an english footie fix..   
i was probably a bit harsh on the pickwick admittedly, but it stll wouldn't be one of my bars of choice..

			I know exactly what you mean. I miss a lot of asian style soups for reasonable prices. They pop up occassionally for 25 francs per bowl in many Asian eateries, but are usually bland and unexciting. I guess if anyone knows it would be Nanda - maybe she'll pop in with a few words.    
But don't hold your breath for an answer you might like...

			Have you ever wondered where you will eat dinner when you are driving back from Italy or Tessin to Zurich or Zug? If you are driving back on a Sunday you've probably been stuck much longer than you planned to be waiting for the Gotthard, and if you've just come back recently you've discovered the lovely road works on the northern side of the Gotthard which add another 45 minutes to your journey (so even if you take the Gotthard pass you'll still be stuck as everything comes down to 1 lane afterwards). So my point is that you may want to make alternative arrangements for dinner.       
Chances are you might pass the Brunnen turn-off depending on the route you have chosen. Take this turn-off and you'll very quickly find yourself with a reasonable choice of restaurants that are open - also late on a Sunday evening. We were surprised at the choice and quality of the restaurants, and they all look out over the lake.   
You can probably guess that I am usually somewhat underwhelmed at the average restaurant experience, so you can imagine my surprise when the Mexican restaurant we selected actually turned out to be quite nice! Fans of Mexican restaurants will know what I'm talking about - they are usually just absolutel rubbish aren't they? Service was friendly, the food was of good quality and the prices semi-reasonable.   
So next time you are doing the trip back my tip is to stop and eat in Brunnen, it's well worth it.   
The place we ate at is called Mezcalito Bodega and Bar, you can find their website at  .   
Do you have another tip for a place to stop on the way back to Zug or Zurich? Share it with us.
