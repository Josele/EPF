1	Swiss politicsnews	Not allowed entry without a resident's permit?	Penelopy	3,970	165	Oberwallis	06.01.2017, 21:08	" 
			
			36 years of living in Switzerland and France... often flying in and out of Geneva, I've never EVER been asked to produce my resident permit.   
It's only since moving our principle residence to France that I've started to carry my passport about with me as I cross the border regularly (I gave no other form of id), but haven't been asked to show it at the border since Schengen came into force.  
As far as I recall apart from at the airport the only other time I've been asked to show it has been once or twice at the bank when withdrawing money at the counter.   
As aSwissInTheUS rightly says, you do not have to carry it, but must be able to produce it within a reasonable delay.

6	Swiss politicsnews	Should Islam become a recognized church of the State in Switzerland?	olygirl	16,287	329	d' Innerschwiiz	12.01.2015, 11:17	"    It's not promotion of atheism, it's recognition that people's religious and spiritual beliefs are very diverse and their attachment to said beliefs can evoke great emotion which can result in something all religions claim to despise i.e murder.   
Therefore the concept of religion should be a private affair, after all it should only concern the individual who practices it or discovers it for themselves. It should not be forced on people in any capacity, be it through architecture, exclusive clothing, crusades, barbarity etc.   
Edit: addressing atheism ideology point, yes, the same applies.   The promotion of atheism is the direct result of the intrusion of religion and thus if religion becomes less intrusive atheism does not rear it's head to combat it.

E.g. I buy 10 tomatoes, 10 kiwis, 20 apricots and 10 onions.     
I get two bags.  
I put the tomatoes in one bag, weigh them, put their sticker on the bag. 
I then put the kiwis in the other bag, weigh that, put their sticker on the tomato bag and add the kiwis to the tomato bag.  
I then put the apricots in the other - now empty again - bag, weigh that, put their sticker on the tomato bag and add the apricots to the tomato bag.    
I then weigh the onions in the second - now once again empty - bag, and put their sticker on the bag.    
This way I have only two bags - at most - for all my fruits and veg, with all the stickers on the bag/s and no fruit/veg rolling around at any time.  
It would be impossible to put all that stuff on the scale without a bag, even only one fruit type at a time, it would be rolling around everywhere and I'd be wasting people's time collecting the rolling-around fruit while people who also want to buy veg and fruit are waiting behind me.   
So - if you only have 2-5 or so fruit/veg items to weigh, weighing them before bagging probably won't turn into a hassle. But trying that with larger amounts seems too much hassle.

right... ""basically"".  But they are going the extra step to create the aire of paranoia and xenophobia to go with it.    
In the US right now, that aire started with the Republicans saying that ""Muslims are terrorists.""  Then they shifted that focus to, ""terrorists could infiltrate our southern border,"".   Then that shifted to ""our southern border is being infiltrated by brown people who could be terrorists, we should build a wall to keep them out"".   That in turn spawned the Minutemen defense who wanted to shoot any poor, dirty brown person headed in a northerly direction by foot.      
Of course, now all the problems in the US, if you ask the anti-immigrant crowd, are because Mexicans and Central Americans are taking the jobs and living on the doll.  Oh, and they're all illegal.  You can apparently tell this by looking at them (I've encountered plenty of anglo-saxon illegal aliens in my life, some of them Canadian and British).     
Oh yeah.  And all Muslims are still terrorists.

			Sorry by saying  artificial that is why i put ''...i did not mean anything for Switzerland as a sovereign state which i full respect and its people. I meant ''artificial'' in terms of neutrality and financial aspect. For example even during recent history Greece wanted to stay neutral during the WWII...nobody respected that and it was attacked by both Italy and GErmany. However nobody touched Switzerland because everybody had advantages both Nazi Germans (use of financial reserves, railway system)with the tolerance of Swiss people ( i don't raise the point whether this was ethical or not) and the allies. But coming to today because somebody mentioned that they keep taxes from the money being deposited in Swiss banks. Well this is not entirely true, they keep a percentage of the interest which is minimal. The problem with Swiss banks is that they never ask where do money come from. Having lived in NL, UK when i deposited a relatively large amount of money within 5 days (in NL) i got a notice from the tax office to go and explain where i found the money. This is to prevent money laundering etc..in Switzerland this is not the case (at least to my knowledge). 
So something has to be done in terms of this aspect.  Moreover, having the benefits of a close association with EU while not following the norms is also not appropriate e.g. (minimal taxation across EU, subsidies) etc.  But having said that, i do recognise even within EU there are so many differences taking into example my home country which follows absolutely no Eu norms and the situation led Greece where it is now.

This is a very specific tax which according to you should be spent on a designated purpose. What would be appropriate?

			I guess the problem will arise only if because the cost/benefit of a slightly worse therapy is way better, they exclude the slightly better but crazy expensive therapy, then you have the feeling you are not getting the best of the best. 
A systematic process of reviewing costs/benefits of therapies, drugs or surgical operations, makes sense to me, what matters is where you draw the line. I don't believe people would accept not having the best, even though health insurance is expensive.    the system is i don't trust my GP so i go to the specialist to get a second opinion anyway. But sometimes people need to talk more to their doctors and there would be less problems.    well australians being fair skinned, having lot of UV exposure and having had the ozone hole, have probably developed more of a sensitivity to the topic. Anyway it's up to people to go to the dermatologist for a scan, i know people do this but it's their business. 
Also scanning for weird spots on your skin is something you can do at home to a certain degree, does not remove the risk 100% obviously.

The grass-green pie represents the traditional model with a single earner, the darker-green dual earner with a clear main-earner (one with  100% workload, the other works anything between 0% and 100%). Their combined share, though  shrinking, didn't change thaaat much, it's still about 3 in 4 households  considered. Both working part time is the orange pie.      (excerpt from page 12 of  )  shows that single parent homes have way much lower average income (40%  of which is transfer icnoem to begin with) than any other household  group, which shows why kids are the poverty risk number one. The  ""Obligatorische  Abzüge"" (mandatory deductions) mentioned in the chart include payments  for children and ex-wife  after divorce, ""Transfereinkommen"" means all forms of social security  income including AHV and individual social help and transfer income for  the children. Interestingly available average income is roughly the same  for all groups except for singles and single parent homes (is perhaps  the number of children by quite a  bit a function of available income?).   
Single earner in my mind isn't absolte. For me this includes households where one earns, say, 15% or less of the total income.

I look on CHF mortgage in my case like this - if CHF would go up, it's not the best thing for mortgage (no increased costs, but no gains either), BUT - all my & fiancee's remaining earnings would go up, at least on global scale (which boils down to local somehow, eventually, even if just a bit). Those are of course much more than monthly down payments of secondary residence.   
If CHF would go down, our net worth would suffer, but at least there is no additional hit in increased monthly payments compared to EURO mortgage.   
For people in Geneva, strong CHF means real savings since so many things can be facilitated across the border, from which you are never more than few kms.    
(there are nasty consequences of strong CHF in employment part, but since there is no real job security anyway, this part doesn't give me creeps).

			St Croix is quite a different story actually- and it industry which collapsed in the 70s, was much more based on musical boxes, record players and cameras, including the famous BOLEX.   
The watch making industry was much more important in my Valley- where about about a dozen watch making and parts manufacturers closed in the 70s- as well as a massive knitting machine factory, the best in the world for over a Century- as they didn't see the Japanese arriving with new technology. It was a tragedy for the area- I grew up here in the 50s and 60s- when all those industries were booming, watch makers, but also hands, ébauches, and all sort of parts, and also several engineering firms, and as said, a massive knitting machine factory exporting all over the world.   
 But some of the young watch-makers picked themselves up, and decided, very wisely and cleverly, that the only way to bring back watch-making was to invest in very high quality top of the range watches. They took a huge risk- but it paid off- with the highest quality label attached. One of those was the son of an Italian immigrant- I take my hat off to him for all he has achieved. And the authorities also realised it was paramount to diversify.   
Yacek. it is tough for you and I am sorry. But can you really talk about a 'mindset' in a negative way. Vaud on its own is owed over one million CHF by France for frontaliers. That is not peanuts. And each unemployed person and their family cost the community millions too- as well as affects a whole range of cultural and social factors too. As hard as it is on you, can you not imagine why it makes sense to employ local people first, and that this is not anti frontaliers or foreign workers? Bonne chance.

But this argumentation implies a trading of ""rights"" in a marketplace because she's better off in any case here. She gets ""less"" rights than other people because in her country things are worse. I don't think that it's the good way to approach it. All foreigners living in this country under swiss law should have same duties and rights regardless of country of origin. It's absolute.     
Regarding Sozialhilfe (Castro is gonna hate the language mix here): she's working 50% only and that does not give her enough revenue. I'm speculating that she has probably health problems that won't her work more than 50%. So does that mean only the healthy and rich are naturalized?

Some locations are rife with it and you can smell it in the air, parks by the lake in summer for example, certain bars and clubs are happy to tolerate skinning up inside so long as it's taken outside to smoke, certain clubs that allow smoking may tolerate it inside (Although it may depend on who organised the night and who the security is).  TBH, you can tell by the crowd who frequent the place.  Police rarely seem to bother such spots and turn a blind eye, or maybe people see them coming.

Then they tore the turkish co-driver out to beat him, kept beating and kicking him even when he was lying helplessly on the ground. They also attacked the driver, who finally tried to (and did) escape by driving into the kurdish protesteres. After a few minutes he turned around and drove into the crowd.

But also I noticed for the first time they are charging extra to pay by CC. Have they always done that? 11.00 chufs for 138.00 fair seems really high. So I paid by Post card which is still free.

Nicht nur Frauen, auch Polizisten benutzen Pfefferspray. Dessen Handhabung erlernen Polizisten in der Ausbildung. Bild kaposz 
Nach der Vergewaltigung in Emmen fühlen sich viele Frauen nicht mehr sicher. Führen sie einen Pfefferspray in der Handtasche mit, können sie sich im Ernstfall wehren. 
von Irene Lustenberger     
Am Abend des 21. Juli reisst ein Unbekannter in Emmen eine 26-jährige Frau vom Velo und vergewaltigt sie in einem Waldstück. Seither ist das Opfer vom Hals abwärts gelähmt. 
Der Vorfall macht betroffen und weckt vor allem bei Frauen Angst. Deshalb erstaunt es nicht, dass Pfeffersprays in Luzern und Umgebung seither gefragt sind.   
«Jede Person über 18 Jahren darf einen Pfefferspray besitzen und mit sich führen», bestätigt David Mynall, Mediensprecher der Kantonspolizei Schwyz. Aufgrund des Wirkstoffs sei Pfefferspray keine Waffe, Tränengas hingegen schon. «Pfefferspray greift einzig die Schleimhäute an, Tränengas wirkt aber auf die Atemwege. Dies kann für die betroffene Person lebensgefährlich werden», führt Mynall aus. Trotzdem dürfe Pfefferspray nur zur Selbstverteidigung oder zur Abwehr eines Angriffs eingesetzt werden. «Wird der Spray willkürlich eingesetzt, kann die betroffene Person eine Anzeige wegen Tätlichkeiten machen», so der Mediensprecher.

			This is true-all tests of educational achievement are flawed.  There's actually been a lot of research on the PISA tests regarding methodology and country-specific flaws.  These studies suggest that, more than anecdotal evidence, there are systemic flaws in test implementation that can strongly influence country scores.  These, unfortunately, tend to lag far behind the PISA results (for obvious reasons).   
From a critical review of the 2000 PISA:   
""The issue of response bias due to pupils having already left school, by the date of the survey, may be expected to be even more serious in countries where 15 is the age when obligatory full-time schooling ends as, for example, in many parts of Switzerland and Germany, but much depends on the survey's coverage of part-time vocational colleges.  Vocational colleges in these countries were sampled in respect of their 15 year olds; pupil-response rates have been published for Germany, but reached only a disappointing 44% (compared to 86% for the inquiry as a whole in that country).""

			I confess to having only read the 20 Min article quickly, but I must have missed the part where the US Embassy called the police.  Rather, the article suggests that the police called the US Embassy to confirm that it was ok to permit the flowers to remain but only after the police had conducted the control.       
Given the current situation across much of Europe, only an absolute fool would be surprised about being subject to police scrutiny when approaching any western embassy under the circumstances described in the article.  The police would have no doubt taken exactly the same action if the flowers had been laid in front of the French or Belgian embassies.   
Oh, and it is only a matter of time before IZRS is found to have been funneling monies used in the funding of terrorist activity.  There is simply no comparison whatsoever between drawing a cartoon and knowingly financing a ""revolution"", not to mention openly recruiting jihadists, in another country.

SwissMorgs	3,673	22	Basel	26.04.2015, 22:57	"    Granted people in Switzerland do have to pay a hell of a high price to survive. 3500 can barely get you by - with 2/3 of that gone just from rent and basic health insurance alone. Most people in a relationship however get over 7k per month combined, if they struggle to survive on that, they're doing something wrong.        Either you have never driven a GB plated car in switzerland or your police in your specific area is more laid back. Ostschweiz have some of the more prejudice police out there I think, moreso in Sargans and Truebbach. Seems to be less common around Buchs SG but it does happen. Never been stopped around Zurich or St. Gallen City to be honest, so views can obviously differ based on the local force. When she did get stopped however, what was interesting is the first question they asked was ""Why is this car here?"". Would have loved to reply ""because it's not illegal to drive an EU issued car in Switzerland"" but that would have probably caused more trouble than it was worth lol. Even more hilarious is when they ask ""Where is this car from?"" even though it has a clear as hell GB plate on the back of it and a very distinct plate numbering system that all police forces in europe should be aware of by now, especially considering the number of tourists who come through Switzerland for Skiing in the Alps.          Not sure what you're trying to get across here. Looks out of context and is quite confusing. Maybe you could clarify of the importance to my message? Not trying to dig, just confused lol        Do Zurich and Basel share the same train line? Shame of it for me is that I am in the Ostwind SBB region and that only goes as far as Zug, so prices are quite hefty to go further (aka to Zurich) by train.

Before our commune and canton interviews, we were given a crib sheet of things we should know and were likely to be questioned on; local geography, political figures etc. We learnt more about the local political scene than many of our Swiss friends had forgotten.

			My wife recently had an operation, which involved a temporary colostomy bag, which she hated. It's gone now, but she asked the Spitex lady who came to change the dressings how did people, especially younger people, manage, if they had to wear one for life? One trick, said the lady, was to give the bag a name. One enterprising 24 year-old promptly named hers ""Christoph"", after Blocher, ""because both are full of s***"".

Now to political clout. Whenever the SVP gets, in the elections to the Nationalrat, between 25 and 29 percent of the votes, not all SVP minded support those positions but many others join them. The other way round, while the SocialDemocrats have to work with an electorate share of between 18 and 24 percent, they in initiatives often get 63 to 80 percent. This is the nature of the direct democracy.  THIS is why Theodor Heuss, the first Federal President of West Germany rejected that idea very clearly

AND, the SVP defacto lost Mr Spuhler and Mr Walter Frei and almost halfway Ulrich Giezendanner. All three were forced to back SVP positions they did not share, and after such things took their distance.      
Add to this that the SVP within a quarter century grew immensely and starts to get divided into sections, just as other parties     
and just as other such large parties got its break-aways       
let's not Forget that the Social Democrats originally broke away from the Liberals (Freisinnige)

			Today in Bern is the Onion Market day, a sort of Oktoberfest without the beer and thrilling rides.    
It is also announced that today the decision will be made on whether to accept the multi-million legacy of Gurlitts junior who died in Munich. The controversy centres around any tax the Gurlitt estate will have to pay the Bavarian tax office. Another possible problem is if any Jewish relatives pop up and claim that a painting belonged to their old relative.    
Info: Gurlitt's father was high up in the Nazi party and was an art dealer, his collection passed to his son, who kept it hidden to avoid taxes. Gurlitt has bequeathed in his Will the massive art collection to the Bern art museum, on condition it be kept and displayed together. So a big expense for Bern is forewarned..

Goverments really like smokers as they spend on cigarettes (disposable income), are addicted (will continually spend) and pay high taxes (on cigarettes).   
The fact is we (as a population) are paying for smokers through our health premiums as, I believe, insurance companies cannot grade insurance premiums - it has to be one size fits all based on the level of service you want.

347	Swiss politicsnews	"""Switzerland, a country that works"" - Washington Times article"	guest	4,268	20	null	1.1.0001, 00:00	"    I think what makes Switzerland so special is that people do get on across linguistic and religious boundaries. The individual cantons are traditionally pretty homogenous and thus people don't feel threatened by the other lot taking over thei homes and their way of life. But between cantons there is a strong will to work together for the greater good. sure, there is a lot of mud slinging and the Röstigraben rears its ugly head, but at the end of the day they bury their differences and get the job done.   
This is in contrast to the US where there are often real vile differences between red and blue states and one lot will sometimes think God wants them to force the other lot to do things their way rather than being prepared to live and let live.   
So the swiss way is that if you gon into the other guy's canton, you do things his way, and if he comes into yours you expect him to do things your way.   
I can imagine that if there were say,a Muslim canton in Switzerland, then you'd still get the diatribe but they'd respect that canton's right to reverse the diatribe in their own canton and neither side would think badly of the other for it.

			I forget a lot of things but I can not imagine forgetting a child and going to work for 8+ hours.  But then again, my job is stay at home mom and the kids are my job.  Now,  I have purposefully left my babies in the car when they were asleep - most times parked in my attached garage to my house with the baby monitor in the car.  If not, I would be within eyesight of the car and check on them, and if the weather was too hot, I would bring them inside.     
It is tragic and will haunt the guilty their entire lives, I can't imagine it.  However, even after reading much of the article mentioned, I am not sure how I should look differently at these incidents.   
ETA:    OK, I will give someone the benefit of the doubt that maybe you forget if you do a quick pop into a store. My former neighbor told me once she did this as her mother had been visiting and she had had some time out alone without the baby.  The next time out she ""forgot"" - but only for 5 minutes before she was in a panic and returned to her car.  But if you are gone for several hours, I don't see how you could forget your child in the car.    
I guess that is the one benefit of never having had family or others around to take care of my kids for me - I always knew I had to have them with me.  When kid # 3 came into the family, I used to do a ""kid count"" with my kids before driving away, especially if it was too quiet in the back!  It's turned into a bit of a joke and we still do it sometimes today, with the kids who are 10, 8 and 5.

fyi, if anyone were to actually have a frank discussion with an honest Swiss banker (yes, they do exist), they would be very open that the Swiss banking industry was knowingly helping US citizens hide taxable income from the US authorities for years upon years, and the fines that have been assessed are just the tip of the iceberg.  you do not have to like the US policy of taxing citizenship rather than residency (and, candidly, what kind of expat WOULD like it), but the Swiss banking industry has been aware of the rules since Hector was a pup and the only thing that upsets the Swiss banking industry now is the disclosure requirement (since the disclosure requirement compels the banks to disclose behavior that has gone on for decades).

The lack of policemen is everywhere in CH I think. We have a low per-capita amount of police. This was okay 10 years ago. Nowadays, the border doesn't mean anything anymore. E.g. thieves from nomad camps in northern Italy come here on day-trips without problems.   
This has got nothing to do with people getting beaten though (except for the elderly that were beaten by burglarizers in romandy some time ago). Usually it's locals who do it, like groups of maladjusted secondos or the usual local team of drugged up troublemakers, or drunk natives.

			Hi, I'm trying to find out the rules and regulations for Swiss (and also German) elections when it comes to advertising, promotion of candidates, putting up posters etc. In my country posters can only be put up 4 weeks before an election, but then it's a free for all with every accessible telegraph pole covered and sometimes traffic lights and other sign-age blocked. They are usually pretty big, roughly 3 - 4 ft (90-120 cm) by 2 - 3 foot. These posters can get blown down in heavy weather and sometimes end up strewn across streets, in fields etc.   
The bigger parties have large budgets for postering and promotion, leaving the independents and smaller parties at a disadvantage. There are penalties for putting posters up early but they are rarely enforced.   
So if anyone has answers (even better for Germany also) or can point me to a site or resource with this info I'd be grateful.   
 - Are posters for election candidate allowed in Switzerland? 
 - Are there restrictions as to when / where posters can be placed? 
 - Are there restictions on size / dimensions?  
 - Do they have to be removed by a certain time period after an election? 
 - Are there any penalties for breaches of the rules?   
TIA

			hi,   
From the armee website:   
hi,   
Here is some information and contact:       
I just translate by google:     
The Swiss abroad are normally released in peacetime recruitment and conscription as long as they remain abroad. However, certain restrictions apply to the territories near the border. The Swiss abroad have the possibility, under certain specific conditions and following specific procedures to perform voluntary recruitment, recruit school and education services in Switzerland . In this regard, please contact directly to the competent Swiss representation abroad . If a Swiss expatriate returns home , he is again , depending on age and ability, constrained by principle and unrestricted access to military obligations.   
If you have any questions regarding military obligations dual -nationals, please telephone or write to the State Joint Staff of the Army Staff, Army (DBC 1 ) Management Section law and guidelines , Pierre -Jean Dizerens , 3003 Bern Tel. 031 324 32 56 Fax 031 324 14 92 , E -Mail (<pierre-jean.dizerens@vtg.admin.ch>) or Mr. Michel Grunig , Tel. 031 324 20 63 Fax 031 324 14 92 E- Mail. (michel.gruenig@vtg.admin.ch)   
Then the best way is to send them an email. I think there is age limite i didn't find it. You should ask them. The best should be for you to arrive after your 30 years old like its the last year to pay the tax if you don't do military. 30 years old poeple who does military should the end but depends if this person did all the days (then after you shouldn't pay anymore the tax even if you don't do it like) but one more time they will tell you more.   
I am doing the military then if you have other question you are welcome.   
Good luck for your projects to come in Switzerland.   
See you

			Hello,   
I've been selected for a masters at EPFL. But recently I got to know about a plan by swiss government to increase the tuition fees. My plan is to work in a lab at EPFL to support my expenses because my parents can not afford it. The amount I get by working there will be marginally enough to support my expenses. But if the proposed increase happens, I'll be in trouble.   
I was able to find these two documents regarding the debate in the parliament. 
Debate on 06/03/2014 :  
Debate on 03/10/2013 :      
Here is my questions, 
I read these documents using the google translator.  But it's not much clear. At one point it says  
""the fees may not exceed three times the amount "".  
Have I understood that correctly ? If this is the case, I might be able to cover my tuition fees somehow. But if they increase it by a large factor (like 10 times the current one) to match US tuition fees, I'll be in big trouble.      ]         PLEASE REPLY - I BADLY NEED TO CLARIFY THIS ASAP   
Thank you   
PS :  
1. When I work in the lab, I'll pay 200 chf every month as taxes. 
2. EPFL do not guarantee that the fees will remain constant after enrolling.

However I have noticed from conversations in Germany that this is not a popular point of view. Maybe the npd needs to be banned just to prove that thats not the solution and isn't ending the violence.   
One problem is that there isnt much of a continuum between the npd and any of the established parties, so there are no normal politicians willing to stand up and say some of the things the npd are saying in a more moderate way, and willing to start a restrained and civilized debate on these questions.  Some people tried. Well, what sarrazin said was extremely stupid, and moellemann got crucified for saying something that if said by say, somebody in the svp, wouldnt even have attracted much attention. Germany seems to have a serious taboo issue that stifles the necessary discussion.

If a CEO is genuinely giving that added value to a company, the shareholders would be stupid not to reward him for that.

			This is true-all tests of educational achievement are flawed.  There's actually been a lot of research on the PISA tests regarding methodology and country-specific flaws.  These studies suggest that, more than anecdotal evidence, there are systemic flaws in test implementation that can strongly influence country scores.  These, unfortunately, tend to lag far behind the PISA results (for obvious reasons).   
From a critical review of the 2000 PISA:   
""The issue of response bias due to pupils having already left school, by the date of the survey, may be expected to be even more serious in countries where 15 is the age when obligatory full-time schooling ends as, for example, in many parts of Switzerland and Germany, but much depends on the survey's coverage of part-time vocational colleges.  Vocational colleges in these countries were sampled in respect of their 15 year olds; pupil-response rates have been published for Germany, but reached only a disappointing 44% (compared to 86% for the inquiry as a whole in that country).""

The writer sums up the Swiss view of its bankers quite well, tolerated but not loved:   ""Until the mid-19th century, Switzerland was  poor. My great-grandmother, who grew up in an Alpine valley, often went  hungry; occasionally, she was even forced to eat grass to fill her  belly. Switzerland’s elevation to the ranks of the most prosperous  nations was largely because of its manufacturing industry: watches,  textiles and mechanical engineering.           
It was only after World War II that Switzerland became an important  player in the financial sector. Despite our reputation abroad, that is  probably why banks don’t really figure in our sense of who we are; we  just let them get on with it. Their revenues contributed substantially  to our welfare, but we were never in love with them.""       "	155	 Aug 2012	3.0	['7', '2']	['160', '73']	0

Yahoo was only one, and I guess with 30 employees, one of the smaller enterprises in this business park that also has Chiquita, Nissan, etc...  So not sure if one can say it was especially built for Yahoo.  The facilties there are just one drab grey modern box sitting next to another on what otherwise is a lovely hillside of vineyards, such a shame they don't take the grey box with them if they leave.

¨ 
Confederata Helvetica 
We are 26 cantons 
Some of whom don't like each other 
Some formed by cantons splitting 
With four different national languages 
And 2531 different dialects 
We've even modified French 
There are two official religions 
But we don't like to talk about religion 
It's a personal thing. 
Despite all these differences 
We're one country 
And doing better than you beggers in the surrounding nations 
So. Yah boo sucks to you!   
It could be in the four national languages, but just put it into latin; then everyone is happy.

			Our politics here in Switzerland are tough to beat. We tend not to berate individuals or their characters because most of us know at last someone involved in politics, even if that is the local school overview committee in your local town.    
We more or less get the chance to vote on all the major issues through referendums. Issues  as potentially volatile as the minaret case a few years ago wasn't associated with individual politicians, rather the political parties were the protagonists. Keeping individuals out of both national and international issues does allow the electorate to focus on the issues at hand, rather than being fed a diet of tabloid type sensationalism.    
On the other side, when politicians are left to their own devices, they can make a mess of major issues which would have been better dealt with by referendum. The non bailout of Swissair, or handing UBS billions without consulting taxpayers spring to mind.

			Well my parents asked  me to sign for it. SO I did. Granted when the time (and if) the decision will be very hard.    
My aunt went from completely normal to not controlling her body within a 2 years timeframe. I can honestly and without doubt say I would rather know I died happy and peacefully than not knowing it at all. This is again is another point that can be argued that you simply would not know it if you got it but the ones you leave behind will know.  , or give my family huge medical bills for something that will not be cured anytime soon. When we went to my aunts wake most of the things her husband could say were from when she got the disease as that was all he remembered since he took care of in her final years 24/7. and that is how she will be remembered by many.    
Our whole family and others including her husband wanted her to slip away but it wasn't possible as she was not capable of making that choice... . I do not find that correct.    
I have another aunt who also passed with Leukemia . The pain was so bad and after many consideration she decided to do Euthanasia. She got to say goodbye to her young children, her husband and her family. She went with her mind at peace and was able to leave the pain behind. I find it normal that one should have that choice of when/where/how to go.....

588	Swiss politicsnews	This Swiss have voted...	AbFab	7,052	56	Zürich	11.03.2012, 17:46	"    The reason that places are empty in April is because literally everything closes down.  For me, this really makes something of a nonsense of the ""cold beds"" argument.  Naturally mountain lifts need to close for maintenance and to wait for the snow to melt, but where we are they don't open again until July.  All the main hotels and restaurants are shut and most local facilities (e.g. indoor swimming pools etc.) are shut.     
Second homes in Switzerland are really only usable for a very short period of each year.  We are lucky enough to own a second home, which is very much a   to us and as such we use it for more than four months of the year.  I would very much like to use our home more, we also rent ours to contacts we have, but I cannot in good conscience rent a property when the whole place is shut and there is nothing at all to do.  The ghost town problem is created by the Gemeindes themselves, not the second home owners.   
A whole new approach to tourism needs to be adopted if year round tourism is wanted.  At the moment, the tourism industry funds its whole year from the winter season by charging extortionate prices, adds a bit of jam on top from the summer season and simply shuts up shop during the shoulder spring and autumn season.     
If Switzerland wants to do something about ""cold beds"" then people should be incentivised to rent their properties.  At the moment, a local annual ""bed tax"" is charged if an owner wishes to rent out his property.  Tax is then paid on the rent earned in addition to the normal deemed rental income tax on any property owned in CH.  When you weigh this up with the costs of advertising the property and processing the rental (cleaning etc.) and the wear and tear on the property then it is no surprise that many people choose not to take the option.   
Naturally I agree that nature and the environment should be preserved, but to a large extent this is already happening.  Most mountain areas which have a high proportion of second homes have already imposed restrictions on new builds specifically for the second home market.

- Right to life 
- Freedom from torture 
- Freedom from slavery 
- Right to a fair trial 
- Freedom of speech 
- Freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
and many more.   
The trick with international conventions is that they only work if all take part. If the UK as a security council member would leave is the entire thing not worth the paper it is written on. It is the only time in history that humans agreed in principle what is right and wrong. Nobody claims that the convention is perfect or that all countries are following it - the world simply is far from perfect. But for me is this one of the few true achievements of the UN - most of the stuff they did in the past 60 years was a giant waste of money, but making everyone agree to that basic principle has probably saved more lives than all those people here banging on the refugees think.

In countries such as Switzerland/USA/Australia a woman is more likely to report the crime and get support from family/friends (although date rape is less likely to be reported), whereas in India they can be shunned, publicly humiliated or ignored....   
But I think also the way in which these incidents is happening is more the alarming part. In most places, if you are travelling with your husband, or another person, on public transport etc you are less likely to be a target. Even in Australia I would never have walked home alone as you can never be too safe.. It's rarely reported that a pack of men attack a couple together, beating the man and raping his wife/partner in front of them. That's the scary part.

We're not allowed to light candles in the office (came from Christmas time) as is poses a serious health and safety risk. At least, for some areas, they've seen the light..   
Otherwise, going back on topic to the Zuri West power outage scandal, I can only guess that the medium-voltage network isn't designed with much redundancy in mind or any real ability to safely reconfigure the system if one section fails. If I look at the distribution network within a (non-nuclear)power plant, there is redundancy everywhere; you can always use the switching elements within the network to safely reconfigure the system in case one section fails.

I know because I bought all my stuff there... the entire concept of Digitec was ""harddiscount"" - the electronics version of Aldi - no fancy shops, no high rent, no incompetent sales assistants earning 4-5k standing around doing nothing all day. No or very low stock of products to keep the business lean and avoid the costs to sell old stock for discounted prices. Just a website and a counter manned by an army of students (The students are probably decently paid though because the concept worked and made the company popular). Therefore no service beyond your legal minimum rights, waiting lines to pick stuff up and anything people would possible endure to get a good price.   
The Migros on the other hand is a cooperative that is the exact opposite - high costs, terrible employees in the electronics section, usually outdated stock, uncompetitive prices.   
Bottom line - there is no way that Migros under their own brand would manage to operate like Digitec. They are diametral opposite company cultures... I hope they keep the business independant. Otherwise will it go down in record time. Because nobody went to digitec because of their convenient parking places... if that happens am I sure that somebody will fill in the gap.

Also, rearing up in front of a bus is a menacing act.  Did you read the article?  Its not like this bear just follows people around like a lost puppy?       If an animal is attacked by another animal, it defends itself.  Many prey animals will actually go so far as to actually attack predator animals preemptively and kill them.  Why is this any different from what was done here?  Further, I would not consider death by mauling a natural cause of death for a human anymore.      This is foolish hyperbole.  We cannot protect ourselves from every danger.  However, we can protect ourselves from a rogue bear.      No, I don't ""fail to see the point.""  I don't agree with those that believe this one bear had more rights than all the people living in the area, nor with those that assume this decision was made lightly and without considering or trying other options first.      I don't NEED to ask them anything, as they're free to make decisions about their own safety from wild animals themselves.  I think everyone in that area, including the children were aware of that bear and knew what to do.  They obviously also did not feel invincible as they chose to eliminate the bear.      Two deaths are better than one?        I'm actually confident that they probably considered relocation as an option.  If you read the article, several less-than-lethal options were tried; why would they exclude such an obvious option from consideration?        Not just a bit...        You aren't ""essentially"" saying that, you ARE saying that.  Why don't you travel down there and point to the person you wish dead?  Can't do that?  Then why should it be any easier when the affected person is just an abstract concept?      Again, I'm sure nobody just flipped a coin, saying heads he lives, tails he dies.

			There was no surprise at the strong vote to keep the military the way it is. The result came from the weakness of the alternative on the ballot. The alternative was a professional army and a voluntary paid year of service for both men and women. No convincing, realistic recruitment plans were presented for the year of service.    
Many agree that mandatory service for men is quite outdated and quite unnecessary for a neutral country such as Austria. The only military operations in which they participate are those of NATO and the UN, and those are carried out by the professional fraction of the army. However, a major part of the rescue and relief operations are carried out by the military. Additionally, a large number of men (who choose to do a civilian service year instead of military service) provide the workforce of social service organizations such as Caritas (like Spitex) and the Red Cross. How this workforce would be replaced without the mandatory service was very unclear to the voters.    
The vote came from the pragmatism of the Austrian people. Before you can do away with an established labor force, you must have a replacement to continue to provide these vital services. I don't personally like mandatory military service one bit. But I do understand the need to properly reform rather than flippantly abolish the system.

I didn't see how reading an article would influence individuals seriously contemplating taking their own lives but the article Adrian posted citing the Werther effect and suicide contagion does provide a clear link and the research to back it up.    
That raises another question, if the logic behind the absence of news about suicides is to discourage copycats, then why are far worse things reported every day? The media has no problem reporting gruesome gang rapes, mass shootings and sadistic acts of violence which unfortunately inspire copycats.

And on the other side, the SVP was determined to get another seat in the Federal Council and to press Blocher into the seat of Mrs Metzler.    
It is rumoured that they made a kind of package deal with Mr Deiss so that HE could continue. The CVP later on moved fairly modern, almost progressive Mrs Leuthard into the seat in question.

682	Swiss politicsnews	Do the Swiss charge the asylum seekers for rent?	stevesim	2,608	9	Zurich	30.12.2012, 16:45	" 
			
			Well, the topic was about ""charging asylum seekers for rent"". This is clearly not charged by Swiss authorities whilst their claims are pending ( which means they have an N permit ).   
Rejectees ( therefore technically no longer asylum seekers as far as the Swiss authorities are concerned ) lose their N permits and work rights, and therefore access to lodging ( and other benefits ). They are sent a letter by the Cantonal authorities to surrender their permit and to leave the Canton.   
Those who do not depart become   and depend on churches, charities and emergency shelters ( especially during the colder months ).    
These organisations support the Sans papiers for medical treatment,  , shared bedding, travel tickets and so on as they have exhausted most means to become documented. I was involved in teaching IT literacy to them in Zürich especially those in need of some skills. Many spoke very good German. Not everyone is  rejected asylum seeker there ( about 15% were from the EU and outside who cannot return for many reasons ) and the people who run the show include the Sans papiers and local Swiss. Their premises have been raided by the police many times.      ( or   in Germany )   
Some Cantons provide a tiny leeway to a permit ( must be able to demonstrate that one is ""integrated"" and apply a few times for the very limited places for a compassionate permit -   ). This is   although only a handful have obtained them after years on here ( less than 5% get it ). Some find work ( schwarzarbeit ) and those who pay their way through for lodging and other expenses.       
The asylum system here is pretty fair and humane, and in typical Swiss fashion is transparent, logical and embodies procedural fairness with rights as per Administrative Law for review / appeal(s).   
I think the allegation that asylum seekers are charged for rent holds no water.

We had a similar situation in the UK with many Indian factory owners, especially in the textile trade, vastly exploiting their own - which made it difficult for authorities to act for fear of being accused of racism. This was prevalent in Leicester as the wealthy and experienced ex Ugandan Asians (thrown out by Idi Amin) took over the textile trade in the 70s - and started sweat shops in the town, and also exploiting women and children working at home.   
Portuguese people in my area are well integrated and settled, most of them having arrived in the 70s/80s - many of them with their own businesses here. The village near where I live has 2 Portuguese shops for instance, one is a printer, another a foundry, and several restaurant owners.

			If it's only for a small percentage of the curriculum I don't care if my son learns about it so long as it's taught in a similar manner to other subjects, eg, History.     
I don't think it would happen here but if they were to start ramming religious rhetoric down his throat I would have a couple of things to say to them.   
I had to complain at his daycare a few months ago because he came home spouting stuff about ""God says this.."" and ""God saves everyone"" - we don't even discuss religion at home.  Turns out one of the daycare dearies decided to shoe-horn it into part of one of the topics they were covering.

			This from the current edition of ""Horse and Hound"" magazine in the UK:       
Horses have made a comeback in more than 120 cities and towns across France and Switzerland. They are used to pull rubbish and recycling collection carts, in parks maintenance and as green school buses.   
Now a hybrid cart  with an   motor that cuts in to help with hills and on difficult terrain  has been developed by Swiss technology company  , with government help.   
Reudi von Neiderhäusen of the Swiss Stud said: We have used six different horses to test the cart, looking at the effect it has on the horse.   
Our research is not concluded, but the response from local people has been very positive. It changes peoples relationship with the street cleaners for the better when they are using a horse rather than a tractor.      
Saw an article about this in the Le Lac free paper some months ago.

Personally (as someone who used to like a punt) I would never bet on something as lowly as Swiss Football, or the result of one ball in international cricket, or a horse race with a paltry winning prize. They are all open to making more money by fixing than winning.

			NO, nobdoy wants to have the Federal Capital in Olten, but SBB CARGO is relocating its HQ from Basel to Olten. The contract about the present location in Basel will terminate in 2014 and the prices for similar locations in Basel no longer are acceptable while the space would be narrow. The price level and the strategic location of Olten makes it THE ideal place for the purpose. The change from entertaining and lively and beautiful Basel to Olten may be a challenge for many of the SBB CARGO folks. But those who relocate may possibly help to ""upgrade"" Olten a bit. The new HQ will be near to Olten Rail Station. The number of people relocating is around 500.  Some or many of them of course may opt to commute between Basel and Olten. However, many WILL move and some will gradually be ""replaced"" by people from the Solothurn/Nord-Bern area which includes Biel/Bienne.

Interesting in a way, but the statistics rather cover up the vast differences. While the ""active"" unemployment-rate in Span and Portugal will get down to the one in Italy, the one in Greece possibly will even rise.    
It works the other way round as well. Companies in Switzerland, and there were and are many, who depend on exports to Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece (and other such countries) suffered quite heavily and may even have to reduce the personnel.    
You also have to see the difference. Somebody ""relieved of his responsibility"" at UBS can rely on an intact economy and an intact social structure, but somebody sacked by a Greek bank cannot

No new law is required in regard to the ""UVP - unverbindlicher Verkaufs-Preis -  recommended sales price""  as it is up to the trading company simply to refuse such ""recommendations"" and in case the suppliers get wild, stop the purchases. There in ""Züri-Nord"" are two shops dealing with aviation goods who permanently refuse to accept such ""recommendations"" and at least two major German suppliers very well co-operate. Quite many customers of shops in the Zürich area are (YES, still are! )  Germans, who perfectly well know the few but important products which are cheaper overhere anyway, and also realize within split-seconds when a product is cheaper than in Germany. The German shoppers are important enough that Zürich-City-Police and most of the city-police-units north of Zürich long ago changed the parkometers to accept Euros, of course on the basis of a 1:1 rate, which is nice for the city-finance    What a MediaMarkt chap of MediaMarkt Donaueschingen told me quite a while ago still is true now. Thanks to Japanese-Swiss trade agreements (both country-to-country and company-to-company) many articles in the TV/radio/electronics sector are cheaper here than in Germany but the furniture and some equipment for the stuff in question is cheaper in Germany by up to 60% !  A few months ago, Migros and Coop started to refuse those ""recommendations"" and only restarted certain imports after those suppliers backed down.    
Why did so many CH retailers accept that nonsense for so long ?   
Very simple, because they had between 25% and 70% out of the add-on profit !    Things only changed when also people farther inland than the usual border-zone saw the savings-potential of a visit to places like Konstanz   
The Konsumentenschutz therefore wants to raise the pressures. Extraordinary circumstances demand extraordinary actions !

			Yes, you are right, different systems are ... different. And some of us feel more comfortable and trust one more than the other. Many people in the Western world choose TCM nowadays, and why not? So if you would prefer to rely on TCM, why don't you, fair enough. A GP in the UK takes 9 years to train (6 years at Uni- 1 year in F1 house officer, then 3 years in F2 for GP training). For specialists, it can be 10 years of more.   
It is true that specialist GP training is not so developed in Switzerland. A school friend of mine was an orthopeadic surgeon all his life, and decided aged 59 to go into general practice, which would not have been possible in the UK.    
But each to their own as regards choice of system we feel more comfortable with, and trust more.

That for industry and inbound tourism is good either way and will either create new jobs or at least save existing jobs.

Secondly, he was even more stupid for telling them that. To be able to prove anything, the customs officials would have had to phone the Finanzamt to verify that these accounts had not been declared, and I doubt that the Finanzamt anwers such queries over the telephone, not even to customs agents. I doubt that the Finanzamt can even access such data in real time. I know from my relatives in Germany that they take months if not years to respond to the simplest of questions, and then still get them wrong. So they would even have had to let the guy go, or confiscated those statements and he would still have had time to do a Selbstanzeige and have it on the desk of the Finanzamt before the customs got their act together.   
And summing up, remember a lot of what you see on TV is set up, often with the intent of scaring people. Quite possibly the guy was an actor doing his job. Do you think he would have signed a moel release to allow footage of him to be put on TV to see for everybody to smirk over if he'd really just been caught in a serious way?   
And finally, I've personally transferred heaps of documents and papers over the border over the years. I've had customs guys look at all sorts of stuff but never my paperwork. They'd probably be too thick to see a bank statment if they saw one.

			All this talk of reunification is just BS.    
Unless it was on our (BL's) terms, I can't see the majority of voters (of whom 60% live in BL) agreeing to reunification.   
Although if it did go through, they'd have to process my tax refund from 2009 at last, which has been held up to date by a dispute between the two half-cantons over an arcane piece of taxation legislation.      As for Wolli's assertion that support for reunification would have grown over 40 years, consider that 60 years ago, support for restricting handgun ownership in the US to police and other (limited) groups stood at over 50% of the population. Today it is around 25% (and that's post-Aurora). If you're someone who thinks that reunification would be the right thing, be aware that public support for ""the right things"" can wane over time.

That's my experience anyway. I know young people from other countries do stupid things but Darwin award types seem to be from the U.S.   
The first time I experienced this was in Lyon in France when I was younger and they thought nothing of running crossing the busy six-lane motorway to get to the shops from the Youth hostel 
(rather than go a few hundred yards down the road to the footbridge).   
Or there were the ones in Pakistan, eager to show everyone the kilo of hashish they had in their backpack.

			The rightwing Swiss People’s Party has launched a second initiative to deport foreign criminals, this time to define exactly under which circumstances they can and cannot be deported.   
The initiative text, which extends to five articles over three pages, was accepted on Tuesday by the Federal Chancellery. The party has until  , to collect the 100,000 signatures required to force a nationwide vote on the issue.   
In a statement, the People’s Party said it had launched the initiative because the government is taking too long to implement its first initiative, which won a majority in a nationwide vote in November 2010.   
The initiative text specifies that the Swiss law would have primacy over international law.          "		 Jun 0001		[]	[]

			An explanation in today's L'Express newspaper. At the end of 2011, the Greek health insurances had unpaid debts in Switzerland 0f 12.8 million CHF, for operations they had given permission to go ahead and had agreed to pay for. Apparently the debt for unpaid medical treatment in CH for other EU countries amounts to 186 million CHF. The difference is apparently that payments from other EU countries does eventually get paid, with long delays- whereas Greece has just stopped making any payments.   
So what is the Swiss health system (us) supposed to do? Can we really take such losses 'on the chin' and just raise our premiums even more to cover for this?

The strategy to ""diversify"" the country's export markets was started in 1948, a time when what later became the ""Eurozone"" made up some 80% of the export market. Switzerland however already in the 1940ies and 50ies had a strong customerbase in the Arab World, in Africa, in South Asia and in East Asia, but exactly those markets ARE price-sensitive. You may add countries like Israel, where the customers before the PEG deserted the Swiss exporters and now are back.  The emerging markets may be ""cash-flush"" but of course compare the prices.       - 
Switzerland introduced those restrictions against NON-EU professionals as part of the Bilaterals with the EU. There is no way to ""looseneing the permit restrictions on non EU professionals"" as the signed treaties are definite.  Switzerland cannot ""tighten restrictions on EU nationals"" due to the various treaties.       - 
To say it again, some 80% of the Swiss exports were to the ""Eurozone neighbours"" back around 1950.  NOBODY in Switzerland regards the PEG as THE long-term solution. But it at present is necessary as long as the financial markets are in chaos.       
And here a map   
which shows you where Switzerland is !  Switzerland is ""deep in the heart of Europe"" .  Many of its export markets are less than an hour or two away from the exporter. People there speak the same language, share the same culture,      
and you of course will see the Maghreb below left, and may argue that this is NOT Europe, and many Europeans may agree with you. But I will never forget when I on visit to London discussed things with three Sudanese and told them that as half Algerian ....etc....etc ..... but was corrrected them, saying that for them the three Maghreb countries ARE Europe !   YES, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia are A) as strictly and totally linked to Europe but as members of the ""Mediterranean Partnership"" together with Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Jordan also bound into Europe as much as Switzerland. In case of Switzerland you have to add that Switzerland is full member of the Council of Europe (Europa-Rat), a rather underestimated organisation AND more then 20 European organisations.  Switzerland is more closely integrated into Europe than Britain. Switzerland is a full member of both Schengen & Dublin, which brings lots of advantages but of course also obligations

Most of them have grown up in Switzerland and in better times thought that Greece would be their place. But under the present circumstances now accept the lousy weather. You see, even in bad situations, the social structures here offer far more than those in Greece.

Maybe the difference is that, rather than coming in on an expat bubble, I accepted a job at the equivalent of about 60k per year in order to get my foot in the door and get the permit issue sorted. Once that was done, I worked my way up, but the first two roles I had (both in this canton) I worked almost entirely with Swiss people, and thus a lot of my friends come from that group. I know which bars the locals hang out at (hint: it's not Pickwick), and I've more or less figured out the ""proper"" mix of American infrormality and spontaneity with Swiss planning and structure. Still working on the volume issue, but I'm getting there.   
The key to my integration is, in my opinion, to seek out change. Look for what's different, rather than trying to find ways to make it the same. Abolishing those international schools so that kids have to learn German and parents have to interact with Swiss parents might help, too.   But it's not really that hard, and not integrating sort of makes being abroad defeat the purpose unless you're just looking for bragging rights with the hillbillies back home, so I don't get why it's considered such an issue.

Now, Bassersdorf wants to have the tram connection extended to their town, using a route thrrough Kloten NOT connecting any points of importance there.

			Normally true that the locals would not benefit much directly.   
And though a mine would create jobs, most of them require experience/expertise in the field, so they mostly would be able to be filled locally and indeed would have to bring in people from somewhere else.   
Sounds like the mine would be relatively small, so probably about 250 new jobs.  They may not be able to be filled locally, however, having that many new people there would probably bring a little burst to the local economy housing, restaurants, stores, services etc.

885	Swiss politicsnews	"""Buchpreis-Bindung"" sent down the drain"	Wollishofener	1,823	28	Glattbrugg	11.03.2012, 15:54	"    Until a certain point I can understand why far away from the publishers and big number distribution channel an item costs more, also much more.   
What we have in CH however is that il Corriere della Sera, L'Espresso, Il Panorama and all of them cost a lot more, having the same or even lower transportation costs. They have the same price in Chiasso as they probably have at Basel, but far more than at Domodossola or Battipaglia.        The list is longer in fact, but not by much (and some have the same owner).   
So in some regions (Ticino e.g.) you don't have the newspapers you once had (s.th. like 3 if you don't count free stuff and the weekly newspaper Il Caffè della Domenica what is the best one imho).   
So offer is restricted.   
Another problem is the Swiss Post Office and letter delivery (extremely slow). That's why I cancelled my Corriere del Ticino-abo this year after decades (besides that I didn't really like it - but what else could I have read?), having the newspaper only in the afternoon (and I have no time to read in the evening) being delivered with my letters.

France as a country only gets around 20% which is not that much I believe.  I agree it is an advantageous for the villages in the Haute-Savoie as contrary to income tax the kickbacks are not going to Paris but to a large part straight to the villages. But even then, the average amount per frontalier paid by Geneva to France works out at only around 1,000 euro I think per frontalier per year.  Not a bad deal at all for Geneva in my opinion. By sending its workforce back to France every evening, Geneva can continue to keep building only half the houses it would have to build otherwise in order to keep up with the demographic growth.    
But Canton Vaud is different to Geneva, I believe you are only taxed in France if you work as a frontalier in Vaud.

			Certainly one should speak the local language to the point of functionality.   
However, integration is another matter altogether.    
I am an expat - or (trailing spouse of a) guest worker if you prefer - but not an immigrant. My stay here is temporary; we came because my husband was asked to do a job. We will not stay beyond that job, however many years that may be. Switzerland is not my home.    
I try to be a good Auslander. I speak German. I'm respectful, I know the laws and obey them. But true integration is a two-way street. If integration is really a goal, not only do Auslanders have to learn to be 'Swiss-like', but the Swiss have to be prepared to actually accept Auslanders as part of their society. And the latter part is very much missing.    
Let's be honest - parallel societies are created because Swiss society is closed to outsiders. You can only bang your head against a closed door for so long before you give up and find another way.

			For me the SVP stands for everything that is wrong. And yet - there are many people out there, who like me abhor what they stand for, but realise that it is important to listen to the people and the concerns they have about recent changes in their communities. The initiative on second-homes and Sommaruga's comments on the effect of 'parallel living' (not much different from ghettos really?), etc- need to be taken on board, by Swiss and non-Swiss. If this does not happen, it will be very likely to fuel their fire.   
You DO NOT need to be racist in any way, shape or form to realise that things are afoot which have negative effects on many people, honest. And if this refusal to see this helps the SVP/UDC then it would be truly tragic.

Intelligent people tend to have fewer children.  Which means stupid people have more children, and thus the prevelence of the stupid phenotype is more prevelent in the world.    
This is why smart people are so bloody annoyed by stupid people and why stupid people can't be rationalized with about anything (see:  SVP).     
Therefore, intelligent people should fight the urge to put off having children while pursuing englightenment and have more babies starting at a younger age.    
But then that won't help the population crisis.... but neither will stupid people breeding more stupid people...

The undeveloped world is (as always) going through a turbulent period, and in such periods wealthy people fear for their wealth. In some of these countries, government ministers are almost guaranteed to be embezzling money. Companies abuse the environment and human rights to make profits. Wealthy people may be prevented from transferring large sums of money outside the country by capital controls. In all of the above situations, it is much easier for people to get their wealth out of the country by using gold, diamonds, etc. than through traceable channels.

			A genevese politician is involved in a mini-scandal relayed (way too much i my opinion) by the media in the romandie. A good case to compare cultural differences based on reactions to an incident involving a politcian.      Mark Muller is the cantonal minister responsible for infrastructure in Geneva. He is from the Liberal/Radical party.     : on the 31st december Mark Muller was having fun in the personnel WC with a waitress of the bar. The barman and also manager asked him what he was doing there (according to the barman he didn't know or recognized Mark Muller). After Muller left the scene, the barman rebuked the waitress. He then went outside to smoke a cigarette. He was then attacked from behind by a man who was beating him and shouting ""you humiliated my friend, I'm gonna kill you"" and a fight followed between Muller and the barman. The barman filed a complain and the incident is under investigation. 
His party the PLR is asking him to resign.   
So what is the most chocking thing? 
 - the ""sex"" in the toilet 
 - the beating/fight 
 - the party asking for resignation   
I find this is taking way too much place in the swiss-romand media and there are far more serious problems for citizens that should catch the attention of both media and politicians. 
This is a typical "" "" displaying a real problem (corruption, amateurism, clientelism,...) of genevese politicians.

And if a prostitute wants out, there are few places for them to go. Women's refuges, by and large, don't want (ex-)prostitutes. This is a problem for them if they're under the threat of violence. While the Netherlands has a pragmatic (and sensible, in my view) approach to prostitution, the authorities are still very concerned about the high levels of criminal activity surrounding even legal prostitution. A friend who was a health worker in Amsterdam has said that the authorities estimate that 1/3 of sex-workers in the city are under some form of duress.      Yes, which is why it's not very high on the agenda of most politicians.

945	Swiss politicsnews	Vote on minimum wage- what would you do?	Odile	9,071	129	Neuchatel	19.11.2011, 21:46	"    So by your logic being on welfare is better than working in a low pay job?    
Minimum wage will push more people on social security because it will price out workers that would normally be worth less than what the minimum wage pays (i.e. too old, disabled and disadvantaged). There is nothing wrong with a person who is disabled asking to be paid less than a person who gets minimum wage. The disabled person is entitled to a job as much as anyone else, provided they have some form of voluntary advantage over an able bodied person. At a minimum wage of 22 francs per hour the disabled person cannot be priced at that amount if an able bodied person is priced at that also. That means that in a 100% of cases that are not charities, the disabled person will never have the opportunity to work for pay. The same goes for people who are too old i.e. 70 years old. A 70 years old might be happy to be paid a small amount just to get out of the house and out of the wife's hair. With a minimum wage he can forget it, no one will hire him at a price they pay anyone else. Because there are more risks and costs associated with hiring someone that is 'too old', the minimum wage will price these people out of the market. The minimum wage is incredibly discriminatory, it prices out everyone who is not worth the minimum wage and thats usually the forgotten members of our society.    
A problem Switzerland often faces is how hard it is for older workers to find work and/or re enter the workforce. Well thats because of the extra costs associated with hiring older workers. Thats the fault of government creating the extra and unnecessary insurance costs, not business. Older workers are priced out of the market, because they are not on an equal playing field as it is being distorted by bureaucrats saying that business should pay more insurance for these workers.     
Therefore if minimum wage prices certain people out of the workforce, than more people drift towards welfare, This in turn then causes more pressure on existing taxes which means more and additional costs on business and workers. Its a terrible cycle that ends where the Eurozone and Western world are right now. If minimum wage were the holy grail that it is made up to be, then Switzerland would not have the highest living standards in the world as well as pay some of the highest salaries.   
If I may ask, what happened to your 'savings for a rainy day'? Savings are what is supposed to supplement social security. I mean you have had the opportunity to work for 45 years!. Or am I missing something?      I would imagine with such a comment that you have never run a business in your life. Many businesses struggle out there and many will fail completely. There is no such thing as a decent wage. Wages should be priced by the market without interference, because thats the only way a price or wage can be calculated. You cannot calculate a wage based on what some person sitting in an office in the capital says. A businesses wage costs isnt just a function of the cost of labour (in a perfect world it would be and we should all wish it was so!) it is also payroll costs, regulatory costs, social security, insurance etc etc. Thats what makes employing people expensive. I promise you, there are many businesses out there that would prefer to pay those inputs to the worker instead of the government, lawyers and insurance companies. Unfortunately those costs have to come out of somebody's pocket and often it is shared one way or another between the customer, employees and business owner.   
You should note that almost all startups lose money in the first few years while they build up to pay for their initially start up costs. So profitabililty initially is irrelevant, as for most it is only a dream.

			Again - shop around for excellent deals in CH. And a reminder- as they DO NOT advertise this, and most foreign families going there do not realise this is available (and UK ski companies keep very quiet about this!) - all the resorts in the 4 Valleys (Verbier, Haute Nendaz, Siviez, Veysonnaz, Thyon, Le Chable, Bruson) have a great offer for families (you need your passport to prove your kids are your kids though) 1 adult pays full price, 2nd adult pays half, and 2 kids pay 1/4 = 4 for the price of 2- which makes a huge difference, on a week or 2 week pass. And it's hard to beat the mileage and quality/variety of skiing in the 4 Valleys. Loads of mileage and variety in the Portes du Soleil too - stay in smaller resorts like Champoussin, or Torgon - loads cheaper and same access to the whole area. etc, etc. 
Have a look at Aldi holidays, amazing deals even for CH.   
You have to be a bit savvie to get good deals. Why stay in a posh hotel in Verbier, when you can rent a flat privately or with Interhome in another of the 4 valley resorts- for half the price and no queues- and still access to the whole ski area? And of course keep away from the London Hoohay Henries- which can be such a pain in the proverbial.

			The real Groundhog-Day-Moment every year is the (deliberate) misunderstanding of the mercer study by those who disagree.   
It does not (and it does not pretend) measure ""quality of life"" (thats why it is called quality of   survey btw.), which is an extremely subjective thing.    
Its helps calculate expat salaries (where expats are people sent abroad for some time by their employer).   
The idea is to adjust salaries based on some objective criteria, such as:   
cost of living 
quality of living 
risk (included in the quality of living here)   
Now, as this is still a very difficult task, proxy measures, such as life-expectancy, prevalence of diseases, murder rates etc. etc. are used.   
So basically, if Joe America, who lives in New Jersey, gets sent to Zurich by his employer Multinational Inc. his salary will propably be adjusted for the higher cost of living. But his chances of getting a raise because he thinks he'll need to hire a bodyguard or fly in competent doctors are very slim.    
That is what this survey is about. Not more, not less.

			Americans have been funny with Halloween lately.  Some neighborhoods observe the holiday on other days of the week, e.g. the Saturday before the actual date, and they trick or treat before sundown.  When I was growing up, it was always that we trick or treated on Halloween, regardless what day of the week it was, and we didn't even leave the house in costume until the sun had set.   
One important aspect of the American custom is that, if a home doesn't have the porch light on, it means that they aren't participating in Halloween and children shan't ring the bell, knock, bang and holler until someone opens the door.   
After several years of living in an apartment and having had my bowl of candy at the ready, and not getting any takers, I gave up.  So when I moved into my house a couple of years ago, I didn't participate, either.  I didn't think there were that many kids in the neighborhood anyway.  And I kept my porch light OFF.   
Regardless, those little buggers still came by, rang the bell, knocked, banged, and hollered.  And when I didn't answer, they only rang more, knocked harder, banged louder, and hollered longer.   So RUDE!!!!     
So... I will be greatful to be living in Switzerland this year, knowing that NOBODY will be knocking on my door this Halloween.

I've had successive pay cuts in the past few years, precisely because of the exchange rates. Is it unfair that I am ""paid less"", for doing the same work? No, it's just part of economic realities.   
""Earn less"" is quite subjective. Many people come to CH from the UK, attracted by the higher salaries. Then discover that their actual liquidity is reduced. In terms of purchasing power, they're  well paid than their UK equivalents. Just on a higher salary.    
Until these changes,  , these employees of Farnair had become significantly better paid than their Swiss colleagues.  I can't see it as ""unfair"" or discriminating against non-Swiss. At best - annoying for those affected.   
Home ownership in France is ~55% overall. Of course homes in France are considerably cheaper than in Switzerland, so my CHF800'000 mortgage example is very much overstating the real effect of French residents with Swiss mortgages. In reality, the effect is smaller.

993	Swiss politicsnews	Swiss - UK tax deal	10pixels	2,862	19	Basel	24.04.2011, 20:19	"    Agreed. The quote from Mr. HMRC could also have said something like: ""no-one would have believed a few years ago that we in the UK and Germany would have acquiesced to the Swiss insistence of getting paid only a share of a Swiss imposed withholding tax, and agreeing not to get the identities of those whom we couldn't prove an illegal tax evasion case against. And for us to recognize legal tax avoidance cases, which are legal under Swiss law, and which the Swiss won't prosecute on our behalf where we don't have sufficient illegal tax evasion prima facie evidence.""   
Little has changed for tax evasion, Switzerland has been co-operating for years on this. It's legal tax avoidance which is the issue. If HMRC can't provide prima facie evidence of Swiss law breaking, why should the Swiss contribute? As an alternative/workaound there's already an EU agreement on sharing withholding tax proceeds with the EU for EU nationals. Switzerland is already sharing these funds with UK and Germany. The new announcements are just the bilateral elements to the EU arrangements already in place. They're probably driven by UK and Germany wanting their cash bilaterally instead of via Brussels, and for Switzerland it gets the UK and Germany to distinguish legal Swiss avoidance with illegal evasion recognized by the UK and Germany in the form of international bilateral agreements.   
However I'm sure Mr. HMRC isn't rushing to send out a ""nothing has changed for legal tax avoiders"" press release.   
By the way, is everyone happy with the way The Local has reported on this? Could someone define ""hidden"" as used in the article. Are we in danger of getting ""Local"" news with a Swedish editing cultural slant.

But why?  In Switzerland many foreigners are ""C"" permit holders, many second generation.  In America if you are born there you are automatically a citizen.   
I checked immigration rates per capita last year and posted them on this site somewhere.  They are almost identical, Switzerland actually edges out the U.S. slightly.  The issue is what happens to foreigners who get in.   
It is easier to become a citizen, faster to get a green card...so the amount of ""foreigners"" by law decreases quite a bit.  Also, my belief is, that more foreigners in the U.S. want to live and stay there, they settle and integrate (in their own way)...Switzerland has more transient foreigners who stay a couple of years and go home or to another job somewhere else.

My first ipression of Luxenbourg was being aware of the number of beggars outside the train station.   even in Switzerland, with it's generally aknowledged high level of salaries/benefits, I am sure I could readily lead any statitician to a lot of people who are struggling with well under the 200,000 ""average"" asets.

Why should foreigners be allowed to dictate to Switzerland what roads should be built? Once people can come into a country and dictate it's outcome (like what's happening in Britain) it's doomed.

			Yesterday while we were out working in our yard, someone from the SP party pulled into our driveway and hung one of their campaign posters on a light post in our yard.    
Yes the light post belongs to the city/canton, but the light post is clearly in our yard on our property making it look like we hung the poster and are endorsing this person.   
Do we have any rights to take it down? If we did after dark and didn't return the sign would it be seen as theft?    
I've looked into the SP party and I'd be more apt to support them over the SVP if I was even able to vote, but as it seems more and more posters are going up it's interesting to know what kind of rights we have if the SVP comes to hang their posters.

No, they have paired their assets from $1tr to about $500Bn. They couldnt do that in 2 years without some one plugging the funding gaps. So the SNB is still on the hook. Last week the SNB started a very large swap line with the US federal reserve ""just in case"" credit suisse or UBS start to fail. So far they have only used $500mn, but it could easliy rise to $100bn if UBS's or CS's capital structure inverts.

1044	Swiss politicsnews	Credit Suisse cuts jobs on poor results	vanjaar	7,234	43	Zurich	28.07.2011, 11:04	"    They are laying off staff because they are not making enough money. The return on equity was 10% this quarter, so even though they made 800m this quarter and that is a huge number to comprehend for us mere mortals, it doesn't cover the cost of capital demanded by the owners.    
Of the 2000 to be laid off I have seen reports that 500 will be in Switzerland. The remainder will I expect be in London and New York in the investment bank. The investment bank posted income of only 200m. I expect that poor performing capital intensive fixed income business lines will be most affected. Without wanting to sound harsh, banking has always been a hiring and firing industry and prone to overshooting on the upswing and downswing of hiring as well as knee-jerk reactions. They pay above Market rates to compensate for having less job security. If you take the devil's silver you have to accept the consequences...   
If you look at the slides presented at the earnings call, there is quite a lot of empthasis on FX neutral results ie if rates hadn't moved.    
In answer to Wollishofen's point about a strong CHF not being an asset for a Swiss bank there are two reasons for this. The majority of the investment bank's revenues and expenses are in USD. Secondly the majority of client assets are not held in CHF - banks typically take a performance fee from clients based on their assets under management. A strong CHF decreases the value of those non-CHF denominated assets and hence decreases revenues.

Personally, I was just plain scared in Baltimore, during my short walks from the Friday evening friendly bar, to where I parked my car. Luckily for me, there were always a couple of young men ( I must have reminded them of their Mum) who would volunteer to walk with me, past the agressively drunk college aged guys on the street ( and screaming obscenities from passing cars and even the chartered buses that looked full of young sports teams on theire way back from somewhere)     
In NY, I was intimidated enough to walk slowly towards the corner to my YH, until I saw another cleancut cut person with a backpack, heading the same way. I would then attach myself, to not look like I was alone. In SanFran, I apparently took the wrong route to the YH by just one block - even during daytime, that was scary.   One the other hand of course, I have met countless folk in and from the USA, who are the nicest, friendliest, politest people one could ever hope to meet.     
The Italains? Oh yes, but they tend to be louder and more openly expressive than people of some other countries anyway.    
Yes, teens here do take part in sport and other activities. In Basel, there seem to be huge numbers that learn to play a musical instrument ( cf: the number in faschnacht bands) and the number of freshfaced young people I see at the train station on weekends, shows that a lot of them organise themselves for skiing in winter, walking in the countrysdie over summer.    
As well as the obvious presence of soccer, I have seen lots of midweek basketball practises going on in various gyms; tennis is played. Then there are all those who turn up to run in Stadtlaufs throughout the country, slowup  bike riders etc., thousands of 'em.  I think that Switzerland is a good place to raise children.

The research said ""measured on the GDP"" and yes, I believe that Switzerland is from that perspective rightfully on top:  
- the mentioned pharmas are huge innovators. 
- Nestle is for example Swiss and has a massive amount of patents on food technology, from Nespresso over baby food to diet solutions.... 
- Biotechnology, some big players in crop science for example... 
- Technology: There are more JOBS in Swiss SME than in the large banks. Those SME have to survive although they have massive costs for labour here compared to the EU and the US, especially right now. You can only do so by picking the right niche market and develop niche products... and you protect those innovations with patents. Not necessarily very visible to most expats here, but this area is HUGE. 
- there are some excellent technical universities which do generate a lot of innovations - directly as well as indirectly.   
Yes, the silicon valley is probably even a better breeding ground for innovations. But if you look at COUNTRIES the silicon valley is put into a huge bucket with anything from the mid-west to the south of the US, not necessarily the most innovative parts of this planet... so what would be interesting to know? How does CH score against California...?

			I attended a talk last year by a chap from a NGO that tried to help people that were being trafficked.    
According to his figures every country in the world has slaves and he gave a figure of approximately 1500 slaves in Switzerland. Most of them were kept as domestic staff by UN workers who had diplomatic immunity.   
He also mentioned that the USA either had passed or was in the process of passing ( I don't remember which ) a law that made diplomatic immunity void if the diplomats were trafficking or keeping slaves on US soil.   
All in all, it was a pretty depressing talk, with one of the most depressing points being that the majority of trafficked peoples had nowhere else to go.

OSueco	1,591	13	Aargau	26.06.2011, 14:53	"    The article is so fundamentally logically flawed that I do not know where to start... ok, lets start with the FDP: The party lost in the past local elections from Zurich to central Switzerland in unparalleled scale - they are on the steepest downward slope ever. They see that the SVP manages to catch the ""less intellectually capable"" part of the society with catchy populist statements. ""Blame the foreigners"" worked extremly well, so did the ""Abzocker-Initiative"". Counting two and two together, they seem to try ""blame those bloody multinational bankers!"" What looks like a smart idea hopefully makes their traditionally not mentally handicapped voters respond...   
Short example from the article:  
""- the multinational companies attract highly educated foreigners because of profit maximisation"" 
Besides the odd grammar - which is equally odd in German - does this statement make zero sense: If you want to optimize profit, you produce in a low cost country, not attract foreigners to Switzerland. Besides: High educated people aren't cheap. That banks hire them because they don't discriminate (a lot) based on nationality but look for specific education.   
The logical message would be: Swiss people, get educated! But that probably does not sell well with Blick readers...

			I wonder if this adherence to ""old traditions"" (which in fact may have been long lost and are as commercial and pushed on people for lot more pragmatic reasons than sentimental value) is for some basically just masked inflexibility. And pride. Change perceived negatively, because for some it means unnecessary adjustment, cash, whatever.    
I was told a few times here that there is no real one national identity, just a   of stuff from before that people try hard to hold onto, since 4 cultures cannot really find a common point. History, language, priorities are different, so people unite worshiping an artificially made concept, what media and tourist and positive image campaigns tell them. Cows, chocolate, watches, etc. I don't mean to make it sound banal, I love living in a place that quite often reminds me my home the way old school things are run. But sometimes I feel like trapped in a biodome, where the rule is to be resistant to change and sing the same loyalty mantra. I recall walking home at tourist areas and looking at the kitch tourist trinkets that were supposed to represent my culture (made in China and Italy), thinking, wow I don't even recognize these symbols. It's just commercialism. But if somebody tried to push Czech outa kindegarten, I am sure people would bitch.   
I think the fact people are scared and defensive and worried about their culture does not necessarily indicate there is a reason to be scared, it may just tell us how they view the negative outside world spreading into theirs, not wanting to ""dilute"" their pure culture with it.

It is the first time a Swiss financial institution has been sanctioned under money laundering laws which require financial services to investigate the origins of suspicious money transfers. 
The case dates back to February 2005 and a cash transfer of SFr4.6 million made to a PostFinance account held in the name of a director of a Dutch investment company.     Although PostFinance had verified that the account was not blocked, it did not conduct sufficient checks on the origins of the money, the Administrative Court of canton Solothurn ruled.        /

			Personal experience is highly subjective, and I dont think it serves to compare with any degree of accuracy if entry barriers are higher or lower. Better to compare the immigration laws itself and choose a group of people with a common characteristic. I have some knowledge of the work permit rules concerning people who have graduate degrees from an university in the same country, and hence I made my comparison on that basis. On this basis, Switzerland has higher barriers for non EU people as compared to the US, and also Germany, a neighboring country with some similarities.      The rule you quote about green cards for a particular national origin being limited to seven percent of the total applies equally to all countries, so it does not equate to the US having different rules for different countries. Hypothetically, if Switzerland were to suddenly send a large number of immigrants to the US, then the seven percent rule would apply to the Swiss as well. And if the green card application cannot be processed due to the quota limitation, it is placed in queue, and does not result in being asked to leave the country immediately.  
In Switzerland, its basically open house for some, and almost impossible for others. Even if total immigration from the Phillipines to Switzerland came to a total halt this year, in 2012 Phillipinos would find it equally hard to get a permit.

1151	Swiss politicsnews	POKER Banned By The Federal Court In Switzerland	The_Love_Doctor	5,115	73	Zugerberg, Zug	03.06.2010, 10:40	"    No and no (erm and no). If you play a turbo tournament like that then luck becomes a bigger factor as good players have less chance to use their skill. Take it to it's extreme. If you all get dealt 1 card and everyone is All-In on that hand there is no skill involved. Depending on the structure playing ""carefully"" can be the worst of all possible tactics.   
If you wear sunglasses and a hat whilst sitting down with less than CHF2k you are just more likely to get laughed at than win. If other players were good enough to get a tell from your eyes then they will be playing at higher stakes..Hat and sunnies, (unless you are purposefully taking the p1ss and being funny which is good), just shows a lack of understanding of the game dynamics.....     I consistantly beat No limit Hold 'Em casino games which are typically at a €2/€4 or €5/€10 blind level.  A lot of the players from my home game poker round in München were full time professionals (JanH appeared on Stefan Raab as a guest profi, JoramV &amp; on German High Rollers, GeorgD on the German High Stakes show). These guys are used to sitting down with upwards of 30k at a time. They are more skilled than me and very hard to beat (but playing with them improved my game beyond recognition).    Fact is, the cards are a small but essential part of the game. Much more important is correct strategy for the game of choice with the given format, with respect to given stack sizes and odds be they pot, implied, or reverse-implied.    You cannot stop getting dealt KK when the other guy gets AA and you then lose a stack. That is the luck element. Neither can you prevent being dealt AA shipping a stack, watching a guy make an awful call with 33 and watch him river a straight. What you can do (which is absolutely nothing to do with luck) is use exploitive play to play the most appropriate (profitable) way vs a given opponent with a given stack size,...etc. So much of the game is about pot manipulation (in a legal way, through making appropriately sized bets) combined with an understanding of playing vs peoples ""ranges"". This is what we refer to as putting someone on a hand. (Never try and put someone on one EXACT HAND.) You should attempt to define the range of hands other players play in given circumstances, narrow that range and base decisions on the weighted average of outcomes vs that range.     Example I sit with CHF1000 with blinds of CHF1 / CHF2 and another guy (unrealistically) raises ALL IN so I have to call CHF1000 to continue. if I absolutley ""know"" this guy will only ever do that with AA or KK then if I lookl down and see QQ it is an easy fold as I am way behind vs the entire range of hands he can play like this. However if I ""know"" this guy will do that with all of the possible 169 possible non-equivalent starting hands then I am well ahead vs 164 of them, roughly fifty-fifty vs 2 of them (AK off and AK suited) and a huge underdog vs 2 of them (AA &amp; KK) so it's snap-call-fist-pump-time. The ""knowing"" is the bit where we rely on betting patterns, tells, and shock-unpolitically correct-horror (lacking better information) stereotyping based on age, sex, race, attire and attitude. There is a poker book called ""Let there be range"" that was being sold for $1,850 (yes it is great and no it is not worth that much) it states when playing online check where someone is from and then      If it's somewhere in Scandinavia or Russia, always click call if it's a close decision between folding and calling.        All these tools and many, many others help you make the correct decisions time and time again. The better you do this, the better player you can be.       Everyone will get dealt the same cards (by which I mean a fair and random distribution of hands from the 1326 possible combinations available), everyone will see the same flop, turn, and river. What you do from then depends on how well you play. The best in the world can 3-bet bluff with air (lousy cards) one hand and routinely fold QQ the next-IF it is the best poker decision.       Poker is absolutely a game of skill, which by setting certain conditions you can change to make a game of luck and skill. Do this by increasing the blinds relative to the stacks as in a tournement. It's like making Brazil play an amateur team at footy (soccer) where everyone is blindfolded. Of course Brazil are still the better team, but you have certainly improved the amateurs chances. I saw the irony in the law as it was that good players recognise cash games (you play for real money-when you bet CHF100 it is really CHF100-and you get up and leave when you want) involve less luck (variance) that tournaments, but tournaments were permitted outside casinos and cash games were not.     All this talk of poker whets the appetite. Anyone want to sit down and we can all try and get lucky sometime soon?  "	2849	 Aug 2009	6.0	['69', '53']	['3', '132', '1', '495']	6

Some of the more immigrant friendly parties are saying immigration is a good thing and there is no problem really if the population rises as a result. The SVP are saying, not so. If you are a tree hugger and angry about some trees being cut down to widen the road, or about that pretty meadow being turned into a housing estate, then maybe you should be asking why these things are necessary. In other words, this is intended as a kick in the teeth for the Green Party who are traditionally both pro-immigration while anti lots of other things that the SVP are now claiming are connected.

			I've no idea whether this proposal is true or not, but (as a non-speaker of German resident in BL), I'm supportive of the idea.   
I find it pretty difficult to navigate my way through the bureaucratic quagmire of Basel Landschaft government, taxation, permits, utilities, etc, without at least basic German, and harder still to integrate myself into the local social scene if I expect everybody else to switch to English whenever I'm around.   
For those of us from English-speaking countries with large immigrant populations, how many residents of your homeland did you meet who couldn't speak enough English to make themselves understood? In decades of living in Australia, I can recall maybe two such people, and both were very elderly (and seemed a little peeved at being there -- clearly it was purely because their children had decided it would be better for them to be there than in Vietnam). Sure, English is the   and there's no real need for English-speaking residents of English-speaking countries to speak any other language, since most of the rest of the world learns at least some English at school -- but why should we  non-English-speakers to speak English in their own countries?

Anybody care to take a guess which is right?

But back to the topic, the height above sea-level in aviation, and particularily in aircraft  
accident is a top important factor.

To the contrary BASE jumpers have (or have no excuse for not having) a good knowledge of aerology and aerodynamics yet deliberately choose to put themselves in a position where they know in advance there is no splat-mitigation factor and no recourse, no matter how much research you do. Much like cigarettes, it's not a matter of ""if"" - it's a matter of ""when"" - without the righteous parallel of ""oh we're pushing the limits to discover something new"".

It’s a woman with a suitcase, and she seems a little confused. She says she’s looking for a Mrs So-and-so, but decides to linger when she finds that the children and their teacher can speak English. 
She introduces herself as Aunt Annie, an American who is visiting Switzerland. The children’s shyness slowly turns into excitement at the novelty of having an unexpected visitor in the classroom. 
“Ooohh!” they exclaim when Aunt Annie opens her suitcase to reveal a menagerie of stuffed animals. It’s time for a game. The cheerful woman has the children sit in a circle and asks one to close his eyes.    Immersion learning 
In fact there are eight “Aunt Annies” circulating around German-speaking Switzerland; four are American, two are Canadian and two are British. All are native English speakers who have experienced the challenges of learning a second language. 
Typically, the first visit takes place in the third grade. Aunt Annie drops in three times per year for up to four years, so there is plenty of time to develop a relationship.

			I have several friends who work full-time but earn below the official poverty line of CHF 2,400 for a single person.  
Given they pay tax and National Insurance of over 16% on their low income - and health insurance of CHF 300 a month (about 12.5% of income) - and high Zurich prices, they find it very difficult to save more than 100 francs a month.   
Seeing the cars on Bahnhofstrasse I can understand that people say ""poverty? what poverty?"" 
But the people on the bottom have a very small piece of a not-particularly-large pie.    
Wealth inequality is the highest in western world - the top 10% of the population hold 71.3% of the wealth (higher than even the United States; for comparison the top 10% of UK people hold only 56% of the country's wealth). That means the other 90% of the population hold less than 30% of the wealth ""pie"".      
Also consider that the Swiss wealth pie (per capita income adjusted for prices) is smaller than in many other places in Europe, and the one in 11 in poverty number even seems a bit low.

If a child does not have parents for whatever reason then they deserve a chance, and if adoption is against nature then nature is wrong. A child needs a loving caring family to bring it up and give it a decent environment and not be left to tough it out in an institution.   
So why did you single out adoption by a loving, stable, same sex couple?    
I wonder what it will be like with this old couple doing the three legged race at the school sports day. I wonder if they will be able to help the child with their maths homework. I wonder if they will be able to still drive and go and get their child from after school club when the kid is 12.

          The foreign ministry on Friday said Switzerland would have to adapt  several of its laws to meet the treatys requirements, but it already  satisfied the central point of the convention: zero tolerance towards  cases of enforced disappearance.     
It was drawn up in 2006 and will enter into force before the end of December.           
What is the Convention all about ? Read it  .     
Wiki link is      
An enforced disappearance takes place when a person is arrested,  detained or abducted by the state or agents acting for the state, who  then deny that the person is being held or conceal their whereabouts,  placing them outside the protection of the law.   
Very often, people who have disappeared are never released and their  fate remains unknown. Their families and friends may never find out what  has happened to them.   
But the person has not just vanished.  Someone, somewhere, knows what  has happened to them.  Someone is responsible.  Enforced disappearance  is a crime under international law but all too often the perpetrators  are never bought to justice.      "	8153	 Jul 2007	6.0	['29', '22']	['7', '036', '3', '912']	6

NotAllThere - I have the greatest respect for the Hospices and palliative care. They do a fantastic job and have helped many friends in the past. 
But it is a choice imho, and not one I would make personally, for all sorts of reasons. If you are a Christian, I realise you look at things very differently. I have no religious beliefs, and do not believe in after life (apart from the tiny bits of 'influence', good or bad, which leave (perhaps) a mark on close ones or even strangers by ones behaviour/attitude). I so hope I'll never have to make that ultimate decision, and that when the time comes, as it must for us all - I'll pop my clogs quickly or peacefully in my sleep - but I'm glad EXIT offers me that amazing Insurance policy.   
Worst scenario is of course Alzheimers or Dementia, as in this case they would not be able to help as the Law stands. Which is a serious flaw I believe- that really needs to be addressed. (did you see the Dimbleby Lecture and Terry Pratchett's moving plea).

			A little explanation.    
Peter Coneway went to the right university and was a rich man working at the top in Goldman Sachs when young president George Bush sent him to Bern, maybe Peter helped George out with his election, but Peter Coneway was happy as even ex ambassadors are treated like royalty.    
So Peter Coneway is a fairly right wing thinking, clever man who had to convince the Swiss government, that is the incompetant defence minister Bundesrat Samuel Schmidt, that the US was doing the right thing in Iraq. The Bundesrat was also dominated by the stubborn Christoph Blocher.    
A summary of political life in Berne at the time from a respected Swiss political magazine.          
(General Neff was appointed head of the army by Samuel Schmidt despite having a criminal record of violence against his ex wife)   
 Presumably the Swiss Government, falling over themselves to exagerate their democracy, failed to impress the US ambassador with their incompetance!    
Google translation follows:          VBS Chief Samuel Schmid with his excuse once before with success guaranteed: the fault of all others, especially the former SVP of Federal Councillor Christoph Blocher.   
Samuel Schmid displays three distinguishing characteristics, since he politicized in Bern and the surrounding area: a strong ambition of a mediocre talent and a weak character. The unbridled enthusiasm in their own right has driven him from cushy positions to cushy positions up to the Federal Council. His mediocrity prevented the overtaxed to accomplish in all of his positions, each a work of importance. And the human shortcomings meant that his career is a creeper for a long, intricate and heaviest of all visible back stairs. Such maneuvers have led him to the permanent crisis that is wreaking havoc in the current affair of army chief Roland Nef. The same quibbles, however, save him again.   
During the year 2007, Samuel Schmid, the important post of chief of the Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports (VBS) and defense minister arrived, the fill almost as central post of Chief of the Army (CdA) too new. The old general, the bulbous warhorse Christophe Keck, he had always felt inferior. It had been spotted in Bern justifiably, the maker and military, the Department and its chief led helpless - and never vice versa. Schmid therefore needed to be able to feel again as a man on the bridge, a weak senior officer. The first and most members of the VBS, the Major General Ulrich Zwygart and Jacob Bowman, from the top or head of the army, as Major General Hans-Ulrich Sole had, so for trivial conversation to terse rejection note.   
Nef's father called them ""are lit-Toni""   
Schmid conjured the lower ranked Brigadier Roland Nef, a then 48-year-old eastern Switzerland with school boys face, from the officers' hats. Even experts who had tried with insider knowledge in the name-dropping amazed. Nef, whose father already was a professional military and rather controversial instructor at the military base Frauenfeld (""de are lit-Toni"") was regarded as a pedantic nerd and apparatchik without ideas and without any real military service ID card: the perfect little number that their patrons Schmid daily for the had rapid ascent to thank and obey.   
That out of character does not seem too well-established Nef during the election process been prosecuted because of coercion, must make Schmid's decision, the Nobody of his main collaborators, have further strengthened. Nef had a partner who wanted to come off after four months of community in an apartment on the prestigious Zurich mountain from his clutches, persecuted and harassed for weeks. Schmid was aware of this embarrassing and criminal acts, as he made to his preliminary candidates, but the affair was kept under the lid. The Federal Council, the application of the election only shortly before the decisive eighth session June 2007, was not aware and informed him crowned the unknown Nef without discussion.   
The illogic of the Schmid-NZZ   
The secret past life unworthy of the alleged Sauber's was Schmid's second power means to Nef. And if the appointment as CdA and (rumored as well) a cough from the VBS for the suspension of the criminal proceedings have been decisive, then the General would have depended entirely on his boss. - If not the Sunday paper, out of disgust from the environment of the applicant on the track that Nef misconduct and perfidy Schmid would be made public.   
The convicted minister has a tongue, be sent forward with changing messages with fragments of information any Adlaten for media work. The council itself does not, has crept up and alone for his dear Hoforgan, Neue Zürcher Zeitung to speak.   
The NZZ has formally legally and politically, has approved its defense. This reads like this: Strictly speaking, it is not legally have been absolutely essential to inform the Federal Council about the background of the candidate into the picture. If it would have been politically desirable but, then, writes the NZZ-Schmid, Schmid not to blame for the sins of omission Schmid, but ""the climate of mistrust in the then Federal Council."" Because ""respect and trust"" in the national government ""in June 2007 was not available"" were, the Schmid-NZZ lectures on, Schmid had his colleagues can not even explain. So ist only pursuant to the Schmid-NZZ, who does informierte nicht verantwortlich Bundesrat for the victims choice and the affair, from he knew nothing.   
This lack of logic works politically, because ""in June 2007"" still sitting in the Bundesrat Christoph Blocher, which always stands as an argument. And shyster Schmid, who has neither a board of directors of bankrupt Haller AG nor accepted as president of the ailing Zealand Bank AG nor as a politician ever is responsible, in office next flit to accomplish nothing and blame everyone else.

			It's an interesting situation, freedom (or, someone's concept of it) as opposed to med ethics. I can only think of what would happen back home, the guy would be left to enjoy his freedom until he passes out and is unconscious, the minute he would be unconscious docs would truck him into ER and fix him, while providing a psy help. I think it is much easier to kill oneself doing something else than hunger strike, since the society and its medical world will always try to keep you alive. I, personally, think there are better ways how to communicate a message, it seems that dude just does not want to bear responsibility for his actions, but I don't know enough about it.

It does some things, doesn't do others. In my view, it does little on the curriculum and not enough on the streaming decisions. Schooling age, start of school, repetition, etc. are relatively well harmonised.   
This link gives the official HarmoS website info    
Wikipedia also gives an overview of HarmoS.         However, at least in Vaud, the starting age of 4 by 31 July will be implmented in 2011, with mandatory attendance at age 4. I guess there are varying implementation phase-ins by Canton.      This thread will enlighten you a bit on this issue        This thread may help understand this.     
Not only are there significant differences between Cantons, but there are indeed significant differences at the very local level between Communes. In my view, HarmoS is a first step, but will do very little to change the status quo. Unfortuantely, your school record travels with you, so once streamed into a level, there is very little to be done to change this in my view.

B)  Switzerland has not been built on banking and insurance, banking and insurance were instrumental however to the general progress, and on the other hand profited of the economy 
C)  single entrepreneurs are a thing of the past, not just in Switzerland. Companies are lead by high-up employees, but no longer by family tycoons      - 
ETH is the Technical University (the other one in Switzerland is the Polytéchnique in Lausanne) of Zurich, and so, ETH graduates are NOT the ones for banking.  Somebody can study economics or mathematics either at the University or at the Handelshochschule St. Gallen, and thereby becoming a potential banker        - 
Lots of innovation did and does take place in the economy, but entrepreneurs very often are NOT to hire services of people like you, as not having too much money. A lot of practical innovation takes place in a far more modest environment.

And, finally, to say it clearly, people here in Switzerland distrust people who want to sell ""innovative strategies"" but rather trust individuals who are innovative in a daily way

However: Rating the dimension to the overall scoreboard makes no sense to me: It is highly personal how important a certain factor is for your. I give an example:  
- We are ""DINKs"" and could therefore not care less about the education system of the country we live in the next years. 
- Some people really do not want to live in the dark, so Finland and Sweden might not be the right choice for them.  
- Some do not care about the political environment or value the fast business environment higher - so Singapore would score higher for them...

			The last schools I've taught at have been British or International English Schools , where most kids where not English speakers. Yet most of them scored much higher grades at their GCSES that many English kids back in the UK..and this is not a selective school.. so per my experience as a teacher, the language barrier is not always the issue.   
Reading this thread , I have the feeling that the Swiss system is not taking into acount that most of the kids here are bi or trilingual in their pedagogy. This is kind of wierd when we know that the country itself has 3 national languages. I have always seen the fact that my kids will grow bi and trilingual as a huge advantage and chance. This is one of the reasons we moved here. But now I understand why a swiss friend of mine is worried about her kid being brought bilingual..Most of her Swiss family and friends have told her that his son will suffer from this and should only speak one language. It's really sad.   
Talking about Uni, I am preparing mentally to the possibility that my kids will have more chance to do a professionnal training as a hairdresser or secretary than going to University.. Which is fine as they will probably have more chance to get a job in the end..

			Agree with you about the ""too little, too late""... but I think many of the problems are hard to solve and would still be around without this place. Then again stories like fire fighters or ambulance needing police protection and violent protesters being able to retreat there can not be in the interest of the Reitschule. Although these things have not happened for a while now, they leave a lasting bad taste. I also take issue with some people in the Antifa movement who do not want any dissent (explains the marx-lenin-stalin banner though) and talk like they alone own the place.   
On the other hand I would not worry too much about graffiti and appearance, tourists being able to see it when arriving by train or tour bus, there are enough clean and tidy places in this country.   
I posted this because some people have told me they will probably not be going to vote themselves as it will be rejected anyway... every vote counts.   
And then shortly after the voting, we can all celebrate victory at the Abendspaziergang...  "	249	 Apr 2010	3.0	['1', '1']	['189', '108']	5

I might follow the news a bit more than the average voter and yes, I am more critical about the whole thing than most... but whoever believed that it takes a hundred of highly trained ""Kommando Spezialkräfte"" to rebuild schools and Kindergardens is more than a bit naive. These commandos fight for the ""operation enduring freedom"" under US lead and have nothing to do with the ISAF ""Kindergarden rebuilding"" stuff - this naturally required two completely different votes in parliament. Each was reported in extensive length and discussed in the media. So: 
- I completely disagree with the OEF in general and the German involvement in particular. 
- The parliament discussed the issues openly and transparently, if voters frankly do not give a thing, it is not the politics responsibility to force feed them. 
- A mercenary is still something very different from a regular soldier - even from a Rambo type as the KSK.

			Hi OP   
Is there some German Swiss angle to the whole discussion?    
You said in the original post that frankfurt is 30% cheaper and then after 2 posts you said 100% more expensive and only 50% more. So the 30% has gone up to 100% in 2 posts.   
The point is Switzerland probably pays 20%-50% more than parts of Europe. Taxes are much lower so one lands up with about 50% extra cash. So on 90K take home you are possibily getting only 60-70K CHF take home in other country. Now do the whole math but on general cost of living you can't spend more than 2K a month extra. Having said that I think all these numbers are just to make up the case.    
I agree that food is bit expensive but the quality is great. Go back to other country in standard restaurant and order a simple Pasta and you will realize that. Eating good qulity food in my opinion costs same now a days. Beyond the normal place, the costs for good places is same all around. I think Zurich^s normal places are like good places in other countries.   
Just my personal opinion.

Russia, China, India etc have little because there has always been little credit available.   
The UK has huge Household Debt becuase they have a high percentage of home owners and banks were offering 125% mortgages/loans on the value of property up to 2007 and since then 10% plus has been wiped off the value of their property.   
The figures therefore stack up to me to that point.   
However, I didn't think homeownership was big in Switzerland (only Ticino) but understand that very few actually pay off the mortage/loan because it is not tax efficient.  I gather that the government will be changing the rules in the future.

			I thought some of his statements made sense; i.e.   
Invest in shares in Asian companies as opposed to Western companies.   
The demand for oil will go up because China now buys more cars than the USA. The cost of extraction of oil will be more as there is less and therefore more costs involved.   
Saying that. I believe that Russia has abundant supplies of oil.  I do not understand the reason Dr Doom doesn't suggest investing in Russia.   
I still haven't worked out why USA/UK and allies are fudging around in Afganistan but do suspect that it is a route for oil supplies.  I also understand that Afganistan and Pakistan are rich in minerals and possibly oil.  The Yanks are hardly likely to be in Afganistan because of democracy, preventing terrorism in the USA/UK and to stop poppy growing & heroin production.   
By the way, I was listening to an item on the radio this morning that was stating that the Ukraine is now growing poppies (herroin) for medical purposes.  As expected a lot is finding its way into Russia.

The Nazi regime was a first in many ways. If the other countries could have foreseen what Hitler was capable of, they would have surely behaved differently.

True forced is no the wrong word, although theres talk of forcing them again unless they have a good excuse.    
Still the point remains. The government highly recommends and really wants to teach every man how to use a gun, wants to get them used to using it in real life, wants them to practice with it once a year so that they stay accurate and wants them to keep the gun under their beds for just in case?   
Which offers the bigger threat? the government giving out free guns to it's adults and teaching them how to use it or adults pressing a button on a controller to shoot a virtual enemy?   
The armys guns is the most used weapon in family killings and I believe suicide as well. The biggest violent gun crimes have been done with army weapons.   
The guy going home for the weekend from the army who though it would be a laugh to shoot a teenage girl and the husband who shot dead his famous former skier wife and kids spring to mind.   
They've been unable topass a law to make sure all weapons and and ammo stays in the barracks but they're able to create a law which bans certain games? The mind boggles!   
I also wonder how much they've know about the games. GTA IV is one of those that they want banned. At the end of the game the main character either loses the girl of his dreams or his cousin and best friend to violance. How this is glorifiying killings I'm not sure.   
Then the obvious question is if they ban games what about films. Almost every horror film every made should be banned. Hostel and Saw are more violent then any game every made.   
Then what about violent music and literature.   
Plus I wonder how many people are influenced by footage of Hitler on history programms or by video broadcasts of terrorists leaders which are broadcast on every news programm and written in every newspaper.   
My god why don't we just ban all media and censor the internet just to be sure. I mean Noth Korea seems to be pretty peaceful......   
Oh and another major contribution to violance and death is alcohol. How many wifes get beat by drunk husbands, many fights and stabbings occour on the weekends by drunk people, how many people kill themselves while drunk?    
Now personally it's not going to affect me any way. Most of my games I get sent over from the UK to the german border and pick them up there so I'll still be playing the games I want, and not those that I'm allowed to but still it's absurd.    
I wouldn't want to be Swiss either should the law be put through.   
Their top 3 biggest news items globally over the past few year would be the Swiss fight tooth and nail to keep foreign citizens dirty money, 
the Swiss show religious intolerance by banning minaretts and now the Swiss censor which media it's citizens are allowed to use. Well done

			Tap water should definitely be free. If I were really thirsty, having rushed to the restaurant or something, I would appreciate free water - but would always order something else to drink as well. I like spring water - if I wanted to drink water all night, I would be more likely to order sparkling water anyway. Some food is very salty - and also very sweet food - and you need water. It's just rude to charge for tap water.

The Mindestumwandlungssatz is the minimum rate at which your accumulated BVG capital is converted to your yearly pension.   
E.g. if the capital is CHF 600,000 and the conversion rate is 6.8% you'll receive 40,800/year or 3,400 a month. With the lowered rate of 6.4% you'll end up with only 38,400/year or 3,200/month.   
It's important to know that the minimum rate is already being  lowered from 7.2% down to 6.8% until the year 2014 to account for longer expectancy of life. There's currently no need to lower it further and certainly not by 0.4%. It would basically be a gift to the insurance industry.

			I am probably stating the obvious, but I think that it is a matter of education and I don't mean academic. You have to live with people from many different cultures to understand them and to understand that you can't stereotype a race of people.    
However, I think that laws help, not just the courts, but the regulations and working conditions in companies. I live in an American enclave ( north of the mason Dixon) of PhD's from all over the world, not that they are rich, but the companies have very strict protocoll on ageism, sexism, racism. It provides a much more harmonious atmosphere. When I first came it was a bit of a culture shock even for me, a staunch anti-racist. In hindsight, I realize how much racism we were putting up with, in the places I lived before, it is such a relief not to have to deal with it any more that depite being offered more money we are staying put.

Well, did you ever wonder why the oldest houses in Basel are only from the late fourteenth century? A point of pride of the oldest Basel aristocracy, the ""Deeg"" (sp?), is that their ancestors felt the earthquake.    
There is an estimated ""return period"" of about 500 years for an earthquake of the 1356 magnitude under Basel. That puts the big one a few years late - in other words, it could happen at any minute now.

			I think that is a very personal decision and as Oldhand said it depends on the risk factors you have (breast, endometrial cancer in the family to name a few). Hormone replacement is useful and good, when given at the correct patients. I suggest to talk to you doctor and listen to him explain, the bottomline is: it is your decision.

How can you compare Constanz (pop. 80,000) to Zurich? How about comparing room rates in New York City and Hoboken NJ? 
Your advice is also to drive 350 extra kilometers to bypass Switzerland? As a protest of some sort?  
It is also a bit unfair to enjoy excellent salaries in Switzerland and bitch about high prices. You can't get it both ways. 
How about shopping locally to benefit the local farmers and small businesses to show your appreciation for the community that allowed you to get that highly paid position in the first place.

			I believe the SVP only got lucky this time around.  It was a fluke.  They simple managed to capture just enough switch voters to win.  I suspect the switch voters were mainly feminists, and religious conservatives.  In other words, I do not believe the majority of Swiss people thinks as the SVP thinks.  In fact, what this vote demonstrates is that Swiss voters tend to vote according to their own personal belief instead of voting according to their party lines.   
I wouldn't give the SVP a lot of credit for getting this ban, but I would put the blame mostly on them for getting it on the ballot in the first place.

Well, here (in German) the Tages Anzeiger article :     
Der Hasenstrick lockt an sonnigen Tagen Scharen von Ausflüglern an. Die Aussicht auf dieser 760 Meter über Meer gelegenen Südterrasse am Bachtel ist einmalig, das Hotel-Restaurant lädt zum Verweilen ein. Und da ist seit 1947 auch ein Flugplatz. Sehnsüchtig schauten Generationen von Kindern zu, wie Kleinflugzeuge von der 370 Meter langen Graspiste abhoben. Und ihre Eltern überlegten sich, ob sie einen Rundflug übers Oberland oder gar bis zum Matterhorn buchen sollten.      
Damit ist nun Schluss. Auf dem Hasenstrick wird vorläufig nicht mehr geflogen. Die Fluggruppe Hasenstrick (FGH) zieht mit ihren vier vierplätzigen Moranes weg. Dies hat der Vorstand am Montagabend beschlossen.      
«Das Kapitel Hasi ist abgeschlossen», sagt FGH-Präsident Peter Nussbaumer. «Wir müssen weg.» 
Der Abflug steht am Ende eines langjährigen Streits zwischen der Fluggruppe und Peter Kellenberger. Der Rheintaler Architekt präsidiert seit sieben Jahren die Hasenstrick LiegenschaftenAG, die 2002 das ehemalige Kurhaus samt Flugfeld Ernst Büchli abgekauft hatte. Von Büchli übernahm er auch den Pachtvertrag für den Flugplatz mit der Fluggruppe. Der Vertrag läuft Ende 2009 aus.      
«Wir warten seit fünf Jahren auf einen Vertragsentwurf», sagt FGH-Präsident Nussbaumer. Stattdessen habe Kellenberger «unmögliche» Bedingungen gestellt. Er wolle etwa, dass die FGH ihm die Betriebsbewilligung abtrete. Und er verlange zu viel Pachtzins. Die FGH zahlte 35'000 Franken jährlich, Kellenberger forderte 38'000. Kellenberger kontert, die FGH habe «eine konstruktive Zusammenarbeit konsequent verweigert» und stattdessen «die Vermieterin verunglimpft».   
Am 5. Dezember wollen die Flieger das Flugfeld räumen. Das Inventar, wozu eine Barrieren-, eine Funk- und eine Windmessanlage, Hangareinrichtungen und ein Flugzeuglift gehören, soll für den Transport in eine Lagerhalle in Uznach bereitgemacht werden. Die Fluggruppe werde auch 2010 Rundflüge anbieten, versichert Nussbaumer. Ab welchem Flugplatz, müsse aber erst abgeklärt werden.      
Möglicherweise könne sie den Rundflugbetrieb auf dem Flugplatz SitterdorfTG übernehmen.      
Für den FGH-Präsidenten ist aber auch klar: «Wir wollen so bald wie möglich auf den Hasenstrick zurückkehren.» Dies sei allenfalls bei einem neuerlichen Besitzerwechsel denkbar oder wenn Kellenberger einlenke. 
Allerdings: Wo ein Flugfeld frei wird, sind Interessenten nicht weit.      
Ziehe die FGH tatsächlich weg, werde er sich aber «nach neuen Lösungen umsehen». Das ist nicht einfach. Die Betriebsbewilligung für den Flugplatz lautet auf die Fluggruppe. Ein neuer Betreiber müsste das Bewilligungsverfahren beim Bundesamt für Zivilluftfahrt (Bazl) durchlaufen und laut Bazl-Sprecher Anton Kohler «belegen, dass er den Platz ordnungsgemäss betreiben kann».

Switzerland won its first world championship when it lifted the U-17 World Cup with dazzling performances whose victims included Mexico, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Colombia and host Nigeria.    
Columnist Rob Hughes explains that the success came thanks to players from Switzerland's immigrant community.    
""They are the sons of immigrants, in some cases asylum seekers, who today make up one-fifth of Switzerland's 7.7 million population"".   
 More than half of the team's players have dual nationality, which has caused concern in Switzerland that they could change allegiance and play for the nations of the heritage (which is allowed under FIFA's national team eligibility rules).      , who scored the gamewinner in the final, is the son of Tunisians.    
Playmaker  's heritage is Bosnian.    
The others are   (Portugal),  (Chile),   (Ghana),  (Congo),   (Serbia),  (Kosovo),   (Croatia),   (Bosnia),   (Macedonia) and   (Albania).     , coach of Switzerland's full national team, said he would ""target those players for a chat"" -- with the aim to convince them to continue wearing the Swiss jersey.

Here is an example of a Verwaltungsrat that I chose randomly (CSS), I bet they are all pretty much similar and surely a few that are heavily FDP controlled.   
-Pierre Boillat (CVP) 
-Lucrezia Meier-Schatz (CVP) 
-Jean-Marc Probst (FDP) 
-Konrad Graber (CVP) 
-Nicola Thibaudeau (CVP) 
-Jodok Wyer (CSP) 
-Urs E. Zurfluh (Don't know) 
-Joseph Vanderweckene (Belgian)   
Although Couchepin is FDP, the CVP and the CSP are ideologically very close to his party (= Center-Right) and knowing that Couchepin comes from Valais/Wallis I would be very surprised if he didn't have strong links with the CVP as well.      That is bullshit and you know it, if the swiss don't mind paying a fortune for their health insurance. How comes there were hardly any premium rises in 2006, the year the vote was held? That was simply organised manipulation.

We live in a civilised society and abide by the law of the land. Dignitas has been deemed legal, so if there is a need for people to choose to die and a legal right to do so, then it is reasonable to provide the equipment and people trained and skilled to facilitate it in a safe and responsible way.    
Surely it has to be more cost effective to the state to have a correct procedure than for the police to find a dead body, which requires a greater investigation.

We would not have an Irish Republic had there not been an uprising. We would not have a Good Friday agreement had the IRA not dropped violence (and they had to be violent in the first place to be able to stop being it). We wouldn't be talking about a Palestinian state or official Israeli recognition of Palestinian interests had there not been a prolonged campaign of PLO terrorism. The German RAF managed to change official attitudes towards the rights of protestors and those chosing alternative lifestyles. But of course we all lke to insist that these people achieved nothing through violence.

I have not heard of such a campaign publicized in other countries. It would not surprise me if the Swiss at the forefront on bringing this to the attention of the general public.   
After watching a couple of documentaries, it is something that I feel strongly about; as it can have devastating consequences for its victims.   
I also think that it touches on a deeper issue, that children or teenagers should not have to decide on their sexuality until they are adult. 
My experience is that many teenagers have conflictual feelings, the feelings are necessary to the maturing process. Others may feel insecure befriending someone whose sexual orientation is unclear. So a decision, albeit the wrong one, may be forced upon them.

			Technically not all of the UK has banned handguns...it's still legal to own a certificated firearm in Northern Ireland, for example.   
It is true that gun controls in England were increased in the wake of both the Hungerford and Dunblane massacres, but gun control in general in England has been steadily increasing since 1903.   
That said competitive shooting does still take place in the UK under military / police supervision - I personally have fired all kinds of different rifles, plus Glocks and (once only) an M16 on various land ranges in the UK, and was ticketed to conduct range firing from 25m up to 600m, on calibres from .22 to 5.56 - so if anyone really did want to get involved in competitive shooting, the option is there to do so in the UK (the more notable UK ranges that I know of being Bisley and Strensall)   
As far as I'm aware the 2012 Olympic Commitee had to request special permission for any competitive shooting to take place in the 2012 Olympics (which was of course granted), but the UK team receive absolutely no grants or government funding, as they are considered to be breaking the law by practising their sport...   
2nd edit - in addition, a Home Office report in 2007 indicated that only 1 in 250 crimes in the UK involved a firearm -   - if you excliude air rifles and air pistols (which are still legal and not controlled) it drops further to 1 in 500.  Hardly prevalent I would say, particularly compared with the rate of violent / gang related / knife crime, all of which would I'm sure return far more worrying statistics.

As I understand, Homeopathy is an approach to medicine that aims to stimulate the body's built-in immune response rather than alleviating symptoms.  This is a different approach to most modern medicine, which tries to deal with the condition by manipulating body chemistry to eradicate the symptom.

My conclusion is that you did not bother to do that in the past so there will be no change there for you? 
Hopefully this will encourage people to sell UK goods in Switzerland at UK prices so we all can benefit.   
Whether it will be in practice as simple as this & when the new rule actually starts - we will have to wait & see. 
Certainly there is already a different rule for food...

			The release of these guys from custody shows how well Swissieland's soft stance on crime is working. It's a joke how real crime is (not) punished here ... and how automobilists and other easy targets are shot by the cops like fish in a barrel. Yuck. The first morning I rode my motorcycle into Zurich for work, I was subject to a traffic stop that targeted all motorcycles. Wow. Impressive. I am so skeered. In the meantime plenty of cyclists ignored the rules of the road, but I reckon the cops have given up on policing them. So they target the easy targets. The justice system follows suit, dishing out impressive fines against speeding furners, but showing its inability to cope with real crime, and real criminals such as child molesters, rapists and other violent criminals.

			The principle behind this is no different to any other Ponzi scheme, the most famous recent example being Bernie Madoff. That so many seemingly otherwise intelligent if not downright cautious people could be so blinded to common sense by their greed is truly frightening. These schemes are ALWAYS doomed to collapse just as soon as people start wanting their money back and/or insufficent new ""investors"" can be found. It is just a case of when, not if. Nothing is being produced nothing is being ""invested"" in just lots of money being pumped into a system that is not self-sustaining.

The real problem in parallel importation is the prohibition of genuine branded goods (e.g. Levi's jeans) coming in at cheap prices through other than official distributors. Unfortunately, this will remain with us.

1581	Swiss politicsnews	Listen to the CERN rap !	DHP	2,594	25	zug	22.08.2008, 16:22	"      When being asked this question, I like to refer to the following anectode involving English chemist and physicist   (1791-1867):   
""Whilst attempting to explain his experiments on this ""electricity"" to the British Chancellor Gladstone he was asked, 'But, after all, what use is it?' Faraday replied, 'I do not know sir, but I wager that one day you will put a tax on it.'""   
'nuff said...    
Sadly, the view that scientific research needs to have an immediate financial return in terms of technological advances is still very strong; this has fairly recently been a subject of debate in the physics community here in the UK, where the government is pushing universities to pursue this mode of working. Unfortunately, this way of thinking cannot be successfully applied to the more fundamental areas of science in particular. In these fields, the process of research brings technological advances as a result of ""engineering refinements"" needed to be able to perform certain experiments; the discoveries (when they happen), are those which have the potential of revolutionizing society as a whole (e.g. the understanding of ""electricity"" above).   
Re the ""CERN rap"": I just watched the video and I'm actually quite impressed! Not saying that I expect it to top the music charts, but the information contained in the lyrics is pretty good.

No one has a   to a father - that would involve even beyond financial support and legally compelling men to be involved with children they don't want, which is insane.    One can argue that it is also about a man's reproductive rights (this is one of the arguments used for abortion). Additionally there are numerous social implications to being a single father. It's a life-changing decision to keep a child, which for men is often taken by someone else.   
But even if it were only about the money, you can hardly dismiss such a reason. My understanding is that in much of the EU, child support works out at around 15% of the father's income. In the US it is higher still. This is a serious financial burden for anyone to have imposed upon them because of another's unilateral choice and has ramifications upon their future relationships and families, the ability to own their own home, afford a pension, not to mention inheritance rights.

(As a background, the vast majority of initiatives fail. Either because their goals are not popular enough to begin with, or because the parliament creates laws as a compromise that are favored by the public.)   
I'll keep track how this constitutional ammendment becomes law...

The positive effect on property values for a   homeowners remains to be validated, the negative effects of significantly increased traffic affects   homeowners and renters.   
Do you really think every Lycée parent would eagerly move to Gemeinde Maur because the school moves there? Hmmmm.

Everybody else would split their votes between the Green & the SVP Herr X.   
Then the Green would have to get more than the equivalent of say 50% of the SVP vote to stay in; sounds like tactical voting before the final round of voting would easily fix that.

			Was swapping travel tales w/ someone at lunch. 
He (well to do italian in his 50s)  was touring US with his son, and decided to stop to ask a police patrol form some travel directions. 
So he curbs the car just ""some meters"" from the police car, unbelts and starts to open the door. His son yells, he turns to see what it's all about. One officer was pointing a pump action rifle at them, the other one his pistol. Since the car door was already open, he was forced to get out, hands up, put his hand on the roof spread his legs, etc. The two cops were shouting at him all the time. When he finally explained what it was all about, they simply told him not to try to do anything like that again and to get moving. 
So much for California, peace & love I suppose.   
Then there's the whole thing of the G8 incidents in Genoa, Italy, where many protesters - and most of them weren't the ""black block"" anarchists  - were abused by the hands of the italian anti-riot police...   
So I guess there's nothing really ""new"" to this piece of new re. the geneva police, but it's always sad to have to realize that there must obviously be some kind of catalyst within civil society that triggers this kind of heavy handed police culture

1645	Swiss politicsnews	Well-educated, under-integrated pension payers	guest	1,944	26	null	1.1.0001, 00:00	"    Unfortunately the bulk of the English-speaking staff is reserved for the duty-free stores of Akihabara and a few posh Ginza boutiques. In most cases, foreigners who attempt to engage a sales assistant in an English conversation will be greeted with a polite but embarrassed smile and a ""sumimasen, eigo dekimasen"", sometimes accompanied by the proverbial crossed arm ""damé"" sign to drive the point home. This is certainly not to say that the Japanese are not willing to serve foreign customers, their behaviour is rather due to a feeling of helplessness as to how to deal with gaijins. But I digress.      Comparing the largest cities of two countries known for their high concentration of foreigners seems fair enough to me, Mrs Doolittle. I maintain that Zurich already provides an excellent environment where expatriates can integrate with relative ease. I am grateful for the wealth of services including public ones available in English here, which contrasts with some of the forms I had to fill in, where my name in katakana would not fit in the 4 boxes.   
Do not get me wrong, I also enjoyed my several years spent in Japan and making an effort to learn the local language indeed helps considerably to become accepted and integrated. But that is true in every country. Gou ni itte wa gou ni sh tagae as they say, or When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

1649	Swiss politicsnews	swiss national anthem	swissotter	5,097	39	singaporeotter	02.08.2008, 19:09	"    Granny’s are often right. A good national anthem should be stirring. Good national anthems emphasise: 
Fatherland/motherland/brotherhood 
God 
Might 
Blood/sacrifice/readiness to lay down one's life 
Victory/glory   
Weak national anthems focus on wishy washy concepts like 
Surviving 
Being free 
Nature’s bounty/resouces 
Spangly stuff   
Hymns make excellent tunes. Good lyrics can be wasted by a weak tune. I personally can’t take the French anthem seriously because of it’s ""tum te tum tum tum tum tum tee tum"" beat. It might reduce your average Frenchman to tears but let's face it that's not much of a challenge.   
I say this as an Englishman who thinks God Save the Queen is pretty poor compared to ""Land of Hope and Glory"", ""Jerusalem"" and ""I Vow To Thee My Country"" which would make much better anthems for a country with a past. The German and Russian anthems also do the stuff for me.

But practically speaking Berne is a capital.

			The Swiss ANTIFAs are not much better than those on most other countries.   
There may be a handful of people in with them who have genuine concerns and are seeking to resolve genuine issues. But these people are either blind to the folks they have teamed up with or have lost all sense of proportion.   
Most ANTIFAs are uninformed brainless troublemakers who are only in it for the destruction and violence and only take pleasure in the misfortune of others. I have tried to debate with some of these people on their internet forums to try to find out why they do the things they do and say the things they say and the basic tenet seems to be, if you don't agree with us 100% you are a fascist like the rest of them and we're going to get you.   
Logics and fair debates are way too complicated for their simple brains so they don't bother. Many of them are school-age kids who haven't got a real grasp on politics or history but blindly believe the drivel they are being fed by a small core of older members. It is their basic belief that anybody who has achieved anything in life, such as a nice car, has basically got there through theft and deceipt and that their property is therefore fair game for vandalism and destruction. The idea that somebody may actually have worked hard to get where they are is alien to them. They also have this schizophrenia about fascism. There are probably about three and a half fascists in all of Switzerland, at least half of who are in prison, with the other half organising a march once in a blue moon which normally gets cancelled a couple of hours beforehand to keep up the pretence that ""some people would have turned up"". Nevertheless, these anifascists see fascists everywhere all the time. The police are fascists. The neighbours who object to the noise are fascists. The rich and succesful are fascists. In fact everybody is a fascist. And of course against fasicsts, violence is totally justified.

			I am a ex-smoker and consider it to be a horrible habit that is a waste of money and will damage your health.      I totally support the rights of individuals to choose to smoke if they wish as long as it doesn't harm other people at the same time. Designated smoking rooms seem to be a fairer system than in the UK where smokers are forced outside, whatever the weather. Even if pubs etc. build smoking shelters they have to be at least 50% open.   
What tends to happen now is that smokers congregate just outside the door and this can be very offputting if it is a pub that opens out onto the street. Either a crowd of smokers to get through, or heaps of cigarette butts on the pavement.

A clever and original idea to advertise the forum and/or an expat issue and/or something else is needed... Another pointer, Agent Provocateur is into culture and movies, so if the idea involves culture and is a movie/filmable, that could be a plus.

1675	Swiss politicsnews	UBS looks for 16bn CHF capital increase...	Gav	4,412	54	Ireland	30.03.2008, 23:54	"    Goldtop, 
If you can put your hand on your heart and tell me that UBS had the systems in place which modelled out a systemic collapse of the subprime market across the whole industry globally, that the risk managers, following documented procedures and using their good tools realised the risk of $40bn of losses and raised the red flag to senior management who turned round and ignored their advice then I accept your point.  
But I venture it wasnt like that. Risk managers regularly look at loss exposure in terms of VAR and stress tests look at stuff like up and down changes of 10%, 15% and 20% in prices and volatility rather than event risks of the magnitude weve seen. Fine if youre stressing a trading book. Not fine if you you've leveraged yourself up to the gills in illiquid assets and it's an open secret your peers have done the same. 
And its not impossible. Somehow Goldman Sachs figured it all out. 
That being said my comments were made in the context of senior management failures where I think the buck stops. I wasnt pointing the finger at the unseen worker bees toiling away in the backrooms though they cant be blameless.  
Thain at Merrill and Pandit at Citi have now reorganised the risk mgt function to report directly to them. Good move. They understand risk. Clear where the buck stops and gives the risk managers clout. The question is will UBS do the same and even if they do will someone with a legal background be capable of understanding the complexity of global financial risk.

			I was looking for something that might explain what Swiss policy is towards the current increasing price of oil, Peak Oil or not.   
I chanced across   (which I have read) and therefore   (which I have not read - 42 pages, PDF, English).   
The reviewer holds a position at ETH. He reviews the paper I linked to above, which review begins thus:   
""40 professors of ETH Zurich, one of the most highly reputed and visible technical universities on this planet, belong to the  , a collaborative effort created in order to study the challenges that lie ahead in terms of resource depletion and the effects exerted by our presence on the global dynamics of our planet. Currently, the potential ramifications of   and   are the Center's main focus.    
A year and a half ago, six of the professors decided to define a new  , to determine how ETH, through research and educational activities, could contribute to finding solutions to these rapidly emerging and ever more pressing issues.""   
In my opinion, the first section ("" "") of the review is the strongest. It appears that a large chunk of ""Energy Scientists"" are working with incorrect assumptions and data.   
Do these people have any clout outside the world of academia? Do they influence energy policy? Ein Bisschen worrying if they have and if they do.

			Dave and cyrus, Cata1st, it is not that simple as avoiding the smokers places.   
I go dancing several times a week in Zürich, and invariably come back home stinking at tobacco.  Same on the restaurants.   
I think the smokers have a right to smoke, i respect your right to do it even knowing it is bad for your health, but they must respect a shared resource as the air.   
If it was possible for you smokers that you could carry some plastic bag and blow your smoke there inside that could be a solution, but not. the smoke you produce poison all   air and affect our health.   
Imagine this. Someone likes to fart, it is a pleasure for him. it feels good for him to free his guts from it, so why he can't go to the restaurants and discos and just fart away ?  Out of respect for the others off course.  If he wants to fart he could go to the toilet and fart inside.   
Well as a non smoker I feel the same when someone is blowing his smoke on me as if he was farting at my side.     
Sure you have rights as an smoker, but we should also have our rights.

			Lower wages and lower cost doesn't not in fact put one in the exact same place but puts you down a peg in the international scheme of things. Switzerland needs to keep one step ahead of all her competitors and high prices and high wages give them the kind of cushion they need to be able to innovate without the constraint of pricing.    
I think it would be much harder for Switzerland, being a very small country, to be able to provide the high grade infrastructure and quality of life that they do if their overall living cost and wage packet are low as international input prices in the long run would put a damper on it currency fluctuations not withstanding (currencies move up and down but a very high price/wage Switzerland can much easily absorb it.)

			It is not just the German government who have a problem applying basic principles of law to their own behaviour. We recently saw a crown prince return from a war to establish ""democracy"" in a faraway land, and his comment regarding going there to drop bombs on folks was that if someone wants ""save lives"" by going to bomb folks, then they should be allowed to do it.   
In other words, do as I say and not as I do.   
The reason our western governments are becoming increasingly bold, and transgressing fundamental principles of law and civil rights with increasing ease, is probably a consequence of the US example. The USA has decided that law is a nice sideline to the main game of power politics. The Bush regime has thrown out the rule book of international norms that has been built up since the last really great, heroic war, and now we face the very real prospect of war in the balkans as Russia wonders where the hell is going to be the next ""independent"" part of the former soviet bloc.   
In this context, the attacks on ""tax havens"" are neither surprising nor unprecedented. All fascist and quasi fascist regimes want an absolute monopoly of control on private finance. It is called destroying the private liberties and rules of private property that characterize modern societies. Every theocrat and commie dictator has the same ultimate goal, in this respect. They want total control.   
What the US has been doing with secret police, secret prisons, renditions and torture is pretty clearly an erosion of civil rights by folks who think they are above the law.   
What these self appointed saints in Germany are doing is precisely the same. They have been brazenly breaking the law and daring the judiciary to confront them. The judiciary says nothing. Just as in the USA.   
Let us be frank: I have not committed any crimes recently, and so I can hopefully expect to stay out of jail.   
Right now, as I type this, numerous people in the German government have committed serious felonies for which you or I would face prison. These include conspiracy to theft, actual theft, bribery and espionage. Civil suits include actions based on a breach of german constitutional law concerning human rights.   
Not one of these folks is going to prison for these crimes. We all know they were committed, we all know that if you or I, mere ordinary people, did these things and proclaimed our actions to the world, we would be sitting in a jail cell.   
Why?   
The only explanation for a lack of universal application of basic laws is that a special class of person has been created by the governing power in the land; a class of person who is above the law that applies to ordinary people.   
You can call this what you like. Fascism is as good a term as any.   
And finally, for all you folks out there running on envy and hatred, who just love to see the government nail a rich man to the wall, just pause and answer me one fundamental question about the world:   
Where in the world would you like to go and live, THAT DOESN""T HAVE THE RULE OF LAW AND PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKETS?   
The bottom line is that the people responsible for this illegal aggression against the peaceful and productive state of Liechtenstein must be rooted out, charged, and sentenced to jail. They are emblematic of a philosophical cancer that is spreading in the world, and they pose a very significant danger to our civilization, such as it is.   
These people want the law of the jungle. They wish to be the ones who define the law from moment to moment. They will tell us we are in danger and that only they can save us.   
It is a crock of shit, and these folks need to go to jail so that our children do not fire up the gas ovens once again, in yet another fit of righteous certainty and aggressive barbarity.

i think it should be a mixture of both. private so people can enjoy the shore the way they wish, and public so people can be herded into promenades, and forced to eat from carts and little venders. personally i like the hiking trails that arent commercialized and seem more natural. living in CA many people own houses with the back emptying out into the woods and public hiking trails,. it seems to work because the locals keep the hiking trials clean and maintained, and the trails arent filled of mcdonalds and millions of people. it seems to work for both. protecting nature and letting people enjoy it.

			If you search for ""Sippenhaft"", you'll find that this point of view has been discussed before. While I strongly dislike the style of SVP/UDC ad campaigns and mostly disagree with their positions, an eviction is by the law not a penalty but a measure to ensure public safety (and therefor should only taken against dangerous criminals and not for every crime on the initiative's catalogue). If you ask the other way: Should a criminal be allowed to stay because he's parent of a minor? Didn't the minor just enter Switzerland because of his parents' effort, too? And sometimes the situation might be solved by giving the child custody to somebody else if the criminal parents are uncapable to take care of their offspring anyway.   
That said I'll vote against the initiative. The initiative wouldn't significantly change the current situation. A yes for the initiative would give the SVP/UDC too much media attention at home and Switzerland a bad image abroad.

			Now this is interesting... How many times have you heard Swiss banging on about how their education system is not bad, and in fact many think it is the best in the world (despite numerous studies and reports which say otherwise).   
So despite defending it so much, 86% seem to think that it needs dramatic reforms as shown by today's vote. Here's the story from Swissinfo:       
Well I think this can only be a good thing for the Swiss education system, let's see what comes of it.   
It reminds me a little bit about the vote to remove the requirement to build bunkers in all buildings. Prior to that so many Swiss were telling me that it wasn't such a stupid idea, and I'd be glad if I needed it one day, etc. Then they had a vote, and 80% came out in favour of scrapping them!    
Participation in this weekend's vote was 27% - that's democracy in action folks!

He announced his candidacy hoping that the moderate right parties CVP and FDP would challenge the SVP for Blocher's seat. He would've withdrawn his candidacy in that case. This unlikely scenario didn't happen. The CVP was considering to attack one of the FDP seats, this would be arithmetically conformable with the concordance idea. The CVP has lost its second seat to the SVP four years ago, but is now better represented in the parliament than the FDP.   
The election of the federal council is running on TV this morning, so far only Leuenberger (SP) and Couchepin (FDP) have been elected (The ministries' leaders are re-elected in order of their years of service). I don't think there will be surprises but we shall see soon.

Finance equlization betwenn cantons and tax competition is a political question. By attracting rich people with a regressive or flat tax Obwalden would still increase their total tax income. So they would receive less from other cantons if they are successful.  
But the total tax income of Switzerland is decreasing with this policy, mostly in favour of the people with high income.

			That's cos it's a system of proportional representation. In this e.g. the EVP who barely had enough votes for a seat have lost ground and therefore their seat. Despite the gain the SVP don't have sufficient votes for a further seat. It takes some maths though. btw, the example you posted is just a prediction at present (I think).

It's not surprising that a business lobby would support foreigners - there's a skill shortage here. Maybe it's just plain people shortage. 
I remember a Reader's Digest article ""Where Have All The People Gone?"" and it talked about how people seemed to vanishing in Switzerland (and other parts of Europe). They also called it an environmentalist's dream because the forests appear to be re-generating (if that's a word). Of course, some of it is the migration to cities. Anyway, this is getting soooo off-topic!

			At times the Euroscepticism is very similar to that seen in the UK.  The psyche, based on history, of ""doing our own thing"" certainly runs true here too.  And with the Swiss they have done quite well and are not exactly short of a few bob by doing so!   
It's an issue close to their hearts and therefore it should come as no surprise that populist politics should come to the fore around an election time.   
But it doesn't mean the Swiss (generally speaking) are anti-foreign, they want to manage their things their way and if foreigners can help then great, but if they prove to be a threat (such as the perceived buying of lots of property) then let's shut that door.  But that decision should be theirs, and theirs only.  This is no different to ""the greatest nation in the world"" (sic), the US and no different to how it was in most of Europe in the past.

			The thing here is that the swiss knife is a symbol of the country's pride. Military equipment is in many countries exempt from usual tendering procedure. I suspect a face-saving compromise will be worked out on these grounds. At the end of the day, it is the responsibility of the swiss procurement executive to get the best equipment possible within spec and constraints on budget, wherever it comes from. Knives are approaching commodity status and have little in terms of maintenance or logistics to worry about. I remember reading a similar discussion recently about army uniforms...

			I had a friend who was in charge of PR for a very large global company and we often discussed ""PR"" issues. In her younger days she was an activist for various causes but told me that she became frustrated with these groups because they were totally unable to convey their message effectively, effectively isolating themselves from the very people they were trying to reach. She had tried many times to explain this idea, but was generally ignored by people who just ""didn't seem to get it"". I think it's sad because sometimes some of these people have a point (many people who laughed at the protests about Iraq have a different opinion today than they did at the beginning), but they discredit themselves to the point where some people can actually imagine that they see justification in cutting such a rope.   
Death is death and injury is injury. A reporter doesn't deserve to get shot in the head twice by a policeman no matter what he's done (unless he is very clearly threatening someone else's life).   
Anyway, I agree with Litespeed's comments - combination of pressure, tunnel vision and an apparent complete lack of training. So to try and bring something constructive to this debate here's my take on how the situation might have been handled.   
1. Assess the scene (that means not talking on the mobile phone the whole time). Scene assessment might take a minute or so to figure out what they were dealing with. 
2. Communicate with the protesters, ask them what they want, or what they are threatening to do. Perhaps another minute required for this. Protesters may shout or not be very useful at this point, but they would have at least explained that there were people hanging from ropes. 
3. Communicate this information back to your central command, request advice and/or backup. 
4. Wait until police arrive in sufficent numbers and then start arresting/removing protestors. 
5. Pull up the ropes on either side of the bridge. Four police officers on each side should be able to pull up the ropes and remove the person on the end of it quite easily. Could be attempted before step 4 if protesters didn't attack the police doing it. 
6. Now that the threat has been removed cut the rope and clear the area 
7. Only allow traffic to flow once the situation is clear and no more people remain on the road.   
It aint rocket science. Of course it could be argued that the police were under pressure, so how could I expect them to keep a clear head. They are supposed to be trained for such situations. What would happen if there were a more complex situation?   
Litespeed - I understand what you said about the burden of proof, but you can clearly see the cop involved on video - he arrives, sees exactly what is going on, then returns later to cut the line, knowing full well what will happen. That's called wilful negligence, and to my mind could be called attempted murder. He was caught red-handed. Because he had perfect knowledge of what he was doing it could not be called an act of ""good faith"".   
I think Verena's comment about traffic snarls is true - we have to endure road works and huge queues every single summer - now all of a sudden a traffic jam has to be cleared with so much speed that all concepts of scene assessment and safety are thrown to the wind - even down to cars being allowed to pass on a road full of people walking around...

			I think there's a bit of confusion: 
Berlusconi is not with the northern league (lega padana), he has not such view, he more into the right wing capitalism. 
The lega dei ticinesi is a weird political party: it's mainly a social right wing party and is really different from the SVP-UDC, it's a bit of a confusionary party because it has right wing people, communists and people rejected from others political parties in it so the only thing they have in common is that they want to bring benefit to the people of Ticino. As is easy to understnad they are a populist party and during the last elections they received a massive support from people.

			The problem is that those committing suicide (which is a high rate in Switzerland) often, way too often, take out their families with them.  The WP article said I think 8 cases last year.    This is why the women's groups are ""up in arms"" (sorry) about it all.  To kill a couple of kids and your wife, then yourself, with a knife, takes quite a lot of time and energy. But easy access to a gun can mean you can rid yourself of all your problems very quickly. And they do.  The murder-suicide rate in Switzerland is very high - I read elsewhere (can't remember where) that it is one of the highest in the world.   
So while it feels ""safe"" here, and the crime rate amongst people who don't know each other is quite low, the fact is, that for some people, usually women, it is not that safe.

			I guess this is all about the eternal problem of envy + plus the eternal argument between left and right politics......nothing can ever be resolved in our millenia I suspect.

Switzerland has the highest per capita wealth (OECD stats: assets of $648,000 each Swiss person on average) - in the world!   
A richista is likely to be a relatively big spender here, and consume very few public services - certainly less than the average taxpayer - and the average Swiss with three quarter of a million franks to his/her name shouldn't have sleepless nights about this surely?

I assume this is an April Fool's day joke. The SVP( monster raving loony party for extreme right wingers) usually wants to send all foreigners home. I can't imagine they want to increase the number of people voting. Their core voters are the farmers and less educated so I can't imagine they would want to add anyone to the voting population who would automatically be against them.

			Ocean conservation is a subject in which I have a keen interest. I can say that this thread doesn't really surprise me. This is not the first time that Switzerland has used its voting rights in organisations that decide matters of the ocean to side with the ""underdog"". Most people could not be blamed for being baffled by this - after all Switzerland has no ocean.   
Why does it do this? I can only make two guesses (someone please correct me if I have missed something here)   
1. Siding with a country with an unpopular opinion (e.g. Japan or Norway on the issue of whaling) might be a way to gain favour from that country in return for that country supporting Switzerland on another issue (e.g. political horse trading).   
2. Where there is a matter of more direct national interest - for example if a Swiss company were supplying something to a company or industry which might be affected by the issue, for example (purely hypothetical!!) if they were supplying harpoons to shoot the whales they might be keen to protect their customers' ability to use (and therefore buy) the harpoons.   
I recall a case a while back where Switzerland opposed the protection of an endangered species of seal. I was puzzled about it and did some research on it. Turns out that a couple of these seals exist in a children's zoo in Rapperswil. Would that really be enough of a reason to oppose such a move?   
The mind boggles sometimes...

Coke produces dopamine, adrelline(SP?) rush, only problem is that it destroys permantly your ability to do so again   So you need more each time, very addictive as well.

			This sounds like a nice event:   
On December 16, at 4 p.m., thousands of candles will be lit all over Switzerland at spciefied squares, on bridges and in buildings to send a sign of solidarity to those in need. Everyone is invited to come and light a candle, too. You can find a list of the places at  . There, you can also find photos from last year to get an impression.   
In addition, Caritas has started selling glass candle holders in the shape of stars to put in the windows. They are white, light red and dark red. Last year, I think three candle holders cost CHF 7. They are sold in front of some big Coop warehouses and at other places, which you can also find at the indicated web site. The profits go to welfare.

Even if there were a centrally processed tax system (instead of 4600 different tax departments) it would not mean that the money would have to be allocated differently - the collection/administration of taxes and the allocation and eventual spending of them are different issues.   
I see this as a first step - simply streamlining the process a little and trying to remove some of the administrative overhead. It's not an earth shattering proposal to covert to the system of government used in other countries.   
This is Switzerland after all - each small step takes time.

			Hi NickJ,   
I admit that that all sounds well and good in theory. However there have been cases of some now semi-prominent people in Swiss society who were originally asylum seekers without papers. Some of them went through two or three appeals (under the much older rules) before being accepted to stay. The no campaign had some posters up with their photos and their stories.       [swissinfo.ch] tells the story of a man who left Turkey. It says that even today he is unable to talk about the abuse he suffered, which is a common condition among those who have undergone extremely stressful situations. I'm sure readers of many tabloid newspapers would pronounce such excuses as complete BS, but the fact is this guy's application took four years, but now he is allowed to stay. The video tells the story of his struggle to integrate. Would his case be considered ""uncooperative"" and see him deported or jailed under the new rules?   
It's a sad fact that yes, they do have to be housed and fed during their application period. But the even sadder fact is that the application process takes a very long time. I'm sure improvement could be made in this process. I note also that out of the total number of asylum applications, very few are actually approved. Still, at least when we house them and feed them we do so without interning them in camps in the desert or offshore islands as is the case in Australia (not happy, John).   
I do agree with you however that if the same vote were put to the public in many western European countries the result would be the same. But those other countries are supposed to elect politicians that do their homework on these issues, rather than asking a somewhat uninformed public for their opinion.   
Anyway, looks like the results are in and here's   [swissinfo.ch]. 68 percent voted yes. Interesting, exactly the same number for both the asylum and the foreigner vote - I wonder if voters had trouble telling the two apart? Here's a small quote:      Now there's a surprise    
Here's an interesting question. Imagine if there were a vote which asked ""Should we refuse to take any asylum seekers whatsoever?"". Imagine if this vote were put to the people in Switzerland, or any other European country. Would the electorate, if given the chance, close their borders completely to those fleeing persecution, just as the Swiss turned away Jews at the German border duing World War 2?   
Lob, small correction on the ammendments to the asylum law - it's actually five times since 1984 that ammendments were approved by voting, but the total number of ammendments is actually nine.

Some quotes:      I also liked this quote about a website:      I wonder if englishforum.ch will ever get a mention in the press like that?   
But the quote that astounded me the most was this one:      Right - so we were poor, then all of a sudden we were rich - and we did this all without economic growth, so maybe this whole growth thing is garbage?
