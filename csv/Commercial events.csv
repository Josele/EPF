			Thanks for the info. I was going nuts trying to post something and still didn't know if it was commercial or social. its actually both tho!
		 
			
			Hello, freelancing,    
if there is a cover that people will be charged at your event, please, be aware that makes it a commercial event. You can post 10 posts of some relevance and value to our expat community and life in CH, then make your commercial event.    
Thanks, MC.
		 
			
			Hello everyone.    
can anyone please help me with this question ?    
I just planned two events, and did not find anywhere a setting of how many members would be allowed to RSVP. I did mention that in the event description, but is not there usually a parameter to set with that information ?    
will I have to keep monitoring my event and stop RSVP manually ??   
and if so, how do you stop people from replying RSVP ?  I mean how do you tell people that an event is full and no one would be allowed to still RSVP ?
		 
			
			As far as I know, Marc73, you can limit the number of guests someone may bring - the default is 20! - but once your quota is full, there's no way of stopping people signing up. Unless you set a date when the sign-ups for the event are closed, but I'm not sure if even that's possible; I've only seen it once the event's date has passed. You can, however, bump people off the list; as organiser you will see a [remove] option next to each person's name. It's up to you to exercise this feature or not.   
It's best relying on people's good will and asking them not to sign up anymore. If you find it's only a few, fair enough - some will anyway not turn up        
thank you very much. I really appreciate your kind answer.
		    Actually I think there is a way, 'cos I managed it once. I think once your event is full you can change the   to the number of days and hours you are at ""now""  before the event... if you get my drift (do this by editing the event).    
The event should then be ""closed"" for RSVP's   
You should also edit the event description and add in bold at the bottom "" ""... or words to that effect. I don't quite have the eloquence that Uncle max has in telling people that they've left it too late       Beware of editing the event as there have been occassions in the past where all the RSVPs are deleted   I don't know if this was a bug or a problem between the monitor and chair. It may be an idea to note who's in before editing anything...
		 
			
			When editing an event you do not loose the rsvps, but you will sometime s loose the +1 guests on the event. Just be carefull what options you chose when editing. If you try to change the end of rsvp date after youve posted you will loose all your rsvps.  
The best way to stop the event , is to make sure you put a close time and date at least 24 hours before the actual event, when first posting . It will automatically close off the event.  
Otherwise you will have to rely on good will, and edit the event to show , it is fully booked.    
			
			Here are the guidelines for posting commercial events.        
You probably know already that your event is commercial, rather than social. In short, if you're advertising your business, charging a fee or hoping to sell something, then it's a commercial event.   have no commercial interest.    
Examples of commercial events are comedy nights, wine tasting, salsa class and advertising concerts. This also includes clubs that charge for events or membership fees.    
Commercial events should specify if there is an entry fee or other price attached. They should preferably have some angle of interest for the expat/englishforum community.   
Example: If I invite people to meet in a pub to watch Chris Black sing, then it's a social event. If Chris himself makes the invitation, then it's commercial.        
There are now two calendars: social (default calendar) and commercial. This helps to separate the different types of event. To see the commercial calendar, look at the bottom right of the calendar and use the “Calendar Jump” field.    
Commercial events should only be posted in the commercial calendar.        
In order to post an event, you have to have a little forum history. Most people qualify pretty quickly. The reason for this is that we want to encourage people to be an active part of the community and not to use it just for free advertising. The qualifications are as follows:

Enjoy the film, I really liked it    
			
			I had tickets for the premier of the ""Force Awakens"" - when I got to the door I was told by some old guy it wasn't the premier I was looking for.    
I think I'll wait until it is available on VHS.          
for some bizarre reason it came out a day early in the french part? gotta love movie companies

Thanks for passing this on ...
		 
			
			Will there be lyric sheets?   
I've been here so long that I can't remember most of the words anymore. The last time I was back in Canada I ended up reciting the Lords prayer in German when I went to church with my mum.
		 
			
			Lovely to see interest, would be great to have you join!   
I am in the process of making the booklets with the words to the carols  and I think there are even plans to have them on a projector, need to check that. If there are several people arriving by train from Zurich, we can arrange to have someone go to the train station to make sure you find it alright.
		 
			
			Wonderful idea! Thanks for organizing it. Already looking forward to it.
		 
			
			So just a few days to go and preparations well underway. Based on a message received I just wanted to clarify that this will not be a ""choir boys and organ music"" type of carol service - simply a small congregation opening its doors to anyone who wishes to join in on the festive spirit. Everyone involved is really looking forward to it and we hope it will be a great success, as it's the first time this particular church community is doing this.

It's really good farm to table style french cuisine. Sort of what you'd get in taverns and bistros in paris.    
Heading back tonight. The food has a lovely homemade taste to it and when it's gone, it's gone. I wouldn't know where else to go in Zurich for this.    
Oh and I had the tiramisu shot for dessert - perfect in taste and size    
The prices are also reasonable. They were less than Zurich prices at the opening night when I went.

			Hi!   
Do you know if there is something similar around Lausanne?
		 
			
			Yes they have something called iCafe:    
			
			Just to clarify - although this is in the commercial events section, it's completely free/gratis/kostenlos  .  It's just not allowed in the social events section because it's not an EF-only event. 
See you there!
		 
			
			Hi, thanks for your answer but Fribourg seems to be a bit far from Lausanne.
		 
			
			Watch out: tucked away at the bottom of their website, it's written that this is a Christian group.    
There are certainly people out there who are interested in some kind of international bible study, but it's dishonest to prey on people far from home who are just looking for some community to push your agenda, especially when you are not upfront about it.
		    Firstly, it's not a bible study group - if you look at the agenda there are a whole bunch of different activities, eg. games, films, talks, fondue, ice skating etc. 
Secondly, there's no 'pushing' - it's run by Christians and I'm sorry if your experience is that Christians are 'pushy', but that's not the case here. People are free to come if they want, or not.. there's no obligation. 
Thirdly, it's a bit harsh to say 'not upfront about it', since - as you've observed - it's pretty plain on the website.  Plus as i wrote in the original introductory post, one aspect is for people to share each other's cultures and beliefs.   
Anyway, tonight is Aussie night - want to come?       Sorry that was the wrong link!  They don't have exactly the same setup but there is a group in Lausanne that has various lunchtime activities:    
And yes, it's also run by Christians
		    Yes, it's run by Christians. Hardly ""tucked away"". It's in one of the main sections:          Yes, it is. Are you sure these are people like that? Or is this just the ugly prejudice and intolerance rearing its head again?

I have started a new meetup group called  , and if you have a sense of adventure, I invite you all to join!   
We are snowboarders, splitboarders, skiiers, and hikers. Above all, we like adventures and love a good time. I will be organizing small events throughout the year with winter sports focusing on freeriding lesser known gems as well as the more well known ones. Powder is powder, right? We can still ski the pistes, and you better believe we will wash all that down with a beer or two   Spring/Sommer/Fall is all about trails and ales   
It is a group dedicated to the pursuit of outdoor excitement. I hope to foster a real community half as good as this one.   
@admins, please move this post if it is not in the right section.

a lot less if you've opened them       Used star destroyers are 3,200eur!   
The Y-wing seems be the most over values - 6k on Amazon for an unopened one!
		        worth whatever some muppet will pay for them, seen the price of some of the mini figures???? the ones from the falcon go for more then the whole kit !?!?!?!?!?!
		    I only searched because you posted about the show. At some point I'll have to organize what I have and get an idea of value - I have a sneaking suspicion the Lego cupboard is worth a few CHF more than I thought!
		     
hope you kept the boxes too
		 
			
			Is this a commercial event? If so, will the prices beat the Legoland prices?
		    3chf for kids 
6chf for adults   
no rides though
		    Thanks. I meant to ask if they sold legos at competitive prices at this event, or if it was just a building event and then go home*.   
* Quite a commute then, and I would forgo it if that was the case.
		     
no idea if they will be selling anything
		    Yep        
I'm there on the sat, so I'll update this thread on sat pm if they are selling there also
		    That's a bit of a hike for you isn't it?  
We will probably be there on Sunday but it is just down the road from us.
		     
yep, we're helping out, we are there sunday as well
		 
			
			quick bump   
Its this weekend, we'll be there sat & sun, bonus points if you spot us    
			
			I should be there Saturday afternoon
		 
			
			Lego is being sold here, new and pre-loved, don't know if the prices are competitive though

			Our organisations website is now up with info on who we are and why we are proud of Zurich's liveliest neighbourhood. Tribeka is still in it's infancy so expect more info once the launch on November 17th has happened. Join us!   
If you have any questions do let me know. We're here to promote Kreis 4 and look forward to welcoming you.       (in German for now)
		 
			
			Thank you to all who came down over the course of the evening; we chomped through three legs of Jamon, 340 oysters, cases of Cava, gallons of Stout, 75 litres (!) of comforting Hot Toddies and mooched until after 4am...   
I'm still on a protein rush from all the oysters    
It was a pleasure to meet new faces and old as people made their tour of Kreis 4 and the launch of Tribeka. Props to the Beat Pirates for the tunes and the good nature of the guests.    
We look forward to hosting our classical music night on Sunday 4th December: see the events calendar for details.   
Cheers and thanks again.

			Evening all,   
About a year ago, I arrived in Switzerland & placed an advert on English Forum looking for like minded musicians.   
The eventual result of that initial advert is the band RAGDOLL SUNDAY; highly listenable original classic rock / grunge influenced music with soaring vocals; marked as one of the hottest new rock bands coming up in Switzerland, with an album due to be released Summer 2017.   
Saturday 26th Nov at 20:30, we'll play a   show at  .   
It'll be one of the only shows where we'll play all the songs which might make it onto next year's album over a 1.5 hour set. All for   You can hear a taste of our music  , from our demo we recorded in May this year.   
There'll be food, drinks & a rocking night all around, & all are welcome!

			Hi All, 
Saturday 19.11.16 1100hrs-1900hrs and 
Sunday 20.11.16 1000hrs - 1700hrs   
Exhibition, presentations, games to play and Saturday night party 2100hrs - 0000hrs   
Place Aktionshalle - Dock 18 - Rote Fabrik - Seestrasse 395, 8038 Zurich   
5CHF entrance fee   
If you have any interest in the original computers and the first games, played Pong, Space Invaders, wrote code on C64's - come and look at what they have and enjoy the nostalgia.

			Thanks to all who came last night and boogied until 04:00. We had a real mixture of revellers and the mood was very friendly.     
I'm impressed with the general behaviour of guests: gallons of booze drunk, dancing around tables and rarely a broken glass. Best of all never any hassle - thank you!    
We were curious how an Electro night would go down in our usually demure bar but are delighted it was enjoyed by all.    
There are various upcoming events if you're looking to expand your social circle here in Zurich, including an evening of Soprano / Mezzo Soprano singing, readings, improv, our birthday party, more DJ sets...   
Next Thursday - Nov. 17th - we host the opening celebrations of   Zürich. It would be a pleasure to welcome you. Do introduce yourself, especially if you come on your own. We have loads of English speaking customers coming in and our staff love to be hospitable. Customers always end up chatting to each other, too, which is deeply satisfying.    
Cheers!

			Hi, 
The recently created Swiss English-language Scrabble Association warmly invites you to its first Open House on Thursday evening 17th. November as of 19:00. 
So please come along and join us in what should be a very enjoyable evening as you learn about the joys of playing Scrabble and how this new Association intends to promote the English version of the game here in Switzerland and more specifically at present in the Geneva area. 
A very sociable group so it maybe of interest to those new to the Geneva Area and what some English speaking friends. 
The evening will include a demonstration of the game by two famous Swiss players Kevin Meng and Benoit Delafontaine.      
Hope to see you there, Dave Underhill
		 
			
			Brilliant!  When does it come to Zürich    
			
			Slightly off topic, but if you're a Scrabble fan, you'll probably enjoy Bananagrams too.   
A bit like speed Scrabble.  Without a board.  Or points.     
(Probably availible elsewhere too)
		    Can't some of us just meet in a coffee shop and play?    
			
			Where is it happening?
		    I'm in    
			
			I need to be part of this thing.   I hope to fit it in our choir/knitting/yodelling/bouldering/fencing agenda. Although would prefer chess    
Mod hat on - OP, might be better to create an event in our social calendar.
		    I do, but I still need to play the game with someone.   I even have the game.       Haven't played the English version since years (and am sorely out of practice), but would love to get together for a round or two.  Am drowning in work s?st at the moment, but might be able to organise a place near the University
		 
			
			Won't be able to attend. But if one day your group fancies coming out to play up in t'mountains near Pontarlier - I've got a massive room available and kitchen (10 large tables - for free)- and it would be fun to organise. 55 mins from Lausanne.
		 
			
			Hi, 
I am new to the forum and clearly I forgot to attach the Flyer which includes the location (not Coppet).......   Maison de Quartier Asters-Servette,   47 RueSchaub, 1202 Geneva    as of 19:00 
I appreciate the responses so far and nice to hear that there are members out there who like to play scrabble. 
The objective is to encourage all levels of scrabble play, from very social to competition. 
The location where the Open House is to be held is quite ""cosy"" and has an area where children can sit and play should you want to bring them along.     
Hope the attachment works,  Dave
		 
			
			The title of this post made me chuckle   Imagine playing Scrabble in German    
Personally, I love the game, would be happy to join if something comes up in Zurich.
		 
			
			Maison de Quartier Asters-Servette, 47 RueSchaub, 1202 Geneva  
as of 19:00
		    Actually that would be a great learning opportunity    
Please expand to Basel or Zurich or anywhere in between   Geneva is too far for me    
			
			If we do a day here one day- we could have French- English and german tables - I hve both the French and German versions.
		    I have the German version if anyone wants to try       ..with umlauts?
		    Yep. (and only one ""Y"").           Maison de Quartier Asters-Servette,   47 RueSchaub, 1202 Geneva   as of 19:00      Yes, does make things pretty boring - thought that it would spice-up my life, but no.  Will stick to English...
		    Could be worse. The set at our holiday home used to be in Slovenian.

			Many thanks to all who ventured out last night; it was lovely to meet so many new faces. We enjoyed the smooth sounds and smooth conversations on a rainy night in the city.
