			It feels like summer is finally here, so to celebrate we have put together our five most popular summer essential beauty treats in one package! 
These no nonsense beauty fixers will have you badi, pool or seaside ready in no time      
Instead of 180chf, you pay 150chf for 3 treatments out of the 5 below. 
All you have to do is choose!       
Your nails are shaped and buffed.  Painted with one of our many soak off gels (Opi Color Gel or Shellac) and finished off with cuticle oil application and creamfor those with limited time or an in-between refresher! 30 mins per treatment.     
A tan makes everything better! For many of us the thought of putting a bikini on for the first time in the season is frightening to say the least, but now we can cheat a little with our golden, natural looking tan   
We apply the LDN:SKINS spray tan liquid using a unique layering technique  building up your tan meticulously to achieve a natural-looking tan that meets your desires. All this takes only 15-20 minutes.     
Why bother with mascara when you can have them all-ready, tinted and looking wonderful before the holiday even begins?!   
Makes a huge difference to the fair-toned but also adds definition and volume to darker types as the dye picks up lashes that you never knew were there!   
Only 15 mins for both!     
Lycon Wax is extremely popular with celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Sienna Miller and Minnie Driver. Australias Lycon Wax contains the finest resins, natural ingredients & aromatherapy oils to deliver superior performance, removing hairs as short as 1mm and with its low temperature it provides a much more comfortable treatment.

In my experience is it especially this time of the season the most busy place around.   
If you have the option, skip it and drive on... I was in Davos this weekend and the slopes were half empty. Saturday was great, Sunday pretty cloudy, but fresh powder... today is probably a killer day, but well, it's Monday...

13	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Ski buying advice needed please...	Richdog	1,278	29	Location: Zurich	10.11.2016, 21:29	" 
			
			I rented skis for the whole season from pro ski in Thalwil.  That allowed me to try out 3 different skis for at least a few weeks each. ( I think you are allowed to change only once, but the second time I changed it was already towards the end of season so they let me have a pair which was just returned) When I thought I had a good idea of the type of skis I would like, I looked out for sales on specific skis around the end of last season.       
Found my blizzard Brahmas previous-season model here for 50% off, free delivery, zero German VAT,  but needed to add the usual swiss tax and admin charges on top. Great service.            
So I rented and tested the skis at probably less than 50% the cost of new skis, then bought the skis at also 50% off, I think overall it was a good move!      
In terms of bindings, the only thing you want to look at if you are buying wider skis is to match the width of the bindings.  I got the marker griffon which looks too wide for race skis but matches mine perfectly.

14	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Free-Weights in Geneva	U Mavaru	317	11	Location: Geneva	08.01.2017, 02:49	"    Squats and deadlifts - two best full compound exercises out there. In last 5 years I've not come even close to anything as comprehensive as these guys. These alone are good enough for me to have a gym membership (plus treadmill for those crappy rainy winterish days)   
Other great excercises - variations of pullups. Some lucky people can mount constructions on doors, but in all of my Swiss rentals (5 of them), I've never had a door frame that would support one of these, so gym (or some parks) are the only option.

I play Squash with Ed (on this forum) and I play badminton every Thursday night with a group from 20:30-22:00 if you are interested. You can join the group for badminton (super cheap). 60chf for 6 months.    
As for squash, I could probably teach you the basics if you want to go a couple of rounds. PM me and perhaps you can join me and Ed. We play during the day though. We could organize evening games. And there is a group that play Fridays at one of the local fitness places.

20	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cycling/hiking or squash partners Rheinfelden / Basel	Denman	98	0	Location: Basel	07.01.2017, 18:16	" 
			
			Hi All,   
I am looking to join forces with expats or locals in the Rheinfelden area for hiking and cycling and furthermore squash in Basel (expect this might be more likely after work for instance).    
I am a beginner at squash so this would be to kick off a new interest.    
I got into cycling last summer and mainly go around my local area and would be happy to hear from locals who want to go out and about. For me this would be an ideal way to get outside, meet people and stay healthy.   
(I have searched for this and found nothing, so dared to start a new thread)   
Hope to hear from you, all the best.   
By the way, I am a British, 35, male, Dad, married to a Swissy.  Cheers

			Check out reddit r/crossfit for a lot more candid discussion about CrossFit itself.     
I did CF for about five years quite intensively, even did some qualifications and coached a bit.  Like any high intensity training/workout you need to take some ownership for how hard and far you push yourself. My own experience was no more injuries than from running, skiing or football.   
Also, you have to understand that CrossFit is a loose affiliation system, not a franchise, so ""boxes"" vary greatly in quality.  However, both of the Meilen operations are run by serious and experienced owners.   
Try it out...

Have I wandered into a post on steam locomotives? I can't think of any moving parts on brake components that require lubrication and as a rule of thumb, I wouldn't go anywhere near the brakes with lubricant. Any areas that do need lubrication should not be lubricated with WD40, as this will just attract grime, which will aid the wear process on moving parts. (Use a silicone based lubricant or any specialised lubricant)      Dirt often gets ingrained into the lubricant and if not properly removed will wear those components. Regarding any acid based degreaser, this can strip all protection leaving components/areas of components accessible to the elements

Second, a proposal for the cycle advocacy section: Other than IG Velo, they don't exclusively support cyclists, but they support the Veloland Schweiz maps and are politically active for bikers: Traffic Club Switzerland  .

			There are two girls hockey teams in Geneva - Servette and Meyrin.  Both are registered with the Swiss National League C.  My daughters play for Servette and this is their first year in the league. There are also a number of club teams, but these teams are only active during the winter and play on outdoor half ice. There are a number of other girls teams in Lausanne, Morges, Neuchâtel, and number of other towns in Canton Vaud.

If you are stuck on Spin and other indoor stuff there are two lets go just by the station - one by the Denner - which have good classes - the one by Denner has just opened or been renovated I think. Pay as you go for spin and its only about 19chf a class I think.

The weekend before was also quite good but skiing only down to Morenia. These past couple of days everything was closed because of strong wind but there's more snow on the way so in two weeks you'll likely have a very good time.

    			 			If you are having any health issues like insommia, fatique,  arthritis, asthma, depression, etc. try Qi Gong. Qigong (pronounced  -gong)  is an ancient Chinese exercise  and healing technique that involves  meditation, controlled breathing and  movement exercises.     
 I have arthritis with some joint pains. I have been doing some  exercises thanks to my husband's training. Doing regularly Qi Gong just  for a few weeks has already eased the stiffness and pain significantly. I also feel energized.   My husband took a two days course in Qi Gong last year in Sion, Valais  with Master Ligin Yang (7dan). My husband was suffering from left shoulder  pain due to heavy weight lifting. He applied the exercises he learned  from Master Ligin and not long after his injured shoulder was healed.    
On Nov. 19th and 20th the same master will be giving a course for two  days in Neuchâtel. If you are interested to take the course check under  the category ""events"" in the English Forum and click on commercial  events then you will see Qi Gong for Health. Click on that and you will  have all the information and details on the Qi Gong course. You will  definitely benefit from it! If you want more information or details go  to Google or Youtube. You will see some video demonstrations.

You can visit each partner up to 4 times per month but if you want some variety and not always to go to the same place you may like to try it. It is not just gyms though - it is also yoga, crossfit, TRX, Power plate, EMS, Bootcamp, spinning etc. There are 67 partners in the Zurich partner network to choose from. As an example you could in 1 month get 4 day passes at Luxor gym near Paradeplatz and 4 day passes at Airport Fitness, do 4 classes at Balboa, 4 classes at Velocity, 4 classes at Atomix and additionally 2 times EMS and 2 times Power plate.

The SAA group has evening and weekend rides during the spring, summer and autum but not so many road rides in the winter     
There are other groups on meetup as well. There is a Zug Zurich Peloton group that has a ride this weekend (never been on one of their rides but am sure it will be fun).     
It is a great website for finding like minded people - just signup for free and join the groups you are interested in.

			The new   prices have been published. There are no new resorts for 2016/7 although les Portes du Soleil is back after a one year absence. Toggenburg, Hoch-Ybrig and Val DAnniviers have fallen off the scheme, sadly, and a couple of minor resorts are now only listed online.   
Adelboden, the 4 Vallées, Saas-Fee and many Graubünden resorts have seen hikes around 10%, partly down to increased rail fares and partly increases in lift pass prices. However Zermatt has kept ski pass price flat, as have a number of other resorts, including Les Diablerets, Leysin, Villars, Grindelwald, Wengen, Mürren, Gstaad, Meiringen, Sörenberg, Melchsee-Frutt, Klewenalp, Airolo and Stoos. Although some rail tickets have gone up, some routes from Luzern to local resorts have fallen slightly.

Worth noting that although it's not normally intended for beginners, we've often been able to put novice groups together using the same format. Minimum number for this is four.

			Everything is expensive here, including plastic surgery, but it's not insanely more than in comparable countries. I have many friends who have had minor to major surgeries here and in London, NY and LA and the amounts spent are not so far off.    
I think the thing to remember is that we not judge one another. (or make jokes at the expense of others.) while I think we can all agree that it would be wonderful to live in a world where the media and society did not demand our perfection and self-objectification, this is our reality and we must each determine what is best for us and what makes feel good about living in our own skins.    
Life is hard enough without the constant (and unfounded) judgement of others.    
Best of luck to you.

			Try  . Of course Zürich city clubs are among the bigger ones, but also kcrj.ch from Rapperswil-Jona.   
Members of a Kanuclub usually (at least that was the custom 30 years ago) can store their own kajak for free in the respective clubhouse, subject to available space of course. While a canadian comes of course with additional requirements, you probably aren't the first, so contacting more than one should increase your odds. However, you will be expected to your fair share, e.g. help keep the commnunal material in good condition.

			Back to this old post - can someone recommend a good swimming teacher for my son (7).    
I am amazed by the way locals handle swimming lessons here - they take it so easy and slowly... My son has been attending for 2 years now some local swimming lessons ina small group to cover the basic 'local' levels (1 to 7), and for 2 years they've been 'getting used to the water' (what you learn for the first 2-3 days in a normal swimming training school) which I find an outrageous loss of time. Why are locals so slow and easy with everything related to sports!   
I can see why Switzerland is not among the swimming nations, but still I have hopes to find a good teacher to give my son the basics, so that he can continue in competitive swimming.   
Please, PM me if you know a good trainer/teacher in the Zug area. Thanks in advance.

			- Do you have it?

Marktkauf, Loerrach, Germany  
 - What model?  
Dunno. It's cheap , like 650CHF. It's a street bike. 
 - Are you happy with it?  
Very ,I had ruined my knees in my earlier job and hence couldn't pedal uphill no more. 
 - Do you use it? 
Very much 
 - Do you feel comfortable locking anywhere in/around Zug? 
Yes. Get one of those un-cuttable locks. 
 - Is it comfortable to ride? (posture/seat) 
Not really 
 - Battery on the ""water bottle"" area or under the baggage/seat area behind? Does it matter? 
Water bottle area. Yes, weight is closer to the bottom of the bike, so more stable 
 - What else to look for? 
Compatibility with a child seat 
You get 2 varieties,  - fast and faster.Latter needs a license plate 
 - Buy now, or wait until end of winter 2017?

No insurance.   
Note, you could install a child-seat in front too.

117	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Where to go skiing - 2nd weekend December	etsius	595	13	Location: SZ	04.10.2016, 23:21	"    No worthwhile information can be obtained at this early of a date. There is only one trend that you can count on and that is to not expect much good snow early season anymore. Treat any good snow before New Years as a bonus. There will almost always be storms that dump some snow somewhere in the Alps starting from now but you can't reliably predict where it will be. Plus, if you get a big dump in early December in Davos (or anywhere), you can count on that being quickly followed by a rain event up high or a foehn storm for a few days that will completely ruin that snow.    
The odds are that the glaciers will be fine for skiing in mid-December and it's quite probable that you can ski to the valley floor somewhere in the Alps as well. I wouldn't book a long weekend at one place expecting good snow though. As is said every year, availability is not an issue so just book a few days before you leave.

On bad years only trockner steg and plenty of wind closures.   
Sölden in austria could be an option and also cheaper

I know obviously it won't b like the Med, and there's no Zenobia at the bottom of the Lugano lake, but I am trying to find a good dive company locally, or tips on dive sites to check out or anything like that.    
I went to an open day for a dive company in Locarno, and asked for info, but they weren't very forthcoming.    
Any help greatly appreciated - it's been 2 weeks and I need to get wet again !!

131	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Looking for a Tennis Partner in Basel level 3 and above	alexkdl	237	0	Location: Basel Stadt	24.09.2016, 19:05	"   Hi there , 
Few months ago I joined a Tennis Club not far from my residence, thus it allows me to flexibly chose vacant fields at a given day or week ,the unfortunate part is that most of the members have already partners as
such I have though times in finding a partner for at least once a week. In addition I train once to two times a week with a Tennis instructor, I also
speak German and I work in the Aviation Industry . 
If seriously interested please don't hesitate to contact me.

			I used another of the Migros properties for the first time at the weekend - the Hamam:     
I thought it was pretty good value for CHF 43, even though it was fairly busy due to the weather. You can use the gym too (if you so wish).

135	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Mountain Bike (MTB) Tours/Trails in Switzerland	Eire	29,462	31	Location: Tir na nÓg	26.10.2007, 16:49	"   Davos Dorg Train station    XC (July - October)    4 29Km may not sound much but 1400hm is...    4 (some tricky rock sections and switchbacks on descent, some tricky climbing).   
Start out from Davos dorf by heading into town, round the one way sytem and turning left at the EGG bar into Dischmastrasse. Folow this to the start of the valley where you go past the Lumber yard, then turn left to In den Bulen. the trail is now sign posted.   
After the climb (av 12%), the trail darts through to the Fluela valley by a short section of single track, leading to a fireroad. Then the trail heads up parallel with the river all the way to the Geust House at Tschuggen, good climb (ave 8%) but not technical.   
Now begins the real ascent. At Tschuggen the trail leads through the guest houes garden past the little church. It is pretty hard going (ave 12%) with rocks and switchbacks to contend with until it hits a wider path around 2200hm   
Once past the Pischa Berg station you follow nice rolling (and rocky) single track to the Horli where the trail cross the ridge and starts descending. At the top before the descent is a nice bench if like me you want to put some pads on and have lunch.   
The descent is I think tricky with loose rocks, loose dirt and switchbacks, no jumping required though. Half way down you will be treaded to the most fabulous view of Davos the Parsenn and Klosters and a 180 degree panoramma. The best view of this area I've seen.   
After the view point the trail got harder for me as it was quite overgrown and became a foot wide and about 1/2 foot sunken, made some corners hard. also hit my head on a few branches. Became quite hard to see more than a couple of meters of the actual trail.   
The end of the trail was a nice fast run through some easy single track before coming onto a farmers 4x4 road, across the railwayline, round the lake and back to Davos Dorf.     
This trail was about as much as I could handle, in fact slightly more, I could do maybe 75% of the climb and 80% of the downhill. I consider my self an XC rider of average ablity and fitness.    
However I'm very glad I did it, it's 80% singletrail and I only saw 5 people during the entire ride. Plus the view of Davos - wow!   
I also had an endo near the end due to a rather large hole / rock combo that I just didn't see - wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't been slowing down to give way to two hikers, who, by the way, didn't stop or ask if I was ok as I lay sprawled across the track - they just stepped round me.....

			I grew up on 'racing' bikes but they always had 'suicide levers':         
You could place your hands in various postions.   
I wouldn't ride drop bars again without something similar.  These are the new versions of these auxilliary brakes:         
I'd rather ride an old bike with drops and these than flat bars, but having said that, on modern bikes you need to get used to the brake-lever shifters.

It's a 50 l Osprey with integrated frame, firstly it doesn't fit in the machine and secondly I doubt it's very good for the frame. I've been on 2-4 days hikes every week since May, it's starting to show. It doesn't smell that bad, yet. Just if your nose gets to close to the straps.   Oddly enough, my boots are ok so far.   
I have Tech Wash, will try that in the bathtub. Will try to only dip the straps to avoid soaking the entire thing. Still, I'm going to wait a bit since I currently use the pack every week. Eyeing 1000 km before the end of the year, can't let a wet pack put a stop to that string.

There are exceptions though, as not all items are VAT applicable to the same level in the UK, e.g. helmets and some other protection are VAT exempt (or very low VAT), so there is no / little VAT to remove.   
What they don't do as well is others is manage the way items are shipped. With CRC you usually get the standard SwissPost invoice for MWST + admin charges. With bike-discount.de you just pay the MWST, no admin.

I'm not really sure why that is because I don't get that from a ""normal"" salad, even from the ones I prepare at home from scratch (dressing included). 
Though, of course, their dressings are much more fancy.   
So, it could the the oils or it could be something different.   
If I would eat there regularly, I'd have a word with the staff about it. They should know, after all, how they prepared it.

			I think I have already mentioned in older threads:       
They ship DHL by default (which is actually a Deutsche Post), with pretty fast delivery (BD usually in 3-4 days), and customs is only 8% VAT (after they subtract German VAT automatically) and this you can pay to DHL online, in case you were not at home during delivery. Oh, and the most important - many items are much cheaper than bikester (which is a special rip off if you use their Swiss site unless there is some special sale).

190	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Buying Nutritional Supplements here in Switzerland	Solum	31,911	107	Location: Bern, Switzerland	03.03.2009, 13:04	" 
			
			Supplements are really expensive in Switzerland, even when bought on the internet. I first started like that after discovering how easy it was to order from the US, I haven't even thought of buying here again.    
My favorite shop is iHerb. They have a really excellent choice of products, great prices and best of all free shipping to Switzerland for orders over 60$ and 4$ otherwise! The trick is to keep the orders just over 60$. I've never paid taxes after more than 20 orders (66CHF is the official limit but iHerb generally indicates a lower value than what you have paid). But if you wan't to play it sure, you can pay the 4$ shipping and order less. And if you are in a hurry and want to be able to track your shipping, you get good prices with DHL (the free/4$ can be slow sometimes, but 100% reliable for me until now at least). You have to be even more careful with DHL with the customs, because they charge you higher fees for administrative costs than the Swiss post. For a 5$ discount on your first order, you can use the following code: PEK942.   
I've never had any problems with customs due to what I've ordered, it seems Switzerland is pretty easy on this. I don't think iHerb sells much that would be illegal here, which is not the case in Finland where even over 400IU of vitamin D would be stopped by customs (I luckily saw that before ordering for my parents there).   
As for protein, Country Life BioChem and Jarrow Formulas are great for Whey. They have a good selection of non-dairy protein too, but they mostly taste quite bad if not mixed in a smoothie or so. The best I have found is Nutribiotic Vanilla. Jarrow Formulas is ok for smoothies (especially putting a banana helps a lot with the flavor).   
Hope this helps!

			Hi,   
I've just moved to Bern (from the Westschweiz), and I'd like to play some Squash more or less regularly.    
I've been playing since a few years, but on and off, never in a club, my level is intermediate.   
I'd like to play preferably in the TST fitness (close to Kocherpark) but other squash places could also do. Evenings or weekends would be best for me, lunchtime also possible every now and then.   
See you on the court

Done a couple of half marathons this year (Ticino in Nov 2009, Paris in Mar 2010) but usually running between 5 and 10k for fitness.   
Half marathon time is about 1h 45m, 5k in about 20-25 min, 10k in 45-50.  Where do you usually run..?  I don't do much round Zug, normally I either head into Zurich or run at work (Pfäffikon)

			During the week - most golf courses other than a couple of high-end ones allow guests, you just have to pay the green fees around Fr.150 to Fr.180 mostly.   
Weekends - unless you are a guest of a member, you have no chance on private courses. However there are some public courses that are surprisingly well maintained, and for these ones you should be able to get a t-time as long as you book by Tuesday.   
If you have a car, you have quite a few good choices within 45 minutes drive.   
By train - Otelfingen as mentioned by Tartan.

			I use it after exercise too.  In the French region it's called Sel d'Angelterre and is sold by the kilo at pharmacies.   
The nice thing about it here is that it's ground finely rather than the cylindrical grains you normally find with Epsom Salt.  It dissolves much faster.

			Hi PeterJohn 
Welcome to the Forum. 
I'm sure you can imagine that many questions are asked over and over again.   
At first, many new users don't (as I didn't, for a long time) find the ""search"" function. 
It is at the top right-hand side of your screen.  There, if you enter ""football"" you'll get a whole list of threads.  Some are current, others will not be. Even so, you might have a look to which of those users who posted, back then, are still in Switzerland, and write a PM to them.   
The search function one way to find previous threads with similar topics. 
Another way is to scroll right down to the bottom of this screen, and the Forum will suggest  ""similar threads"" to you.   
Hope that helps you find some other football players.

			I agree with Assassin above. Don't assume you need knee support before examining the knee itself and running style. I ruptured my ligaments years ago and assumed i NEED knee support. After going to Cross Klinik they advised against any knee support to allow the muscles to compensate for the missing ligament. Have been running half-marathons and squatting with heavy weights since then with no knee pain.

			Hello all   
I would like to ask you if you are aware of any free/open basketball courts in Morges, other than the one where the football fields are located.   
It's mostly for going from time to time and spend a couple of hours.   
Thank you in advance

			Thought I would pop this up again. We are losing 5 players who are joining our seniors team this year. We got promoted from the 5th league to the 4th this year so in need of a few more lads to join us.   
We currently have about 8/9 expats in the team, I think 7 or so have all came from sending me a PM on here.   
My email is   or you can PM. Feel free to check out our website  , if you're looking at playing football in Basel drop me a line, our pre-season training will start again in a few weeks.    
Cheers, 
Dan

Is there a good gym in Brugg which has proper barbells and free weights?

			they also do that in interlaken beneath a bridge. there was a contest there a year or two ago. there are two types of corded river surfing, one with a ski rope (non-bungee) and the bungee type. the ski rope type usually attaches to a bridge and the surfer rides against a strong current. with the bungee type, the surfer stretches out the bungee and then uses the slingshot momentum to skim over the surface of the water.

But, if it's not making any grinding or other strange noises then it could quite possibly be a loose wire - at the switch or the incline motor.

For Fitnesspark, it depends ln whether you want to take classes or only use the gym. They usually have a campaign in the summer. The full package is 1,340.00. Expensive, but some complementary insurance cover part of it. I'm very happy with them, been there 2 years. It includes 5 sessions with a personal trainer to review your program. I've had one ok session and 2 excellent sessions.     
Active fitness is cheaper, I was there one year but then we moved and it wasn't convenient anymore. No PT included, they prepare a program at the beginning but it's kuch less personalised. But the one I went to was nice, however it got a bit more cramped at times than the Fitnesspark I go to now.     
Both offer daycare, but only in the morning on weekdays.

			What's the opinion of the experts on the forum .. I admin a buy/sell group and we allow the sale of tickets at face value.. However there's a bit of a debate as to them being still valid after sale..    
The UEFA rules say that the tickets can be sold at face value -- but that the original buyer must attend the match also - the new buyer would be their guest.    
Some media like the daily mail are saying that entrants to the matches will be ID checked..  Any official word on that?  I've been to countless international matches and never once showed ID at the stadium.

			Just watching the Strongman Event in Engelberg and have to say we are very impressed.   
The whole village has been brought to life with groups of (fancy dressed) mainly youngsters having the time of their lives.   
Think street parade but with action ! Kind of an early summer mating party !   
It looks great fun. I've watched them setting up all the obstacles this week and we are inspired to join in next year.......(Big talk lol!)   
The locals are buzzing too,we saw one party this morning with the dj deck , fire pit and catapult at the ready.   
Big party tonight 💃💃🍻   
Just wanted to give it out a shout out to English forum members for next year 😊

			I truly like Holmes Place, yes of course it is busy at peak hours, i.e. afterwork between 5:30 and 7:30 if the treadmills are taken there are many other machines to choose from while you wait probably no more than 5 minutes or so.  Nice in the summer with the open ceiling and rooftop deck, classes are great and facilities are great as well.  I recommend it.

			The  , which leads to Allmenalp, has been open since mid-may, it's classified K4 (K5 on a few meters). Finding the rest for a two-day tour should be very easy in that area.

I go running up and around Käferberg close to Oerlikon and Seebach and take advantage of the Parkoursvita course there as well, parallel bars, pull up bars etc for some strength training. It is a beautiful environment to exercise in, if anyone is looking for a partner for some extra stimulus or just to make their session more interesting, meet a friend etc, around that area, let me know.

You are probably better off using one of the forums dedicated to mountain bikes to explore your product choices.   
There are numerous ways to purchase bikes - direct online sales (Rose, Canyon, YT, and more in Germany and the UK, for instance), online sales (plenty of shops around), local bike shop.   
And then you have used bikes, e.g. on Ricardo.ch, tutti.ch, velomarkt.ch, traildevils.ch to list only the largest _Swiss_ sites.

I suppose there could be five digit PLZs so that's why the possibility might be there - or the programmer just made a mistake.

			Hi there,   
I want to go rollerskating at a rink here in Zurich, but am having difficulty finding information. Googling ""Rollschuhbahn Zurich"" has returned a number of results, but none of them have any information about opening hours. This evening after work, I went to Heuried sports centre (which according to   has a rink). Unfortunately by the time I got there (I guess about 9) it was closed, there was no information on the posters and the map only showed an ice-skating rink.    
I'll try going back, and going to the Steinkluppe rink, but if anyone happens to know some times when one of them (or another flat rink, ie not with jumps and stuff) is open, that would save me possibly fruitless traipsing about.   
Thanks!

			Or just walk and then hike. You can start that immediately and will be able do it much longer than running at first. It will burn a shitload of kcal if you are carrying around extra kg.  It will get your joints well used to jogging/running in due course.   
Yes you cannot just exercise your way to thin, diet is key.  But walking 60mins a day will burn 500kcal a day easily at your weight, and that is 1kg every two weeks... or 25kg in a year, or half your goal (as long as you control the kcal you eat).  That will be much healthier than cutting 500kcal extra from your food.   
As for heart risks of endurance running, unless you have an anomaly, that is risk for people who do massive mileages and/or aim for very fast times.   
But with 60kg to lose, please do that with medical supervision.

			If you have a mountain bike you really like it is possible to convert it to an e-bike, I'm sure there are good and and bad kits and it will probably be a case of you get what you pay for.   
Having done some investigation I am seriously considering   which are available in Switzerland though they only seem to be available via mail order and knowing my luck with mechanical jobs I'd rather have someone do the work for me.

Crossfit Basel specializes more than the others in powerlifting, strongman and oly.  Ramon the owner has current natural raw world record in his weight category, so they know their stuff.  They may offer an open gym type access if you are sufficiently experienced, more and more Crossfits are. Jackhammer CF definitely does open access, but is a bit outside of the city.

			You can go just across the border to Divonne-les-Bains... There's a very good golf course there, indeed. There are no requirements to play there and I don't think it is all that expensive. It's on the Lausanne motorway and is all of 15-20 minutes from Geneva.

I am an at home mom of 4 who currently plays squash twice a week in California.  We are relocating to Zurich in July and I'm looking for some new partners.  I am level 3.0/3.5 in the U.S., not sure if that helps.  Someone mentioned a list of all the clubs in Zurich... could you please post here?   
Thank you!

			I can recommend Winni's SalsaPassion school. It is near HB in Zurich:     
She is Japanese teacher, speaking German and English (funny pronunciation), but she is very friendly and fun. I was doing 4-5 months of dancing (I am in the mid-proficiency level).   
Also a friend of mine was going to Salsarica in the city centre, I have personally haven't tried it. It is a little bit cheaper than Winni. What i like about Winni's approach is that you change a partner every 10 minutes, so you will be dancing with many partners and understand better the feeling of the dance from it.

			Hey everyone!    
I was wondering if I could find someone that would like to help me with my long runs...by helping I mean making some company running or with the bike while I run for some Ks.    
Normally I run in Uster, wich is really pleasent and I love it.  
I have 2 halfs Marathons to train for before my Marathon wich will be in October.    
As an example This saturday I have 18k on my plan to run. I have done the distance already since I ran 5 halfs already....so is no big deal, but my marathon training will come up and I would like to know someone reliable to be a partner...Even if its cold or raining a bit, I need to put this miles on my shoes!    
In may 8th is Geneva Marathon, wich I am running the half.  
In Oct 16 is Amsterdam Marathon, wich I am running for the first time e full marathon, and before that, there will be really long runs and I don't really wanna do them alone. Like 34k   
I am a  32 years old woman.  
Thing is I am a slow runner...I run at a 6:45 min/km a Half Marathon.  
So I need someone that is willing to go WITH me.  
I normally stop a bit for water and gels evrey 8k, dependes a bit on strategy.    
Well, let me know if anyone is interested...it doesnt need to be the whole Mileage, but just to have someone part of the long run is already really cool by bike or running....    
I don't speak much during running...but I like chating a bit.... I dont listen to music either.    
Let me know your thoughts!       "	Posts: 67	Join Date: Jan 2015	Junior Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 46 Times in 13 Posts	no particular reputation at present

Been using MLB.TV for many years.  picture quality is very good, but what sucks on the replays is they leave in the blank space for commercials which is really annoying.  Best is to watch the game but stream the radio announcers so you have top quality commentary and have a small portal to the US in the advertisements - not that I advocate commercials but it's better than silence and a splash screen saying, ""Commercial Break in Progress.""

			i have 2 29ers and a monster surly 'cross set up. i drank the cool-aid years ago and haven't looked back. up front--you may not need to get a full suspension 29inch to enjoy big wheels. nice but not needed like you would need them on a 26. spend that extra cash on a nice fox fork for up front.    
those big wheels eat so much of the trail chatter that i prefer a 29er hardtail any day over a FS even if it was the same price. I'm also riding a Salsa El Mariachi full rigid single speed as my main steed so take my opinion for what it's worth. but a nice steel frame, good tires and a good fork up front will make it feel like you have a full suspension with all the pedaling efficiency. really!   
You have to test ride these puppies to see if it's your cup of tea. For the most part, to me at least, if you're on really tight trails with a lot of technical turns, etc.--26er might make more sense. they're more nimble some would say, all things considered. while 29er may be a bit sluggish or slow in turning, i also feel that because of those wheels, you choose routes differently and ride differently to a certain degree. as for roots, rocks, etc... it's night and day the roll you get with big wheels. climbing, you may lose traction if you're up front the whole time, but downhills are brilliant on 29ers! i don't see the disadvantages in the setup, just focus on the pros of big wheels.    
i personally wouldn't use the person's size argument for whether to go big wheels or not. i know people close to 7' tall who still like 26 wheels. I'm 5'8 and run big wheels without a problem. it's about the ride quality, not your size, although some would disagree i'm sure.    
ultimately, the best bike is the one you have most fun on--whether it's a schwinn beater or a fancy carbon frame. try one out, you may just have  the time of your life.

			As far as apps go GPS-Tracks.com is the best free app.  If you register (free) you can download and export all the gps tracks to your garmin or just overlay them on your phone.  And they have tons of tours here in CH, probably because its the most popular app here.  Every single Swiss that I've ever ridden with has this app including all my friends so they seem to have the biggest data base for trails.  All my expat friends tend to use different apps.  When in Rome.... 
Now regarding the Etrex 35,  its a small unit,  a bit smaller than I thought. But I didnt want a larger screen as that reduces the battery time. Plus I only need it when I'm on a new trail and need to know which way to go when I come to a fork in the trail.  Its not like I'm going to be looking at it as I'm riding.  Thats like texting and driving.     I find it easier to plan the routes in basecamp and just load it on to the device.  Its too cumbersome to do that on the device with the smaller screen.

354	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Mountain deaths in 1985 - what happened?	Gordon Comstock	839	3	Location: Geneva	17.03.2016, 19:10	   Its also important to consider how the SAC compiles the above statistics: Only people killed during sport are counted. If a person dies in an avalanche in a car while driving to a ski resort this accident isnt included. But if the same person dies one hour later in an avalanche sitting on a sledge drinking a Rivella  J  it makes it into the SAC numbers.       Therefore the SAC figures do just give an idea but should not be considered perfect. For mountain climbing they are probably fairly accurate while other alpine sports are not covered as well as those activities are not what SAC members are mainly interested in doing.

When I was looking for wheels I found a company called Spokesman in the UK. 
He has a list of wheels for sale on eBay but if you buy direct from him they will be 6% cheaper.        
These look pretty good? Novatec hubs and Stans Crest rims -  around 1595g for the 29er version. £305    "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			I'm a decent skier, not amazing, but there really isn't a piste I can't tackle. In CH, when I go off-piste, I always go with a guide. It is pricey, but the piece of mind is well worth it. Usually we go to a normal resort where we meet the guide, they'll usually take us to find powder within the range of the lifts, or with a short walk or trek. I find that most resorts know of the off piste within their area and do make an effort to have it relatively safe---but they always stress, they are not monitored.     
When I was younger riding back-country in BC and Alberta, I never imagined about getting a guide, the increased risk is that in Western Canada---if you make a bad turn, you could be lost for weeks! Here in CH it's not as likely to get lost :P

			Indoor climbing is a great one for kids. Most climbing places have a section where young children can just climb up without rops (only 2-3 metres high) and jump down onto a very thick mattress. 
If you kids are older, squash is a good one. 
Good luck

			I'm thinking about buying a new road bike, i.e. a Canyon Endurace in XL.   
I did the measurements according to the website and am very close to 2XL.   
Before purchasing, I'd be keen to test ride such a bike. I know that this is possible at Canyon in Koblenz, but I won't have a chance to go there for the next couple of months.   
Since Canyon bikes are quite common, I though I'd just ask    
Does anyone here in the forum have such a bike and would be happy for me test ride it (ideally in or close to Zurich)?   
Would be very much appreciated !

Ok, so that's really very small climbs, compared to Alpenbrevet. For example, Grimsel alone is 1500m of climbing, all be it over 26kms. For me, that's 1hr 30 to 2hrs. Nufenen is around 1100m over 13kms. Gotthard 12.5kms and 870m. Then to finish off, Susten is another long one, 20kms, 1200m.   
If you're going for gold, you really need to know if you can several long climbs in one day. But first, you really need to try just one climb aroudn 1000m. Or start off with something like Sattelegg,  with is 720m over 11.5kms from Siebnen.   
And as someone else said, 34x32!!

Do you know if in Baden area there are any voleyball or handball clubs for amateurs? I am intersted to do some sport and the mentioned ones are among my favourites. Is anybody willing to meet once or twice per week if we find a professional field, in order to play one of these sports? For example, in Obersiggenthal there is an outdoor court for voleyball but I don't have any information about its availability. But it seems to be always free and free of charge  .   
Let me know if you are intersted.   
Have a nice evening.

400	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	SHR hair removal in Zurich	miladn	555	0	Location: Zurich	16.02.2016, 12:19	" 
			
			Hi everybody,   
I have decided to try the SHR hair removal technique and have found a place in Zurich - Body Esthetic in Seefeld.    
I have done two sessions so far, and if the first one was painfree, the second one was really really painful - extreme burning sensations.    
Now I'm hesitating about going for a third one... this technique is normally supposed to be 100% pain free, and the technicians were surprised that it was hurting me.. Has anybody tried it? were did you go in ZH? and most importantly, was it efficient? after two sessions, a lot of hair has grown back (leg area), which also annoys me, as they said 4 sessions should be enough, and after 2 there are no big changes to be seen...   
They use the Alma lasers which seem to be the reference on the market..   
Thanks for sharing your experiences...

			The problem is, swimwear needs to be fairly tight, or once in the water it creates drag and may also sag or come loose causing an embarrassing situation.   
If she can't get off a one-piece, or deal with any fasteners, I don't think there is any other option....   
.... apart from a helper. I appreciate that people with disabilities want to be independent, but even Paralympians need help, Para-Triathletes have to be carried from the water and helped with their wetsuits. I think the focus should be on finding someone who can go regularly to the pool with her and help her, rather than finding a swimsuit.    
Maybe look into disability swimming/sport associations, I'm not sure what exists in Switzerland. Or maybe just find a volunteer.

Ideally once a week, any days but Sundays, from 7pm to 9pm. We could also see fees with private pitch owners happy to let us play football. My lack of German is not helping me much in my quest.

Yes I'm an active ski instructor, and I work exclusively with Prime Ski School in Engelberg. Prices are shown on our web site    
My wife and I both mainly do ski teaching at weekends, but at the moment I'm often able to teach during the week as well. We're both very keen to help struggling intermediate skiers such as yourself, and tend to follow a tried and tested method that helps progression from basic snowplough all the way through to beyond parallel.

			Not sure if this has copied properly from facebook as RTS archive.  This is how I grew up here in the 50s, when we had 'proper' winters- for  our family at Lac de Taillères/La Brévine- our sledges tied at the back  of my dad's 2CV on long ropes, and him driving full pelt on the lake  and making hand-break turns on the ice- brilliant fun    
Sadly neither lake open for skating now. It was minus 29C the other  night at La Brévine, but much too warm overall. In 87, the record cold  temperature at la B was recorded as minus 41.2 (or 41.8- can't remember)   
Arggh, it didn't copy. Perhaps someone clever like Adrian can pick it up from my FB page and copy- an old RTS documentary about what we used to get up to at lac de Joux and Lac des Taillères in Ye Goode Olde Days       "	Posts: 899	Join Date: Mar 2011	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 43 Times in 28 Posts	Thanked 796 Times in 347 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			I'm a member of the Uto section which is the bigger section, has a few thousands members. Lots of activities, but the number of participants is limited per activity, so there's some competition about getting a place on a tour.    
Most members are Swiss and German, a few internationals here and there. You will def. meet them, and will be awed by the Swiss Alpine training and fitness.    
For me understanding the Swiss German is not easy, and most tour leaders try to speak Hochdeutsch, but social chatter is going to be in Swiss German.    
Most tour are free, and the leader gets 5CHF / participant. You nee to pay for your own transport. Extra costs are specified in the tour description. This is Uto specific, other Sections have other structure.

The floodlight track there can actually be a real pain because it will mess up your night vision.

			Depends how it's transported.   
If he's cycling into Switzerland, which is what I did, (or driving even) then the shop should deal with the German stamp, otherwise it's stamped at the airport he takes it to in the UK.

Google   
Montgolfières Jura or Montgolfière Suisse, or France...   
or Ballonreisen or Ballonfahren Schweiz   
... or get in touch with THE Big man himself in Payerne, our famous Bertrand Picard - you never know your luck.

			HI Luis,   
I've been to Einsiedeln before and it's great for Cross Country skiing. I tried the classic style where you ski in the ready made tracks.   
I think if you click on this link:       
you can see live web cams on the individual tracks.  There's been snow today but not sure how much is sticking. More snow is due as well.    
You can also rent the gear for a season and then, if you like it, you can then buy it at the end of the season and then you know you like it and it fits. I was very happy with the service in this shop in Schindellegi which is not that far from Einsiedeln and they speak good English.        
Good luck!

			If Affoltern am Albis is not too far for you then there is a karate club there that is run by a Swiss German who speaks English. The classes are run in Swiss german but he will give the instructions in English until the child gets up to speed with the terms in SG. The class is mostly local kids but there are a few native English speakers attending.

With parking right by the lift and half price passes on one of the buy club thingies.. It's worth a try.

			Alright, I read a lot of reviews, asked everyone I know and finally bit the bullet and bought a Tacx Vortex Smart T2180.   
Its hard to get a lot out of reviews, as its usually by someone who bought it, so its not comparative with what else is out there (although some people will compare their new trainer to their old outdated one), and is often tainted by a lack of objectivity, their first impressions, or a negative impression which might be unrepresentative.   
Anyway, I have found a reviewer who stands out, he is called DC Rainmaker and is an IT guy who is also a very keen cyclist - extremely thorough and readable and comprehensive in his tests and reviews. He actually uses each piece of equipment before reviewing it, so it experience based. And unbiased.     
Apps. There is a sudden explosion of virtual reality apps now, as some like tacx have gone open source, and i found the choices boggling, but the top 3 - and each has free trial period - zwift, veloreality (vride) and kinomap.

All these years I've been using an old philips travel iron. Was fine on old narrow skis, but gets too cold about half way down my 122s and takes ages to heat back up  It's difficult to find a domestic iron these days that has a flat sole - mostly they've got holes for steam, which I always imagine would get quite messy if used for waxing.

Assuming people are fit, they should be able to snow plow turn & stop by the end of the first day, I really don't think Zermatt is out of the question.

			Why don't you take some private ski instruction with your son and learn with him? The tips that the instructor will give you can also be used on your 4 year old. If you get a good instructor they can give you a few pointers so you can safely ski with him aswell. You can also then use the information from a board to teach your son.   
ive done it many times

			I have a SUP and in case you have never seen one from up close: they are huge. Much bigger than a surf board and even bigger than a beginners windsurf board. Mine is over ten foot... and I think that's unpractical to carry around in Seefeld (but probably something a hipster might do...). Some people swear by the new inflatable type as you can carry it around in a backpack and I see the point, but for me personally does a board need to be a board. A good one with paddle will cost at least 1000 CHF... so better rent and try it out before you invest into a hobby you don't enjoy in the end.

They mention Davids Gym on that thread but I have never been there so cannot confirm what is there.   
If you want to try out Ghetto Gym or to see if Angel can offer training at Balboa which has the rack etc then you can contact [email removed]. Ghetto Gym and Balboa are more class based but I am sure they would let you just go there and train outside of class times if you coordinate it with them. Rather than big chains like Holmes Place or Silhouette these are independent places run by trainers themselves.   
Reebok Crossfit Club Zurich also has the concept of open gym where you can just go along and train by yourself if you are a member, or you can pay per session. And they have a lot of free weights etc. Their site is  .

			I see you're in Nyon. Should you ever fancy a go on a real velodrome you should definitely sign up for an initiation evening at the UCI velodrome in Aigle. It's heaps of fun.

The test pass should be your lift pass and unlimited changes of skis including fitting to your boots, so you can keep trying out different ones to see what suits. 90 is about right, last time I was down there at a ski test it was 40 for the test if you had your day pass already.

			You could also come to Hoch-Ybrig as there will be 4 native english speakers working there this season, and several dutch instructors whose English is almost as good as a native speaker.   
As she is a total beginner if she books lessons at Hoch-Ybrig then make sure she books them for the Oberiberg location (Ski lift Roggen) rather than at the Gondola station, as at Oberiberg we have a good progression of lifts starting with magic carpets and moving on to short and then longer T-bars.

			Yeah, people dont tend to sign up for the yoga on meetup. They just show up, there is around 4-6 people normally.   
Internations organises the hikes.   
What I am personally looking for is a good salsa class. Someone told me that there is some salsa at the Desperado on Thursday but I can seem to find the event anywhere ...     
PS.  
It is not sport related but last night I went to the english pub quiz at the cafe du cerf and it was so much fun. It is a nice place to meet people too.

Lenzerheide would be my suggestion. A very easy train/bus combination to get here and some great beginner terrain for both skiing and snowboarding. i would also suggest getting private lessons as you get the most out of your time and can progress as fast or slow as needed. It is even possible to get an instructor that teaches both sking and snowboarding.

So if you stick with it, you can fly right by Zürich, and land right on the edge of it.

			Hello,   
I will be moving from London to Zurich in February 2016 and am looking for an ice hockey club to join. I'm looking to join a team that plays organised games in a league. I currently play in a league in London and skate once a week. My ideal setup would be to join a team that trains once a week and plays one game on the weekends.   
I've been looking at the Swiss 3 Liga & 4 Liga teams as potential clubs to get in contact with. I was wondering if anyone on this forum has any experience playing in these leagues and how much of a time commitment it involves? Also, I'm assuming that these teams play each other in and around the Zurich area and don't travel across the country to play teams in other regions?   
Thanks for your help and I appreciate your replies!

Definitely nowhere it would make reasonable fun to go downhill.

			the keratin treatment is something done at the hairdresser.  They apply some gloop, straighten the hair, wash it, more gloop, more straightening, another wash.  errr.....does it show that I don't pay any attention    Takes a while and is boring.  But saves so much time at home, that I'm happy to pay the price in time and money one Saturday afternoon 3 times a year   
I've had it done twice now, the results last about 4-5 months on my hair, and make it way way easier to style.  I was sceptical  before trying, but  it's a must-do for me now.   
I have it done here (no connection other than as a customer)...the description is ""Keratin Glaettung"".  It does not use Formaldehyde.

We are looking for a dancesport partner for our 14 year old daughter, she is currently a Junior II B (163 cm) and has been dancing for 6 years. 
She is training with one of the best teachers in Switzerland, so it would be no problem if the partner has less experience or is even a beginner (but in this case we would appreciate if he were really interested and ready to work hard). 
The club is located close to Zurich, Hardbrücke.     
Some examples of dancesport copetition couples:     
Juveniles (up to 11 y.o.):         
Juniors (12-15):         
Adults:         
Looking forward to hearing from you.     
Cheers, 
Julia

			Sport is run through clubs and not through the schools. I suggest you contact (ice hockey would be the Kloten Flyers or ZSC, indoor hockey is called uni-hockey, land hockey hardly exists; not sure what the baseball club is called but it is most likely softball that is played) clubs directly - they will speak english -at ten years old most swiss sport is social rather than seriously competitive (the exception is skiing and soccer to some extent). 
Good luck

			If you want to lose weight you need to consume less calories than you burn... simple. Eat less, exercise more.   
There is no secret, it is just pure will power and effort. If Jessica Ennis can become World Champion a year after giving birth then any Mother can lose a few kilos.... if they want to.

			Hello everyone! 
Sorry if this has been posted already, but I am 15 years old and I live in Aargau. I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and I was hoping to take up powerlifting or working out with weights in general to become stronger for my sport. I live near Wohlen and Muri, and would like to find a good gym that is nearby. I have no experience with weights, but I like the look of powerlifting and calisthenics and believe they can help me get stronger.   
My other plan was to get a home multi-gym, but I believe it would be better to go to a gym and receive professional assistance instead of teaching myself everything, with limited equipment.   
Thank you!

			Right...so I live 10kms from central ZH, work next to HB, and want to cycle to work. I've got a bike, a secure place to leave it, and possibly even a discount from work to buy a new shiny road bike...but I don't have shower/changing facilities at work. I'd like to make the most out of the commute fitnesswise so I'm trying to find somewhere I can grab a shower after the morning ride in. Idealy I'd have somewhere cheap, open early and late, and within a short walk of HB.   
I've looked at the showers etc downstairs in HB, but to be honest I'd rather not use them...so my next thought was joining a cheap gym. I've had a look online, but as expected the memberships fees are high, and don't seem to have any ""lite"" membership options.   
Anyone have any ideas? Know a cheap gym?

			Hi there,   
I too hunted for good karate clubs but they are few and far between. 
In my opinion, this club looks like the best bet for Shotokan :        
It is quite a trek however to get there. 
I may look to offer a short training course here in Pfaeffikon SZ. 
It would depend on how many wish to try of course and finding a suitable dojo (hall) to rent. I'm no Bruce Lee or Enoeda but have trained with some great Karateka over the years. It would certainly give people a tremendous foundation for what traditional karate (JKA Shotokan) is all about.   
Let's see what the future brings! :-)   
Warm regards,   
Imanuel

			Thanks for the tip. I checked it out this morning. It's a nice place, I love the sawdust on the trail. I couldn't find a map of where the equipment is located and had to wander around a little bit during my sets. I'd prefer something closer but it's nice exercising in the forest.

			Hi! I started my Ng YAG laser hair removal process back in that states. I am looking to finish the treatment here in Switzerland since i'll be studying here until December.   
Is there any laser hair removal clinic in Switzerland that used the YAG? I prefer somewhere close to Lugano but the farthest I'm willing to go is Zurich.

If you want more specialised bike stuff at half of CH prices then I recommend wiggle.co.uk  - Free shipping to CH if you spend something like 40chf .. For example I needed new inner tubes - my 700c 18/25 was hard to find and cost 11chf here .. wiggle price 2.50 chf

They often give much better and more flexible offers than the bigger gym chains like Holmes Place. Boot camp, metafit, pilates, barre concept, and various other kinds of fitness classes are all possible as drop in classes at the providers I work with. I work with No Excuses (bootcamp and metafit), Ghetto Gym (many different types of fitness classes incl Cross Yoga and Ghetto Parcours), Strictly Fitter (Barre Concept and Pilates) and others. PM me if you want to know more. If you can find a group of people interested in doing Metafit classes on Tuesday or Thursday mornings from 7.30 to 8am at Hallenbad City then I can probably get you a good deal. The usual price is 20CHF (excluding Hallenbad entry) but if there are a group of you this might be able to be negotiated as the room has a massive capacity.

			Hello all, 
probably the nature of football-posts here is more ""casual"" and one-off, but I though I might share our efforts here as well, since I guess there could be some ex-pats interested! (FYI, I am only coaching there, not playing)   
It is in general greek-community based, but one could find swiss, italians etc in the team. Trainings are in a mix of languages (football doesn't need a language) and we can definitely offer a great ambiance, passion, a slight different environment from a regular ""swiss"" team.   
This year the clear aim is promotion, there is a serious new start going on, and we would welcome anyone that can play and take part in this!! Just as an appetizer, we won (with only 11 players and no player on the bench) our first game, cup match (one off), against a higher-division team. It is going to be a great year, and anyone to contribute would be very welcome!

			You don't have to give me any information at all. 
Let's say I replied because I've been involved in sport in Switzerland for a long time and I know that, at least in swimming, good coaches with experience and good referees are not easy to come by. I don't expect the situation in football and basketball is much better. A lot of work for very little money and a requirement for constant refresher courses is too much for many folk.   
By answering your post I brought it to the top of the page again and with luck someone who knows more about football and basketball organisations than I do will see your question and reply. 
OK?   
PS - if you think my first reply crappy I'm sorry, it wasn't meant to be. Maybe getting a bit 'short' my old age.

			Welcome Dani - where in Switzerland are you moving too?   
I'm a big Geocaching fan and used to go all the time in the UK.  I've found a couple over here but haven't had much chance so far this year as we seem to have spent most of the year moving house...  The Groundspeak forums are great but the Swiss sections are all in German or French as mentioned above.  Would be fine if my German lessons actually sank into my head...   
I still need to get the Swiss maps for my GPS unit, so far I'm just using my iphone which works well but I really need the walking level maps before I head up a mountain.   
Oh - and another thought - we released a couple of trackables in our nearest cache in the UK before we moved. They are meant to be racing their way to the cache nearest us here.  Could be fun to do something similar.  So far ours apear to have gone to Wales    
Let me know once you've moved if you fancy meeting up to cache.

			I'm thinking of doing next year as well as part of my training for Ironman Zurich.   
Do you have a tri-bike? I don't yet but it's meant to help save your legs for the run as well as making you faster on the bike leg.    
Btw, I did Ironman Austria a few weeks ago and that has a very fast bike course and a flat run course if you ever decide to do a full.   
The most important thing I've learnt is not to go to hard on the bike and eat and drink enough while I'm cycling to fuel my run.

			Aliceb,   
thanks for this update. By chance it happens to be useful for me now, since I'm about to join Activ Fitness in Dübendorf (where I work) and in Zürich (where I live).    
I'm looking for a nice gym I can reach during the day (I'd like to train around noon) and in which I could possibly speak some english..    
I was doubtful between Activ Fitness and Base Fit. Does anyone have experience on the second one?   
tnx

624	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Gym around Wollishofen needed only for 3 months	marceln	727	0	Location: Zurich	17.07.2015, 13:28	" 
			
			Hello,   
I am in Zurich Wollishofen for internship only until end of october 2015 (thus 3 and half months remaining) and I would really like to go to gym. I am still a student. I could register with ASVZ students club for 300CHF/year and go to the gym in ASVZ Polyterrasse but I would prefer something cheaper and closer to Wollishofen. 300CH is certainly a great deal but since I am here only for 3 months more , it is not such a good deal for me.   
The gym should be located ideally near Wollishofen or between Wollishofen and Rueschlikon (my internship is in Ruschlikon).    
For me, the monthly membership would be best, or single entrance payments.   
Right now I have found Pitch gym in Adliswil ( ) - it is close to my workplace. But still quite expensive. And I do not know if they allow monthly subscriptions. Also now basefit.ch have a specieal offer 30CHF for 30 days to try the gym.

We are considering the ""Tour du Mout Ruan"" but have not been able to find information on how technical / difficult the trail is and whether it is a good choice for our group.  Does anyone have information/experience on this trail and whether it is common for groups such as ours, two experienced hikers and an athetlic 14 year old?     
Thanks for your responses.

Does anyone know which tracks allow training for field events, jumps in particular (that is, have pits/beds out for use on a regular basis)? I am particularly looking for a place to do pole vault sessions. 
I have seen the track at Sportanlage Sihlhölzli has pole vault facilities but which clubs train there and can I join one just for the summer in order to use their equipment? 
Or does anyone know any other clubs/tracks in Zurich where I could do jumps sessions, even if I have to pay to join the club? 
Thanks!

637	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Bike Rack Rental In Zurich?	velocio c	508	0	Location: USA	12.07.2015, 21:49	" 
			
			First, this is wonderful site and glad I found it!    
My wife and I are flying from the USA to and returning from Zurich in the August/September time frame. We've become quite fond of Switzerland and have hiked in several regions on the last three trips and then spend some time relaxing in Zurich. However, this time it's different. We are packing our road bikes and bringing them over. I've got all the logistical issues solved except the bike rack for the rental car. Does anyone know of a way to rent a auto bike rack in or around Zurich?   
We found a great bike shop in Wallisellen to help with bike setup and repacking but the only rack rental they could offer is the type that mounts to a tow hitch on the car but rentals do not come equipped with a hitch. Also, Europcar does not offer bike racks. To fit our budget, I guess the best type would be one that would hang from the rear hatch of the car (VW Golf Station Wagon).   
Thanks for any suggestions !

639	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Anyone going (or been) to the Omega European Masters in Crans Montana?	nanners	702	6	Location: Zurich	03.07.2015, 07:59	"    No, we always drove, I you like driving you can go over the Furka pass from Zurich, about 4 hours.  You could have an early start, enjoy the golf, start the drive home and stop over somewhere nice on the way back, breakfast, little hike maybe...   
Dont worry about the 0730 start... players go out in reverse order.  The top of the leaderboard will only tee off at about 12:00, and finish at about 16:00.  Of course after 12 there are less and less flights out on the course, and the popular groups will have largish followings.

			You can try SportFabrik, which is in Regensdorf, ZH.  If you are lucky you can find some  stuff with up to 70% off the RRP (recommended retail price).  They have a wide range of brands from NorthFace to Mammut, to McKinley.   
Another shop which I say has some pretty cool stuff is Sherpa Outdoors.     
And check Aldi/ Lidl, if you are looking for a basic jacket - they have some pretty decent ones.    
But as ever, best time to have a great deal is when they do a sale.   
Have fun shopping

			In terms of training diversity then crossfit is probably the best bet from what I have seen, machine's are only good for some types of isolation exercises for hypertrophy, wouldn't really sign up to a machine based gym. Crossfit also has a free gym at times so worth checking out if you want to train your own routine rather than following a class based routine.

			The weather is hot, moon is full and there is not a cloud in the forecast till Monday.... Sounds like perfect weather for a night Hike!    
Has anyone done something like that in the past? Any suggestions for routes? Somewhere where one could climb up, watch the sunset, come down... Preferably with the same start/end point (would most likely need to be done with a car) Preferably no more than 5-9km of hiking and <400m of elevation gain? Within 1 hour drive from Zurich.   
The only thing that comes to my mind is Uetliberg and trails around Amden... But Uetliberg is a bit too crowded, the trails around Amden are a bit long and I am not sure what the Sunset would be like around there.

			Hi all, 
Lets make a list of all the public places where one can spend a Sunday  tanning/swimming generally enjoying themselves during this heatwave.   
the park on the right side of the lake 
Arboretum, Mythenquai, 8002 Zürich, Switzerland 
Really nice to tan, however very crowded. Also access to the lake for swimming is limited.   
Seebad Utoquai 
The left hand side of the lake. Less crowded, and a great swimming spot.    
The river close to Hardbrucke 
Kloster Fahr-Weg, 8037 Zürich, Switzerland 
Great tanning spot. 2 bus stations away from Hardbrucke. Swimming not encouraged due to strong current of the river.     
Those are my contributions. As I explore Zurich I will add more...

659	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Learing to shoot	Dack Rambo	1,521	4	Location: Switzerland	20.04.2015, 11:10	" 
			
			Your best bet is probably to join a shooting club, there are oodles in Zurich city, probably more than one close to you.    is grouped by shooting range on city ground, try google or tel.search.ch (phone register) if URL is missing.    
Finding a club with an english speaking instructur/tutor shouldn't be that much of a problem, and if you understand some german you should be fine. I'd expect for clubs even today to provide the training weapon (probably can't be taken home though) if needed. Back in the day I did a training on the swiss army rifle as a 15-year  old, the gun was provided by the shooting club.   
The bonus: 
You also get to know people from your area with at least  one  common  interest, a good starting point if you want to find  friends. Chances are many pro-gun people are also pro-US.   
I think you need a C residence permit in order to get a license to buy a gun, club members will know with certainty. Being a shooting club member, perhaps with a couple/few years  membership, will definitely help getting a purchase license as club board  members can be expected to act as reference, and probably will do so  gladly.    
I would expect for you to be admissible in most clubs, though perhaps not all, each club defines its own admission rules.   explicitly says every person above 10 year age can join, while another says the kantonal military commission must give the OK for foreigners (which I'd guess is just a formality if you have C permit and a clean criminal record). Additional conditions, if any, are on the level of ""should be a good sport and must be careful with the weapon"".

			Hello,   
Interested in share a flat in Laax for the full winter season?    
In case somebody is planning to go snowboard/ski regularly, that might be a good deal.   
Send me a PM if interested and I can share more details.

			I will do my best to avoid the tunnels and take the small country side/mountain roads instead. I have already been cycling between Lugano and Como but Milano to Como and Lugano to Zürich tracks are not so familiar to be. But yeah, maybe it would be a good idea to take a train from Milano to a bit more north to avoid the worst traffic...

			Your Liestal link says from juniors to elderly, so clearly, they assume adults as well.   
That said,  so far is that your either take things ""seriously"" or not at all. So facilities   to be geared towards clubs rather than people wanting to use facilities independently.   
This is based on my children joining clubs where very quickly you are expected (as a child) to train every week and in between sessions etc etc. There's no sense of doing it for ""fun"".   
I would suggest you contact the Leistal guys - they will be able to point you in the right direction.

			Hi there,  
I have posted here a while back about Ballet classes in Lausanne but am still searching. 
Does anyone know of any in and around the lausanne area? Have previously danced for 15+ years so I am desperate to find somewhere!  
Similary for bikram yoga, the sports centre at UNIL offers yoga classes but ideally I would like to find a bikram/hot yoga centre.   
Many thanks.

A brand i swear by is Gore bikewear, long lasting and not just for the bike. Lastly your most important purchase if not done yet is padded pants. Believe me worth every penny!!

If not that then are there pickup games (like someone renting a sheet of ice in an arena) that are around at this time of year.  I'm assuming places like St. Jakob arena maintain their indoor ice sheet year round but please let me know if I am mistaken.   
Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

			For anyone who was looking to buy a Body Pass which is supposed to give you a 50% discount on first visit to beauty and wellness establishments, DON'T.        
Many of their ""partners"" impose random restrictions on the use. That's not outlined to you when you purchase the card. Seems like the partnership establishment is not working well.    
For example, only day time usage (no weekend or evening), some services are excluded (services you request), or they are no longer partners in the current year even though they are still listed.    
Save yourself the trouble don't buy it.

			This is propably the best website I've found for plotting biking and running routes.  . You can simply plan your own route, or let it do it for you and is particularly good if you want to plan a pre-determined distance. You can then save (with a login) or download the route to load onto your favourite GPS device.  
The auto-planner is not so good for XC routes, which is where the self-planning comes in nicely. I used to use Bikemap.net, but this is far superior I reckon.

			It seems that the remarks about lengthening a snorkel were meant as a joke.  
Having occasionally seen the results of a 'joke' which was taken seriously, I'm not too happy about that sort of thing...  
I suppose on a forum where the readers are adults one might assume that 'everyone knows that'  but I wouldn't mind betting that they don't. ""I'm sure I read somewhere that you can lengthen a snorkel with tubing...""   
The Paraplegikerzentrum has quite a few patients who dived head first into water which was nothing like deep enough and 'everyone knows' that one should check the depth.    
Have a good weekend.

			Hi All,   
I moved here with hubby and family at the end of April and am now finding my feet a bit more.  My son (8 in July) is now in local swiss school but I would like to find him a football club, he wasn't part of one when we were in the UK as he only decided shortly before we moved that like his friends he'd like to do it.  The link on the 2013 post regarding this doesn't work anymore - does anyone know of clubs in the Basel region for kids?  Ideally weekly and not just holidaytime.   
Also I am keen to get my 2 yr old daughter (3 in Sept) into ballet or gymnastics classes as an activity for her, she attended nursery when we were in the UK and once we move to our permanent apartment in Riehen I will be getting her into daycare of some sort for one day  a week.   
It's not necessary for them to be english, but might be nice.   
Apologies if I've been blind and there are already posts on these, I couldn't find them.   
thanks 
Roz

Can anyone recommend an English-speaking physiotherapist/sport therapist/experienced masseuse in Geneva?

Maybe even carbon one: 
go to   , use find function on the page for ""Kross level B9"" 
Something along those lines.   
Forget the hybrid type (they call it crosstrekking here) it will never be able to compare. These are budged allrounders, with more comfortable geometry and thin tyres for road use.(Perfect for people with budget under a grand though)   
And dont mix cyclocross and crosstrekking, these are two diferent things.

Only having to attach 1 magnet is already an improvement with respect to other cadence units. But having to buy the Garmin unit is def a no go       Bingo - I had read precisely the same review, that's why I said to myself ""why not?"". 'Cos at the end of the day a stride / pedometer sensor triggers the cadence with the in built accelerometer (i.e. the measure of the vertical movement) so the pedaling motion in theory should be enough to trigger the count of a ""step"".

			You might be able to rent a bike from these guys.    
They are in Pully (east side of Lausanne). You can see the test bikes (they may rent them?). You will need to tell them your height. You can write the email in English as the owner is USA and the chief mechanic is UK.   
You should also have a helmet (bring with you?). People here do not mountain bike without one.   
For the rest, you will hopefully get some suggestions from others, the search function or one of the tourist sites.

About the atmosphere....this is a personal thing. I liked the place because it's quiet, no ""muscles/gymsuits'show"", professional trainers, spacious and basic. Another one is Kieser (never tried there) but they are specialized with machine training  , there is one on Monbijoustrasse, easily accessible from area Inselspital.

715	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Online Rhein gauge at Basel	tormund	767	0	Location: Basel, CH	14.05.2015, 17:39	" 
			
			Ok, so I spent a fair amount of time searching to find this information so I thought I may as well share it.     
The best gauge near Basel is at Rheinhalle:       
This is above the Birsfelden dam, so it may not be reflective of water levels in Basel for swimming/paddling. However, it provides water flows in-addition to water level. Note that the Swiss decided to report water level as meters above sea level, which is very helpful considering how close Switzerland is to the sea. If you click the ""Station Data"" tap you will see the reference height of the gauge, you have to subtract that value from the graphs to get the actual water level. Unfortunately they didn't provide a red-line or other guide for the eye on the graphs so it's relatively tricky to guess the water velocity.     
The gauge in Basel-proper has just water level:       
and the water temperature (and quality) is availabe from the Weil station on the German border:       
For completeness, here is the Birs, which is a little class 2- whitewater (wildwasser) river that dumps into the Rhein.         
Note that the Birs is polluted and not suitable for swimming. It has some little drops and hydraulics as it nears the Rhein, and when it's in flood it has some fairly beefy surf waves.     
I haven't found anything for Huningue yet.

			I was a member of ActivFitness for a year. It's a chain with locations randomly scattered all over Switzerland, and you can access any gym without any additional cost. Price-wise it's one of the cheaper chains, but the facilities were always clean and well maintained. An Abo for a year is around 750 CHF (if I remember correctly), which is a few hundred cheaper than MigroFit or ActiveFitness, for example.    
I used the one in Oerlikon a few times. It's in the new UBS building, on the two top floors. Never too full, and a rather OK selection of machines. I'm sure you can do a test training for free the first time to see if it fits your personal program    
I have nothing negative to say about ActivFitness and would still be using it but it doesn't make logistically sense anymore since I moved and no longer have one easily accessible between home and work.    
Good luck!

			I get a lot of bike stuff from Wiggle, including a couple of bikes over the last few years. They deduct UK VAT at their end, but you are responsible for Swiss VAT when it arrives here plus import charges. This is normally 8% of the cost, plus about CHF20-40 for the courriers charges. If it is a small parcel it comes with the Post, and you have to be the tax on delivery. Larger parcels come with DHL and you get a bill from them a week or so after delivery.   
Given the crazy shop prices here, as long as you are spending roughly GBP 150 or more you should be comfortably saving money.

748	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Running shoes advice	gypsyspears	11,145	52	Location: Lausanne	09.10.2009, 13:54	"    I've also had a great experience with the Montrail Mountain Masochist. I tested out at least 8 brands/models for UTMB before arriving on the Masochists. Excellent grip in all conditions and very comfortable even late in a long run. For muddy and winter runs, I've enjoyed the La Sportiva Crosslite (great lugs and stability). I'm not so fond of the Crosslites for really long runs though. I ordered my Montrails from the States at shoes.com. Even with the shipping charges, the price was half what it was when I could find the shoes in Switzerland or Chamonix.       I've tried out various slip-on spikes and landed on Kahtoola's micro spikes.   Excellent for snow and ice running. They never fall off (unlike all the others I tested) and they are perfect for variable winter conditions (excellent grip without getting in the way of running). I throw them in my backpack for winter runs along the Albis Ridge and just pull them on once I hit the snowy/icy parts of the trail. The only downside is that you can't just head out the door in them (to run on the non-snowy bits on the way to the hills). With some of the other slip-on spikes (more designed for walking to the train than winter trail running) and some of the shoes with built-in spikes, you could actually run on them even when not on the snow. It's never been a problem for me though because I do all my winter trail runs with a backpack.

			Hi   
There is a meetup group for mtb with members all around Zurich. They organise very regular rides all around the area.         
I also mtb in the area of Greifensee and Pfannensteil very regularly and would be happy to hook up for a few rides either evenings or weekends. I too am pretty slow. Just let me know.

I'm no expert on the various brands but they seemed to have quite a large range in the big Edeka (E-Center) there.

			Ricardo - you have to be signed up to buy or sell. 
If you're not already, it takes a couple of days, as confirmation code comes by snail-mail.   
I'm not sure if you can filter results within a certain distance of your location, or whether you just have check manually.   
You can organise according to price (cheapest) or time remaining for bidding.      "	Posts: 9	Join Date: Aug 2011	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Most gyms have a creche the Jelmoli Holmes Place is the exception rather than the rule. The Holmes Place in Oberrieden also has a creche but that is outside of Zurich. Very popular with families.  
The Migros Fitnesspark has a creche at Glattpark, Münstergasse, Regensdorf und Milandia.  
Also Activ Fitness has a creche but limited opening hours for that. Here is the info for the one at Stauffacher   and this for the one at Tiefenbrunnen  
Generally look for ""Kinderhort"" or ""Kinderbetreuung"".

759	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Climbing / Bouldering anyone?	stripeyboot	3,390	23	Location: wipkigen	10.03.2014, 13:16	" 
			
			Hello Adamskii,   
In term of bouldering there is Minimum ( ) which is really nice although a bit crowded during the week.    
Route climbing wise there are multiple around zurich depending on how you plan to get there: 
* Gaswerk in Schlieren:  
* Milandia close to Greiffensee:  
* Kraftreaktor in Lenzburg:  
* 6a+ a newish climbing gym close to Winterthur:  
* Griffig in Uster (also pretty new):    
So far my preference goes to Griffig as it's about as far as the other ones from my apartment and it's much cheaper (27CHF regular price or 19CHF before 6PM)   
I go regularly to Minimum twice a week on Monday and either thursday or friday with some friends so feel free to join us.    
I'm also looking for a regular partner to go route climbing outdoor on the weekends (or indoor if the weather is not nice). I climb around 6a/6b+ indoor and about 6a outdoor but whatever grade is fine.

			Hello all   
I was meant to be running a SOLA leg this year, with a nice team from my university, but I have managed to mess up dates and will actually be back in the UK on the date...    
If any keen runners want a nice day out on Saturday 9th of May, please get in contact! I was down to do one of the longer stretches, 14km (there are two of these, but I'm not sure which one I was actually down for). The team is very nice and not at all competitive, so would be totally happy to have anyone do it, regardless of what time you run. I think there'll be a barbecue afterwards as well.   
I did it last year, and had a great time - it's a great atmosphere, with what feels like the whole city dressed in running gear with numbers attached to them, and the longer stretches are lovely runs through woodland. (Details  ). I'm gutted to be missing it! Although some time in English pubs will help make up for it, I'm sure...   
Please let me know if you're interested, or knows someone who might be.   
Cheers 
RadBaron

			First of all, congratulation on your amazing weight loss- this is fantastic.   
I've recently been discussing a Low carb diet with UK friends, which seems quite different to Adkins. So I am simply asking questions to try and get my head around all the different issues. Due to pre-existing conditions, ketosis is totally unsuitable for us. The diet discussed does not advise using substitute low carb version of normally high carb foods (like bread) but :       
An LCHF diet means you eat fewer  carbohydrates and a higher proportion of fat. Most importantly you  minimize your intake of sugar and starches. You can eat other delicious  foods until you are satisfied – and still lose weight. 
A number of recent high-quality   and to control your  . And that’s just the beginning.       Eat when you’re hungry until you are satisfied. It’s that simple.   You do  need to count calories or weigh your food. And just forget about industrially produced low fat products.

He is the owner and a cut will set you back 150CHF but it is worth it as he really is excellent.

			That's good news! 
You can get to Riehen by Tram number 6 - Stop Bettingerstrasse 
Then take bus 32 (just across the street, behind the corner. 
Stop at Wenkenhof.   
What time would be more convenient for you?  
Morning or afternoon?

It is a different kind of website, with tailored software specifically for finding people of specific interests.   
Many of the meetup.com groups form and then advertise their events on englishforum.ch   
I am an average Zurich expat and not affiliated with them in either way.   
I am just impressed with the number of specialized Zurich groups this group management site has formed within that last year.   
I also have been a loyal and ardent fan of  englishforum for a number of years.

			I joined Sihouette in Bellevue over a month ago and am very satisfied. There's no wait time for machines, even during evenings on weekdays. The machines are well maintained, there's enough room for floor exercises, and you're never waiting for a particular set of free weights. They also have a sauna room that I have yet to try out, and more than enough showers, hair dryers, etc. The only downside is that the gym opens laterish in the morning, so I had to say goodbye to my early morning workout plans. Overall, for the price you're paying the services and amenities are pretty good.

			Hi there,   
I've been looking for/through various fly fishing clubs and basically there are two types. The clubs that organise events and those that don't. The one that organise trips go to interesting places (well Austria, I suppose if you'r into the sound of music it's OK) but judging by the photos none are under the age of 75. I like to travel a bit to fish but the idea of sitting down to a schnitzel pomfrites and a halbe mineral mit with my grandmother does not appeal to me.   
Is there anyone here who would be interested in forming/joining a Swiss Trout Bum club? Call yourself a man? PM me.

we will be moving to Zuerich in the summer. Our daughter would like to continue playing volleyball. She has been part of  a Gold Medal Square  
Club in California. Is there something that is equivalent to that method of playing in Zuerich? 
Also, does anyone know how much the club fees are for a 13 years old girl?    
Last, are there any sand tournaments that are being offered for a 13 years old? Is there a mailing list to find a partner?  
Any good camps over the summer?  
Thanks!

			I have found no ""lost & found"" forum, so am posting this here as a ""best guess"", but am happy to move it if required.   
On Monday evening, 16th March, at 18:15, I unintentionally left my ski boots on the Zürich-bound train platform (platform 2) at Unterterzen, the SBB train stop that serves Flumserberg. I went back yesterday in the hope of retrieving them, but they were no longer on the platform, nor had they been handed to the ticket office at the bottom of the Flumserberg ski lift, nor to the Heidiland office next to the SBB station. I filed a lost property report with SBB, but nothing has been handed in as yet.   
The boots were Salomon brand, approximately 2008 model, size approximately 44-45 (or at least, that is my normal shoe size), burgundy red and black in colour, with four clasps, a velcro strap above the uppermost clasp, a carrying handle on the top of each tongue, and moulding foot inserts with the word Comfort fit at the top. I do not know the exact model number, but the attached photo is of a very similar boot.   
I broke my hand a couple of months ago, and had only just been able to start skiing again, so any assistance that anyone might be able to give me in getting my boots back to their rightful owner would be very much appreciated.   
Many thanks, 
Martin Reed

			Hi All,   
I have been doing freeletics for the last 3 months and, so far, I have to say I am quite ok with it.   
Not strictly sticked to 4 trainings a week and, although I spent Christmas with 3 trainings a week, due movings and personal stuff I stopped for a month, and in February I restarted.   
I have to say I have a good experience and I almost achieved the goals I set for myself. I purchased the app and the year coach, and so far I think I am ok with it. Only problem I can find is time, but trainings are tough, which is good.   
However, I was considering buying the Nutrition Guide and I wanted to ask if someone has already tried it and if it is worth the investement, as they advertise it is linked to your coach...   
In advance, thanks a lot. 
Francisco

Freeriding conditions aren't so hot at the moment and the snow is pretty wind affected up high and frozen, tracked out crud everywhere else. Unless you are willing to put in the effort and skin to something untouched, a guide would be better served at a different moment. On piste should be decent if the crowds stay away.   
If you do venture off-piste, watch out for crevasses. A teenager spent 6 hours wedged in a crevasse (16 meters down) on the Steinberg yesterday before he could be extracted.

Thursday through Sunday have times organized and the weather looks great for outdoor hockey on Zamboni'd ice!   
After Sunday, the rinks will be shut down and torn down for renovation. I believe only one outdoor rink will be replaced and another indoor---when they will be done? Well I'm pretty sure there will be no hockey there next season, maybe the one after.

			I definitely suggest Karrer in Laufen. If you like the ski/snowboard or the shoe, you can buy them next year. They discount the rent price from the sales price.       in Laufen

			Hi Paul   
Thanks for the advice. I have several options/locations in the Bahamas which I need to look in to, and also a recommendation for the Seychelles. I have been told that now (ish) till March is good in the Seychelles, this time is very difficult for me because it is the season for the Lodge in Brasil so it will probably have to be the Bahamas or somewhere else. Take a look at this link, these are some of the options I have and I know the bloke as he is an agent for the Lodge I work for    
It would be good to meet up for fishing chat, are you ever round Zug/Zurich way?   
woops, we seem to have gone off topic a bit here. I'll send you a PM   
Cheers   
Jon

			I recently bought Kurt Kinetic here:   Delivery was fast (DHL), minus VAT, no complaints.    
I also used bikester.ch for some small things, no complaints either.    
Tempo Sport in Thalwil is nice, I actually bought a trainer tire for indoor trainings there, BUT everything is much more expensive than Cycle Basar. And products in their shop are more expensive that online. For example, training tire: Cycle Basar - EUR 22 (-VAT), Tempo Sport Online - CHF40, Tempo Sport Shop - CFH50.

848	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Best place to buy skis Zurich	finkle	5,800	22	Location: Zurich	21.02.2013, 19:19	" 
			
			Hi BKN, 
Regarding your question about hiring, this means that you can rent the skis for the entire season, for example, pick it up from the shop in December and use them the full season and return around March/April (exact dates depend on the shop I guess).  From the place where I hired my skis last season (Pfister Sport), it was great because I could also swap the skis during the hire period if I wanted to try something different, or if they didn't fit properly etc.  Given how much trouble I've had with ski boots in the past, this was great! 
Good luck! 
Nadja

			The Fitness park in Malley also allows to pay per session, or buy a 10 entrance ticket. But it is quite expensive (around 30.-/ticket), as it gives you access to all the equipment/swimming pool/classes/sauna/hammam.   
However the quality is excellent: it is big and clean.

Ace1	788	0	Location: Engelberg & near Basel	19.02.2015, 12:29	       Crans-Montana  Tourisme &amp; Congrès (CMTC) proposes a spectacular marketing campaign  this winter: an exceptional offer made possible thanks to the hoteliers  of the station, several apartment rental agencies, the  Crans-Montana-Aminona (CMA) ski lifts society, and the Association of  Six Communes of Crans-Montana (ACCM).     This offer, intended to boost the end of the winter season 2015, has been baptised    «Ski for free».  It is intended as an invitation to reserve a stay in one of the partner hotels, and receive as a present a ski pass. An offer valid from 15 March to 19 April 2015 for every stay in one of the partner hotels.    The  principle is simple: one night spent in one of the partner hotels  entitles the hotel guest to one day of skiing offered. The offer is  subject to a skiable area being open.

859	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Great Bike Shop to take advantage of the CHF/Euro situation (for shiny gear!)	philh	817	0	Location: Altendorf SZ	18.02.2015, 00:25	" 
			
			Hi All,    
Last summer something quite unique (for me at least) happened to me.  
I woke up on Saturday morning in mid-June to find that my cellar (and we live in a big apartment block) had been emptied of all the high end bikes.    
Some other people lost bits and pieces, I lost a top of the line BMC racing bike, and two custom Intense MTBs. I'd only just finished putting the final touched to the BMC and then it was away....Never to be seen again.    
Anyway, long story short, it took till September to finally get the insurance money and then the road season was pretty much over.    
However now with the weather warming up again, I visited my local BMC shop - Squadra Mondo in Altendorf, (who have been excellent and very supportive during the insurance process - they gave me a loaner in June, which I still have) and ordered a new road bike.    
Ok, we are now coming to the point of this thread (and hence the reason for the title).    
To finish it off nicely, I wanted a set of carbon wheels for my new BMC, and have decided on Enve 6.7s.  
Checking around the web for prices and availability, there were lots available in the US (they are handmade in Utah) and the UK (I previously bought them from Evans), plus a handful in Germany. Thinking a European warranty may be easier, I looked into a few of the German ones.    
All much of a muchness, apart from Toms Bike Corner ( ), which caught my eye....most items in stock, or available quickly and very competitive prices. I also noticed a remark - call for the latest day prices on these items....so I did. 
I dropped Tom a mail with my requirements (and a couple of questions on hub choices). I received a response with an hour with some clear answers. Based on this, I made my choice and asked about the special price of the day. Well Tom looked after me, and I ended up paying below their website cost, and not just for that he gave me discount on a bunch of other components as well.    
Fast and friendly service (he actually wrote me back in English and dealt in that language too) great selection of products and fantastic prices. What more can you ask for?   
Prices before the CHF/Euro thing here were competitive, now they are simply great. I couldnt recommend Toms place enough. If youre thinking of buying some shiny carbon (well actually most of it is matt.) or other toys, its worth dropping an email to Tom for a price. Im very glad I did.    
Just to make this very clear, Im not getting anything out of saying good things about Tom, just looking to help out fellow cyclists/bikers with a great find I came across.   
Now I just need to wait for my parts to arrive!   "	Posts: 128	Join Date: Feb 2009	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 21 Times in 15 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Before this one, I had an rcx3 from Polar which I lost  . I had used the rcx3 for over 9 months and it was pretty simple and easy to use.    
The box comes with  
- The rcx5 watch 
- WearLink+ Hybrid strap for monitoring the heart rate 
- G5 gps with a strap holder 
- Datalink USB stick   
With the datalink you can upload your workouts on the polarfitness website. With the GPS you can check out the map of your run or bike route. It also gives a gazillion other info about heart rate, calories etc etc. I am just a beginner in this area and primarily bought the device to keep a track of progress and motivate myself. It is just cool to see your run on a map and how hard or easy it was for you to do.

			I'm looking to branch out from skiing (intermediate level) and try this new fangled snowboarding malarkey.    
It seems the schools are setup for multiday group lessons, which doesn't fit in with my view of trying boarding just for a day on the weekend. I've checked out  
Leysin, Haute Nendaz, Lelex, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Les Bugnenets and Crozet and cant find much suitable.   
At most, there is a Sunday supplement at some places for getting your snow legs in, but they seem to only offer it as a part of the multiday lessons, rather than stand alone.   
Any suggestions for places to check out?

876	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Rooftop Fitness Basel	JoMiFa	1,014	1	Location: Basel Stadt	05.01.2015, 12:15	"    Yes, I tried out a class a couple of weeks ago.   
Yes, very intensive, burned almost 1000 calories and ached for several days after. The class I did  involved a cirucit of excercise repeated several times, similar to a crossfit WorkOut if the Day (WOD). Some body weight excersises, some TRX, use of medicine balls etc. In the gym they also have kettlebells chin up bars and some other bits of equipment. Group size was 10. Instructor managed to make sure people were doing the exercises properly. Class done in hoch deutsch but instructor was happy to explain things in English.   
Can't remember the exact prices but the subscriptions were a lot cheaper than cross fit. I think about 1100CHF for 3 classes per week. Also did packages for 6 and 4 months and for packages for 1 lesson per week. Also blocks of lessons available.

			Hi there,   
I'm looking for Ski/Snowboard beginners that would like to go practice to Aztmannig during the next weekends. If you want to take snowboard lessons we can share also that, otherwise we can simply share the company! The place is 1 hour by public transports from Zurich HB, Green/Blue slopes and a Beginner's slope. I will be there this Sunday for sure. PM or Reply this post if you wanna join   
Cheers

Recently got a job in Geneva which I start in January. And what's the first thing I do? Look for a local footy team. This long chain of messages don't look very promising but if anyone knows of any weekly footy going on in Geneva, full teams or 6 a side, let me know!

881	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Looking for a climbing instructor in Zürich	emilycc	1,266	10	Location: Zürich	19.09.2014, 11:40	" 
			
			Thanks to everyone who gave feedback or sent me a message!  For some reason, I'm suddenly getting a lot of replies to this rather old post, so I thought I should give an update.  Since my original post, I have managed to learn the basics of climbing, through some combination of a) bouldering with more experienced friends, b) messing around a lot by myself with bouldering, and c) waiting until a trip back home to the U.S., where I could learn to climb on ropes with friends who have done a lot of climbing.  I'm now bouldering very regularly (though not climbing on ropes so much, since the gyms aren't as convenient for me) and it's going really well.  So, while it's of course great to meet other people who enjoy climbing, I think I can officially rescind my previous request for an ""instructor"".

			just go and take a day or 2 lesson. after that you will be good to go.  
Im picking up skiing again after 15 years on the board. skiing def is more fun on piste, board off piste. whilst you learn you will only be on the baby piste so you really have to put in an effort to hurt yourself.    
you can get good gloves with a sort of wrist guard in them, or just a big velcro, that should do. Ive done some nasty falls at some serious speeds and never broke a thing (did knock the wind out of myself several times  .   
Protection is only gonna hinder your movement. Just wear the helmet if you want ( i dont) , dont wear jeans, and dont use the pink lipbalm.

			In case you are close to this Fitness Center I recommend all classes given by Andrea W.  She is just an excellent trainer having both an excellent charisma that motivates people and a strong power which makes you work and get results like never before.   
She was my trainer in two Gyms in Zürich and sadly she needed to move to Bülach.   
Do not miss the chance if you are close by.

			If you mean me DB, I am now retired from gainful exmployment, which is why I have enough spare time to Mod on here.    
To learn to swim you first need water - sounds logical but as far as I know there isn't a public pool in Pfäffikon except Alpamare, which, for learning to swim isn't really an option.   
How are are you prepared to travel? Check out the 'Swimming in Switzerland Sticky' and take a look at the  with the pools. Select the region around Horgen, then you can click on the links to the individual pools to get more info. The pool in Wädenswil has a couple of teachers, who give courses and probably also private lessons - unless things have changed a lot in the past couple of years, one of them certainly speaks English.   
If you don't find anything to suit you there, you can go back to the map and click on the pools on the other side of the Lake.    
Hope you find what you are looking for.

			Don't skimp on the shoes. I know you said you'd buy nice ones later if you liked it, but in the wrong shoes, you very much won't like it. Get assessed and get the right shoes - they won't cost much more, but your body will thank you for it. When I wear the wrong ones, I hurt after just a kilometer or two; put on the right ones and I run for 90 minutes pain free.

Hey Rob !   
Where did u move to ?  Closer to Zurich or Bern ?   
This Moss lake or ""Moossee"" just next to Schönbuhl is a nice lake, i went for a walk around it with my son the other week.  Trouble is with the nice weather there's a lot of boats and swimmers in there .  Should be alright closer to autumn and spring though. 
One whole side of the lake is completely covered by reeds and could do with a bit pruning, but the road side has a few nice swims.   
I just need to get tackled up again, i sold all my gear in England b4 i moved out here 14 years ago, Doh....   Think i'll order in the UK and get it sent out here, cos the tackle shops that i've seen, seem to only stock fly and match fising gear, the up side being of course that there can't be too many carpies out here as of yet !!

I have moved to cardio since, religiously, and walk a few miles every day to be fit, keep weight on and most of all to get rid of energy, Pilates  were too static for me after those years. But I do keep up part of the Pilates routine for my lower back, abs and flexibility, it's fab!

I'm tempted by Parabolica and Ascari.  But there was lots of action on those first bends........

903	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cycling blow out - possible causes?	guest	3,729	69	null	null	" 
			
			Rim overheating. I just read up on it on a bike forum. I had no idea it could cause a blow-out  - apparently rim gets so hot it softens/melts the tyre or bead and if its a loose fitting rim, the tyre can pop off and tube blows, presumably high pressure is needed too. However, the forum contributors also emphasized it is very rare and even if you *try* to make it happen over a very long steep descent - e.g. by braking hard for a few kms down a 15% grade  - even then, its hard to get a pop.   
I think you just had a faulty tyre or a foreign object.   
I haven't had a puncture in the last 9,000 kms of road cycling.   
Since you're getting a new tyre, try kevlar reinforced tyre     
or buy the kevlar strips you can put between yhe tube and tyre.      "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			My boyfriend always raves about    it has only high end tackle gear and lures but at very competitive prices. Much better prices than any other shop in switzerland (again for high end tackel) . It's mainly an online shop with a store in rudolfstetten in Aargau, but I think one has to arrange to meet there as it's not always open. On the other hand most new customers get a personal delivery and he  comes with alot of stuff to show.

906	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Tandem skiing - anyone done it?	ecb	1,334	8	Location: out n about - it's summer!	21.11.2014, 16:03	"    He did have an hour on skis - his instructor did have experience of autistic children and struck up a surprisingly good rapport with him. Unfortunately our son does have physical disabilities - notably dyspraxia - which although isn't terribly visible,  became much more apparent when placed on skis.  Whilst he gave it a good go, it was clear that any progress on skis would be very slow this year and is something perhaps best left a little while.  Afterall, he only learnt to kick a ball a couple of months ago so skiing is a little adventurous ..   
But you allow me to highlight that it is a common misconception (and one that I laboured under) that this sort of skiing is only for those with physical disabilities - the instructor was very keen to stress what a wonderful experience it is for all people who otherwise would not be able readily and easily get up on a pair of skis on their feet.  The pure adrenalin rush and accompanying stream of speech (my son usually only speaks very little and in pre-learned set phrases) from our son is testament to the unexpected side effects of such an experience.  As he said to me when I tucked in him bed at the end of the weekend ""a lot of fun"" Never heard him say that before   "	Posts: 2,146	Join Date: Jun 2010	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 8 Times in 8 Posts	Thanked 3,445 Times in 1,288 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			I love my horse-racing and the backdrop at St Moritz looks fantastic from the homepage. I'm taking the missus on Sunday 15th Feb - the lucky gal - and we're looking forward to having a blast.    
Besides wrapping up warm and suitable footwear, are there any other handy tips for us?    
e.g.  
- will the train out of Zurich be jam-packed? worth leaving 1-2 hrs beforehand? 
- is there anywhere out there good for brekkie or is it an idea to have a big brekkie before going?  
- is it worth taking a chunk of cash vs. the debit card?  
- is the odds system or placing a bet process different to the UK?  
- what's the big race of the day? 
- is there a nice restaurant or bar we can go to afterwards, so to let the crowds heading for the train die down?   
Thanks,

			Any proper sports shop that does ski rental and/or servicing should be able to do this for you. Some folk I know have just downloaded the appropriate template and done it themselves, but I really wouldn't recommend it. I do lots of my own ski servicing, but this is one job I leave to the professionals.

			Terrible spelling in these posts... it is Le Châble and coming from Lausanne is your best option.    
I can confirm that Haute Nendaz is not the way to go. If you want that part of the mountain take Siviez as others have said. Starting at Siviez is actually quite nice. I can also confirm not to take the Wall back down as I have climbed back up that piste last year. My friend continued down but he is still a bit white around the nose... Actually it is not even a piste. it is a liaison

920	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	escape the grey	PTKate	5,072	34	Location: St Cergue, canton Vaud, CH	07.01.2009, 16:46	"    To be honest I am not a god enough skier to tell the difference in the lateral stiffness of a boot. The flexion/extension stiffness can be adjusted in my boot, but the soft option is only for walking not for skiing. I think to really tell the differences on this kind of stuff you need to be someone who can drive an edge very hard at high speed. The majority of skiers who I see on the pistes (me included) tend to release the ski to slow themselves down as they come out of the turn.    
Yes I have touring bindings too, but would have gotten a hybrid boot regardless of touring bindings are not. I am not a world cup downhill skier and don't intend to be so absolute stiffness at a cost to comfort does not interest me. It doesn't make sense to get this set up unless you intend to tour (and then you also need alot more safety equipment too). The bindings and boots are more expensive for touring, so it would make it a very expensive option if you were just going ride on the piste.

Come and join the fun.      Alessandro, I regularly fly in/around central Switz. and occasionally do XC in central Switz, Wallis, and Lower Engadine. My old school also organises regular meet-ups for qualified pilots (have look at:  ). If this does not fill your sail, then there are several clubs in N.Switz. (see:  )

Unfortunately the indoor track at Oerlikon (Hallenstadion) is the only indoor track in Zurich that I'm aware of. It is not a permanent track and the stadium is used for other type of events and shows.  I don't think it is ever open to the general public for daily training purposes.      
Sadly i think your best bet (other than moving to a place like Grenchen) would be the outdoor track which is just across the road or even better to get an IDT (in door trainer).

			When hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing, skiing (especially off piste) - please remember that you are invading the native wild animals' space. You are the danger, not the other way around.   
Switzerland's many hiking trails allow us a closer relationship with nature than we might find elsewhere - we are very fortunate to have this opportunity. But we must approach nature with the respect it deserves, and it is incumbent on each of us to ensure that we disturb these glorious animals' habitat as little as possible.    
If you hike the mountains, learn how to respond correctly to the animals you might encounter. Here's what the 'Respekt deine Grenzen' website, has to say about encountering Steinbock:

			The Tanzhaus Zurich offers a 'youth' dance course:       
This is suitable for young people (teens) who have not danced before, or are not 'ballerinas'. Our daughter has just started in the group and it is very focused on enjoyment of dance and learning to move their bodies.   
For anyone who has a teen with a rapidly changing body shape, who perhaps lacks self-esteem or confidence, or who is creative but not ballerina shaped... this could be a really great introduction to the enjoyment of dance, without over-emphasis on physical appearance or the perfectionism of ballet. (My sister was a ballerina so I know how kids who do not fit the classic body-shape lose out once they hit puberty).    
They do movement, rhythm, of course exercise, but also the teacher has organised for the group to see a play as well as go to a dance performance.    
Our daughter joined as a social outlet as well as to build her self-esteem. The group has only a few members and they need to grow. There are at least two kids who are fluent in English but the group is German-speaking.   
If you want to ask any questions, let me know. We travel from Adliswil with her and organise to pick her up each week so that she does not travel on the train alone - we would be happy to coordinate this if there are any teens around Adliswil/Leimbach/Sihlcity who want to join the group.

			so anyway i went to basefit and bought a day pass for 20chf. because of their 400chf per year intro offer and the fact it's still only about 500chf now, and because 20chf is about half the price of the next cheapest gym day pass i could find, i was expecting a no-frills gym. and maybe it is a no frills gym, but that zurich has again just raised the bar when it comes to what is considered frills. then did this for 10-12 reps and ate a banana    
because basically, basefit is brilliant. and of all the gyms i've been to, it's probably the best. i had a free trial at holmes place once like i was ever actually considering it, and that was as totally utopia as any place where you can ride the elevator in a big white dressing gown can be (totally), but holmes place doesn't really count because actually i remember sitting in the splash pool there thinking that if i ever joined the place i'd probably just get fat(ter) unless i could burn the calories from drinking smuggled-in bailey's-cream miniatures by going up and down in the elevator in a dressing gown afterwards.   
basefit is big, spacious, modern, and packed with equipment; there are four or five of each of the most popular machines. there are also plenty of other machines with more obscure missions such as the one that works your lower back and that no-one uses without coming across as a right pelvis thruster. there's also a free weights section, a unit of men in and around that section who occasionally make across-the-forest noises, and best of all a group exercise room where a new class starts every 20 minutes and is taken by a retroly-leotarded avatar on a wall screen.    
anyway: recommend.   
and free juice as well.

			The bike shop on the grounds of Rote Fabrik is really good. We've taken our bikes there and have been very happy with the work they've done. I'm not sure how extensive their supplies are but I assume they can order ... I think they are called Rad Los. And they speak English, in case that is important for you.

The unix px is nice because it has a longer/flatter stroke, more like an elliptical trainer.

Good studios in Enge are: Vero Pilates, Pilates Zone and Martha's studio. I suppose it is one of them.    
I can imagine if there is already one class of 3 people then the studio will be interested to form another group?   
 It would be great if you could post details of this studio so people who are interested can contact them directly and ask about possibility of joining similar group to yours as this one i can imagine is full already.

			It is actually quite disturbing that nowadays helthy lifestyle is not seen as a norm. Particularly, when people do not drink alcohol whatsoever for various reasons, ""normal"" people question their sanity. Literally. Because there must be something wrong with them.   
Also, I have been to a helth dining conference recently and learned that apparently average Swiss spend less that 10% of their earnings on food. Not to mention the killer salt consumption.

The professional musher was always in the lead, as he should be, minimizing the risk. But still, the dogs got quite fast, and you do need quite some strength and also the appropriate weight to do it. If your daughter is still a child rather than a young adult, you should go for something where she can just sit in the sled.

I once tried a very much toned down course once, but  cocked up a jump and ended up skinning my knee and a couple of other good bloods.   
The problem seems to be, regarding the jumps, is that there no no real way to gradually gain experience ...... entry speed, landing, etc - there's either just small bumps, or fully committed jumps, nothing in between to graduate up.

If you know any gym that has childcare also in the afternoon, any advice would be much appreciated

980	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Night cycling	ThomashG	851	5	Location: Vevey	13.10.2014, 22:46	" 
			
			I pretty much only cycle during the night after work (especially these days, since the sun goes down before 5).   
It's getting a bit too chilly sometimes for night rides, so I switch to running but if I have a bit more time I take my bike for a quick spin. During winter/autumn I usually limit myself to going to Chexbres (from Lausanne) while taking any hill possible on the way.    
I pretty much go on solo rides, so I wouldn't mind a bit of a company. But I tend to go a bit earlier (around 7:30 - 8pm) and I'm on a road bike.  
If you are still interested maybe we could figure out something.   
I know some people who do downhill during the night on mountain bikes, but that's a bit too hardcore for me.

			Hi Markarina   
I have used it; it is great as you do not need to pass by the cashier anymore. And with the same card you can ski in Davos, in Andermatt, Gstaad, Crans, Saas Fee etc. No need to buy each time a new ski pass.    
I have subscribed for the premium user model, what they also call automatic payment (post payment). So I keep the skioo card in my jacket, and on the website I have linked it with my credit card. I then go skiing and just get an SMS afterwards that they will charge my credit card.  
They are doing it the way that only the time is charged for what I was skiing. If I was there for half a day, then I am charged just half a day.   
The best is to try it out. After the first day, you will not want to miss it. 
Cheers   
Patrick from Zurich

But there are other possibilities.... come and sail with us! We are always on the look-out for new members with whom to share our passion.     We are a friendly,multi-national, multi-lingual group who own and sail International 12-foot Dinghies. Designed in England by an amateur designer over 100 years ago these boats became the first small boats to be granted international status and the first small boats to be raced in the Olympic Games. Against all the odds the design has outlived many more modern designs and large fleets are to be found cruising and racing in Italy and the Netherlands.      Being just 12 feet long our boats are easily towed and stored and there are now 15-20 of them around Lake Geneva. During the summer we take part in many of the local regattas (Régate des Vieux Bateaux, Classique de Sciez, Fête des Canots etc. etc.) and also meet for cruises followed by picnics and barbecues. We also welcome visiting boats from other countries for events such as the Swiss 12' Dinghy Championships which were held at Vevey (2013) and Morges (2014).      Visit   for more information or email me at   to arrange a sail.

			Hi, 
I got   and it was delivered by post.  
I suppose you can also find it in a physical store if it's more convenient for you! SportXX offers only this weighted Hula Hoop judging from their website, but I recall having seen normal ones at  , in case you are looking for this kind.     
Oops, just realised you want hula hoops for kids! I'll leave what I have written in case it's useful for an adult (the PITA is to find adult-sized hula hoops  ). Cheap ones too, hmmm. I'd suggest you try Athleticum and any chinese shop you can find (do they exist here?).   There's also   and  but I don't know if you have enough time to get it delivered.

			It took me ages to find this place and It's so nice that I want to share it. It should have been obvious - I was looking for a small affordable health club with an indoor pool, sauna and steam room, somewhere quiet to relax. They had exactly what I was looking for at the Hilton Hotel near the SBB. The staff are very friendly, speak English and the health club is open everyday too since it resides in a hotel. They offer an excellent massage service aswell. They offer daily or annual fee options. Enjoy!

1002	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Ski Touring / Freeride -Central and Eastern Switzerland	khawk22	658	0	Location: Zug	02.11.2014, 09:55	" 
			
			Hello all,   
I'm a beginner ski-tourer who just got kitted up last season.  I've done a few small 'side country' ascents and have done some powder and crud descents on touring skis.  I'm looking for other beginner or early-intermediate ski-tourers who would like to partner up for a few day-tours this winter.   
I am a very experienced alpine skier who is comfortable skiing in all conditions from black pistes to mixed-snow off piste (crud, powder, etc.).  I have limited experience with skinning / ascents on touring skis but I didn't have any problems the few times I have tried.  I would say I have a medium-level of fitness overall, but I can endure long-hard days on occasion.   
I also have a set-up which is more free-ride oriented -meant for short ascents to access free ride areas near resorts.  If this is more your style I'm also interested in hearing from you!   
I live on the border between Zug and Zurich so the Central Switzerland area is most convenient for me.  I don't mind travelling a bit further though to access the Bernese Oberland or Graubunden/Engadin, etc.  I usually make a few weekend trips to the western part of Switzerland each winter and tend to go to Chamonix when I have a week or more available.   
So, anyone out there keen to join me?  At this point I'm eager to get a bit deeper into the back-country but need a partner or small group!  I'll see if I get any bites here before looking to sign up for guided group tours.   
Cheers,   
KH

			Fine. I did it. You have your bloody poem. I  . Unintentionally, the meter and rhythm sort of changed in the second half, and are less 'Raven-ish'. I guess just think of it as prose instead of a poem.    
To anyone contemplating doing the Engadiner, it really is quite the event, and I'm highly recommend doing it once just for the experience. Yes, it is very crowded, but it is stunningly beautiful, unbelievably well-organized (there is  purpose-built train stop at the finish line!) and, like all sporting events, there is a great feeling of accomplishment in finishing it. So long as you go in expecting it to be a bit of a squeeze, and just relax and enjoy the experience instead of aiming for a blistering time, you'll have a blast. (Oh, and I'd recommend some sort of training program too.  )     To anyone contemplating writing a race report inspired by literature, I would highly recommend that you pick something simple. It's a bit hard to bring everything into a poem. (For example, what rhymes with s-Chanf?)   
'Poe'-etically yours,

			My son does gymnastics through the school, not at a competitive level, but they do have a competitive league which you invited to join if you are good. At that stage they practise twice a week so about 3-4 hours total. Costs are very low here in our village (50CHF/year which is actually just to cover the insurance). It may be very different at the level your daughter is competing at.  Good luck finding something!

Back here in the UK I've been running the Park Run (almost) every Saturday and it's been brilliant for me so I'm looking for something similar over there.   
I've looked at the Basel Dragons running club but I'm not that dedicated to running, I've still not managed to persuade my self that running is something I do for fun so paying such a large membership fee isn't going to work for me.     
I'm also after a gym over there, ideally one where I don't have to sign a long contract, again, I'm not that dedicated. I'll mostly be doing free weights and wouldn't really bother with any gym classes.   
Any suggestions?

			I have done a raketlon event here in Luzern and would have continued to do other events had I not injured my shoulder.   
Event was fun. Atmosphere was pretty good for a Swiss sport event (I find some are a bit too serious here in Switzerland and forget a little about the fun, although I'm a competitive person this is the feeling I have).   
If I was to provide any advice it we be not to underestimate the stamina element. Whether you are winning or losing matches you do end up playing a lot due to the way the event is run.   
Unfortunately I'm concentrating on other sports at the moment and am a bit far away from you to train together.  Perhaps in a year or 2 I'll get back into it and we can meet up at an event.    
Anyway ,I thought it was a good format and was pleased I found out about it so would recommend it to others who are considering it.

			As everyone has covered the creams already, I'll give my 2 Rappen on makeup. Less is more after 30.    
Use tinted moisturizer with SPF more than foundation, and go sparing on the rest of the makeup. If you can, buy sample sizes in a couple of colors and see what works best before you spend a lot. If you're like me, you need to change shade slightly between summer and winter.    
Only line your upper lid, not your lower one. This helps your eyes appear more open. Avoid waterproof mascara, because it's harder to remove and you'll tend to scrub the heck out of your eyes to get it off. Don't wax your upper lip if you can help it. If you smoke, stop.   
If you don't like my advice, just listen to edot. She looks half her age. No joke. Whatever she does is the ticket to looking like a teenager forever.   "	Posts: 40	Join Date: Nov 2012	Junior Member	Groaned at 21 Times in 7 Posts	Thanked 80 Times in 26 Posts	considered knowledgeable

I am a Silhouette member since 3 years, and as far as I know - you can't transfer your membership. 
However, as you may have noticed - there has been a re-branding going on, because they have been purchased by some company.

			Hey, good to hear that.   
What I mean is that when you walk along the shores of Lake Murten, Neuchatel, or Thunersee, there are countless cats standing in various clubs and marinas. But on a windy day, you go out on the lake, and there are four, maybe five actually sailing. This is true for all the sailboats. There are plenty of boats, but so few actually sail.    
But anyway, PM me if you are looking for crew. I have two kids and am not always available, but if you let me know ahead of time, I would love to come down and sail with you. I am in Tafers, just outside of Fribourg, so quite close to you. I am happy to come down in September or October, as the winds pick up.

			Hi 
I am looking for a lady or ladies to do some activities several days a week in Geneva   
I am a female in my early 30s, due to my studies it has been a while that I have not been so active and I d like to get back to the track of doing some sport. However, I think it is easier to do it with someone as it makes me motivated and it is more fun. 
I am interested in jogging/ walking/ biking/ zumba/ swimming etc.    
As I live in Vesenaz  I prefer someone who lives in the area from Eaux-vives to Hermance or in city centre.(but at the end I am flexible).    
Looking forward to hearing from you

This is a message for CosmicSpunk. I saw your kind offer to someone regarding the Let`s Go gym. I`m staying in Montreux for the next 2 1/2 weeks learning French as the ESL colleage and would like to still keep fit. Yes, I know I could go running by the lake but I actually hate running and prefer doing gym classes where they tell you what to do and you can`t escape. I was hoping you would be able to introduce me to the gym also to get a free month. I know it`s a bit cheeky of me to ask! I can take you out for a drink to say thanks.

			I must say that there is no shortage of pools in Switzerland which is a good thing. Generally much cleaner and more plentiful than in the UK. Price is usually reasonable to. My only gripe is that they don't have very work-friendly opening hours - I guess I was spoilt in Australia with some pools opening at 5am and closing at 10pm, here 9am is a common opening time, and 8 or 9pm a common closing time.

			Not too sure about Basel, but Wetzikon has pickup hockey usually throughout the summer (presently a break till the 9th of September).     
The 2nd week of October, the pickup season starts in Zurich, usually a pretty good turnout Thursday through Sundays at Heuried for example.   
It is outdoor as well, which can be pretty interesting when if the weather gets up near the 20s :P

I saw this post a bit late since it's almost end of summer. 
Have you done wakeboarding in Geneva this year? 
Can you recommend a place? 
I live in Lausanne like eddierourk and ddads and would be willing to join some time.

1110	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Learning to Paraglide	jerallie	3,015	16	Location: Goldiwil	03.08.2011, 20:12	"    I have been flying for 4 years now. I trained in Switzerland and have nothing but good things to say about the Swiss system.    
Switzerland has the highest per-capita participation and as a result has a well oiled training regime, highly proficient paragliding association, and enjoys a good reputation as a respectable sport. Importantly, paragliding is not considered a high risk sport by insurers and has no impact on heath or life insurance.   
The training process is essentially: 
(1) Basic training 2-4 days. This gives you a knowledge of the equipment and its safe use. This is the only time you might have to put real energy into walking up a hill (unless you chose to!) 
(2) High flight training. This takes you through a structured course under radio supervision, and ensures you have mastered normal and abnormal flight situations. 
At this point you will have to pass a theory and and practical exam. Thereafter you are able to fly unsupervised essentially anywhere in the world, as long as you adhere to local air laws and have the appropriate insurances.   
For a list of schools have a look at the paragliding association website:  . I would urge you to research the school you choose thoroughly; how well the instructors can communicate instructions to you (in fluent English), how fun they are to train with, and their track record of getting students through the exams first time will be facts you will have to live with for 3-6 months!

I am also interested on playing golf. I am 47 years old and I play since I was 8. I have very good handicap.

I live in the area of Zurich but I can play in another canton, no problem. I am the whole August on holidays so I am flexible.   
Hope to contact me.

The only thing worth mentioning is that you'll encounter some planet models of the Planetenweg if you follow the Gratstrasse. (A member posted a photo of the sun model in the gallery section.) Other than that - forest, hikers, bikers, ""Hündeler"" (dog owners)... more or less the same, everywhere.

The Sommerweg will end at the bottom of the Gletscherlift and from then on up, you just walk up the ski piste (just a cat track at this time of the year) to the Klein Titlis. Don't wander too far off the piste as there are some crevasses. If you are going next weekend as part of the Bergtrophy Titlis, just follow the groups and you'll be fine. Have fun.

I am Chris, new in Zurich and in the forum, and I love to play squash and this is my 2nd post about Squash.     
Does anyone know any squash ladder / tournament in Zurich where simply you can join and play with other  people? I called 9 squash courts in Zurich and all said no besides one which said maybe around October.     
The problem I am facing I am new in the city and   find people to play with - surely I cant be the only one facing this problem      
Any other idea on how to find people to play squash with? I posted a message on this board but I only got 1 reply.      
Thank you and looking forward to your replies!

I tend to agree that the back brake is slightly less effective, and have always been told that rear = slow down, front = stop (more or less). It does worry me though that applying the rear brake has virtually no effect unlesss the front is applied in tandem and although it is fine to control a descent, I'd be in a world of trouble if I had to pull an emergency stop  .

I'll be moving to Geneva in a couple of months and I'm looking for running routes. I see there's a trail in the Centre Sportif de Vessy.   
It looks like a good trail, with the trees and the river, but there are no public transports around and I'm wondering if this would be a safe place to run in the evenings, specially during winter days?   
Is it safe to run anywhere in Geneva in the evenings? Are there dangerous neighborhoods?   
Thank you!

			That'd be great! Thank you! I found one - Verein Zucher Wasserspringer, but am not sure they'd take her as she does not speak German. I wrote to them, waiting for the reply. Is your son at the nationals now, in Knoxville, TN? My little one is there.   Thank you again!

			Reima is a good brand but can be pricy-I find them to be excellent for gloves as the hands will be the first body part to get wet or cold, so it is important to keep 'em dry!.  I have found the H&M also to be of very good quality.  Sportxx also has good selection and prices.

			Hey there,   
For what it's worth and depending on how tall you are, I'd rent out my roadie for the weekend. I hope the mods don't think this is an ad. I'd call it a friendly offer.   
54"" Giant TCR double with a 8-speed cassette, Ultegra kit.   
Just PM me if interested.

			Hi,   
I hold a license and jump in Beromünster.    
It´s a really nice flight up, where you see Luzern and the mountains. Great dropzone where also spectators can have a cup of coffee, icecream etc. while waiting.   
I think Interlaken is also quite wellknown.

			For proper Downhill: 
Best is Portes du Soleil, and Chatel in France is a good access point. Very popular so can get busy including lots of Brits coming over from the UK. Morgins is also a good access point, and my preferred area, with some great downhill tracks (mainly reds). 
Verbier is a nice spot, has far fewer runs than places like Chatel, but rarely gets busy. I like it a lot, but haven't been for a couple of years. 
For something that has a longer season (May to October), Leysin is worth a look.

			Thanks for your advice and the link.    
I greatly enjoy fitness walking and never stated otherwise...  Which is why I was surprised at my indifference to NW at the trial session but am keeping an open mind on it, hence this thread.    
I found the sticks easy to put on and hold but found them fiddly due to constantly wanting to bend my arms whilst holding them like when running and jogging.  The instructor kept me in check on that whenever I did this, however!   
I agree, it's important the instructor is personable, has a good sense of humour and is fun to be around.  She was, so no complaints there!       "	null	null	null	null	null	null
1144	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Urgent: Anyone can rent a road-bike for two days?	travelingheel	630	0	Location: zurich	22.07.2014, 18:21	" 
			
			Hello there!   
As I will be attending my first triathlon this weekend in Zurich, I (quite stupidly) was being careless and clueless about the whole preparation phase prior to the Short-Distance Triathlon.   
Suffice to say, I'm desperately seeking a road cycle to rent for the day prior to the race and on race day itself (Saturday, July 26).   
I've called most bike rental shops in Zurich but all bikes have already been rented out for the race, which leaves me a little in distress. Granted it's my own fault for being so disorganized, but I'd like to find an alternative solution, possibly as soon as possible.    
If anyone here would have a road cycle they would be willing to rent out for the next two days please reach out to me.     
I'm female, 163 cm (thats 5'4) and do not own road cycling shoes, I will be wearing my normal running shoes, so obviously no fancy pedal gimmicks.      
I'd be very grateful if anyone would know someone or have any advice on what other alternative solutions in such first world crisis.    
Thanks! And lovely day to you all.    
Cheers, 
TH

1151	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Riding in Binningen?	BethS	477	0	Location: NC, USA	17.07.2014, 14:42	" 
			
			Hi, just moved to Basel a month ago and am looking for a riding program to get started in. PSZ Binningen (  ) (sorry, would have embedded that link but none of the icons in the toolbar seem to be working) looks promising and we'll be moving from temporary accommodations to Binningen in Septemeber, so it would be convenient as well.     
I don't quite know how to get the ball rolling, though, as my German is very basic at the moment. Would anyone out there be interested in checking out the lesson program with me? I'd be up for a group lesson or semi-private if anyone's looking for someone to ride with.     
I should say that this is my third time living in Basel. Last time I rode at a big stable out in Baetwil (this was over 11 years ago), and it's possible I may end up there again, but Binningen is so much closer. Going through horse withdrawal (had to sell my horse before moving here), so hopefully I can get something arranged soon.

I guess actual martial arts that include less than average contact, or do not absolulely require contact [such as Judo, Aikido, various jujitsu], would be    
Certain federations of karate, which I am not familiar with.     
or;   
Capoeira is really cool, has less contact [you want to avoid the spinning feet, etc], but is going to require either a lot of youthful energy, or time to develop muscles most people don't think about or use.  I have seen a lot of it, but never trained.   
A great thing about exposure to these sorts of practices is that it is an opportunity where you have to approach, or even leave certain envelopes in one's life, such as physical contact.  Even non-contact karate may involve correction from the instructor, where they simply move the student into the structure they are trying to teach them, rotating limbs, joints into position xyz.   
One art I would like to see here in CH is Schwingen   "	Posts: 147	Join Date: Apr 2007	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 71 Times in 27 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Hey there - try Base Bike in Lamone    
Thing is, Lugano isn't Whistler. There is no major ""scene"" hence most retailers only are there to sell, not rent. 
In Coldrerio (20 minutes by car) you could try to give the guys at Wild Horses (  a call. 
They seem to have plenty of 2nd hand DH / FR rigs there so maybe, who knows?   
OTOH if you want to go someplace serious like Davos / Klosters, Madesimo or Livigno where they have DH/FR runs then you probably will find more rental opportunities.   
Ride safe & enjoy

Just saying because if your skill level is still relatively low (not criticizing you, everybody goes through a learning curve) you could try to rent some bikes before you commit serious money (consider that everything here in CH is way more expensive than USA...). 
When I purch'd my full-suss I was lucky enough to try out some more FR/DH oriented rigs beforehand and I immediately realized that I wanted a lighter trailbike because I wanted to be able to pedal my way up easily, so I settled on the Canyon Nerve AM (now 3 yrs old, the good girl).

If you are feeling hardy, you could then finish up by proceeding upwards to the top of la dole, for the sometimes epic, sometimes foggy view   "	Posts: 7	Join Date: May 2014	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			Camping is done not only to save a bit of cash, but also to be closer to nature. It gives also a bit of independence feeling. Rather than listening to snoring of that fellow who drank a bit too much, you can listen to waterfalls while falling asleep... Just leave place in same state as before your visit.   
That said, I camped in cca 2000m in french alps, not more than 5 km from swiss border last weekend.  You don't get ibex males fighting 15m from your accomodation in mountain huts  
South slope was ok with flowers sprouting up, north slope was fully snowed (ie that crazy fox running down from high pass).

On our first hiking trip to the alps, my wife and I would set off at 5.00am every day and walk uphill for hours. 
We would arrive at a top cable car station (or the path near one) after walking for four or five hours solidly uphill, and meet all the fresh-faced people who had had a lazy breakfast and taken a leisurely trip by cable-car.   
At the time, I thought that going up by cable-car was cheating!

			Any hike in Switzerland will be scenic..   
Flumserberg has a nice hike which overlooks the Walensee.   
Otherwise Amden, Brunni, Etzel, Sattelegg, Sattel, Santis, Rigi...The options are endless. Just park the car at any Passhohe or Gondolastation and look out for the yellow signs. The time indicated is very accurate usually. Just avoid the white-red-white marked yellow signs and youll be fine.   
Bring good shoes though as the ground will still be very wet.

I (39m) am interested in playing badminton or squash at the Sports-Zugerland Center in Cham/Zug over lunch. I currently work in Zug.   
My skills for Badminton/Squash are about advanced level.   
First prio is singles (any of the two options), but I wouldn't mind playing badminton doubles.   
Let me know if you like to play and we can make an appointment.    
I am looking forward to a good game.    
Cheers,

Ok, german is not such a problem for me, but the way the classes are there is really no need to be perfect in German, its all about right moves and repeat after the instructor.  
Could be a bit different for youga and pilates as there I think it's important to understand the instructions to follow them in a correct way. But then again it's a nice way to pick up the language  
Good luck !

Looking at the times you mentioned, it looks like your riding time is going to be at least 12 hours. Looking at the results from last year's ride, of those that completed the tour (over 1000 people) no-one took more than 10 hours:   
I would get in touch with the organisers to check how long they will be there at the finish, as I'm afraid it is quite possible that they will have stopped timing by the time you make it.   
With regards rests, I will be stopping once or twice at the feed zones to fill up water bottles and pick up some snacks (5 mins max each stop ) but then I'm aiming for around 5 hours...

			Thanks again for the replies. 
I will measure the bike tomorrow and see how it fits in with the recommendations on that website you posted, Craban.  
Yeaaah, it is one of those bikes that you're supposed to go faster on to keep balanced. And I do know the problem is me with the bike, not with traffic- it's so quiet where I am, haha. Out in the country! There's even a flat, 'back' route into town to the grocery store, so I have no traffic excuse. Just a fear of being up so high and having to go much faster than I used to.  
I really wouldn't mind using a slower bike, to be honest. It's still faster than walking, yanno? But I've only got another three months here, so we'll see- otherwise at the weekend I think I'll try to get out to one of those larger bike rental places I've seen at some of the other nearby train stations like Murten and rent something more my style to get that balance. I liked going fast in the past, so I'm sure once I just get back the balance I'll be golden, even if the monster-bike is a bit too tall.    
Thank you all again for the replies- I was so frustrated last night after trying and failing yet again to find a sense of balance on the monster-bike, haha.   I really appreciate the thoughtful responses!

			It is in Irchelpark, if you take the tram to Milchbuck and walk into the park, it's on the left (north) side, there is a path that goes past the football and tennis fields (with the fields on the left), before the path goes under a ""roof"" the climbing wall is on the right.  It is not very high though, I've never seen anyone there with a rope..   
There is also an excellent bouldering wall at ETH Hönggeberg.  From the bus station you walk towards the sport center (heading roughly east), it's close to the sport center entrance, on the other side of the pathway.   
I went once to minimum bouldering, it was okay, pretty difficult problems though, it's a sort of a lifestyle-climbers kind of place  .  Only options that I know of for rope climbing are Schlieren and Milandia which are very expensive (imho), but big and with plenty of routes of all levels.  Pretty crowded in the afternoons though and not inside zone 10, when I go to Schlieren I usually take tram 17 to the end station (inside zone 10) and then it's about 20 minute walk.   
So who is hosting the planning / beer meeting?    
Off to Zermatt, schönen wochenende.

As you refer to A/B permit, I assume that you have a non-swiss paragliding license. If you are already qualified, and are resident in Switzerland, you will  need to pass the Swiss exam. Details are to be found here:    
In order to get you through the exam, I recommend that you contact a local school. There are many great paragliding schools in Switzerland. You can find a list on the free flight association website ( ). Personally, I would recommend   above all others. They usually fly around Lake Luzern, which would be very convenient for you if you are in Basel. They also have a lot of ladies training, or already qualified, so you should find some good company there.   
If you are just visiting Switzerland, and have an IPPI 4 or 5 then your are most welcome  to fly in Switzerland. If you want help on where or local site/meteo  knowledge, just contact me.

Touch rugby is a bit like rugby except there's no tackling and ... er ... well, it's really quite different actually. For one thing, men and women play on the same teams, so it's a pretty good social activity if you want to meet new people (we've got over a 100 people on the membership list, of these 30-40 are regular players).   
So if you are interested in playing a new sport and meeting a bunch of friendly people, you could do much worse than  . If you want to check it out without making any sort of commitment then come to our open day ...   
Saturday May 10, 9.30am to noon @ the  . If you want to take part, it costs CHF 10. We'll also be running a BBQ at lunch.      "	Posts: 59	Join Date: Oct 2009	Junior Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 53 Times in 28 Posts	considered knowledgeable

			I don't have recent experience to offer. But a few years ago I was a member of the Lausanne (Malley) Mifros Fitness Park, and I found the 3 included lessons pretty useless. If you've been to a gym already (which was my case), they didn't teach me anything. But I guess their advice is useful if you're a total beginner and don't know the equipment at all.

			Hi there - I don't mean to criticise, but why didn't you attempt to ""bike it"" properly, i.e. unassisted? 
Maybe go for less distance, but more exercise, and a quest / challenge too. 
For example I remember distinctly seeing once a middle aged couple on recumbents climbing up the Gotthard (Uri side), obviously huffing and puffing (and it may even have been raining), but really ""into"" the challenge. Bet they took something home from that experience!   
Just wondering if maybe you've gotten yourself into some kind of mental trap re: age* (or as some say ""lack of youth""), lack of physical preparation (many times the bar is irrationally raised to olympic levels), danger(s) and other unknown unknowns, not owning a ""proper"" (i.e. somewhat expensive) bike, etc, etc.   
Cheers

			I have recently ordered something from Wiggle (UK based) and Roseversand (German based).   
Wiggle ... item was £38 (excl.  VAT) with free postage.  It arrived in 3 days.  It had been stopped and inspected by customs (they had taped the parcel back up with tape marked DOUANE ZOLL CUSTOMS) but obviously quickly left to continue its journey.  Outside of package had item description and cost.  I assume they opened it to check postage costs (""free"") and maybe to ensure the contents matched the description.  So, no extra charges, just £38 vat free.   
Roseversand ... items came to 130€ and took 4 days to arrive. They had removed the 19% German MWST, added the 8% Swiss VAT and charged 1% for doing this.  It arrived untouched by customs as there was a Swiss customs declaration already on the parcel.

			This reminds me of a scene out of the zany story ""The Third Policemen"" by Flann O'Brien which describes the relationship between a man and his bicycle. However, in terms of a bizarre atomic theory where there is an interchange of ""bicycle"" and ""man"" molecules especially at the saddle and handlebars, the points of closest inter-contact. This resulting eventually in the bicycle developing human characteristics and likewise the man developing bicycle characteristics.

			Personally I can't help on the details, but the windsurfers only seem to go out when it is howling. One good spot to meet up is   - I often see a few people rigging up there when the wind is up. Overall though it isn't going to be consistent or regular.   
The prevailing strong winds are called the bise, which comes from the North-East and is therefore cold. It also means that you get reasonable waves coming in from Lausanne direction so the water is fairly bumpy.

My personal trainer (outdoors) just called and told me to walk away from the screen and indulge in some woodland trail running.    
My other fitness instructor (the sun) also beckoned.   
I can recommend both outdoors and the sun as useful factors in your training régime.

			Hi all 
I would like to start again play tennis in Zug, it's long time I didn't play (work family kids ) so if someone want to start again we could try together ( when i was 20 i was quite good). 
Unfortunately I can play just in the morning.

			Thanks for all the replies. I think the weight gain came about when I was put in an isolation  room for a week - there was just a bed, a table and a toilet so not much opportunity for exercise. I have spoken to the doctors and they have put me on the vegetarian option at lunch time (too much meat was upsetting my digestion), and will send me to the dietician. I'm sure I am comfort eating between meals and am trying to cut back. I shall now go and take my second walk of the day. And yes, I do use the stairs!

			Hi Guys!   
Having opportunity to explore Geneva day by day, I came up with the idea to organize biking group for Geneva area.    
Our group would stand for recreation riding open to extend itself to race riding.  
Undoubtedly Geneva offers a great bike routs locations for both MTB and street riding ready to be explored by yourself. However having a group of enthusiastic people, fixed meetings will give you a voice of reason why you should grab your bike and meet up as quickly as possible! 
Moreover, as all of us have already some ideas where to go, it would be better to share it withing a group.   
Don't hesitate, it will take only a few minutes to post/write me back stating when is good for you to meet.    
Let's share our hobby and spend good time together!   
Cheers! 
Alex

			I believe there are already threads here for riding in Basel, and you are sure to find something there.    
Just to let you know about a couple of places in france, but of course it would be in French, and you'd need a car! My daughter goes to Bartenheim -  , which is good. It costs 15 euros a 1 hour group lesson, but less if you buy ten.    
There is also a place in hegenheimhttp://hnalsace.blogscheval.net/formation-et-initiation/

			We have a second-hand one that we're looking to sell (was new when we bought it 2 years ago, is in very good condition, folds up when not in use).   
We're selling it because we're looking to move back to New Zealand later this year and don't intend to take it back with us.   
We are in Dietikon. (Not too far outside Zurich)   
If you're interested, send me a PM and we can work something out (make us an offer for what you're willing to pay).   
It is a little bit of a pain to get out of the apartment (due to the size of the door) but once it's in the corridor, it rolls on wheels and fits in the lift and is pretty easy to move.

			Hi,   
As Spring has officially arrive (kinda, considering the hail we had on Monday...), it's time to get a new bike. I think I have my mind settled on the Giant Anthem X 29er (most likely 1), but the price in Switzerland seems to be a bit higher than what the FX rate would suggest as compared to France (3200 CHF vs. expected 2800 at current exchange ratge). How curious...    
Does anyone know of bike shops doing regular discounts on Giant bikes? I have found  , but they only have the model I'm looking for in XS/M/L sizes, while I need XL. Otherwise, maybe I'll get it in France, but not sure about the geographical scope of warranty then.   
Cheers

Looking forward to hearing from you.

			I ride a bike as part of a commute every day, up to 30 minutes each way. It's tolerable (with the right clothes) even in bad weather. On the rare occasion that it snows, I may take a day off!   
Just make sure you use lights when it's dark, and be careful in the wet. Also watch at some pedestrian crossings (some are combined cycle and pedestrian crossings, some are only for pedestrians).   
Proceed with caution, practice, and you will get used to it. As sandgrounder says, it's often the fastest way around the city.   
You will find many decent bikes second hand for the cost of one or two month's tram tickets.

			Even easier, take the train to Aigle, then the bus via Vionnaz to Torgon, which then links up to Chapelle d'Abondance, and Tour de Don and on to Châtel and super Châtel, and down to Morgins- and then on ...   
Torgon has an excellent English speaking ski  and snowboarding school and beginners area, with restaurant next to the baby slope too.   
Had an excellent day there (drove up to Plan de Croix, just before Torgon) with huge car park and restaurant- plenty of snow and excellent conditions- although a couple of slopes a bit in the afternoon. Thanks BMXgirl and friend for company.   
If you want to stay for a few days in an English speaking environment, with lots of British, OZ and NZ staff- have a look at     
A great company who can organise everything for you on spot and right next to the slope, ski or snowboard hire, lessons, accom, meals, ski pass, etc. Highly recommended.

			I would say just choose the club local to you, there will be training a couple of times a week, and matches (half of which will be at your home pitch).   
Kids football over here is really well organised.   
My son was 9 when he started playing for a local swiss team (and he spoke no german as we had just moved here). He has been playing with the Swiss teams for over 5 years now.   
You will also find that as the kids get older the Swiss kids will want to try out their english, so they find a way to communicate with each other in a mix of languages. 
It also helps with learning Swiss-german, and gets them out of the ""international school bubble"". (if your son is at International school! mine is) 
The teams are very well run, disciplined and have amazing facilities. 
Our experiences of kids football over here have been really positive and I would recommend it to any family with a kid who loves football. 
Good Luck!

			Presumably you have looked at Holmes Place above Jelmoli? I personally have not found the service particularly good or friendly here either, but it works for me because of the wide range of classes, the towel service and the fact that you can rent a locker, which saves me having to cart loads of stuff around with me.

1367	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Recreational cycling route from Zürich?	alsbergt	1,999	9	Location: Zürich	10.04.2009, 20:00	" 
			
			Ended up deciding on a different direction this time.  We cycled to the Greifensee (lake of Uster), around it, and back.  The way to the lake through the Zürichberg, Gockhausen, Geeren, Pfaffhausen, and Fällanden, the way back through Benglen, Pfaffhausen and Witikon - see   of the path.  It was a really nice ride!   
I'm not in good fitness these days so the way to there across the Zürichberg was a bit difficult - that hill goes on farther than I expected climbing, and as my legs were somewhat tired on the way back through Witikon I did the steeper parts stepping off the bike walking, but overall it was not too strenuous.   
The weather was good, and a big part of the ride on the hills is in paths in the woods, which is coasy, especially with a mountain bike on the stones and roots.  The villages and towns going down to the lake aren't too exciting but pleasant to bike through nonetheless.   
The entire trip was about 45 km, done in a relaxed pace of 5 hours including pauses.  The path around the lake, about 20km, is nice and easy with view to the alps part of the time, though on an Easter Sunday we were not alone...  The hills in between are climbs of about 300m.  We did it all in a relaxed pace in 5 hours including pauses.   
Definitely recommended!  I'm looking forward to more bike rides in the area.  Next time I guess I'd check out some of the routes to the Zürcher Unterland, the Limmattal, or south west the Sihltal.  And perhaps at some point with company a full day to go around the Zürisee.   
  Cheers, 
  -- Tom

			Hi Pilates Fans !   
I used to go to the Spirit Studio, in Gundeldingen about a year ago, and I really enjoyed the lessons (used to go at midday). Teachers were very good, although, at the time, the classes did get a little full, but there was always enough space for everyone.     
Well equipped, with different sized balls, rolls and hoops, to get those muscles working !    
Enjoy the workout !

If you fly with Swiss then they are also pretty good with sports equipment.   
Here is a link for their  .      Note that the ""example"" above refers to Zurich to Paris. The fee's are different for an Intercontinental flight such as yours       
There maybe better options, but I don't know how long you intend to stay to see if it's at all worthwhile.   
The link earlier to the Velomarkt is also a good option, but you will also have to factor in an additional 'service' cost to the bikes before you use them..... they might be fine, but generally second hand bikes are not. 
The velomarkts are also rarely that cheap.   
If you want to specify exactly what sort of bikes you are looking for (frame sizes, features, etc,) and the budget, perhaps you might strike it lucky.   
Best of luck. 
Riding in Switzerland is the best.

1. Shooting - No idea, sorri 
2. Rock climbing - No idea, sorri  
3. Waterski'ing - Yes and not sure, Zugersee a few km's from Baar has plenty of boats on it in summer and water ski'ing, but never seen anyone doing slalom on a proper slalom course.  
4. Softball - Sorry no idea  
5. Ice hockey - Yes in Zug at the Herti ice rink a few km from Baar. 
6. Gym - Yes, there are at least 3 gyms that come to mind in Baar. One Training centre, Dober fitness, Talos gym and the Migro fitness but that's in Zug :-) 
7. Roller blading, Yes plenty of suitable paths (i.e. next to the Lorze river going towards Zug) and a small skatepark with flat and ramps.

Maybe the customer service is also better at 6am because when I went, nobody was there to answer questions and i didn't have all day before my other appt to wait around. If I were a man and I wasn't interested in courses, I would have gone with them just because the price is unbeatable.

You won't even find cabs for that journey, although you could call one, but seriously it would be crazy to do so. And the walk can be done in about ten minutes, although longer for some people in ski boots.   
Ooops, just saw that you've edited your post to specify ""the Brunni slopes"". Makes more sense, but I'd still recommend getting the free bus which runs every fifteen minutes.

			Hi,   
I am loking for a climbing pole which is outdoor. In the past there was one near every school, as it was used in the Swiss military fitness test. But after climbing is no longer part of the test and too many childs had too many concusions they were all(?) removed.   
Does anybody know were one was left in/around/near Zurich?    
(Does not have to be as colorful as this one)

			Hi, 
To get right to the point. I'm looking for pool player on Thursday nights. Level, age, and gender are not important. If you're a beginner I can teach you and if you're a professional you can teach me. I used to be a keen pool player but over the years lost a bit of interest. 
I live in Menziken and found a place in Reinach with one pool table. It rolls off to one side a bit but nothing we couldn't fix with a Bierdeckel or two. Smoking is allowed, just in case that's important to you. We could meet there or anywhere between Zurich and Menziken.

1400	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Switzerland - Weekend Skiing from London	cisco43	3,126	46	Location: London	12.02.2014, 04:34	" 
			
			Look at this website for the Ski Company based in Greenwich and the Portes du Soleil. they are hugely experienced in ski courses, do their own transfers, ski and snowboard hire, closely linked to English speaking ski/snowboard school and right next to slopes, where beginner lessons take place- with a restaurant for hot drinks, food, pizzas right next to it.        
and click on week-end packages. Gerry the owner, Becky and Oli, his management team, will happily answer any questions. I have no connection with them, apart from having organised dozens of trips with schools and friends from UK. Fabulous value at £65 per day!!! to include:   
This price                                     includes  accommodation, buffet  breakfast, packed lunch, afternoon tea and cakes, 4 course evening meal,  lift pass with 60 lifts and 150kms of slopes plus complimentary hire of  ski or board equipment. (transfer extra- but you can get there by train and bus from Geneva airport station easily- train to Aigle, then bus via Vionnaz up to Torgon). It is one of the closest Swiss resort to access from Geneva via transfer or train/bus directly from airport.   
That is £260 per person all in for arrival Thursday, ski pass and equipment hire +full board   (about 1 hr).  Lessons extra depending on number of hours wanted, and    running ski trips to CH since 1984.  Easy peasy. They run courses in several other resorts- but Torgon is the nearest and easiest for a week-end. I can whole heartedly recommend them, as I've used them for over 20 years.   
Check their Facebook page too.   
Zermatt is indeed gorgeous, but so much further unfortunately- so really not sensible for a week-end.  Very easy to get to Verbier too from Geneva, train to Martigny from airport, then change train to Le Châble and gondola straight up to resort- but very expensive and not so good for beginners.

1406	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Recommendations for a stylist that works with curly hair near Lausanne?	Merchglas	656	0	Location: Near Luzern	11.02.2014, 23:59	" 
			
			Ok, question for the kind people here from the other end of the hair styling spectrum...   
I have fairly thick, naturally wavy hair.  If it's cut/layered by someone who knows what they're doing, it curls and fluffs beautifully as though I'd had a perm.  After years of searching and having some semi-traumatic bad experiences (including the horrible cut right before my son's wedding   ), I finally found the Best Hairstylist Evah...but of course had to leave her behind when I came over here. It's been a year, I'm getting to a gawdawful frizzy hippy chick mane stage.  So does anyone here know of a stylist who...   
1.  Is somewhere in the greater Luzern area (I'm happy to drive to outlying areas)? 
2.  Is genuinely experienced and knowledgeable about how to cut my type of hair? 
3.  Speaks English (optional--El Husbando well understands the problem after all these years & won't mind translating)?   
And...how much does a wash/cut/style from an experienced stylist usually cost here?  And how much is an appropriate tip?  (was paying $45 USD + 20% tip in the US, I expect it's more here like everything else, but I really am happy to pay for competence/skill and the resultant peace of mind...)   
Thank you so much if anyone can help me out with this...every morning the bathroom mirror gets an exasperated sigh these days....     "	Posts: 25	Join Date: Jan 2014	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 60 Times in 19 Posts	considered knowledgeable

1409	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cost of Ski Hire	webdev	2,104	20	Location: Zurich	09.02.2014, 21:09	"    You are talking top end equipment that 90% of skiers will never touch.  Even then your boots prices seem to be very very high.  My touring boots (Scarpa Maestrale so basically as good as most things out there) cost me CHF 500 a couple of years back.  For piste use I just got a perfectly decent pair of Nordica Hell and Back (stiffness 120) for CHF 270 on offer in Migros.   
Fully agree about not buying boots on-line though.

I would say my ability ranges from average to superbly-average depending on the night before.    
Does anyone have any regular football going on that I can get involved with? Happy to join an existing league, team or even just a group of lads having a kick about on the weekend/evening.

Another suggestion for food on the way is to call in to a Bachmann bakery (the hot-pink ones that have monopolized the bakery scene in Lucerne  ) in the morning to get a filled roll and cake. Otherwise you can pick up plain pretzels or ""weggli"" rolls then get a nice appenzeller cheese and salami at the supermarket to take as a picnic. ""Apfelschorle"" is a nice refreshing mix of 60% apple juice with 40% mineral water to take on the way, too.

We are in the process of relocating to Zurich area coming from Andorra, where our daughter (5 years old) has been in a ski club as well for the last two years. It works quite similarly as you described her as well, some 60 days of ski per season taking advantage of school holidays and weekends. Also, the ski club bus make things easy here and would appreciate the same... 
Thus, we would appreciate if you can share any intelligence about your findings!

			Hi all,    
I will be travelling to Switzerland for a few two-weeks periods and I will be staying in Vevey.   
Everything is covered, but entertainment. And that is a little scary, for me.   
One of my passions is shooting guns (pistols, mainly. IDPA, IPSC) and I was thinking to check out some ranges near Vevey, if you could recommend me some. 
I don't have a car, so ranges near/in cities like Vevey, Lausanne or Geneva would be great.   
Another interesting thing is that, from what I've heard so far about Vevey, is that it is kind of ""dead"" after 6pm and that makes me sad. 
Do you happen to know some pubs/bars where one could enjoy a few beers and meet new people?   
Thank you for your help, 
Rares

			Any fad diet will work for a time as it means people pay attention to their calorie intake, which is the thing that determines weight loss/gain.  I'm sure we could come up with a new one on this thread that will work.   
Harder is to be sure what to eat on a long term basis to be healthy.  It certainly seems there is a move towards reducing refined carbohydrates and worrying less about saturated fats which are highly nutritious and do not impact 'bad' cholesterol levels.

1432	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Off piste in Switzerland	guest	7,834	66	null	null	"    To use a great German word ""Jein"". Some schools will give lessons on riding off piste. This is aimed at the skills required and will use slopes that are within the ski area and have minimal avalanche risk. This is a lesson on how to ride powder on your ski's or board and not a lesson on avalanche safety.    
The guides can teach you avalanche safety, but not necessarily the technique required for you to ride off piste.         I did the course and some powder days with them in Engelberg. Best bet is to contact them and see what they say. If you get enough people together you might be able to organise a private course.       There is a simplified reduction method which I don't have time to look for now that I use pretty much every time. That is if the avalanche risk is 2, I stick to slopes less then 35 degrees, if its 3 I stick to slopes less then 30 degrees. If I go into the grey areas (over 35 degrees in risk level 2, or over 30 degrees in risk level 3) then I use the reduction method along with any other information I have to decide whether to go or not.  I am not someone that likes to ride stupidly steep coulours etc so I am normally happy riding areas of about 30 to 35 degrees and just cruising.

			Dear Izabela,   
I am an experienced rider (ex-eventer / classical Spainish trained in dressage) and have trained many levels of riders in the past and work with the rider and horse to gain a common and respectful understanding of each other, normally when confidence and trust is lacking. I am due to relocate to Gersau in Feb 2014.    
If you can find a horse to ride I'm happy to train you. I am self-employed so I am sure we can find the time when it suits.   
Best wishes,

			Hi Calvin,   
it can sometimes be a bit of a science to understand snow reports. Atleast in Switzerland they are more truthful then some other places i know.   
Im based in Lenzerheide and can say the conditions are pretty good right now.. Almost all of the ski runs are open and all of the lifts are running. This part of Switzerland is haivng an ok winter so far. We could all use some more snow, but there is definately enough to ski on. In high trafic areas you can get some little rocks coming through at the end of the day. Its not just Lenzerheide that has this problem but most resorts in the region.   
Sorry wrong info, the lift to Arosa isnt open yet. That should open in the next couple of weeks. They still have to make the finishing touches.   
The best snow info is    its the avalanche forcasting website for Switzerland but you get a very good picture of what the conditions are like. Combine that with webcams and snow reports and you should be ok with where to go and ski.   
Have fun this weekend

My husband is a professional Tai Chi teacher from Taiwan, Republik of  China, and the representative of the World Tai Chi Chuan Federation in  Switzerland. 
He teaches Yang and Chen style in Zurich. He has tought in Taiwan for  years, his teaching style is traditional Chinese style and different  from the average Swiss teacher. He teaches in English. I don't know, if  that is what you are looking for, but have a look at his website for  more info:    (it's in German) or PM me if you are interested.

Most groups will spend some time covering off-piste, certainly the higher groups do a lot of off-piste.  For example, last year my group spent 4 days of the course off-piste.

			By the way, often they have open days/weekends when you can go and try for everything for free. In addition, in such days, there is normally some promotions going on. I would wait for such days or ask them go give you access to try it a couple of times before making up your mind.

			Hi,   
I have been last week in Sattel ( ). This is close to Luzern.   
Is really nice for sledding, we paid 20 CHF for the gondola trips and 8 CHF per sledge.   
At the middle of the webpage, you also have the SBB timetable.   
Have fun!

			Well, I trained in a very good kickboxing club in Zürich-PRAVDA(they are also combining muay thai with the KB, something like full contact), but since I moved to Basel I'm searching for another one here. My best recommendations for the club PRAVDA. You don't need to speak much and the exercises are hard enough that after training you feel like a butterfly. So if anybody is interested in, here's the link:       
p.s. Also to mention that once per week you will have opportunity for light-contact sparing but only when you move from the beginners level.   
Have fun

Here's the contact info:     
Andrea: 078 911 88 82   
I don't know if Andrea speaks English...(we speak Swiss-German together),  but it's worth a try    
I hope this helps,     
Good luck!

			After all the lovely snow 3-4 weeks ago, the weather has been sunny- and today horrible drizzle-not good for the ski conditions. Let's hope we get some new snow soon. Would you be able to do week-day? The best place for total beginners near here is called Les Fourgs, over on FRench side. Very gentle slopes, cheap ski and boot hire, and cheap pass for the day, with a café/restaurant at bottom of slope. But as said, we will have to wait for better conditions. I know at least 1 total beginner who would like to join us- and I am happy to help. Which dry ski slope in the UK. Used to take groups to the one in Leicester a loooong time ago, then to Swadlincote- before Snowdome opened at Tamworth.

1485	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Gym in Zurich Enge	Viper1983	2,975	11	Location: Zurich	11.11.2013, 00:34	" 
			
			Hi,   
Probably in Zurich to join a sport club or gym can be affordable if you get a reduction from your Health insurance company.  For example from CSS you could get a list from all the gyms where you get a reduction up to 40%. So from this perspective the price / distance / equipment / services can start to be very different and range to very good equipment for a very cheap price.   
If you  do not get this info from you Insurance company, the probably other option is a reduction card, there are many options in Zurich.    
But also try not only the gym but the sports open air, which are more popular...   
Good luck

			I don't believe that taking supplements daily is very good for you. I think that your body should be given what it needs in food and learn how to extract it itself. If you give it a nice tablet everyday it'll get lazy.   
Saying that I am not anti-supplements, I think they have their uses as a supplement, not as a regular diet. eg:   
I took a vitamins, omega and folic acid supplement when pregnant and breastfeeding, because folic acid is important, and I don't eat fish or a lot of eggs so omega supplements were the best way to give my child what she needed.  
My daughter had two ear infections after colds in winter, so my (Swiss) GP recommended that she take supplements every day, I only give her them if she has a cold, or.... (as both infections were in winter) over winter.  
I take vitamins only when I have a cold.   
Basically, good for the occasional booster, but not so good to rely on them everyday.

			Here's some advice that may be of help.  I shipped my triathlon and CX bike from the US here a couple of months ago.  The bike shop in the US was great in letting me use their account and get a really low rate with FEDEX, however I got hit with a significant duty/tariff upon arrival here.   
It seems to be all based on the value that is placed on the Commercial Invoice (i.e. a lower value - lower tariff).  So you can save some bucks if you use a lower amount for the value.  Obviously, you'll have to weigh that against the amount of insurance you select, so there's some trade off there.   
Good luck with your shipping.

Point is, its a tiny snapshot in time, its pretty hard to judge what happened before or after either photo was taken, which would allow you to judge precisely how well they ski. Given both are instructors, I suspect they both ski superbly.

Could anyone recommend a good beginner martial arts class for 5-6 Years old kids.  We live in the Forch/Maur area.   
It can be any martial art at this point, having a sensei speaking English or french would be very helpful.   
We quite like the one in Volketsvil (Kindercity) but the logistics is too hard with school commute.  We are looking for something closer.   
Many thanks for your inputs

1506	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Backcountry Cross Country Skiing	DeniseMarieM	1,796	15	Location: St. Gallen	05.12.2013, 05:06	" 
			
			DeniseMarieM, for the skis you showed, you can have basically two types of bindings: 
-""flat oriented"" - BC versions of profile bindings like Rotefella NNN or Salomon SNS - better for longer trips on rather flat areas, where active walking or even running is desirable. I believe that a set of shoes Salomon X-Adve 8 + bindings BC SNS Raid can be bought in any bigger XC shop in Switzerland (I sow such a set in the 'megalopolis' called Delémont, so let's say in Zurich it should not be a problem)       
-""downhill oriented"" - e.g. 3 pins+cable - better stability on slopes, less comfortable for ""active"" stepping. Unfortunately I don't know much more about them.   
Regarding the areas for BC in Switzerland: I live in Jura so I go out from my apartment, look around and decide on which ridge I ski that day ;-) 
Basically whole Jura (the region, not the canton) is quite nice good place to do BC XC.  
I'm planning now a BC XC 1-2 day trip, maybe around Chasseral or Creux-du-Van or completely different place, just with map and compass. Would you be interested in joining such a trip?

If you are stuck down a crevass they might not be able to hook onto the harness in the front but they will be able to get to the strap over the shoulder to hoist you out. It will not be elegant but it will work. You can get these straps at any sports store that sells/rents harnesses. An investment of CHF 25 that might save you some day.

			I don't know of any pools within walking distance of the airport (maybe there are & I'm just not aware of them) but my daughter used to swim for a club that practiced at the Servette pool.  Really nice indoor facility next to the hockey rink, with easy tram/bus connections.

In the UK we very much have bike parks, which are main trail hubs throughout the UK where you have the option to ride maybe 10-15 different trails (Not all in the same day) and throw the bike in the car and head home - any recommendations for something similar in Switzerland?

I am looking into an athletics course (or similar) for my 5 year old son.   
This has probably been talked about before, but if anyone has experience of such a club or course which you can recommend to me, I'd appreciate it.   
He currently does swimming and school sports.   
Many thanks

1513	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Climbing /alpinism partner	Giada	528	0	Location: Montreux	09.12.2013, 01:00	" 
			
			Hello,    
I'm recovering from a knee surgery and I've just restarted climbing after 5 months from the op and 9 from the accident.   
My level, and especially the confidence, is not as good as it used to, but I'm determined to get back to where I left ASAP.   
My usual partner is very busy lately, so I'm keen on meeting new climbers.   
I'm currently back to basics on 5b/5c depending on the movements involving the dodgy knee, but I aim to go back to feel confident on 6s quickly.   
i work in Lausanne and I'm happy to drive to climb pretty much anywhere: I tend to go to Sottens, Magnet, Saxons, Chavornay....not before 7pm during the week.   
I don't particularly mind the level, but I'd need to feel safe (especially considering the current wobbliness). Ideally someone who enjoys the outdoor and alpinism ...   
Looking forward to new partners,   
Giada

			Hi, 
I was about to buy some Basel Sharks game tickets for my husband and stepson this month but have no idea what seats to pick.  The seat map lets me pick the seats but am at a loss which ones to choose.   
To anyone who has been to a Basel Sharks game can you recommend which area/rows are the best?  Are you better as close as possible to the ice (row 1?) or up the back where I'd imagine you get a better view across the ice rink.   
Cheers!

			Hi,   
Another quick question as a new arrival. Does anyone know of a family friendly swimming baths in the Geneva - Nyon area?   
I did some internet (and forum) searching but the ones that look the most suitable for a young family seem to be open air and only available in the summer.   
Indoor ones with areas for young children seem to be harder to find - maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?   
Thanks in advance for any tips and advice!

What we should really do is taking few minutes to relax them, for ex. I find useful breathing exercises and of course neck and shoulders exercise.

Thanks for the correction. I thought only books, newspapers and food were taxed at the 2.5% rate. It seems that medicines (nutritional supplements) are also at the low rate.   
So that would confirm the CHF 200 limit (the calculation is based on not collecting less than CHF 5 in VAT so 2.5% x 200 = 5).

			The Snow and Rail offers are only for the Swiss side of the Portes du Soleil normally, and not for the French side resorts. You'd have to take the train to Cluses (Thonon is a long way off) then up to resort by bus- but I am pretty sure you'd have to do this from Geneva- and would not be included in offer.   
Chatel would be much easier to get to, very close to Morgins (on Swiss side)- but again- you'd have to check if it is covered by snowRail offer. SnowRail offers are put together to help Swiss tourism, and not French...   
Just checked, and as I thought. The SnowRail is only to Swiss side resort- but you can get reduction on the ski pass for the whole of the Portes du Soleil, both Swiss and French, including Morzine, but only if you pick them up on the Swiss side- so Morzine is just not possible on that offer by public transport.              21 December 2013 to 27 April 2014 (based on the snow situation)

1531	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	In Basel, hoping to find some snowboard/ski buddies and advice	adsiripala	1,906	3	Location: Basel	07.11.2009, 15:44	" 
			
			Hi folks, 
I'm heading back to the States in mid-December, and am hoping to do a bit of snowboarding in Switzerland before I leave.  (This would probably mean a day or weekend trip from Basel on the Nov. 21, Nov. 28, or Dec. 5 weekend, or possibly earlier, if the lifts are open.)  Would love to meet some people who might be up for some early-season skiing or snowboarding, and also to get some advice about the best resorts to check out.  I'm an intermediate snowboarder (don't know how Swiss ratings work, but I tend to ride the blue square slopes in the U.S. (mostly Lake Tahoe area), and occassionally try to scrape my way down a single black diamond.)  Would like to find someplace that's snowboard-friendly (preferably not too many flat spots or drag lifts) with a good variety for novices/intermediates, and hopefully some nice, wide-open cruisers.  For a day trip from Basel, I was thinking perhaps Engelberg or Meiringen-Hasliberg, though I read somewhere that Meiringen has quite a lot of surface tows - would this be an issue for a snowboarder who's used to chair lifts? I'd be very interested to hear other recommendations.     
If there is any interest in a weekend trip, I would also be up for venturing further afield, maybe to Zermatt?  I don't have a car in Basel, so would probably be going for a snow n rail pass, and would also need to rent gear.  (I figured I would rent at the resort itself; is this generally an OK option here?)   
Anyway, let me know if you might be interested in a ski/snowboard trip, and thanks in advance for any advice!

I wish you good luck!!! And if you don't make it this time work hard and keep trying. But don't forget to keep up with your schooling.

			Hi    
I would definitely be interested in joining or forming a ski school group, please let me know if anyone is interested?  
I would be mainly looking to do a ski school on a Saturday, I would be coming from Basel, so would be great to meet fellow beginners from Basel.    
Thanks

			Hey!   
I haven't heard of anything in Küsnacht, but it seems like a winning proposition.    
If you want to get in contact, just give me a call:   
076 317 59 92.   
Or send me a mail:       
I have a pretty complete set of everything. The only things I'm really missing are a GHD machine and proper medicine balls. Have 3 OLY bars and bumpers, rings, PU bar space for 4 people - etc. Oh - and I use dumbells in place of kettlebells (=lots cheaper).   
BTW, I lead a crossfit-ish Monday evening class (primarily in German) at a local school gymnasium. I concentrate on body-weight stuff and simple gymnastics. It's  sponsored by the local Sporttreff. If you have time to come by, you could drop by my cellar afterward.

			There are still 2 places available (there are three but I can take up to five - this will decrease the cost to about chf10 per class).   
Since some ladies signed up, we have discussed and planned a new time that seems to  suit everyone,  in case it happens to suit you better too and you might like to join us:    
The classes will be held Tuesdays from 9.15am – 10.30am (75mins) at Sanapurna Ayurveda & Yoga, 10 Schöneggstrasse 10, 8004 on:   19 November
  26 November
  3 December
  10 December
  17 December
  7 January   
  As yet, this class is not being officially offered by Sanapurna but they are generously providing use of their lovely, centrally located studio.   
  If you are interested in participating, please contact me as soon as possible.     With gratitude

			I had not seen that...thank you.  It would appear that most do consider a regional pass as a good deal.    
We only ventured away from central Switzerland a few times a year (7 days total) for skiing.  So, the regional pass seems to be worth it since the majority of our days out were somewhat local (1.5 hour drive max).

			Hi,   
Ive been living in Reinach for a couple of months now and my neighbors and I have been discussing organising an informal kick about for an hour or so on the weekends.    
We might be able to get access to an all weather pitch but realistically need at least 8  10 people for a decent game. So Im interested in setting up a distribution list with anyone that may be interested in playing, aiming to have the first session on Sat 23rd Nov @ 10 am?   
If you live in or near Reinach and fancy a kick about on the odd Sat morning  then please drop me a PM with your email.    
Look forward to hearing from you.

			I can really recommend David gym!    
- generous opening hours 6-22 weekdays, 8-20 weekends 
- I always find a parking spot  
- the place is huge, you never have to wait for a machine to get ready (only been there once during rush hour - but they have multiple versions of all machines) 
- I haven't tried their classes, but it seems they have a great variety of martial arts, aerobics and more  
- it is clean and neat  
- I like that there are a lot of big (muscle wise people training there), I find it inspiring 
- they have saunas (a northener like me need one - and that the gym had one was an unexpected serious bonus) 
- you can buy nutrition there as well (haven't checked the prices yet though)   
All in all - great service and great environment. I really find it worth my buck, (I got a special deal so I pay 300 for 2 months - it's not cheap but it is definitely worth it).

I started looking for english speaking dance classes but then I gave up and joined an Italian one! For me, it was very enjoyable, you can just follow the teacher and others around you whilst brushing up on your language skills -win/win!

			I go to   in Zurich. Now that the weather is getting colder, the classes are getting fuller but it's still pretty comfortable. They teach in both English and Swiss German, sometimes a mixture, depending on who is attending the classes.   
And yes, staying well hydrated during the day beforehand is key!

			In general, Crossfit boxes, as well as other gyms, don't post their costs on their websites.  Was horribly frustrating to have to go and talk to people in order to get the information, but that's how it works here.     
I do go to Crossfit Basilisk and love it, since it pushes me harder than I would ever push myself plus the people are awesome, however not sure what the current rate is, as I have been there since before they had all their equipment. But worst case scenario, go to both boxes, have a free trial, get the information and decide what to do next.

1601	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Pannier rack for road bike	petertaylor123	429	0	Location: basel stadt	28.10.2013, 15:28	" 
			
			Hey everyone,   
I have a query about attaching a pannier rack to my road bike.   
Has anyone got a system attached to their road bike? 
If so, what is it and does it work well?   
Rack systems that I have seen and I like   
attaches to the quick release, and the rear brake bolt. 
The above link is not available in CH. Its out of stock in a lot of UK retailers, and costs almost as much for shipping as it does for the thing in the first place!! But if it comes down to it, and there is nothing that I like better, then this is what I will be going for. I just wanted some first hand 'reviews' of anything that's available here.   
I have a carbon framed bike, so I don't want to 'clamping' anything to the chain stays/rear forks. 
However, becauseroad bikes chain stays are shorter than tourers, does this mean that your heels are clipping the panniers?   
Also, racks that just attach onto the seat post look they would be swinging about from side to side when there is a bag on it. 
Does anyone have one and is this a correct assumption?   
I appreciate any input anyone cares to give. 
Regards, 
Pete

			UTMB, is that one of the Mont Blanc ultras? start at 02.00 and complete 150km in a day? 
I know a guy who's done that 1x or 2x (he's an iron man tri).  
I've done a few training runs with him and he intro'ed me to the so-called 
Elefanten weg along the Elefantenbach (named for a rock) that goes up  into the forest from Bergwies (near the Tram museum). Massive network of  trails, go in the direction of Forch and Pfannenstiel, you can go  forever with good climbs and height difference (although it's trail not  mountain piste running).   
We start at the Migro Fitnesscentre in 3Koenigstr and go along the lake  before heading up to Bergwies and the trail (which is also a so-called  Pfadiweg, Pfadi = boyscouts, there's even a plaque commemorating  Baden-Powell). You hook up with one of the stages of the SOLA. From the  health club I've done 2.5 hours out & back - my guy keeps it short  for me . then sauna and a bit of craic. can't beat it.

And as we skied down the mountain at the end, my daughter (being assisted by the instructor, holding on to his ""sticks"") was yelling at me ""faster Mummy, you're too slooow!""

			Went last night and picked up a few things for less than CHF70 including some crap I didn't need and donuts for the road!    
It's all low quality stuff to be fair but can't see anything wrong with it so far. 
Was quite impressed with the goggles though, they're not that bad at all given that they're less than 10% of the stuff sold at Ochsner Sport. They have two versions, sunny day ones and cloudy day ones, as I already have the sunny day ones it was a good time to get the cloudy day ones. It remains to be seen if the texture of the snow's visibility is improved and whether or not they will steam up. They fit over glasses easily so if you're blind as a bat it should be no problem too. 
Thermals, gloves and accessories are cheap as chips and will keep you / your visitors warm on the slope. 
Jacket and trousers I wasn't very impressed with but can't really go wrong with CHF20 trousers that you can throw away if you have to after one season.   
Only problem is size as there are no changing rooms, so you need to know your size before you go, maybe take a pair of your own to measure against. 
Popular colour for trousers seems to be green, as I couldn't find my size in that colour so ended up going with a boring colour (black).

note they do have preseason times (right now) then regular times after the 21st.   
Not sure how good your german is, but ""Freier Eislauf"": is the times for normal skating. ""Chneble"" refers to pick up hockey. All you need is a stick skates and a puck (all can be rented) and hockey gloves are recommended.    
Not sure about the times with dolder, but usually it's always open to hockey fun if the rink isn't reserved for organized groups. Hockey sticks are free to use there.

			Hi,   
I'm looking to start Salsa lessons in Bern around the 14th October (that's the start of the new term) and thought it would be a good opportunity to see if there were any other interested people out there. Perhaps we could get a small group going..   
I've danced (Cuban) Salsa on and off over the years so am comfortable with the rhythm and basics, but it's been quite a few years now and I have forgotten most of the moves, particularly their names   I'm therefore not sure what level I would start at, but I'm more in it for the fun/social aspect than technical perfection so aren't too fussed.   
I did some research online and am leaning towards the ""salsa dancers"" school ( ).  There are other places around too, so let me know if you have any tips on what dance schools would suit.   
I'll likely sign up later in the week (yes, it's quite soon), but you can always join in later once the term starts. I'm also interested in trying some other styles too.

			Hi,   
Ive been living in Reinach for a couple of months now and my neighbors and I have been discussing organising an informal kick about for an hour or so on the weekends.    
We might be able to get access to an all weather pitch but realistically need at least 8  10 people for a decent game. So Im interested in setting up a distribution list with anyone that may be interested in playing, no commitments at this stage just need you to register your interest.   
If you live in or near Reinach and fancy a kick about on the odd weekend then please drop me a PM with your email.    
Once I have enough email address Ill try to a organise the first game.    
Look forward to hearing from you. 
Moe

As I said in another thread, I'm more than happy to do bits and bobs of servicing and repairs at cut-price rates for regulars on here, and as it happens I'm right next to the base station at Engelberg too.    
Mates rates for skiing mates, not as a proper commercial service, of course, and by arrangement, if it's convenient, sort of thing. Think of it more as a hands-on training session, if you like.

Most shops will do a 'base grind' and wax on a machine which takes away the manual effort for a simple service, but a proper sharp edge requires a little more patience.      The main thing people notice is if, after a service, you're constantly 'catching' the inner tip or tail of the ski - it may have been sharpened too close to the end, so 'detuning' the last 20cm or so might help. But it's worth bearing in mind that if you have a good fore-and-aft weight distribution over the skis then this won't happen anyway. So go get some lessons too   	Posts: 3,484	Join Date: Jul 2008	Forum Legend	Groaned at 11 Times in 11 Posts	Thanked 3,296 Times in 1,732 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

The sugar removal method was the least painful hair removal I have ever experienced. They are pricey, $95 for a full brazilian. Don't recommend for eyebrows though. Had those done too.

When I had a look at the suggested search terms, the first one just brings up gyms and the second one also just shows gyms with the exception of oerlikon but actually when you drill through it becomes apparent that it also just refers to classes in the fitness centre part of the pool.

The pilates studio next to Zug station is brilliant -   - and has trainers who can work with you in English, in groups or individually, on the machines or on the mats. It's a bit pricey, but you really see the results.   
For yoga, have you tried Yogaschule Sunanda in Cham? It's easy to get to from the station -  . Ursula and Thomas are lovely people and run classes in English and German. The yoga classes at Bodymove in Baar are also great.   
Although the sun is shining here, sometimes I really miss Zug and my friends!

There maybe a suitable pool in a home that is not normally open to the public.

			Oh...so tempted, but Berlin is a hair far.  If it was in Stuttgart for Frankfurt we would be all over this.  We have not done a mud run since we moved to CH.  The last one we did was a tough mudder.  We had a team of 5 but you really did not need one...everyone is rather helpful and encouraging.   
The TM event we did was held at a ski result and was in total 17km.  However, we could only run about 10 of it because of the climbs up three of the slopes.  So...in Berlin...you might actually have to run more...But its not a timed event so who gives a crap?   
A few notes about our experience: Three of our team of 5 had injuries of some type or another.  Only one of us needed a visit to the hospital...where there were so many others waiting to be seen.  I have a lovely scar on my side.  This experience also helped redefine what cold is.  When our race started it was -3.0C and it never got about 5C all day.  Being wet and cold became less noticeable as the end got nearer...but at 7am when we started...holy...that was an eye opener!     
As a result of that race, rain, cold, and other things don't really mean that much anymore.  I have but one recommendation: where merino wool athletic clothing.  This will help keep you less cold than other sport clothing options.  Especially a hat and oddly enough...gloves.  Looks funny, but you'll suffer less.

			Cheers everyone.    
In the end, the answer came to me as I was hooking up my existing 26er to the kiddie trailer - the clearance between the wheel and the frot of the trailer was very small. After measuring it I discovered that a 29er would give less than 2cm clearance - not enough to account for flex and turn when riding - so 26er it was for me.    
I shoppe around in Zurich where 2013 bikes were gettin thin on the grous, and as I discovered for the bigger brands (Specialized, Cannondale) almost no 26er bikes are being offered in 2014. Specialized offer the Rockhopper in 26er only to a size M frame in 2014 - I'm definitely a large/19inch frame.    
So, I checked the Internet and ordered a Cannondale Trail SL3 from bike24.de. Decent price, and a good frame. Drivetrain isn't brilliant, but easily upgrade able.    
Thanks for the advice all!

			Here are the prices that Migros and others do, unless you are better then them and able to do BFU certificates then you aren't in the game. Also I have used both Migros and Atletikum for a few years and the claim that they add scratches is wrong never had anything other then perfect service.   
Mini service 35CHF 
Maxi service 45 - 55CHF   
Pickup and deliver is nice but not a competitive advantage given most people have easy access to being able to take gear by car or public transport. Serviced mine recently and service location was at the Bahnhof so it was a simple matter of collect the skis on the way home from work. (better still they did the service for gratis since I just updated my boots with them)   
Question is, are your prices lower then the rates stated above with inclusive BFU capability?

			Hi there,    
I posted an intro as I've just moved to Lausanne with my other-half. ( ) however I'm wondering if there are any Lausanne or nearby based people who are keen to get out on the rock this weekend (or any other time!)?   
A bit more info about me - I've been climbing for quite a few years, and am really keen on any type of vertical activity. Have climbed all over the place... My level has suffered these past few months as I've been travelling on sabbatical so haven't been able to keep up the climbing, but am still happy to lead the lower grades (and thrash at the harder ones) as I build back up my climbing-fitness.   I will give pretty much anything a go.   
Skills wise I love sport-crags, trad, multi-pitch, ridges and have all my own gear/rack - although haven't done any glacier travel (but know the basics). Big mountain days and long walk ins are fine with me too!   
Am happy to meet with newbies too and show them the ropes so to speak so please drop me a line    
Cheers!

			Great for exercising for free, using the natural or manmade urban environment. 
And also to meet new people, use your language, etc.   
In Neuchatel, on Tuesday evening, and soon in La Chaux-de-Fonds too- but also in all major towns in Switzerland. Check the website for your local area:       
Sponsored by your town who pays the professional trainers who will pick natural or manmade artifacts and plan exercise around them.

Thanks for the train info! Can I assume that SBB is the definitive website for booking rail journeys in Switzerland.  I've noticed that it's pretty low cost to take the train from Zurich direct to Milano, and also well priced for a train Zrh to the Interlaken area - Meiringin (2 hrs) and Grindelwald (3hrs), however it's 3x as expensive to go from Interlaken to Milano.  It's cheaper to go back to Zurich 1st and then direct to Milano! Don't know why...

			Hi All   
If you are in Gland upwards: Begnins, Burtigny, Marchissy, St George, Gimel, Le Vaud, Bassins area.   
I use race cycles or MTB.   
I just went around Lac Leman in 7.5hrs riding time. So I am not a super fast rider especially uphill. On 1-3% gradients I tend to run 30-38kph, on steeper 4-7% gradients I slow down.   
So would be great to find someone who wants to get fitter and would like to join on 1-2hr rides during the week.   
Thanks

Maybe something near the dam close to tinguely museum / breite ?   
just draw the route on google map and share the link if you are used to ride a specific route with rollerblades / skate / longboard.   
And by the way, I'm looking for longboarders to train with (sliding and jumping mainly) or slalomers (for slalom of course) and there I already have my spot but I would like to cruise kilometers, not cruising in the city (too many people, too many cars, too many curbs)

You can reduce the cost if your   (health fund) pays some. Mine pays CHF 200/year. Please is you buy 2 or more years in one go the price comes down. Also Kiesser were always handing our discount vouchers - ask if they have any.   
I still go every 4 days to a very similar outfit as there is no Kieser locally since I moved. I cannot imagine living with it. I can ski and walk all day without muscle ache...

For hiking, the 1:100,000 are certainly marginal. However, I've used them for a lot of long hikes and they are generally OK when paired with the frequent directional markers. However, they don't have all of the hiking trails marked on them, so before leaving home I'll often have a look at the area I'm going to on the   website, and then copy onto the map any additional trails that I think might be useful.   
Of course, I also have a couple of national 1:300,000 maps that are best for long-distance route planning; one that is good for driving, and   that has all of the cycling routes marked on it.

			Thanks heaps for the advice, Knuid.   
I'm going to head to Bordeaux to try and get in a weekend of surfing in September...   
Is it pretty easy to get down to Biarritz on a Friday evening or do you think I'm being too keen and should just go to Lacanau or Soulac (closer to Bordeaux)?     
I've read that there is a train down from Bordeaux to biarritz or I was also even considering just hiring a car.   
Has anyone else done this?   
Has anyone surfed at all three...biarritz, soulac and Lacanau? Which is better for an intermediate surfer?   
Let me know if anyone wants to join me!   
Ta, bear

1768	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Starting Insanity: we must be mad	Jonster	6,368	56	Location: Zurich	17.05.2013, 19:59	" 
			
			I can only agree on what most posters have said already. Insanity is not for beginners. It is tough and very challenging. First I did P90X almost 2 years ago but I adapted it to my own routine as I still wanted to commute by bike (2x20K) so I didn't do the cardio days. I did my own diet stuff too but still I managed to shred 8-9 kilos and reduce my BF% to around 11.    
P90X was intense so I had a 3 month break before I took on Insanity.   
Insanity is in my opinion more challenging than P90X and much more fun. It is extremely tough too and as I mentioned before it is not for beginners. If you struggle to complete the fitness test on day one I recommend you to pick another program and save Insanity for later.   
I have also bought P90X2 and Insanity Asylum but unfortunately I have been forced to rethink my exercise routines due to a painful ""Spondylarthrose""   so these two programs are on stand by until I am pain free....if ever.   
Doing Insanity is the best thing ever happened to me exercise wise.....the program kicks butt and in particular I like the fact that there is no thinking to do. Everyone can put in a DVD and follow the instructions given. You don't have to be a fitness expert to get the result you desire.   
And since the warm up is very thorough and the stretching likewise......everything is covered.   
Good luck to everyone who decide to change their life with Insanity, P90X or other BB products.   
BTW: I have just purchased Ultimate Reset and will do the program in August. It needs careful planning in order to be successful.   
More BTW: I bet most of the pictures showing ""before"" and ""after"" Insanity are true. I went from ""build"" to ""almost ripped"" in 60 days......but since I am facing fifty this year it takes a lot of effort just to maintain.....a lot!

			Hi all,   
I just came back from a surf trip to portugal and decided that I'm keen to try and do one trip a month (at least over the summerish months).   
My husband kite surfs instead so we're generally wanting to go to different places.   
I'm about a beginner-intermediate level. More beginner by australian levels and more intermediate in European eyes...   
I'm thinking about a trip to the west coast of France for a weekend in September. I've been checking flights and it seems Bordeaux is the only place you can get to with Good Friday night/Sunday night weekend flights.   
I'd love to have some company if anyone wants to join me.   
I'm also keen to  hear about if anyone has done a weekend trip surfing somewhere close(ish) to switz.

			There are now a lot of Swiss online shops for diving equipment. I do import a lot (USA / Germany) but sometime also buy here. 
A lot of the gear now sold is based on gimmicks and changes every 6 months. If I need to try a piece of equipment, need maintenance or advice then I'll buy locally. Prices in Switzerland have dropped quite a bit and are getting closer to Germany plus shipping plus VAT.

			If you are lending a bike to someone from abroad it would also be a good idea to first check if the person has proper insurance, otherwise they would be liable for any damages they do to third parties.    
The old Velo Vignette schema used to cover this cases as the insurance was per bike, until it disapeared.

			Thanks for the reply Biff, that answers all our questions and good info on the ev6. This is actually our third trip working on it, we combine business trips to Europe with vacation bike trips, and started in St Nazaire on the Atalntic. We found it easy to find bike shops in France that would rent us a bike, then pick them up where we finished but to so much in CH(actually I did find one but the cost was huge). As we get further east I think we will just buy reasonably priced bikes, keep them for a week then find a charity to give them to local kids. This time tho I think we will just train back to Basel and fly out of there. Thanks again.

			Hi 
I have a seven-year old boy and I am looking for a local football team for him to play in.  He has played the Intersoccer camps/Saturdays for a few years so has the basic skills but needs to play in a team for more experience - and it's a good way to meet more friends too.  He speaks English and French.   
Can anyone recommend a team?  Ideally in or around Lausanne North/East.   
Thanks

1812	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Martina Hingis Tested Positive for Cocaine Use at Wimbledon	Merrylegs	4,054	54	Location: Vaud/Valais	01.11.2007, 20:36	"    Nice....   
On a serious note don't they say that virtually every 20 pound note in England has traces of Cocaine? So it would be possible to come into contact with the stuff, but not internally.   
I heard there was a study to analyse sewerage pipes for cocaine traces In London, obviously it would be more accurate than a guestimate from the Govt. Quite clever I thought, I'm sure the findings were way above the expected levels of cocaine use.   
Story, from my prev workplace....   
I used to work in Forensics in the UK and one of my friends worked in the drugs lab.    
Well anyone know's after a bust they test the purity of substances so imagine the scene in a lab with 50 odd 1/2kg bricks of cocaine being weighed etc.    
Anyway back to the story, so to test drugs you need a pure substance as a reference, this happened to be 1/2kg of 99.99% pure Cocaine. Over time something strange started to happen the reference stock started disappearing quicker than was expected, and some wierd purity results were seen. All of this is controlled, signed in etc etc and I have no idea how this was done.   
Anyway it's noted that the reference block loses more that it should when one certain guy is around.    
Now at this point what would you do? Deny it, or admit it?    
The guy actually admitted it and said that he has a problem and he hasn't felt right for the last month or so after working in the lab.   
A full investigation is launched and the findings are the extraction filtration system is not good enough and hasn't ever been. So the occupants of this lab have in some cases 5yrs worth of exposure to illicit material in their system.   
At this point the company has to quickly offer alll member counciling inclusive of the guy stealing the coke and ensure that he's placed in a clinic to deal with his addiction.    
How bizarre is that? Go to work and gain a class A addiction.   
My personal favourite at this lab was watching the rasta security guard follow the weed busts around building on route to the drugs lab   "	Posts: 810	Join Date: Oct 2007	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 30 Times in 19 Posts	Thanked 1,073 Times in 463 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Hi!   
I have a similar profile (working mummy of little kids - no time to hit the gym) and a couple months back I came across Jillian Michaels and her DVD.   
I got hooked    
I completed 30 Days Shred and Ripped in 30 Days and my strength and muscle tone has really imrpoved.   
The first you find on youtube, just search 30 Days Shred Level 1 (3 levels to do over 10 days each)   
There are some high impact moves but always with a modifier if you cannot do them.   
They are 30 mins top and should be done about 5 times/week.    
I really really reccomend it    
Ciao

			Hi Everyone,   
I'm booked with a Nepalese agency to trek and climb a 6,400m peak in these little-explored regions of Nepal next Autumn 2013. The agency has a lot of experience organising such treks and their fee is all inclusive and pretty reasonable. I'm looking for more trekkers as the price per person goes down the more people join the trip. More people have climbed Everest than have explored these regions of Nepal. If anyone is interested please contact me at my avatar at aol dot com. I speak Spanish, English and French.   
Many thanks,   
Mike.

However I find that for sports I prefer contact lenses and then I can wear my cool Oakley sunglasses    
Definitely have them done outside of CH - too expensive here.   
Better to try the fitting of the frames and choose the lenses etc at a store rather than online.

just arrived in Switzerland (Basel), everything fine so far. 
Love football, and usually try to get to a game every odd weekend.  
Wondering are there any fellow mad football fans out there who would be interested in meeting up now and again for matches? In the centre of Europe there is an abundance of football we can see - in France, Switzerland, Germany and beyond!

			It could be the dealer's mate from a different IP address, but it could be totally innocent.   
There is an automatic bid function on Ricardo, for when a user may not be available when the offer closes. He just needs to put his maximum bid, and the system will out bid any other last minute bids until the maximum is reached.   
This happened to me once, and I was naturally suspicious, especially as the seller contacted me, shortly after the close of bidding, and offered me another of the same, for my last highest bid - which I declined.   
So it could be price bumping or automatic bidding.     
From Gonsers own site:       
If it goes above 257,00 drop out.

			I'm a member of wellness parc at Heuwaage as posted above.  I think it's well run and always very clean and the clases are excellent too.  Sometimes gets a bit busy in the pool at the w-ends but that's to be expected I guess.

			Hi Sandra,    
I am going to the Silhouette (Bellevue) Fitness Studio, they have like 5 gyms around the city; I go mostly for Yoga and Pilates 2 or 3 times a week, and would like to do more, but I'm in the same position as you with the motivation part, feels boring and intimidating going alone, plus I have not idea about how to use those machines or how to correctly lift the weights. Let me know if wanna give it a try, I can actually invite you ( or anyone)  for a ""prove tag"". PM me if interested.   
Have a great weekend   "	Posts: 2	Join Date: Oct 2010	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			SAA Works very hard to have almost zero no shows on their events. All the events run are accessible from Zurich. The feeling is that anyone can take a run down the Antenna trail at any time, so while the evenings are long we try to get people out of the city and show options that most people wouldn't otherwise think about. You would be surprised how much stuff is actually quite easily accessible from Zurich after work.    
As an example next Tuesdays afterwork ride is nearer Luzern, but a number of people still travel from Zurich for it. Coming up there will be rides on Geissberg, Altberg, Zugerberg and at some point we may even revisit Uetliberg again.    
If that is not your cup of tea there is always the option to suggest a ride that you find more suitable. With over 800 members and nearly 200 events in the last 18 months I don't know of any more active cycling communities in Switzerland.

			Hi eveybody,   
I recently moved to Basel and I am looking for a Pilates studio where to do exercises with reformer and cadillac.. I surfed the net but all the places I was able to find offer this kind of training only individually, which to me is a bit too expensive.. I used to have classes with maximum 4 people and that was really ideal..   
Thanks for any suggestion you might be willing to share with me!

I should probably have written this post under shopping, but I am hoping that more golfer will actually see this post if it is under sports...   
I am suffering from ulnar nerve entrapment and need to keep my elbow straight when sleeping. Does anyone know where I could buy a golf swing trainer brace like the one by keep it straight? I have seen a similar brace by another brand,  but this one makes a tic-toc sound every time you start bending your elbow. THis would obviously disturb me when I am trying to sleep...  
Thank you in advance for your help..

			How far are you willing to travel? I've recently been to the newly renovated outdoor pool (Töss Side) in Rorbas (between Bülach & Embrach). It's a 50m pool, and the entire length for about 1/4 of the width of the pool is shallow. It opens at 10am and the first hour or so is pretty quiet so would be good for a learner to practice. It's CHF 6 for the entrance fee.

I'm new on this forum. I just wanted to ask if there's a website of sorts that I can find people to play tennis with? I'd also like to ask on here if anyone would like to play tennis sometime between June 22nd and July 12th, as well as June 15th. I'm 16 years old and none of my friends play tennis seriously. Just looking to variate my sports as the summer starts. 
I live in the Hünenberg area and I'd be willing to travel to Zug-Baar to play, 
I don't think Zurich will be worth the investment of a train ticket :-)

I have an Aussie friend coming to visit from the 9-15th July. He's a keen climber.   
We'll be going to Sutter's BBQ party near Romanshorn on Sat 14th, but if anyone has anything planned for the 15th, climbing, hiking etc, please let me know as he'd love to meet some people and tag along.    
Unfortunately, I have three kids and anyway, not a climber...   
Alternatively, if anyone's keen to go hiking in Zernez / Val Mustair / Scuol on Sunday 14th and Monday 15th, that's our backup plan, with the vague possibility of going white-water rafting in Scuol on the Monday.

I'll second the Basel Dragons recommendation.  They run on Mondays and Thursdays for regular runs, and there is a smaller group that run on Saturday mornings for long runs (to train for marathons).  You can find their info on meetup.com.  Just Google ""Basel Dragons"" and you will find the link.

Oh, I forgot. If you have an Android (or poss. iPhone, I don't know) you could start out with the ""Couch Potato To 5k"" app. There are a few around, actually, but the one I started with is by Zen Labs. It will get you from doing nothing to, well, running 5k in a few weeks on a planned programme that I can tell you simply works.

			Hi All,    
I organised a two-day intro climbing course in Interlaken on Thurs - Fri, 27-28 June. Unfortunately, the two friends planning to visit Switzerland have had to rearrange plans and can no longer join.   
So, having seen a few posts about climbing - I thought I'd open it up and see if there are two folks that would like to join. Will be perfect for anyone with limited / no climbing experience, a good level of fitness, and a great sense of adventure!   
Cost of the climbing course is CHF 280 per day.    
Cheers,    
Scott

			I have just completed my 270 hour yoga alliance certified teacher's training in Prague.  I have studied many forms of yoga - from Jivamukti to Sivananda to Ashtanga - but I am the most inspired by Hatha yoga.  It has always been a part of my life and in recent years has become a true passion.  I truly believe it can add so much to your life to remember again how your body can move when it isn't forced, but accepted.  And learning how to breathe again as an adult is just as centering.

			I think the Aussies faced similar crisis in the mid eighties post retirement of the Chappels. But it took a guy like Border to mend things up. But at least then the domestic cricket was still a robust structure. I hear horror stories these days from friends down under. But I still think Aussies will not go the WI way. WI losses a great deal of talent to Yankee sports like Volleyball and Baseball.

			Go to   and check their stringing machines. AFAIK they're the cheapest I could find. The shipment costs you few extra bucks but not much and all you need to pay is 7.6% Merwersteuer tax. Altogether it was around CHF50 + stringing machine price.

			I am struggling to find any dinghy racing on the north shore of Lac Leman. For example in Morges where I work there is the Club Nautique who organise races on a Tuesday night but they are for large keelboats. I think there is a guy with an RS 600 who races but  the courses are too long for my little Laser.    
They do have Laser races but only for kids sailing 4.7 rigs.   
There appears to be some Laser racing or training at University in Lausanne but I think that is only for people with a link to the Uni.    
Am I missing something? Is there any dinghy racing at Neuchatel?

I would just like to know if anyone knows the location of a good gym i could use for the summer. In the area of Chambesy to Coppet (so along that train line). I have heard about Silhouettes which have the one in Mies-Versoix which is the one i would use. However no where online can i find the prices. Im looking for a 3 month membership as I re-start university in September. Also with regards to the Silhouettes one, i have heard that if you take the regular membership it automatically renews? (something i do not want)   
If you guys could please clarify my questions on Silhouettes with regards to price and membership types, and also if any of you know better gyms between Chambesy and Coppet i would gladly listen to your suggestions.   
Thank you very much

If bringing your bike on the train, one generally needs a bike ticket; not having one can result in a rather expensive fine. Also, on some routes bikes are not allowed during peak travel time.

			Anyone here also use Garmin Connect to record or search for training activities? If so, is there any way to save the filters for ""Explore activities"" in your profile? I've looked everywhere, but it doesn't seem to exist, or I haven't looked in the right place. Every time I want to see if there is an interesting route near me, I have to eff around with the explore filters.

1941	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Football or tennis groups for children in English around Bern	chinagirl	473	0	Location: Bern	14.05.2013, 10:09	" 
			
			Hello 
I'm not sure if I should post here or in 'Family Matters', but I'm trying to find out about football or tennis groups in English for my 6 yr old son. This is intended as more of a social thing than to improve skills, so group lessons preferred for tennis rather than private. He's already wrestling with Swiss German at school, so I wanted to find him a social activity with other English-speaking kids to give him a break. 
Does anyone know of anything suitable in or near Bern? 
Thanks!

			There is the occassional community wrorkshop for bikes in Europe - I have come across the in neighbouring France, but have personally only come across one this side of the border.  (though others may exisit).    
I have bought both metric and nonmetric allen keys from the same bike shop here. With those and an adjustable wrench , there is little basic maintainence that I can't do when touring.    
Yes, bikes are cheaper to buy over the German and French borders.  Can you be specific about what sort of bike you are looking for? Brand?    
If it was me who was able to freight a bike over, without cost, I would do so. I would imagine that tools are also cheaper to buy in the USA than here ( this side of the border) so would also look at buying the basics keys, wrench, chain tool etc and shipping those over as well.

			Absolutely - and as for adults, most villages and towns have got a or many local clubs. But yes, some clubs are more competitive than others. Our local one is great - and one of the few clubs here where the local Swiss and French kids from the village across the border play and practise together. Great.

If you have a ""Presta"" valve (French valve) or even worse - a woods valve, I'd suggest that you pick up your own pump to carry on you at all times.   
I think most service stations also carry the adaption, so just ask inside if you get stuck.

The way you enjoy a bike in a relatively safe environment such as a circuit and the possibility to really push to the limits makes all the difference. And you learn a lot. 
But yes, nice mountains to climb up are defenitely my cup of tea!

			I'll be moving to Geneva in about three months' time, and I have a few  questions which I haven't been able to find the answers to on any of the  guide websites. I'm hoping someone here can help me    
I  am a reasonably experienced and capable rider, and here in Australia I  often school and exercise other people's horses (because on a student  budget I can't afford my own). Is this something which is commonly done  in and around Geneva? How do horse owners find people to help exercise  their horses?   
We have an organisation called Equestrian Australia  which provides its members with insurance for horse-related injuries.  Is there a similar organisation in Switzerland, or are horse-related  injuries usually covered by health insurance?   
I wasn't sure what  section to put this in, so I've also posted it in the Pets section.  Admins are welcome to delete whichever one is in the wrong place.

			Paddy,   
I used to ride with a bunch of guys in Australia and they were getting multiple punctures all over the place. I became a professional tire change watcher, sometimes I helped with the occasional hint they should try running tubeless . I run tubeless tires with the goop in them, they are a little heavier but I have never had a flat in over 18 months of riding on them. I now swear by them. I have a spare tube just in case, its pretty painless to put a tube in if u do have a flat. Flats have become a thing of the past for me.   
Hope the alternative approach helps.

There are other professional Pilates studios in Zurich but you should be careful choosing one. PM me if you need more info about it. My friend is certified Romana's Pilates so I know a bit about it. 
At the moment I am interested in joining duo Pilates class with a partner as private sessions are too expensive. I can pay 110 CHF per session for 3 maybe 4 months but not longer. If you think of regular workouts contact me.

			Hi there - Welcome to the Forum 
The Swiss idea of 'spontaneous' is making plans about three weeks ahead (and this is for an invitation to a cup of coffee).    
Switzerland is basically not a disability friendly country. Things are improving but I've said before that the main reason that the Swiss are so good at the longer distances in wheelchair racing, is because they are used to racing from one WC suitable for wheelchairs to the next! There are hills all over the place. Some new trains have wide doorways and are roll-in, roll-off. Some trains have narrow doorways and narrow steps. Some trains have broad doorways but stop at stations where descending from the carriage is training for coming down from the Matterhorn! Restaurants often have steps all over the place and ramps tend to be steep.   
There are lots of rules regarding dogs and bringing them into the country involves about three hundred of them.  I'm not trying to put you off but forewarned is forearmed. Check out 'Meloncollie' on here for excellent dog advice and loads of tips.   
Since you say you speak some German, I suggest you take a look at this site -    is the 'Home' of Disabilty Sport in Switzerland and has links to the Swiss Paralympic folk who will have far more detailed information than we have on here. Try under 'Leichtathletic' for handbike stuff. Swiss Skiing is clear. I would e-mail them and ask for suggestions and advice. The national teams travel a lot for training and competition and will know all the tricks of the trade and the best places for you to enjoy your sport.    
Be prepared for this sort of thing... I asked at the cash desk of an indoor swimming pool, if the cashier could take care of a perfectly behaved Guide Dog, while the swimmer, who is blind,  took part in a training session in my group. The reply - 'We cannot start doing that or everyone would be asking. If the lady comes by car, she could leave the dog in the car...'   
Good luck in your plan making.

1984	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Advice re Brit looking to train as a Beautician	Karen1983	605	0	Location: Riehen, Basel	26.04.2013, 23:02	" 
			
			Hello,   
Before I start, a brief intro about myself, I am British from London, 30 years of age and I have been living in Basel for over 2 years now with my husband - I speak no German and I work 80% with my current employer.    
Now to my situation - since being in Basel I feel I have a lot more time on my hands compared to when I was living in London, so I have taken to doing things that I would not normally have the time to do, these are mainly pampering myself with Beauty treatments i.e. doing my own fake nails, pedi, mani, waxing, facials etc...the reason I did this is I struggled to find someone in Basel who did the job properly or to the standard I am used to (I am quite picky with beauty treatments and I am sorry to any qualified beauticians) and thought I could do this myself.  So I did. From time to time  people comment on my nails and ask where I go and I say I did them myself, same with my mani, pedi etc. This has got me thinking and I would like to go back to the UK to train as Beautician.   
And to my questions - does anyone feel like Basel is lacking good Beauticians at reasonable prices? Would this be of interest to people? Or could I be wasting my time?   
I have discussed with friends already who think it is a good idea. If all works well, I will do a few courses this summer and then look to do treatments in my spare time and day off, mobile or at my home and then the price list will be based be similar to UK converted into CHF.   
Look forward to any advice and I will keep you posted on my training   "	Posts: 11	Join Date: Apr 2011	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 5 Times in 4 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Hi - my 11 year old son is interested in playing sports for the next couple of months until we leave Switzerland at the end of the school year.  He was very busy through the winter playing ice hockey for the Lausanne HC and skiing.  However, now that it's the end of April, he is looking to play/do almost anything - soccer, baseball, tennis, fitness training, ball hockey, etc. - to stay busy after school and on the weekends.    
Can anyone recommend any clubs, group or organizations that he could participate with for this time period, especially in the day/evenings after school?  His French is good.     
Thank you.

Having said that, I found it a great machine and I regret parting with it.

1993	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Avalanche Backpacks- Considering one? Check this out.	pensrud	3,610	39	Location: SG	02.02.2013, 19:35	"    I agree you have a better chance if you are still harnessed to your airbag but there is no guaranty that it will keep you afloat as many people have been completely buried with it on, although not as deep as if without.  As for your first statement in most cases you have time to deploy your abs and insert mouth piece as that should not take more than half a second.  The avalanche I was buried in took quit some time before it buried me,  I was almost able to cut out of it but hit a rock, fell over, buried.  My point is, most of the time you do have the time to use both and even try to swim or try to cut out of it.  Again too many variables to say anything with certainty.

			Anyone who is interested in Chess (in or around Zug) has a great opportunity to watch some real world class Grandmaster action - The FIDE Zug Grand Prix being held in Cham from 18th to 30th April.   
There has been a surprising lack of publicity around this event which is strange because the event features some real superstars of world chess including Veselin Topalov (ex World Champion), Hikaru Nakamura (US Champion), Sergey Karjakin, Ponomariov, Peter Leko and Alexander Morozevich.    
Here is the link to the official tournament site which contains details about venue, timings etc.      
The tournament goes on till April 30th. Also a fantastic opportunity to take your kids who might be interested. There is live commentary in the Hotel lobby with moves being displayed on a projector.   
Regards 
J

			Hey, I am more than happy to lead you through the Ashtanga poses free, at least I am not practicing on my own and would be happy to share my knowledge. I did my teacher training in India and teach modified Ashtanga, so suitable for beginners and I can teach Pranayama too. 
I had a accident last week so for few weeks I can not practice, but if you send your phone number get back to you as soon as I can and we can meet up and practice. What do you think?

I generally buy kit in Chamonix France or from Ebay Germany, which seems to have the best deals on Skis / Tranceivers / ABS sacks / Shovels & probes which you should have if you plan any off piste skiing.

It's not really in the Geneva area, more like the vicinity, but in Lausanne there is a well-organized touch rugby group playing regular games. They're holding their open day on April 28th.   
Click  for some info about that event.

2008	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Glasses for cycling	Jonesy	1,378	15	Location: Zürich	11.04.2013, 17:04	"    Okay.....if it isn't too late to avoid being anal I will say this. 
The Asian dude bought a specific pair of glasses from CRC (most likely as why else would he make a review on their store?) So in my view he is obviously reviewing the glasses they sent him and since he bought them in Europe and intend to put them on his Chinese face, they will not fit well (as CRC sells the European model and not the Asian model).   
If a reviewer of a lens xxx ""feels"" that the lens is sharper than xxx, he is right. Not that the lens is sharper but that he feels that it is sharper despite any test saying opposite. If he had wrote that the lens ""is"" sharper he would be wrong.    
So any review have to be sorted into ""facts"" and ""feelings"" because even though I read reviews myself in order to learn about other peoples experience with a specific product, it is important so know what is facts related to a product and what is a personal opinion.   
See.....I had to be anal   "	Posts: 505	Join Date: Jan 2012	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 20 Times in 11 Posts	Thanked 56 Times in 46 Posts	considered unworthy

Ahhh, music to my ears, I got scared off Engelberg a bit this year, crowds and movement of queues was just horrendous the few times I went early on, and made a habit of checking the cams even if I werent there and was always heaving on the ticket office cam.   
Well I think I had packed up by this time past two seasons, so I can understand the mindset, but as you say, so much snow I want to make the most of it.   
I suspect it will be my last as got some busy weekends coming up, and some studying to get into........ . May is particularly busy, but maybe, just maybe, there will be another day in April.

I have already contacted the manufacturer who can send me a new motor, but they do not have any contacts in Switzerland who are able to install it... My 
usual electrician has also come and taken a look - he advises me a specialist in 
treadmills or at least electronic equipment will need to fix it, but again, he 
has no contacts who do this work.   
Any leads / ideas greatly appreciated. I am located just outside Lausanne, if 
that helps.

			Hi,   
I am considering having hd brows as my eyebrows are quite patchy due to over plucking when younger.   
Has anybody had this procedure done and can perhaps recommend a salon in the Zürich area?   
Many thanks in advance.

			X-bionic is ""functional"" compression under garments and will have little effect on warmth vs classic odlo or whatever but is purposefully really tight to lower fatigue and help recovery.    
I've never tried more than compression socks, but most people who try those from xbionic or other makes are positive that they do help. I will certainly be using mine on the slopes this year, as I think lowering the swelling and expansion of the lower legs will avoid ski boot discomfort.   
As to whether its worth the money that's your call.  Just like you can get a 10 CHF watch to tell you the time...

I'm actually going to give a few lessons to a girl I know in Lausanne in the coming weeks. We skated other other weekend and I think she felt she really improved.   
They are one-to-one but if I have time afterwards or before, I'd be happy to skate with you guys. 
Just let me know. Or I'll try to post on here when I know when I'm going so I can try to meet after or before.        
Hope the weather gets a bit better... otherwise will have to buy little umbrellas for our skates....

i'm looking to pick up tennis again and play for a very competitive women's league here in Switzerland.  
I grew up playing tennis in Arizona, played DI college tennis in the US, and taught tennis at various clubs in my early 20's. After a much needed break from the sport, I'm ready to play again!   
Anyone know any clubs on the Horgen side of the lake that might suit my level?    
many thanks!

2040	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Altitude acclimatisation	PTKate	693	4	Location: St Cergue, canton Vaud, CH	28.03.2013, 12:17	" 
			
			In mountaineering the thought is ""climb high, sleep low"".   
Even if you aren't training just being at altitude for the days before the race will help out.  But you loose acclimatization fast, so if you can you should stay slightly below your race altitude at least the day before.  Don't go all the way back into the valley.   
I've done a fair bit of high altitude mountaineering.  What works best for me is to drink a lot of water and gain altitude slowly.  The better hydrated you are the less chance you'll get headaches.  And if that fails, try some ibuprofen and relax.  And it that fails, it's time to descend.   
You'll be in the AMS zone altitude-wise, but it sounds like you're training pretty seriously, and as long as you listen to your body you should be fine.

It was a cheap bike and wasn't worth the money to fix it.   
Fixies are pretty hard to ride, and the whole 'fixed' thing freaks me out a bit. It seems to be a whole lot of trouble for the benefits fixie riders say it's worth.   
My gears were crap, and rather than replace the derailer, I just shortened the chain to the most common gear I used.   
Obviously the bike was stupidly light afterwards which was great, and I've since seen other people who also just buy a single gear cog, and spacer unit to fully replace the rear cassette. I just didn't want to spend anthing on the bike.       
I kept the brake cables, solid freewheeling single gear racer...... great bike now.

			Stoos is brilliant for the views.  Not so for beginner skiers.   
For pre-intermediate + skiers, Fronalpstock has excellent runs, especially in the morning.  They become slushy in the afternoon as the sun warms the slopes.  Some of the best views in Kanton Schwyz can be seen from the top of Fronalpstock.     
Klingenstock is fantastic for intermediate + skiers.  Not many people and steeper slopes.  The butt-warming chairlift in cold weather adds to the enjoyment of the day.   
If you can barely snowplow or make turns, the only lift advisable is Sternegg, located in the middle of the village.

			Thanks for the replies and info guys, especially about what these yellow areas are all about......in our group we have a mix of experience and ownership of kit, but we can easily rent it.  As you said, if nothing else then being prepared is good practice for future occasions too and keeps the habit of of a sensible approach to all off piste activities

If you want, you can also register as an individual and we will place you in a team. Playing times will be Tuesday and/or Wednesday between 18:00 and 22:00 (depending on various factors). We have a new, state of the art, facility as of next week which, is very exciting.   
See you all soon.

			Hi All - I am about to put a post up about road cycling in Zug but thought I would say a quick hi here also. Moved to Zug a few months ago and got the bike out last weekend - felt great to be back in the saddle. I need to be in some serious training over the next months as I am doing the London, Brussels, Amsterdam challenge - 550km in 4 days in August. 
Here is the twist, i am not what you would usually see on a bike! I am very overweight, unfit in comparisson to the local cyclists and probably go at a snails pace! Is there anyone out there who wants to take it easy, at least for the next month or so?

I like your attitude.    
I would be happy to ride with you, and i don't care about a slightly longer drive to explore a new resort and be the first on the mountain.   
Will be doing weekends in the mountains for the rest of the season, so hopefully we will be able to find a day that works.

Like most Swiss village/town Skiclubs, they seem to be focussed primarily on racing, and if that's what you're looking for then I'm sure they'll be fine. (But I have no first-hand experience of them).   
If you're looking more for a general ski teaching and progression, focussing more on individual needs and learning, then you might consider the     program in Engelberg. Runs for 4, 8 or 12 weeks through the season, full day on Saturday or Sunday including lunch.    
(And just for reference I'm an instructor there but don't run these kid's courses myself).

			I know the Zug question is from a couple of months ago but if it helps anyone else..... There are gymnastics classes in Cham (near Zug).  My daughter did the MUKI turnen when she was small but i know that there are classes for older kids too.  Their website is   The classes would be in German.   
Otherwise if you do a google search with 'Jugendturnen Zug' there are other classes around the Zug area.  
Likewise with Bülach if you google Jugendturnen and Bulach you may find something. 
Good Luck!

2098	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Summer Skiing in Switzerland?	qwidgibo	859	2	Location: Genève CH	06.03.2013, 08:34	" 
			
			I think Zermatt, Saas Fee, or Glacier 3000 are the only options in Switzerland.    
Many pro skiers come to train in the summer. In Zermatt 1 piste is taken up with gates, one is made into a world cup mogul course, which leaves 1 piste and the park for free skiers. The lifts are open from 0630-1300, it takes with the large queues 1 - 1.5 hours to get up there. So you need to stay the night before. Also it is prone to high winds and regularly doesn't open which is frustrating!   
Everywhere in Switzerland is reachable by public transport. Zermatt has a train station, Saas Fee you get the train to Stalden-Saas then get a bus.

Did you miss the bit where I said   The taking of photos of people   is a bit off though.       Yes, they often do. E.g. at Engelberg, all five of us have to queue to get the tickets, as we have two adults, one student, one youth and a child - all requiring verification, and must be present at time of purchase.       Specifically, I've been at Ski Amadé (Austria). They   require a photograph for day passes less than 9 days.  In the ten different resorts I've stayed at over the last ten years in four different countries, I've never had a photocard for a 4/5/6 day card. I discussed this on a skiing forum, and most people there were surprised at the requirement.   
What's really stupid, and probably why they don't mention that they photograph you through the barriers, is that if you want to cheat the system, it's really simple. The two of you just need to be of similar build and wear similar clothes/helmets/scarves.

			What is the appropriate age to ride with a parent down the Zugerberg run (sledging / sledding)?  I have a 3 1/2 yr old that would ride down with me.    
On the same note are there any good places to just go sledding down a basic hill near Zug/Baar or does everyone go to formal runs? Any hill with snow on it was fair game when I was a kid but I don't want to break any Swiss customs.

			I've got 2 kayaks, with one already committed for the event. You're welcome to use the other as long as you can transport it. It's a single seater 5m long Lettmann Magellan Touring Plus. You can transport it on a car roof or by bike! It's a long haul back from Züri to Richterswil by bike though, but would make a nice workout.

K7 is a bit more expensive and the feel is different which I like better. I'd say that the routes in the back room in Weil (lead only) are higher than the ones you'll find in Basel.    
But the number of routes are probably the same. In Weil you also get free access to the sauna when you climb.   
Guess, you need to try either and figure which one you like the most.

			Hmm. I have been skiing since my 6th, and have been taking lessons until after my 25th. My wife has been skiing for 4 seasons, and my 9y/o kids outski her. Anyway, here is my 0.02p.   
Hire a private instructor for the both of you. My kids learned from a french ski instructor without knowing one word of french. Language is not important, you should not be talking anyway. Learning how to ski is done by example, and then try to reproduce it one step at a time.    
""Variation"" of skislopes is BS for beginners. You will not be able to enjoy the panorama nor the ""variation"" of the skislope until you know how to brake, how to turn, how to avoid colliding into each other, how to fall, and then how to get up again. It is all part of the learning curve, and it should be fun. If it is not fun, get another instructor. Once you know how to do all that and still enjoy yourself, only then start looking for ""nicer"" slopes and bigger ski areas.    
Usually, absolute beginners would start with moving around on skis on a flat area. One ski, then two skis. Learn how to climb a small hill using your skis (and not take the lift). Learn how to get down that small hill while staying vertical. Learn the pizzapoint, and move on to parallel skiing after a few years. Only a very few areas teach parallel skiing from the start with relatively short (1.20m) skis, and progressively move to longer skis when skills improve. More expensive.   
Anyway, all of that can be done in all ski areas. You will only know whether there is chemistry between you and the ski instructor after you have met him/her. As mentioned, just change instructors if he doesn't fullfill all your needs (there is a limit though). As long as you don't expect to ski down a red slope after 1 week you should be fine. After 5 days 2h/day instruction most people are able to navigate down a blue slope without too many falls.   
I don't know either of Pizol/Sattel areas. Just pick the one where you can get the easiest/quickest. Or, if costs are an issue, where costs are the lowest. The advantage of a slightly larger area, like Sorenberg, Flumserberg, Brig, Engelberg, is that they have more ski instructors. Usually they are also slightly more expensive.    
Make sure to get a good ski outfit, because if you are cold you will definitely not like it, however good the ski instructor.    
Arriving at around 9-10am is not early. Most lifts open at 8:45am. Most courses would start at 10am, but hiring a private ski instructor would probably allow you to pick your hours yourself. Also, take into account that it may take quite some time to get from the railway station up to the slopes. Are you going to rent your skis? Do you still need to fit shoes? The first day, that may take an hour or two as well, depending on the popularity of the place.

Likewise, just because shops in Engelberg - which probably have a bigger concentration of potential customers in resort than my local shop - can sell at lower prices, doesn't mean that is the norm either.

If you feel you can sell the remaining, then go for the 12 month plan.  Just stop payment will get your name on the register of non-payers, which will bite you if you ever show up in Switzerland.   
Otherwise, if I may ask, why go into a contract longer than your expected stay in Switzerland?  Spring and Summer will be here before you know it - why not test your discipline and do your yoga or aerobics in the living room?  Come on, it is only five to six months.... you can do it!!

Anyway I've been to Silverstone twice, and I booked flights to go to New York and then they cancelled the race (grr).  
I want to go this year. From here I think monza, Barcelona, Germany or Belgium would be ok. But sadly I don't know what would be cheaper.   
I booked through Silverstone circuit and f1.com, the circuit was cheaper and you tend to get discount on accommodation if you do it that way.

			It can be detrimental. If you have probs with knees, best is to run on softer grounds. Threadmill really useful here. With time, and some weights training, you get stronger muscels around the ligaments, then you can start running on harder ground. But best to avoid concrete - it is much harder than tarmac.    
Also, including some uphill parts during your runs helps with strengthening your knees.    
The trick is to take it easy, build up gradually and listen to your body... and enjoy our run.    
Cycling as countertraining is also recommended.

			hello,    
I had bought a pair of Strolz 4 years ago in a Stoeckli shop. 
First I found that the buckles were amazingly old fashioned and that the styling  was inexistant, but then it^s the made-to-measure inner boot that makes them interesting. they cost about 900 CHF. They were very hard to get in: the holes (left after removal of the plastic tubes) had a bit of hardened foam around them, and were placed at a sensitive spot over the ankles. They were just uncomfortable.  
Bad molding ? bad technician ? Maybe, but he was a seasoned practitioner.   
So I gave them back and he made me a pair of Tecnicas, with competition Conformable inner boots, just like I had before. 
So maybe I was used to to the second brand.  
Nevertheless, in comparison, Strolz has no advantages whatsoever.

Also, the runs are listed in difficulty from easy to difficult.  Maybe I'm just stupid, but what exactly is a difficult toboggan run?   Not looking for a luge ride here, but I'd like for it to be fast enough to be fun.

			Hi all, 
I visited Dart Club Basel last Thursday. 
It is great atmosfear and good darts in one place. 
But I have to say it is not a place for beginners   You have to be a good player to beat any of the lads in the club

			I think most of the local clubs start when kids are a bit older.... ask at your Gemeindehaus or Kreisburo they'll know who to contact (or google Fussball Verein in your village or district).     
It's a big decision though, our lives changed considerably once football commitments started. Training two evenings each week from 6-8 pm and matches on Saturdays in random locations at varying times ... don't rush!  Wait til he begs. Then he'll appreciate it more.

			I own the Lightning Ascent 25"". Have really abused them and they are great for climbing.   
Just so you know, in the MSR LA range, there are the 22"" women's model (they are cut differently), the 25"" mens and the 30"" mens.   
Assuming your friend is a man, the choice is 25"" or 30"". Some of it depends on the height and weight, and as well the planned usage. The 30"" is useful in really deep snow (especially if the person is heavier). The 25"" will be easier for the climbing (if you decide to climb up a ski hill for example).

A coach picks up the kids from various pick-up points in the morning and drops them back at the end of each day.

Click on the site, and click on Ski area finder. Enter your desired amenities, desired driving distance, resort size, etc.   
I use the ski area finder often. Great tool. Good luck.    
If you have been on the slopes, found your edges again, and want some tips on great resorts, can throw some your direction. Let me know.   
Resorts near you worth looking into: Flims Laax Falera, Flumserberg, Toggenburg, Engleberg Titlis, Brandertal (good resort for families; In Austria).    
If not those, look into others near you, smaller ones.

We can all go jogging together when the weather gets warmer out. I live near the Thalwissenstrasse tram stop and usually go jogging Sunday mornings when it's nice. It's much pleasant and enjoyable to go jogging in groups of 2-3 people that way we can all challenge each other. I will be in contact with whomever sends me their email/mobile number.

I've recently joined an archery club in Zurich and I'm looking for an affordable place to get my equipment. The club itself sells all kind of equipment but compared to online shops it's way more expensive. 
The online option is always there but I'm woindering if any of you know of any archery specialised shops in Konstanz or any other nearby town in Germany where I could get stuff at euro prices and if possible get VAT refunded. 
If you know of any general sports stores that have a good archery section will also be interesting.

			Hi all,    
I've been to Arvenbuhl once and plan to go back this weekend. Am looking for advice from people that know those slopes if I can?   
I'm sort of new to snowboarding. I've done some lessons and days on the board and am starting to get a bit better. The last time I went to Arvenbuhl I was comfortable on the ""Arven"" & ""Leistkamm"" lifts. What I'm trying to find is the piste in the area which is the next level up. Something a bit more steep / difficult to keep testing my skills but not crazy hard. The problem is the piste map shows all runs as Red      
I've never tried to other run in Arvenbul (Sell) or been to Amden yet.    
Is the Sell run harder than the ones I've tried or am I better going to Amden? If Amden, which are the easiest runs there for me to ease myself up the difficulty ladder?   
Apologies if this sounds like a dumb question just want to keep getting better bit by bit and not take a sudden leap onto a mad difficult slope and freak out

I went to Fitness plus after that, most of the classes were crowded but there was at least so much space so that I could enjoy the class.  
I really loved the Body Combat (fight) and the Body Balance (yoga, thai chi, streching).   
Now I use Joggeli, it is no so crowded but most of the classes are boring.   
There is a ""Schnupperklasse"" everywhere, you can try the gym and one class free. In Migros I also used the three months trial. I would just go to the reception and tell them I want the Schnupperklasse and then the 3 months.

My wife and I are moderate ,15 to 20 k per day hikers. I want to use next Sunday to begin to explore some wonderful places .   
Are there recommendations of where we can get to ? Do not want rock climbing but do not mind a mountain climb that is not too steep . 
I know its likely to be snowy so really we do not want too high where it will be up to our knees but would love some underfoot. 
A circular trail starting or finishing near a rail or bus stop would be excellent . 
I do not mind travelling for an hour plus to get there . 
Ten kms or therabouts would be fine .... i just really want to get ourselves off to a good start where perhaps we can have a recommended restaurant for lunch or dinner at the end .   
Many thanks in advance for any help given . 
It is greatly and deeply appreciated

There then followed 40 minutes of fantastic football... 2 late, really spectacular Bologna goals.. a 'chuck everything at it' extra 30 minutes and a last minute winner from Inter.

			Hi, anyone knows or suggest a good diving center in Zurich? 
I'm OWD but I really need to refresh and improve my level (breathing). 
I had a look on what google says, but I haven't found a place where I can go and do exercises. Most of them offer just the main courses only. I remember back in Lugano there was a school that did weekly meeting at the pool just for exercises and stuff..   
thanks,

2214	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Want to Learn Scuba Diving? [lake Zurich in English]	snowdiver	7,601	39	Location: Zurich	16.04.2008, 21:20	"    Yes, you should get a medical. The BSAC makes the following additional recommendations about when it is appropriate for Asthmatics to dive:   
Asthma may predispose to pulmonary barotrauma and air embolism, which may be fatal. An acute asthma attack can also cause severe dyspnoea which may be hazardous or fatal during diving. However, there is no evidence that the mild, well-controlled allergic asthmatic is at significantly more risk.   
Asthmatics may dive if they have allergic asthma, but not if they have cold, exercise or emotion induced asthma.   
Ashtmatics should not dive if they have any chest symptoms, have needed a therapeutic bronchodilator in the last 48 hours, or regularly need to use a bronchodilator.    
During the diving season the asthmatic should take bd peak flows. A deviation of 10% from best values should exclude diving until within 10% of best values for at least 48 hours before diving.

I would love to say that snow boarders are wayyy cooler (Which i know is not a cool thing to say ) but seeing as I have quite literally broken my arse twice sprained both knees (At the same time), sprained both elbows (At the same time) hurt my neck and back, face planted and belly dived on sooo many occasions i hurt thinking about them .....but anyways... thats not cool    
What i will say though, is that snowboarding is kick ass hard work that requires alot of time, dedication and patience....

2218	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Skiing lessons in Switzerland	raghava2285	5,371	28	Location: Glanzenburg	28.10.2012, 16:44	"    I disagree. At Engleberg, there are great beginners slope at the village level on one side, and up just one short lift level on the other side. So one need not pay for passes to the top of the mountain. Perfect for beginners to have lessons, then to practice what they have been taught.    
As a teacher, I tend to be critical of the teaching ability of others ( ie: knowing a subject well does not necessarily make anyone a good teacher) however, I cannot fault the instruction given by Ace1, for anyone who wants an instructor who has English as a native language.

			Sauerland put on some big events across the border in Germany, some of which are fairly close by and manageable. However I've been to funerals with better atmospheres than German boxing matches. The Klitschko's have both boxed in Bern in recent years and there was another Heavyweight bought in Zürich involving Evander Holyfield not so long ago. Again the atmosphere in these fights wasn't the best.    
There are some smaller shows put on in Switzerland however I've no experience with them. You can perhaps get more info at  .

			Hi All,   
I live in Zug and would like to go out snowboarding to wherever is close and accessible from my place.   
Have snowboarded for 3-4 times but no proper training, so I feel like my snowboarding skills are very little (I can go down bunny slope no problem but questioning my technique still).   
I was wondering if there's anyone who can recommend a good snowboard teacher/class. Or if there are any private mentors who can go every weekend with me to train my snowboard skills.   
Thanks in advance.

			We have just come back from a 3 day trip to Davos, which was simply great.    
We booked last minute and ended up staying at Solaria ( ) which was OK (clean, new, cheap parking and central), but not great because of service. Friends stayed at Parkhotel and loved it ( )    
Overall, I would highly recommend Davos because of the slopes and the size of the town itself. Have fun exploring, wherever you go!   "	Posts: 60	Join Date: Mar 2012	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 27 Times in 14 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Hi, 
Well over 40 people have joined the ski group so far. and 6 of us went to Engelberg before xmas. I have arranged a trip to Feldberg which is a German resort in the Black Forest very close to Basel for Jan 12th. It is more suitable for beginners and intermediates, which I will use to practice my techniquebut there are apparently some more challenging runs which I will hit once I am bored. 
As far as logistics go, getting to quite a few resorts is easy from Basel either by train using the sbb snow n rail discount, this is easy and the stations have storage facilities, I take my boots and skis on the train, or you can use the snownrail discount at intersports shops.  And nowhere is particularly far by car.  
This is a very useful website.    "	Posts: 318	Join Date: Apr 2012	Senior Member	Groaned at 5 Times in 4 Posts	Thanked 275 Times in 149 Posts	earned the respect of many

Is anyone interested in sharing tennis lessons?   
I'm planning on taking a few after these holiday seasons. I've been looking around but the costs are a bit high and though it would be a good idea to get a partner to share them.   
We just moved into this area, so I'm not familiar with what this part of Zurich is called, but Greiffensee, Uster, Wetzikon, Gossau (zh) seem to be the biggest towns around here.

			Brunni and Klostermatte in Engelberg, Klostermatte has moving carpet and easy slope for beginners and being located in the valley is easy to access. For more advanced and dedicated run then Brunni is above 1600 m with a yeti kids park for real little ones and a dedicated sledge run reached with a chairlift. Grindewald has some of the classic runs, if the run to the valley is closed from kliene scheidegg area usually this is not a problem as you can pick up the train for the last stop. Some of the runs in the first area are truly spectacular with either an hour or 2 hour additional walk you are even away from the skiers.

			Just posted a brief review of the Basel Migros Fitnesspark under 'Gyms in Basel' (sorry, forget to get the link), which you may find a little useful.    
Never have been to Chur, I cannot comment on the gym there. But, based on the one in Basel, they are not bad gyms. It is a little restricted when it comes to free weights, but it has a good variety of the usual classes.    
Are a little expensive to my tastes, but then I go for simple gyms and do not need any added benefits (like classes).   
As for customer service aspects, I cannot say, I only trained at this gym for one month.   
When you do join a gym, be sure to leave your thoughts somewhere here. I found it hard to find a gym to my tastes and had to visit a number of places (hence my post), so your thoughts will be of help to others.   
Good luck, 
D

			In an Olympic sized pool 50meters, swim not less than a mile equal 32 laps using combination of breast-stroke with free-style every other lap non-stop going. Lovely! Physically you will feel all your muscles workedout and mentally you will feel like a champ   It is great for endurance. Afterwards, in-pool stretching works great!

			More reasons to frequent my winter home    
Sucked I didnt even get to go weekend just gone, damn US tax deadlines and people handing their docs in a week before, I was working all weekend  .     
But both days are reserved for skiing this weekend.   
Ace, are you around? I have my best mate and his lady friend with me from the UK, she is a complete beginner and will be doing a ski lesson I picked up from the Engelberg team when they were promoting in Zurich before season kick off. Well actually I picked up two, unsure if she can do an AM and PM one in same day. She has had a taster on dry slope and was by all accounts ok, getting in the basics of standing on the slope, putting edges in, and snow plow and snow plow turns.   
We're hoping she can at least get to a stage she can really enjoy it a bit, and maybe even make it down the runs to the bottom with some confidence. My mate thinks I am being fairly optimistic about getting her up on the blue runs by Jochstock, but I am forgetting my learning days. He thinks they are challenging blues.    
Do you know what area they do these lessons? I imagine its a basic group thing.   
Otherwise, if she struggles at Engelberg we may make the second day Flumserberg.    
Heard Sunday is supposed to be a huge snow dump too........  "	Posts: 5,893	Join Date: Sep 2011	A singular modality	Groaned at 170 Times in 121 Posts	Thanked 8,969 Times in 4,005 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

2257	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Jelmoli Ski boot service	climber	1,034	2	Location: Zurich	14.12.2012, 14:49	" 
			
			I purchased my boots from Jelmoli this year and as far as I am aware, no, they do not do what you want.   
They do a very basic fitting service, but better than say Athleticum, whereby you just pick up off shelf and buy.   
I was evaluating the whole ""custom boot"" spec now that I am skiing a lot and before going all out I wanted to try a cheaper option i.e cheaper than 1,000-1,500 CHF.   
I discussed my ski style, where i get pain (outer right foot) and what type of skiing I will be doing.    
He took measurements, identified the wide point on my right foot where I said yep, thats where i get pain, and then picked 4 boots with the widest spec. I tried them all on, and went with the ones I felt most comfortable in after walking about for few mins in each.    
He then heated them on a machine and I wore them for 15-20mins around the store. We then put in medium arch footbeds (not a custom footbed).   
The boots gave me a lot of grief on day one this season. Day two I didnt have them as they were at the shop with skis for service so used my old boots. Day 3, I played about with the bindings and effectively just used them to secure the boot rather than tighten the boot as its such a snug fit. Result was a great day skiing pain free.   
Sounds like you need a filler, like a sponge, some people use these to pad out space in boots. Alternatively, as Ace said, mouled liner, but these are expensive, but by all accounts, well worth it if you want to invest that amount of money.   
Oh, the service I received was free and I only paid the cost price of the boots...490..I think....Salomon Quest 110

I know there are a number of large companies in the Baden area that recruit many expats.  I was wondering if any of those companies ran a regular informal football evening that was open to people from outside the company too?  I've tried organising my own events, but there's never enough regular interest.

Most tough guys with a bit of muscle think they can automatically fight and that the weight difference will be sufficient to win. But a)most guys without training cannot fight at all, they can hardly land a decent punch (try it in front of a mirror and look how ridiculous and clumsy it looks   ) and b) you will be much to slow to land any hits, any fighter with a few years of training will see your hits coming from a mile, you would have to land a lucky punch, fat chances of that. C) Your body is not conditioned to take hits, especially kicks to the leg and body, a few of those and you're completely gassed out and limping. So a tall that is only slightly lighter but taller than you would easily take you out in the first round.

Can you maybe pm me private contact details and we can get something arranged.   
It is best for me to play during the evening, preferably around 7.30.  Would that work for you?

			P90x looks tough.  
Though I haven't tried it myself, I believe if you stick to it, there is no way you won't get results.  
The question is will you follow it or get bored after a few days? 
It's always difficult to keep motivated and so esay tio find excuses to not do it. If you're confident you will, then go for it. Otherwise I would recommend you find a Personal Trainer or even a Bootcamp.

GAA, Gaelic Football, Ladies Gaelic Football, Hurling and Camogie have all grown significantly in the last few months and years all over Switzerland.   
Zurich still has a damn good Camogie and Hurling team and they train and play all the way through the spring and summer. they always look for new members so come and play.   
Zurich has a mens and ladies gaelic football team that has won some serious silverware this year and they also recently had their 10th anniversary game with over 40 players men and women taking the field.   
Saint Gallen Bears are tipping away with about 13 men and 4 or 5 girls. come and join   
Geneva Gaels played in their first european tournament in maastricht with 13 or so men. get in contact, get involved   
Basel have the start of a team maybe. Players in Luzern, Aarau, Neuchatel, Bern, Freibourg and down in the Italian area have all been in contact.   
At the last european tournament of the year they were over 60 players representing switzerland there (48 men and 13 ladies)   
There are people all over Switzerland involved now from all ages.   
Four members of the European County Board live in Switzerland so we are trying our best to grow it all over at all ages and levels. we are working on securing funding to help grow this project from youth all the way up. we hope to have a swiss cup next year in maybe hurling, football and ladies football so it would be amazing to get as many people involved as we can.

			That's great, thanks a lot. I had been using   for German-English, but hadn't found an equivalent for French, so this is way better, plus it is far more exhaustive. Due to browsing a lot of Swiss and German online bike parts stores, close to half of the German vocabulary that I know is bike-related. There can't be many people in the world who know what a ""Steuersatz"" is but cannot say ""My name is Chris"" in German.

Unfortunately, the Site is rather out of date. Zürcher telephone numbers no longer begin with '01' but either '044' or '043'   
Still, the list will give some idea of where the rinks are. Covered ones are fewer on the ground though.

			Here we have one of the classic comments of all time.   
Hitzfeld was caught out giving the finger to the referee during the first half of a match between Switzerland and Norway on October 12th.   
His explanation? He was pointing the finger at, wait for it,    
Still, Hitzfeld argued that he should not be penalized because you cannot punish me if I point a finger at myself.   
So I have decided to give him the award.       
Justly deserved...

			This means that you can string your racket at tension 27kg, which will be used as a reference for stringing machine to be set to such value. Usually rackets specify min and max recommended tension which you can choose at the shop. If you not sure what your preferences are always try out racket strung at (min+max)/2 until you find your favorite tension.

Well in regards to footie there are quite a lot of teams in the lower league...and with FC Biel we also have a nationally competing team.    
Best bet would be to join one of the smaller teams here.Almost every village around Biel has teams of various skill and leagues. Usually you're required to join the respective club ...you could PM me ...where you'll be living and i could try to find out the nearest club for you.

			Hi,  
Anybody interested in getting together for some Sat/Sun biking this winter? I'm a bit rusty as the bikes have been in storage for a while but me and my partner would love find some companions for winter biking, road or mountain and weather dependent obviously. We don't really know many routes yet as we're new here but we're happy to explore or very open to suggestions. I know Swiss Alpine adventure organise rides but a) they get very booked up and b) they are finished for the winter it seems - not sure if any rides are organised anywhere else? 
Level wise - we're used to Italian mountain passes and alpine ""all mountain"" style riding, just a wee bit out of practice at the mo'! Happy to do anything really to meet fellow riders, get some fresh air, keep fit and have some two-wheely fun. We live in Adliswil but have a car or can use trains to meet wherever. 
Maybe something next weekend if the weather is ok? Let me know if you're interested or have a suggestion!

			All good tips, another one is Swiss alpine club (SAC/CAS), they usually do little bit more advanced stuff like glacier treks, skitouring in winter, trainings etc. Drawback is paid membership (~170/year, every canton has different prices - don't ask me why), the way they organize events few months in advance is far from ideal (at least from what I heard). You will also get discount on Swiss huts accommodation.   
Or - you can do it like me (sometimes) - get a good & lightweight camping equipment and go by yourself. 15 kg backpack is not that limiting, and if it is you'll get a good training and improvement in strength & stamina   Plus if heading for peaks you can leave it somewhere below and do the summit lightweight (great feeling & speed). 
There are no dangers in that - bears are only animals that might pose a danger to lone trekker in europe and they are not present in these parts of alps as far as I know. Camping in the middle of nowhere under super-starry sky is simply amazing - and if you find other people to participate fun is doubled   "	Posts: 8	Join Date: Sep 2011	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

The kickboxing places I know about (mainly NL and SE) ask for a minimum age of 16. I imagine this is similar for boxing.

			I need to get my racket restrung in Bern. Ive heard Migros Sport has the best price? Worried about quality. Ive got a wilson ksurge, like to string hybrid: poly (prince i think) and regular (usually wilson sensation) at 60lbs. Im only gonna need a restring once while im here so it doesnt make sense to buy to packets of string. At Oschner Sport that was gonna be around 90chf for 40 feet of each.

			Having Suunto Core for some time already (""aluminium"" with rubber band) and using it in all kind of outdoor activities including crashes and etc. - no problem whatsoever. Yes, there were some issues with Core's first versions few years back, but then those were fixed by Suunto, and have not heard anything bad since then. I'm changing a battery approx. once a year (not waiting for a low battery sign - just in case) and that is not a problem at all, as it is user replaceable and costs few franks.

			Absolutely - but many schools only do a camp every other year, in Neuchatel for instance- and it is a great opportunity for kids who are in public schools here to be with other English speakers from all over, for a change. Our Communes here do not organise camps actually - your kids are lucky.   
A great opportunity for those who would like to learn snowboarding too, with whole day lessons. They do all levels, from beginner to advanced for both skiing and snowboarding.

Looking for a decent gym in Geneva.  Not too fussed about price as I gym 5 days a week so get my monies worth.  What is important is it must be clean, have decent equipment and pleasant scenary of course  .   
I used Holmes Place / Virgin Active for years but recently moved to the new Equinox.  Ideally looking for something similar (I am sure many USA people on the forum will know Equinox)   
Thanks for any advise

			I tried the hip hop classes at backstage studio in Zurich. They have open classes on Fridays as well as courses. I cant commit to weekly classes so just tried the open class. The open classes are for now taught by a pretty young dance group so the classes are cheap (10 chf each) but decent. If it matters to you..the crowd there is very young (under 20s). Made me feel like it was time for me to move on to another genre of dance..

I think it will not be easy. We have been trying to find a place to play for months but still couldn't. We tried to rent pitches in those big sport centers but all of there pitches are fully booked. Here in Zurich every school has at least two halls, but the ones we asked were are also fully booked. We also keep trying, so if we find something I will inform you.

			Hello there!   
I've just moved to Zürich from London and I'm excited about getting into life here.   
My Partner and I just got married this summer in Ticino. He is Swiss and I am British.    
We are both architects and have our own practice and right now we're offering free quote for any scale of project.   
If you have a project in mind and are unsure of it's feasibility, drop us a PM and we can help you.   
I'm also interested in running a yoga morning at our flat once a week.   
Before opening our practice I worked for a very large & renowned practice in London which offered a great yoga course in the evenings.    
When I came to Switzerland I realised that most yoga courses charge high rates comparatively and it's not so inspirational practicing yoga by yourself all the time so, I propose that all lovers of yoga meet up for a morning session, some tea and a get together.   
Drop me a mail if you're interested.   
Have a wonderful day!

But soon, my precious, soon      Didn't ski yesterday, but I think the other main glacier runs, with the drag lift, were also open, as they certainly were at the weekend.

The Kloten, Zug or Rapperswil venues are much nicer to enjoy the game, but either way enjoy some great hockey and make sure to take in the Lockout players.

			Hello everyone, I am moving to Switzerland and I need a good eventing barn with a trainer that speaks English pretty well so they can teach me the terms in swiss german/german..ect. I have been doing jumpers, equitation, and hunters. And want to try to get serious with my riding, so I want to learn dressage. Though I want to continue to do jumpers and start doing cross country. I don't have a horse, but I've ridden all sizes and personalities. I want to ride for a while a pretty easy going horse so I can get out of some bad habits I've developed from riding problem horses. I am 5'7-9 and have really long legs (so I've been told) so I need a pretty big horse (I have pictures of me riding recently if that helps)    
If you don't know any that speak english then just put the stables you know. It can be any location, preferably not the Italian part but that's fine.

			Hi   
Me and a bunch of my mates have been trying to get some football games going, but it's only been 2 months since we've moved to Lausanne so we don't know much about the city. I know the university has pitches that we could use, but that's a bit far. Does Parc de Milan have goalposts? I have also seen lots of pitches in the Vidy area, but do I have to reserve or pay for them?   
Thank you!

It's not far; the pitch is opposite the Affoltern train station which is served by the S6 from HB (16 minutes journey, 2 trains per hour). If you're in Oerlikon, you can get on the S6 there and it'll take 5 minutes.   
thanks,

Bump for relevance (although I'm a complete beginner and interested due to martial arts usually providing a sufficient mixture of intensity, action, and group support/pressure to keep one's semi-ADD interest up).

2381	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	where to rent skis	juice99	1,068	5	Location: Zurich	17.10.2012, 16:48	" 
			
			Are you only going to ski 3 days the whole season? or is this for guests?   
I agree that the resorts for a few days aren't any more expensive really than other places plus you can take them back and change things when they don`t work out (like some boots for a guest of mine last year).   
If you plan on doing 2 days here, 3 days there, etc it will make sense to rent for the season.   
The rental cost of skis is most expensive for 1 day and then gets a lot lower as you rent for more days. Makes sense as they spend all their time measuring you for skis, boots, setting the bindings, the skis are waxed etc.

I go to the one n Lutry and I like it there.    
Otherwise, go for the Stade Pierre de Coubertin in Lausanne, near Vidy. You can go for a run there, and they have football fields nearby. And, if I remember well, a basketball one too near the lake. All in the same area.

			Novartis gym has classes in English, but you'd need to work there. I know that some instructors here   also teach in English.    
What kind of classes are you looking for? With many, you only need limited vocabulary to understand the instructions. For example LesMills classes are the same all over and instructors often use the English terms anyway and Zumba classes should ideally be taught without any verbal cues, so in most cases you should be able to manage even if you don't speak the language. I'd rather find a nice gym that's conveniently located, most people wouldn't drag themselves across town.

Does such a thing exist for kids younger than 12?  Where we come from, flag football teams are for 8 year olds.   
(No offense to the many people who play flag football - I have to say I was awfully excited to see lots of posts about flag football teams for males  , I wouldn't turn my nose up at that opportunity!)

			Hello   
A friend has asked if I can spread the word about pony club games.  She runs a couple of pony club games (mounted games) teams and is looking for more riders to bring on and perhaps make up a 3rd team.  There is no age limit to pony games in Switzerland with many different age categories.     
She is based in Wila, Kanton Zurich and is hoping to promote and encourage new teams to start up.     
You dont need a pony, but you do need to be able to ride, and looking to have fun as part of a team.  Non german speaking is not a problem.     
If you are not sure what the games are you can always come along to the Swiss Pony Games final next Sunday in Inwil Lu.   
Please PM me if you have any questions, or are interested in the pony games.

Will post if/when I have more info.

			You guys are awesome. So much great advice. I actually ran 21kms today, not my best run as I had a few occasions where I needed to walk and my over all time was awful 2.27. I am hoping on the day to do 2.15. I know that's slow but as its my first race after just 3 months I hope it's not too shameful. That's my last long run before the day, just 10km or shorter now. Feeling really nervous now! (btw, for me 1/2 marathon is enough no plans to do a full)

			Hi peoples   
I was wondering if there was anyone out there who wants to do some Weekend trips to France to go surfing (that means leaving on a Friday ASAP and coming back Sunday night (or Mon morning in time for work), or maybe long weekends.   
I have potentially a car that I can borrow.   
Main goal of the trip is to surf, surf some more, eat (baguettes)...you get the picture.   
Let me know.

			Yep.  I just moved here from the US.  Your distance and speed look high to me, but then again I come from a VERY hilly area in Pennsylvania and it might be OK for me if the ride was a little more flat.    
Problem is that I just finished up training for the Basel marathon and I'm really out of ""cycling"" shape, but after I recover from the run (it's this weekend) I plan to start cycling again if you're still interested.

			If anyone is interested in mountaineering and would like to add a little extra to by going in vintage gear and outfit (1920s to 1940s) please PM me and I can fill you in onmore of the details.   
I'm part of a club that does this and sometimes we got a larger group or just a couple. There are routes for all levels from going up to a hut and having a little grill night to going on a multi day trek past the 3000-4000m mark all done just like they did 70 years ago but still very safe. We pay attention to detail though as we want to escape from the mordern world and live a simple live for a day or longer. Of course we have the modern safety items (such as a cell to call REGA) but we keep that out of sight as we don't want to ruin the impression. So nailed boots, breeches, funny hats and good, real food! But maybe some funny looks if others see us      
But I should add that the places you will see....you will remember for the rest of your life along with the expereices you will have. Our club knows some really speacial places, no matter what the skill level, but be expected to get a little freindly push once in awhile to get yourself to ""higher goals"".   
Ladies: our club would be more than happy to welcome you, and don't worry, we don't bite, we're really a good bunch of gentlemen.   
If you're still interested by this point...let me know. All languages welcome but main languages are English, French and German.

			Snooker tables seem to be getting more scarce in Lucerne. There's 'The Tom's' in Ebikon that is great for pool & darts (had snooker tables there until a couple of years ago.    
The Pink Billino in Emmenbrücke has pool tables and 2 well maintained snooker tables.    
The next place would be in Cham (Zugerland Sports) which has pool and 2 x snooker tables. The National in Littau is the home of the Swiss Snooker Association. Here you can pay membership which then entitles you to a key, providing unlimited (including out of hours) access to the club.   
Or do you mean buying one?

			I have skied it regularly and it is a really good location with mostly intermediate slopes.    
The main issue is if the season is not so good with less snow then the lower height of this resort does mean it is not so good but with good snow its brilliant. It can also be a bit foggy and icy near the bottom at times. I guess the other thing to consider is that if you ski the Chasserugg area there is a rather long t-bar that gets a bit tiring espcially on cold periods as your feet dont get respite from the cold ground.   
However it remains one of my favorite and from schaufhaussen you should be there in under 1 hour by car

All three are very different. IMO - one is for swingers and porn movie filming, one is for Swedish wives of CEOs to have affairs with their personal trainers and one is like the Easyjet of the gym world.

I'd love to get a feel for kite surfing, but getting time into it seems tricky, what with jobs and all. Maybe it would be barely doable to hop to Faro on a Friday evening, surf saturday and early sunday, and flit back, but... seems a bit arduous.   
What is the situation of snow kiting? I know people do it, but it's definitely not as common. Less wind, more dangerous, perhaps? Would the skills transfer to kite surfing?

It is always half empty : and although the football is reasonable quality : do not expect any atmosphere. Game in November is against Aarau who are bottom of league so expect goals but not much of a contest.   
Not seen any real trouble but tolerance of police is far higher than UK and in my view why they have the problem :

They are joined in the final by   who beat the holders,  , by 2 wickets in a closely fought contest in Hägendorf.    
Unlike previous seasons, this year's final is made up of the winners of both the regional divisions. It also promises to be a high scoring and very close affair and has the potential of being one of the most exciting finals for many years.     
The Swiss Cricket Association encourage you to attend the final and witness the 2012 SCA league final.

on Tue  : Tango Argentino B   
on Fri    : Tango Argentino L1 (level1) 
on Wed : Tango Argentino L2 (level2)   
I don't like this time so much because I might be rush. 
Even though, I would love to dance so it depends on you that what do you think about these classes. I took Tango Argentino B  before last year. For me, there is no problem to take Tango Argentino B or Tango Argentino L1 (level1).    
please don't hesitate to reply ..doesn't matter what answer is.

			Kinderturnen is usually a fun, non-competitve to pretty much everything that involves gymnastics (ball games, gymnastics,...) for kids in kindergarten. Mädchenriege is about the same for girls 1st grade and up. Mädchenriege goes to several non-mandatory Jägerball-tournaments a year (at least they to where I live).   
Kunstturnen and Geräteturnen focus more on the training in the respective disciplines (gymnastics on the ground in the first case I guess and gymnastics on all the equipment like the horse, rings, bars...) and usually the kids are expected to compete at least some times.   
Hope that helped.

Anyone else?  Next weekends are already sort of loaded with plans :/.  Being a student I'm quite flexible to go out of down during the week though, if it makes it easier to find some time.  We can also just go for that beer at some point and brag about the latest item in the gear collection, or something..

pm sent    
The club 100's arn't that quick, the engines are rev limited so they live a bit longer (normal 100's need total rebuilds after 8 hours, which costs quite a bit) which is why we stopped racing 100's and moved onto rotax max, which gives the speed of 100's but the reliability and longivity of pro-karts (4 stroke)   
For real speed you have to try a gearbox kart, a mate let me try his a couple of months ago, and it physically hurt, changing gear felt like someone has kicked you in the back, and braking is somthing else, like you have just hit somthing,  in the words of sgt Murtaugh, I'm too old for this s**t

			Been working with The Ski Company in Torgon for years, organising ski trips for school, and mixed groups of friends of all ages- both skiers and snowboarders.   
The Ski Company has some weeks when they are not full, and are happy to take on small groups of 'fillers'. These dates won't be known for a while yet- but should be clear around November - these are only available for long-term customers/contacts.   
 They also organise ski weeks for kids 13+ February half-term- mainly kids from the UK so would be great for any English speaking children living in CH. As they have separate apartments for adults, they might be able to accommodate whole families for those dates.   
Would some of you be interested in forming a EF group - Torgon links with the Portes du Soleil - and the pass includes Torgon, Chapelle d'Abondance, Chatel and Super Chatel + Morgins, so a huge area. The ski and snowboarding hire is great quality and in-house, ski/snowboarding school and lift 50 m from chalet- all English speaking staff (UK, OZ + NZ). And with prices that can't be beaten, especially for those 'filler' weeks organised by long-term contacts.         BTW they are still looking for staff for this coming season. Salary is very poor, but accom and food free, ski/snow equipment + ski pass thrown in - and loads of time to spend in the snow every day but change day.

			There's another Athleticum in Dietikon (Silbern), also one in the middle of Zurich near Stauffacher.   
But SportXX by Migros normally have a lot of better value cycling clothes, not much in the way of shoes though. There's one in the middle of the city in the Migros City complex, another in Altstetten and also in Spreitenbach.   
Both stores have online shops so you can see exactly what range they have.   
Local bike shops are really variable, some are shockingly expensive but some are OK. I normally stick with SportXX for clothes.

			Hello everyone,   
I am looking for anyone and everyone who are or would be interested in Nordic Walking in Lausanne area (preferably closer to Chalet-a-Gobet, Epalinges or Croisettes).   
I used to do it a couple times a week before I moved to Switzerland and could not find a group who would speak English (my French is still only in the basics level) or would go out at times I could actually join.   
If anybody knows about an English group in my area, I would love to hear more about it.   
Also, I believe I could teach people the technique and we could arrange activities in the woods (as it really is a sport better to do in fresh air).   
Cheers

I actually really like the look of Fitness Plus.  I plan on joining for a month (I may be moving back to the US), and do think I will join for a year if I stay in Switzerland.     
The day care area seemed clean with good toys for children, there is a decent variety of equipment, with TV's on the cardio equipment, and they had classes during the day care hours on most days.  The price was similar to the other gyms in the area.   
It is smaller than Migro's Fitness Park, with no pool, but seems to be the equivalent quality.     
To see the gym they do require an appointment, so I would recommend calling in advance.  Based on my experience, the woman at the front desk during the day does not speak much English, so I would suggest calling after 5 if your German is not very good.

			Hi all,   
I am a capoeira professor with +4 years of experience teaching (+7 practicing) 
I am living in St-Prex right now and I want to start teaching in the area. Anybody interested? please tell me your contact details, where you live as well as your availability so we can work something out.   
For those who want to know a bit more about our capoeira: 
The group is Abada-Capoeira based in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil founded by Mestre Camisa almost 25 years ago. 
The largest and most pedagogically advanced capoeira organization in the world, present in the 5 continents and all states of Brazil.  
for those who know already about capoeira: we learn Sao bento grande, Benguela, Angola and iuna  
we learn to play all the instruments (berimbau, atabaque, pandeiro and agogo) and to sing in portuguese. 
Classes should normally be in portuguese but I speak eng, spa and ger (unfortunately only basic french)   
We play a fast, more dangerous capoeira, we throw kicks in the opposite direction and learn many takedowns. You need to ALWAYS keep your eyes open and dodge! but the best part is the community: we are a family!   
We train hard as it can be, sometimes people from other sports can't keep up with our warm up!  
(but you can make stops is you need to, don't worry)

			There are various free locations around zurich with air compressors for bike tires.   
I know of one at bellevue (between Terrasse and the river) and one at Helvetiaplatz (by the 32 bus stop direction limmatplatz).     
They're very easy to use, and have a pressure gauge. Read the value on the sides of your tire and inflate in short spurts of air watching the pressure gauge until the desired pressure. And make sure the gauge is working (needle moving).

			The via ferrata Farinetta    is located inside the Gorge de la Salentze, a tight and quite panoramic canyon with waterfalls above Saillon, and is named after some Italian/Swiss kinda-Robin-Hood guy, who died there trying to escape the police:    It is composed of two parts, a first and easier part of 2 hours and a second (optional and more difficult) part of another ~1h30. I found also a video which might give you a better idea of what to expect:    Participants are supposed not to have fear of hight and to come duly equipped with:  - harness + assurance for via ferrata - climbing helmet (bike ones are not recommended, but acceptable) - good hiking shoes (i.e. with vibram sole) - climbing gloves (biking ones should again be ok) - (optionally) a   backpack with some water and chocolate

			I wouldn't worry about the 2012/13 models, it's just a paint job generally (obviously not always)   
Bikes can be rather expensive (I bought my cervelo tt bike from Germany over the internet for about half the price of a similar bike in CH). Canyon do some good bikes, focus too, though not sure re dealers. Shimano ultegra is probably the best value components.    
However, really, most important is a bike that fits you, and that you like the look of. There isnt really that much of a difference in performance. Its all about the engine    
Get measured properly, chat to some good bike shops - not sure where you are but if ZRH then tempo, backyard, veloatelier, thomus etc and speak to the guys, maybe get a proper fitting (pay for it) and narrow the choice down that way. And make sure you have a indoor trainer  for the winter   "	Posts: 107	Join Date: Oct 2011	Member	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Thanked 27 Times in 23 Posts	slipped a little

2496	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Youth Sports	fire1836	855	1	Location: Maur	21.08.2012, 15:08	"    you should be able to find youth soccer for those ages through the local clubs (verein), in addition to the programs that ICS may offer.  the basketball programs through the local clubs generally start at U14, so about age 12 or so, although some offer programs for ""minis"" or younger children.   
there is no youth lacrosse in Switzerland (that I know of), other than the TASIS high school program in the Lugano area.  we are on the other side of Lake Zurich, but if your kids have an interest then shoot me a PM and perhaps we can get something started for younger kids, I have an 8 year old daughter who is just starting (as well as a teenaged son who plays and an 11 year old son who is just starting).

			Hello,   
I just came to Geneva for a six week training and am interested in purchasing or renting a women's bicycle while I'm here. Mostly I would ride it to work (easy city ride 30 minutes each way). If its nice enough I would do some longer weekend trips (50-70KM per day). I would be interested in purchasing a cheaper used bike I could sell at the end of my time or renting a bicycle from someone. I'm not a good enough biker to be too picky about the quality.   
Also - if anyone knows any yoga classes in Geneva please let me know.   
Thank you.

			Switzerland is a good deal more populated in Canada, making the value of registration less. You have to look to find a trail that doesn't get walked over regularly in the summer. Also, cell phones don't work everywhere in the mountains, but you normally have signal when you have a view of a valley.   
All that said, people do die in the Swiss alps, and not just from BASE jumping.   
As mentioned, the ""Zurich Hiking and Outdoor"" group on meetup is fairly active. They generally don't do anything technical, but the hikes are not professionally guided tours either and Swiss terrain can be steep. The   is also something to consider, especially if you want to do more technical or otherwise intense things.   
Occasionally there have been attempts to arrange hiking meets with this forum, to the best of my knowledge they haven't had great turnouts.

2521	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Formhaus Basel - help!	outrage	1,610	2	Location: Basel	23.08.2011, 20:05	" 
			
			Following my attempt to terminate my membership of the Formhaus GmbH gym and health club in Basel last year I reluctantly accepted that I had not followed the letter of their procedures for leaving the gym and paid up for another year. I wasn't happy and frankly felt their behaviour was not only bad customer service, but a bit sneaky as they did not even tell me my membership was due for renewal until afterwards, when I got a demand for payment.    
This year I carefully did as instructed for terminating membership and sent a letter by recorded delivery well in advance of my subscription end date, followed up by a copy letter in an email. However Formhaus deny receiving the letter (I still have the post office receipt and frankly I doubt that it did not arrive), they do not accept the emailed letter and rather sniffilly tell me that they do not accept my resignation.   
My inclination is just to ignore them, but I don't know what leverage they have and in which way they might claim I made some infraction of their resignation requirements. From feeling like an innocent abroad I now feel like the victim of a mugging.   
Frankly I did not think Formhaus was a good gym. I found the equipment limited and the staff all a little creepy.

			Hello 
There is an exceptional rowing club in Zug - one of the world's oldest and most famous, in fact.  If you walk round the north side of Zugersee from the centre of Zug, you will come to a marina area with lots of sailing boats etc.  The rowing club is in a modern looking building just there.  It is known as See-Club Zug, on the web at  .  I'm an ex-UK international rower and I do know that the club is quite an exclusive club. I move to Zug in July and will be knocking on their door soon after I arrive. 
Good luck

			You have got further than I have.  I used to enjoy (ok, that's a bit of stretch) participate in 4-6 hour weekend rides (with a cake stop) before I moved to Switzerland...  they were nice, pleasant affairs with friends where nobody got dropped and it was possible to have a conversation on the flat if you really wanted to.... and cyclists would wave at each other as they went past.  Then I moved to Switzerland, took one look at the local road cyclists and haven't got on a bike since.  Yes, I'm a quitter.  I don't stand a chance of keeping up with those club cycling machines, and while I'd love to think that I could take on a pass or two, the reality is that I'd still be peddling forwards as I actually rolled backwards.   Good for you for taking up the challenge!

Cavendish will never win le Tour - he's not quick enough up the mountains or in the time-trials - so I don't believe that he sacrificed it for Wiggins.   His role is to win individual stages during the sprint finish, which he is very good at (ranked fourth in the overall classification of stage wins).   On stages when he is likely the have a chance Wiggins and the others go all out to make sure he is in with a chance.   On the days when he is not likely to be a contender the roles are reversed and he has to play the domestique role.   
He's entitled to disappointed as he was labelled the 'favorite' by many at the start, but giving away the strategy to the opponents openly is always a mistake!

			hi all, 
i would like to advertize the existence of our badminton group here in Lausanne. we play every wednesday (except during school holidays) from 20-22 close to La Sallaz in the gym of the school Coteau-Fleuri, Chemin de la Grangette 77, 1010 Lausanne. we have 3 courts. we play for fun and players of all different levels are very welcome to join us.  
the fee depends on the number of people present, but is very low: we pay 10 CHF per hour FOR THE WHOLE GYM.  
so far, we charged 35 CHF per semester for subscribers, 5 CHF per session for visitors. sounds like unfair competition, i know. well, it is    
it would be great to see some of you there! just drop me a mail and we can arrange the logistics.   
cheers,   
norbert

2566	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	6-a-Side Football in Zug	superhoops	645	0	Location: Zürich	24.07.2012, 20:30	"     
Our next 6-a-Side league is due to start on Friday 31 August. The first league was a great success, and we are now looking for new teams and players.   
Matches are played on a Friday evening on the astroturf pitch at the Kantonsschule in Zug (Lüssiweg, behind the Metalli). The games are competitive but fair and friendly. The league will last for approx. 7-8 weeks, depending on the number of teams registered.   
Fuller details can be found on our facebook page        
If you are interested in playing, please pm me or get in touch asap via the FB page or website. Full teams are obviously welcome, but we're also happy to help individuals and/or smaller groups of players to get involved and join a team. Whether you can make every week or not isn't too important - the idea being to have a bigger squad of players from which to call on the 6-8 players needed for each match. The league offers a great opportunity to play competitively, have fun, keep fit, make new friends, and enjoy the odd post-match drink.   
Any questions, let me know, and I hope to hear from you soon!    
Thanks   
Daniel

2580	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	About training and running ...	climb63	2,323	52	Location: Zurich	12.07.2012, 14:03	"    Not trying to preach to those you feel they need to use them but:   
I firmly believe that unless you are are suffering (or recovering) from a medical condition which prevents absorption of specific vitamins or nutrients, then as long as you eat a healthy balanced diet, you don't need to spend money on supplements.     
The supplement industry (like the diet food industry*) has created a product that people now think they need and cannot live without - clever and very lucrative for them, but unnecessary for us.   
I know people on here consume this stuff because they say they haven't got time to eat properly but in this case perhaps they need to change their priorities.   
A lot of studies have also shown that some of these substances do absolutely nothing for you and others are actually harmful.   
Of course some have been shown to be beneficial -  including folic acid for pregnant women.   
On one of the supplement threads - one of the posts said some thing like, ""Oh, my supplements are coming tomorrow and I can't wait !"".  Get a life, I say.

			I just moved to Zurich from Shanghai.  I love the whole idea of Xterra triathlons, but China is too polluted to race in the wild.   Now that I live in lovely Switzerland Xterra here I come.  Anyone in the Zurich area want to train over the next month before the race?  I live in the Küsnacht area, but we can meet where ever there is a good trail or lake.   
Hope that I am not the only one in Zurich planning to race.

			Hi there   
Does anyone now of weekly running meet up's in the area?   
I am training for my first Marathon this Nov. in NY and could need a little company during the long runs. I am not a fast runner maybe around 6.15 pace for the long runs, but hoping to improve.

			Hi, we drove through that way on our way home from Italy on Saturday afternoon. For cars, only the tunnel was open.  We saw some small patchs of snow, but nothing significant. Temp mid-afternoon was around 18°, and it was as warm, if not warmer, yesterday and again today, so I'm sure any remaining snow is long gone!

			Hey, I'm signing up for an 8.4 km swim from the French side of Lake Geneva to the Swiss part (from St-Gingolph to Vevey). It's on Sat 25 Aug at 12:00...   
Anyone interested in paddling alongside me? Canoe / kayak / standup paddle board - any of these would be welcome. It is a requirement for all swimmers to have such a support vesel. I checked already - they won't ask for our passports as we cross that dotted line that runs through the middle of the lake    
There's info (in French) on the Vevey Natation Riviera Club website.   
Any feedback appreciated!

You could come and try some ZimFit outdoor circuits/bootcamp in Vidy (just near the Theatre du Vidy). All-round fitness (core, strength, balance) and we do plenty of boxing.  Its a fun group and the workouts are early morning or evening.  We cater for all levels of fitness, so you can start with any level of fitness and the group will keep you motivated.

			No, however I have visited many times when I lived in the UK for a while, I didn't have citizenship I lived there with my mother at the time, but we made frequent trips to Switzerland during holiday, I do understand that getting a working/residence permit is moderatly-highly difficult however I do have assests that make me unique in my field, i.e.) being able to train professional athletes, being able to train post natal patients, and train MMA professionals...so I do believe attaining some position in the Fitness Industry is possible I just want some generic numbers to work with if possible.

The Zurich gang will be getting together on Tuesday evenings from next month if you fancy putting your bike on the train and going for a spin on Uetliberg with some like minded people.   
Oh... and check out the trails on Zugerberg, there are some good ones up there, but its been years since I have been up there so can;t remember exactly where they are, but I think some of them are on the singletrail map.

			2k seem about right, but there's massive variety of factors. It could be as much as 50% out I recon.   
Also, re: ""two bananas"" - that's not the energy your using. You are actually running in deficit - the same goes for your fluid levels (especially if its hot).    
You're only replacing some of the carb/glycogen stores with two bananas - if at all. Chances are, if the pace is sensible and you have a fair amount of condition, you might actually be burning a lot of fat or Glycogen stores.   
FYI - I also use a 705. Todays run: 
Body weight: 80kg 
Road ride - 30km 
Av Spd: 36kph 
elevation gain: 95m elevation loss: 300 (ie it's a downhill run!) 
Average HR: 147bpm 
Average cadence: 87rpm 
Calories: 1,200   
PS: Babenas...An average HR of 158bpm??? Wow, that's beasting it...  "	Posts: 2,423	Join Date: Feb 2006	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 39 Times in 27 Posts	Thanked 1,464 Times in 758 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			I went along to Markthalle but left before the game started - it was far too hot, too many idiots with air horns had been let in, and overall the atmosphere didn't feel good.   
I've heard similar stories to you, but I haven't seen anything in the news.   
Seems like it was a good decision to leave, either way.

			I find it quite sad, that olympic city like Lausanne doesn't have an OLYMPIC pool (50m) that is usable for whole year. Remember Zurich had a lot of those all around  the place. It makes a big difference for me when I want to swim in a lane, constant turning in 25m gets annoying. 
Lake is safe, OK, don't worry. Biggest fishes I saw were like 15 cm big. There are much bigger ones, but they don't come close and definitely don't bite (just don't swim naked  )

			the valle verzasca, just north of locarno, is amazing and it all starts/ends at a very large dam (it was used in some james bond film - not sure which one cuz i don't watch them).  there are numerous trails (varying difficulty) throughout the valley.  a major trail runs parallel to the river and it is very doable for kids and the elderly (well marked). there are many waterfalls and a farm with reindeer (i think), and even a trailside honey stand (i kid you not). An added bonus - along the trail north of lavertezzo there is a exhibit of really cool, funky sculptures.  it is really beautiful and amazing and relatively flat.  In the three weeks since arriving i have hiked to the top of mt lego and walked along the river from levertezzo to ganne.  not sure about the precise distance from zurich but it should fall within your stated time parameters. enjoy, and be sure to bring your camera.

Actually there seem to be quite a few ultra runners in our group.  Coach Jeff himself has done the Marathon des Sables and Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc amongst others, one guy attempted Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc last year and will attempt it again this year, I just finished the Marathon des Sables, another guy just finished the Marathon des Sables and last but not least this other guy is doing the Jungrau marathon.  So 4 ultra runners plus an ultra runner coach.  I blog about my training on   if you are interested.

If you are interested you can see what I wrote about them on my blog  .  They have been around for over 20 years and were invented in Switzerland, but they only seem to gaining popularity as of late.

I agree, you would probably feel nauseous and get a headache, but still lose some weight.  The 1000Kj gym routine would probably take longer to complete as the week progresses as well.

2693	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Squat rack for home use	Breezy	3,471	14	Location: Richterswil	31.05.2012, 16:28	"    I'm using something along those lines right now. It wobbles and looks silly, but it works fine. And you can't beat the price.   
Bumper plates can act as a safety mechanism - but I've found that dumping heavier (for me!!) squats can cause some problems. I had to dump a 260 lbs load a few weeks ago, and I twisted my left elbow letting it go. No major damage, but it was inflamed for a couple days.    
Since then I've noticed that you can use a second set of construction stands as safety rails. Just set up the second pair behind the ones being used to rack the barbell; put them to a height just below bar level at the bottom of your squat. I lift with a friend right now, but I actually prefer my ""safety rails"" to him spotting when I'm pushing my boundaries on squats. (Just don't starting dropping the bar from any kind of height. The stands can't take that much.)   
BTW, I think you've already picked up on this, but advntur/Jeff Grant is right in your backyard, and he has a complete rig, not to mention being a great coach. Nothing in the world like lifting with company ...

			Thanks!   
Fewer than in winter - and, well, colorful. My daughter and I discovered five different species:   
1) The pro skier. They're up there because they have a career to get off the ground. Stick to themselves and talk about anything but skiing, except with their coaches.   
2) The wacky tourist. They just happen to be in the area and suddenly think, ""Hey, instead hiking like normal people, let's go ski!"" There were two complete beginners from the UK with an instructor. They spent an entire day sliding down head first and admiring the scenery. (Pretty inspirational, actually.)    
3) The fanatical skier. Not necessarily very good, but obsessive-compulsive about skiing. Just DYING to talk to the pros about proper hip to knee angles when carving at 63 kph. (Probably the reason the pros seem a little shy and nervous.)   
4) The radical park dude. Ride down backwards and turn double back-flip-twisty things while rolling a joint with one hand and filming themselves with the other. Some of the boarders may have thought they were actually  on skateboards. Friendlier than the pros - and they get to the slope later.   
5) The civilized mountaineer. Hairy people who spend the entire morning skiing up the side of the piste carrying ice picks, ropes, flares, tents and rubber rafts. Presumably, they then disappear into glaciers or climb up  sheer rock faces - but I suspect that they actually just ski back down the piste once and go home again.   
(All in good fun ... )

			That's about right for summer prices which are valid in some less popular places but the court hire is very seldom included in the hourly rate. Expect to pay: CHF60-80 for a decent one-on-one lesson. Most definitely the charges do not include tennis courts in winter. Just as an example of   sports center which is a very popular hub for expats living in Aargau and Zurich with tennis, squash and badminton facilities. The certified Swiss coach will charge you as much as CHF100-130 plus tennis court CHF35-65 depending on time of the day. My wife is in business and we lowered our prices quite a bit to be able to tailor the rates to expats taste and expectations, who initially are shocked by local rates but after exploring the market, they will realize that those are the common running rates in Switzerland.

			The sun is shining, the birds are singing, great weather is finally starting...time to get on the crags!   
3 years ago I was the organizer of the Switzerland Outdoor rock climbing meetup group, and we had a nice group going climbing almost every weekend during the summers.   
Then life happened, I moved away, and couldn't maintain the group anymore.    
Well, now I'm back in Switzerland and it is summer again! So, I've rescued and re-started the group. Please check out our meetup page and join the group to meet other like-minded rock climbers and find out about our outings. The first one this year will take place next Sunday at Roches d'Orvin. Links here:       
and     
Note also that we climb all over Switzerland, and though I'm personally based in Bern, you don't have to be a Bern local to join (the group has climbed as far as the Jura, Geneva, Oberland, and even Tessin area, so there's stuff for everyone).    
Beginners most welcome! Also adventure hikers (we often have trips to fun via ferratas at all levels, i.e. Rotstock, Kandersteg, etc).   
And...if you want to organize an outing yourself, the group settings allow you to do so. You don't have to go through the organizer if you want to announce a cool spontaneous climbing outing to the list.    
Anyway, that's all I'll say for now before EF bans me for too much group self-promotion. I'm just announcing it here cuz we used to have a bunch of EFrs showing up, and everyone knows the EF people are the most fun to talk to, right?    
CU on the rock!

			HI Yokine, there is another tour starting in Wallenstadt, and ending in Weesen, which has quite a lot of single trail in it for the tour length. We tried to do it last month but play got called off by snow! The next day we went back from the other side and cycled up the singletrail section to come back down. The trail looks fun as far up as we went, but I rekon it will be pretty tough at the upper sections. Hopefully get to go back and try the full thing soon.

You wouldn't want to end up going over some of those weirs and getting all smashed up.  The one on the Limmat just after Wipkingen is certainly marked way ahead of time.  Then there is a place where it tells you to get out of the water and not to go beyond that point.

			Update: 
Spent the w/e with my 29er-owning friend and he loves it! Or should I say loves them, he bought a hardtail and a fully (both Scotts),  . He uses the fully for leisure biking and the hardtail for competitive should he ever get back into it. As people above have pointed out, he says it really does flatten out a lot of obstacles and can really fly when up to speed. 
I'm going to give an L-frame Scott Spark a spin this weekend (they said they would set it up for me based on my height and weight) and will probably order an XL afterwards. 
There goes the remainder of last year's bonus  .

Hikr.org is a good resource for mountaineering also and you can also find nice recreational climbs from Von Känel's Plaisir Alpin ( ). But just to make sure, as you don't seem that experienced, these are tours you do not go do alone (unless you are an idiot or Ueli Steck) or without proper gear and skills.

He's been using one for well over a year and he raves about them. He did say that he used others in the past and that he often had to reach down to pull the seat up fully on one model he had but the Rock Shox always returns to the full up position. You can stop it anywhere you want in between too if you want to find a balance between being able to pedal and not having the saddle wedged up your crack when it's a bit rough.

			Hi everyone, I just got the note in the mail about Bike to Work teams - does anyone have a team that is one member short?    
I have done it the last two years but just changed jobs and moved across the country. I still commute every day, about 15k roundtrip. (Alternatively, if 3 people are interested I can make a team, please just let me know).

			Hi,   
I'm training to be a chartered sports psychologist, and I have an assignment to complete as part of my masters program.   
I need to perform an intake interview with an athlete, we could explore issues like using imagery, self-talk, relaxation skills, and goal setting  these are all core techniques used by successful elite and recreational athletes worldwide, and extensive empirical evidence supports their effectiveness; these are the things that separate the winners from also-rans.  The output could be in the form of a report (for your personal use only, not shared elsewhere) recommending strengths to leverage, ideas for areas to work on, and reference material supporting follow-ups.  What I can't do is then work with you on a continuing basis to address these things; the way sports psychology is regulated I am not allowed to 'practice' until fully qualified.   
The session would be filmed but footage would be confidential and only seen by my tutors. If this is interesting drop me a PM and we can get into further details. Meanwhile, here's some info on work done with Sir Chris Hoy:       
Cheers John

Looking to restart playing squash now and would like to find new partners.  So if you fancy a game then please contact me.

2732	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Zurich - cyclists, runners, swimmers, triathletes...	Tonkington	622	0	Location: Zurich	14.05.2012, 12:29	   Im sure Ive seen a bunch of similar threads but cant seem to find any on searching.      We (my girlfriend and I) would be interested in joining up with people or existing groups for road cycling, running or swimming  (all things triathlon).     Were training for an ironman at the moment so longer stuff is preferable.     Im based in Seefeld, Zurich and am not opposed to early starts now that sunrise is at 6am. Other than that most evenings and weekends Ill be doing something.     In terms of speed:   -running: shorter (around 10km) hard runs around 5:15 min/km, on the long runs (20km +) more like 6:15   -bike*: Id say Im a mid level cyclist. I can get up any of the hills around the area without too much bother, can cycle 4 hours plus at a social pace   -swim: less important for keeping in a group but around about 2min per 100m (I normally swim in Oerlikon pool)     *I should say we ride time trial bikes, which often puts people off from group riding but is never something weve had any problems with.     My girlfriend is slower on the bike and run but quicker on the swim.     If anyone is interested, please get in touch. Also happy to go for beers etc. after and keep it social.

2734	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Touch Rugby / Footy	catch_me_if_you_can	568	0	Location: Montreux	14.05.2012, 10:55	   Hi all,                It's coming around to that time of the season again where the sun comes out and so does the rugby ball. If your new to Lausanne and looking to meet new people and join in on the social life, or just looking for a summer game to get outside and enjoy yourself then touch footy/rugby is the way to go.    This year the Swiss Touch Association has organised Touch football fun days all around Switzerland to promote the sport &amp; bring people together. They have reserved this year, the beautiful location of the Rugby Field in Dorigny on Saturday 19th May (located on Route Cantonale, opposite the University of Lausanne), to bring the ever growing sport to Lausanne. There will be members of the national squad for the Swiss Touch European Championship this year there to help, as well as coaches and players from other cantons in Switzerland. This day is aimed at all levels of touch footy/rugby experience from beginners to experts, from all ages including children, and it's purely to promote the game and to introduce new people to the sport. The beauty of this sport is, it's for both males and females to play together. It's a great way to meet new people as well as getting in some good fun exercise in the sun. There will be a bar-be-que and drinks on offer, with a demonstration game, some coaching / skills session to help you understand the game or play it better, then we will break up into teams and play a round robin on the day to end it off. All for the nominal cost including some food of CHF10.     To RSVP or If you have any questions please feel free to email :     coaching@swisstouch.org      Looking forward to seeing you there........

			Don't know how big he wants it to be, they have a few different ones in Toysrus.  We got one which is about 120cm high x 180cm wide. Its light, you build it out of the plastic tubes, it comes with a net and 4 metal pegs to push into the grass to keep it in place. It was CHF30. Look on   and see if anything fits the bill.  They also have some at Athleticum, which cost more.

			Hello guys,    
I am looking for a tennis partner.    
I played tennis for quite some time. But then stopped because of practical reasons, also because of busy and of course laziness...... Now, i really miss playing tennis. So plan to play once per week.    
My level is fair, you wont be bored to play with me. I play both single and double. Had quite some experiences in playing doubles. I play for fun, not serious, not against matches either.     
Concerning place for playing, I would suggest play at EPFL/UNIL sport center, where you need to buy a sport card and pay some extra fee for tennis court. Neverthless, it is still much more cheaper than tennis clubs...... and it is a great place for meeting sport lovers, having a drink alongside the lake leman and enjoy tennis!   
OK, enough, thank you for your attention. Contact me if you are interested!  , 0789530356.

			For a very cheap day of golf in a very different setting - try the  
Golf de Pontarlier les Etraches, in the nearby French Jura. The course is set in the clearings of the Jura mountains- owned by 2 young French guys, very friendly, with shooting range and a couple of pros. About 1 hour from Lausanne. 18 holes for 39 Euros - best value ever.

2763	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cycling weekend suggestions for Ticino	MissS	2,843	9	Location: Zürich	18.04.2012, 11:37	" 
			
			So, quick report on the cycling in Ticino:   
1. It rained 80% of the time. That sucked, but I still managed to get in three rides by keeping an eye on the radar pictures. Although during one ride I got soaked twice and ended up shivering down on the descent.   
2. AMAZING area for cycling! Totally recommended, and the pdf (see earlier posts) was invaluable. The hotel had an original copy in large form that I took with me.   
3. Bring your ID/passport - so much fun being able to ride into Italy    
4. There are a few direct trains each day to Locarno, which is worth it to not have to bother changing trains with the bike. The bike spots are limited though, so suggest getting to the train station as early as possible. Taxi to Ascona was approx ~28chf with bike.     
This was the only nice weather day of the four day weekend. The gradient in Valle Maggia is quite easy, and part of the ride has separated bike lanes. I used these on the way up, but stuck to the road on the way down. Worth doing though because they take you into the beautiful little towns along the way. 
Val Bavona is much steeper and a good challenge. All the way along you're following the river and there were constant waterfalls at the side, most notable the big one at Foroglio. 
The descent back through Val Bavona is steep and twisty and a lot of fun, but I hit a strong head wind in Valle Maggia and it turned what was supposed to be an easy 20k back into a slog (with a puncture 12k from the end, just to top it off!). Apparently this is not uncommon in Valle Maggia. 
Strava link:      
I waited until a break in the rain on the afternoon of the second day then decided to give this long ride a crack. It was AMAZING. The climb up Val Cannobina starts off quite steep then settles into a managemable gradient. It gets steep again near the end though, and quite narrow. I almost had a heart attack a few times when the drivers came down honking their horns before corners. The first part in the forest is absolutely stunning, again lots of waterfalls and an incredible gorge off to the side with a fast flowing river. 
By the time I reached the top of the 20k climb I was over being wet and cold, and happy to start the descent. And wow! what a descent! It starts of super twisty and steep so I wouldn't recommend doing this ride in the opposite direction. Wet roads and rain made me a bit cautious but can't wait to do this again on a dry day. The towns of Malesco and Re are quite beautiful and worth a stop on a nicer day. 
I stopped over the border for a hot chocolate and some Smarties at the service station, and to warm up a little. Thankfully there weren't many cars at all because after that point there is a brilliant descent through Centovalli. The roads are well maintained and the scenery is awesome. 
Strava link:  
(Note on Strava, the elevation seems to be way out on this ride, refer to the elevation graph not the elevation gain that's quoted.)     
I got up very early to beat the weather on this one, and it was totally worth it. I was able to ride right along the shores of Lago Maggiore on the usual pedestrian path only as there was no-one about. The climb from Tenero to the Contra Dam (James Bond Dam) is pretty intense, but worth it for the photos at the dam - so cool, and totally empty at 7:30am. 
After Contra Dam the gradient is quite relaxed, and the valley climbs and climbs. There is the beautiful village of Lavertezzo along the way, with it's old stone bridge (as seen on postcards of the area). The river was an amazing blue/green colour from all the snowmelt. 
Eventually arrived in Sonogno, which is a well maintained stone village at the very end of the valley. Thankfully even at the early hour the cafe was open and I was able to get another well earned hot choc before starting the descent back to Locarno. 
The descent is AWESOME. The part up until Contra Dam is not too steep but you can still get a bit of speed and it's a really pleasant ride. I was a bit surprised when I reached Lavertezzo so quickly, you forget how much you have climbed. The final descent from Contra Dam to Tenero is not for the faint-hearted, but if you're any good at these kind of steep, twisty roads, it's absolutely brilliant. I was lucky enough not to have any cars near me so I could fang it the whole way down. 
Strava link:    
All up, despite the horrible weather, it was a fantastic weekend. I will definitely be going back there again to re-do the second ride and hopefully try out some of the other rides as well.

			Found this article over at  and thought it was interesting      I must say I never thought cricket would be seen outside countries of the former British Empire. I´ve tried a few times to explain the game to Swiss and Germans, but you can imagine their horror when I tell them it takes all day, and that is the FAST version of the game. Understandable really    
Your thoughts on cricket? Is it a good thing for the Swiss, or is cricket a game that you really have to grow up with to like or understand?

			I had a really bad experience with Geneva runners. Very unfriendly, and first run I went on they didnt explain the course or wait for people. Ended up getting lost. Im not a really slow runner (just did a 10km in 48 min and have run a 3.30 mara) so Id hate to be a slow or new runner running with those guys. Worse still was when I let the organiser know she had a go at me and disputed what happened! Its a shame as running is about being social friendly and getting fit! GOod luck with your search for a running buddy. Im not saying dont go to Geneva runners, just be aware of my experience and perhaps ask someone to run with you when you go or to wait for you if you end up alone.

			Yes, I forgot to mention there is one in Ticino, I even know the Instructor :-) It's only a bit to far away for me. And the school that teaches wing tsun, (in Uster) has part of the CLF punches, but not forms and the whole system... If there is any more you have found, please let me know! 
Thanks for looking it up! Looking forward to more :-)

There are loads of water stops and if it's like previous years, they give out bottles rather than paper cups so you can always carry one of theirs with you for a bit but really their's no need.   
There's more than enough food on the way as well. Gels, bananas and those carbo bar things.   
The information pack tells you what's available and where but I wouldn't worry.   
There is a very little hill on the the way to Meilen but not high or steep enough to cause any problems.

			Hi Folks,   
Am looking for any tips or recommendations for doing this bike route. We would preferably like to camp or stay in BnBs along the way. Would love to hear from anyone who has done this route before and would like to share some tips regarding where to stay, equipment list, must see places along the way etc...        
We are planning to go over easter, would this be a good time? Also how long did they trip take?   
We are a fairly sporty couple but this would be our first biking trip. We would also need to kit our bikes as we dont have all the equipment. Also do you think it is feasible for 2 persons on bikes to be able to carry all camping equipment: tent, sleepingmats, sleeping bags etc?   
Cheers

			Hi I would be interested in joining though I am not sure whether I will be able to follow your pace. I run regularly and has already done a marathon but I am not used to run this length (I am usually running between 7 and 10 km). I can join you maybe a first time to see how it goes. I live in Oerlikon. Tell me when is your next saturday's training (not sure I can this saturday but likely yes for the next one) and I will come !

			Whatever sports we do it is vitally important to try and minimise the risk of injury.  Structural balance and muscle strength testing can pinpoint any weaknesses and help avoid injuries   
My company, Swiss Strength is offering these tests as well as constructive advise on what exercises are the most effective to remedy any weak links.   
Bored of training in the gym.  Starting soon we will also be starting strength and fitness boot camps culminating with a special fitness day on April 21st with a couple of guest international coaches in attendence.     
More details to follow but we will be offering such things as modified strongman with sled pulls as well as bodyweight exercises and maybe some boxing and kali stick fighting.   
This will be suitable for girls and guys.  Hard work, yes.  Fun and a change from the usual gym and cardio session - definitely   
Feel free to PM me

			To get a court at the Vidy courts without a reservation, I suggest calling to check with them (French only) to check on availability mid to late afternoon on Saturdays or Sundays.  If there is availability, you can usually get on later in the day with only waiting a short time.  The courts cost CHF 17 per person for one hour.

			I am looking at starting a bootcamp group in Winterthur. I have an English (and german) speaking fitness instructor lined up. I'd aim for a couple of evenings a week for a start and see how it goes fom there. It would be outdoors and within walking/cyling distance of the Winti HB. We need a minimum of 4 people (the more the merrier). Is anyone interested? We can start as soon as we have enough people. It would be ~20-25CHF per person per session, depending on how many people are interested.

So, I purchased the TRX Force Tactical kit Friday afternoon and I'm hoping it arrives this week. My wife and I have decided that I will be a stay at home Dad, so I'm hoping it will really pay off.   
Thanks again for your feedback mate, it really helped me out. How does your brother enjoy the system and have you tried it personally?

			I've seen sand volleyball being played at Grun 80. There are eight places for playing. Look at MAPS in google and type in Grosse Allee, Münchenstein. Easy to find on the satellite setting.   
Hope this helps you out.

			HI Anthony   
My company runs strength and conditioning sessions aimed at rugby and American Football.  One of the coaches has played USA Football. He travel back and forth between our UK offices and will not be in Switzerland on that date but am sure would be interested    
We are also running a special training weekend April 20 with a couple of international guest strength coaches who regularly train some of the pro Rugby guys in UK

2852	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	beginner skiing in Nendaz or Siviez?	hsd	1,839	12	Location: Geneva	10.02.2012, 20:13	" 
			
			Yes we ended up staying in Nendaz and skied both there and Siviez with the family.  The village of Nendaz was great, lots to do and really great restaurants.  The drive up the mountain is not for those with a fear of heights   For the skiing I think for true beginners as small children the Siviez set up is better.  We were with 2 three year olds, a five year old, and a 6 year old.  Those stairs in Nendaz with the number of skis we had to carry were not ideal.  However once you are there Tracouet is great for the kids.  Our five year old had a huge tantrum out of fear in the freezing snowstorm in Tracouet the first day and it was not fun getting her and the skis back up the stairs.  The ski instructors needed help getting all the kids and the equipment down the steps.  For our adult friend who is also a beginner, Nendaz was perfect and the stairs were not an obstacle.   
Siviez was a very easy and close drive to ski with everyone.  Parking was not an issue, even during the busy time over the Feb break.  All of the children (and adults) were able to keep their same instructors from Neige Adventure who met us in Siviez.  It was a great experience, with everyone skiing from the top of the mountain by the end, with our littlest happily playing in the nursery at the bottom of the slopes.  The main trail did get very crowded in Siviez however.   
It is best to stay in Nendaz, even with skiing in Siviez I think, because there are more restaurants and things.  The views from all of Nendaz are amazing.   
We never made it to Villars to give any feedback.  Recently though, we did end up in Morzine which was fantastic for families with small children.  It is a lower altitude though, so not sure what it would be like now.   
Thanks for everyone's advice!

2855	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Big Bike Swap Events, Velobörse	guest	1,117	0	null	null	" 
			
			For those of you whose children are inconsiderate enough to grow much faster than your wallet allows, every spring there are a number of, what I like to call ""bike swap"" events throughout this fine land.  
Officially they are called ""Velobörse"" and you can do your own search in your area, if you don't find anything here.   
You can come along and sell your old bike- you label it with your theoretical price, (the organisers get a small cut) and leave it there for the day. Pick up your cash, or unsold bike at the end of the day. 
And you can buy a pre-loved, new bike for yourself.   
Just like in any market, of course the best ones, at the best price go first. 
Run-arounds usually go for about 50-100 chf. Kids bikes, 5-50 chf. 
A decent racing road-bike.. well, you can find them there too. 
""Follow-me""'s, trailers, babyseats, tricycles.. they often have these there too. Luck of the draw of course.     
Here is a list of a few that are coming up:       
Feel free to add some as you find them.   
And some reviews might be good too.

I have read the posts on here about Riding Lessons but I am wondering if any of the stables around Zurich offer hacks. I am not a very experienced rider, I rode off and on as a child, but I still enjoy going riding occassionally.    
I am looking for somewhere offering 1 hour/2 hour/half day riding where I would be able to trot and canter.

			Janine Hug, Lomi Lomi Massage therapist and Body Worker   
I had a pleasure to meet the above mentioned person during the massage workshop this weekend. Janine is very skilled massage therapist/teacher  and a lovely person. After 3 days massage workshop I can't recommend her highly enough.  
She is very laid back and supportive instructor with lots of good energy.  
If you don't speak any German or very little you are still welcome to join as Janine speaks perfect English and can run the courses in both English and German so translating is not a problem, however, the main language is local language so you will also pick up some Schweizerdeutsch during the course which is another benefit.  
She is absolutely passionate about giving and teaching Hawaiian Lomi Lomi massage so if you are looking for Lomi Lomi massage experience as a client or professional Lomi Lomi massage instructor, do not wait any longer and contact Janine.    
Her workshops are not very expensive but she is worth every money and is very busy with clients and teaching. 
After learning about Hawaiian touch you can also attend massage exchange weekends and meet other massage enthusiasts there. This is fantastic opportunity to meet many open minded, friendly, Swiss people.

In general, MA are as good as their live training and resistance.   
The only MA worth mentioning or backing up from the ones posted before to me is escrima, and only (and that is very unlikely) if it looks like   .   
If you want him to learn properly (and in order to do so, you must cross train) I would suggest Judo, Boxing, Wrestling, BJJ, Muay Thai. Kyokushin Karate.   
For sport itself, I would suggest Olympic MA or disciplines,  
(TKD, Judo, Fencing).   
As an activity in General, I guess any MA will do.

			Hello everyone,   
Since some time now I am interested in learning and practicing wall climbing. I live around Zürich and I found two nice indoor climbing centers Kletterzentrum Milandia in Greifensee and Kletterzentrum Gaswerk in Schlieren. The problem is that I have never done it before, and when I asked for the Grundkurs 1 (the basic climbing course) they recommended me to find an english speaking partner since I am not so fluent in german.   
So, I am wondering if anyone would like to join me, or if anyone has some tips.    
Adrian.

			My advice is don't get seduced by the big resorts. If you are real beginner - and need only to master turns - there is not point paying out big bucks when you'll only need the lift half a dozen times.   
Amden/Arvenbuhl is currently in very good condition - although I suspect by the weekend the bottom slope in Amden will begin to suffer from holiday season and the rising temperatures. Arvenbuhl has a chairlift slope - and 2 draglifts - one of which is without camber - and nice and gentle.   
You'll also learn more in 1/2 day with private tuition than in 2 days in a class (IMHO). Once you have the basics get out with friends/colleagues.   
What level are you at?

			They had 2500 for their last home game, admittely in Arctic conditions.  Average this season is about 4,000.   
Grasshoppers have been in slow decline for the last ten years. They have an excellent youth setup but no money, so they can't hold on to the talents that they produce - and attendances have been declining as well. They were the biggest team in the country when I first came here 14 years ago, now they are bottom half of the table.   
Mind you, it could be worse - I am (or was) a season ticket holder at Neuchâtel Xamax and we're not even in the league any more since last month !

But ski boots are made of thick plastic, so maybe you need to warm up the plastic with a hair dryer during the stretching process.

			Dear all,   
Can anyone suggest a pub, hotel...or anywhere... that is likely to show the England v Wales game next Saturday in the Riederalp, Kanton Wallis area?!   
I'm down in Wallis for a long weekend and suddenly realised that I won't be able to take my TV or my local irish pub with me!   
Thanks in advance for any suggestions! 
Go Wales!

			Ok, a plan is coming together -   
Cheers MathNut for the very interesting reply, when you mentioned the 20 rounds per year that the militia fire it peaked my interest. If I cant shoot full auto then it would be nice to find something to do in Switzerland and I have done some research         
So it looks like it should be possible to shoot at the 300m range in a similar way to the Swiss militia. It seems like a good thing to try. 
This would be very challenging for me in itself, I mostly shoot IPSC practical and 3 gun, so the longest shooting I have ever done was 150m standing  and that didnt go so well. I will have to try to practice before I go I think. 
Thanks Arthur for your helpful post I will contact a few ranges but if I have any specific trouble I will PM you. One question  can the electronic scoring system at Swiss ranges all score you for the A5 and B4 type targets  in other words are the ranges set up for both? 
Thanks,
Matt   "	Posts: 4	Join Date: Feb 2012	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

now I don't have my inline-skate in Zurich, but probably next week I will have them. I think around the airport is a good area to skate.  
During the week I can't but in the weekend I could go to skate at whatever time. Which is the best timetable for you?

			Thanks for the tip. This looks right up my street - a good race for donkies. The competition seems pretty fierce. I imagine I could manage 1000m climb/h, which gets you a finish time of 1:40 & a crap position even in Herren 2, the old gits class, where I belong... I'm used to mountain races so maybe stair climbing is much easier  . Or maybe I'm kidding myself...

			I am very interested in ski touring. 
I am an intermediate to advanced skier on-piste. Love snowshoeing, and now ready for touring. 
Never done off-piste, but interested in getting out of crowds and 30mins lift waiting lines. 
Where to begin with ski touring? 
Sources of information ( emglish preferred). 
Anyone interested in beginners ski touring courses in the Montreux area ( english guide). 
Have taken first aid in mountains course and avalanche courses, as well as glacier ... Now need a group of adventurers, english speaking, to progress into this beautiful sport. 
Joined CAS but is mostly french speaking. Learning french but coming slowly.   
Anyway, contact me if interested, in good shape, and thinking about learning ski touring... Day or night activity ( with lamps) in Les pleiades or le paccots during the week a must.

			I myself haven't tried any deep powder skis, but I just upgraded my 1080 Spaceframes to the Twenty-Twelves and I'm super impressed!   
The 1080s did well in off-piste, although back then there weren't many other options from Salomon other than the Pocket Rockets. They were amazing in the park and half pipe, but definitely lacked at highspeed carving.   
The Twenty-twelves, although only slightly wider than the 1080s, have performed amazing off-piste (only touched snow knee deep so far), and are very fast and solid on carving. Haven't tried them in the park or pipe yet, but so far, the best all-mountain ski I've ridden.   
Sorry this doesn't quite answer your question, but hopefully gives some input to someone.

If I thought their level of playng might suit my level of playing, I'd sure get in touch and see if anyone speaks English enough to tell  me where the sports' hall is and what time they train. A common interest is a great way to get to know people and learn basics of a language and if you play already, many of the terms will be self-explanitory.    
When our girls started swimming competitively in England, they were thrown by the coach saying 'go on red ten',  but they soon enough found out what it meant!     
Good luck in finding a team anyway.

Surprisingly, it was subjectively warmer than last Friday, maybe because there was no wind.  
Anyway, I reached avg speed 7.7 km/h without any special efforts. And the shining Moon was as always incredible.   
At Friday night I will probably try La Vue-des-Alpes.

			ok ok ok guys I have to tell u that most of u seem to have no idea   .... 
I´m from Austria... from Vorarlberg. Thats the region just at the swiss border   
I live in a valley where you can choose to go into 5 !!!! different valleys with skiing resorts where you can just live where the lifts are!!!!!!!!      Actually I don't want to make to much advertisement cause we already do have too mucho tourists but anyways for you guys i´ll do it   ... as we austrians are very guest-friendly   
Lech/Zürs 
Damüls, Didamskopf 
Montafon (Golm, Silvretta Nova, HochJoch, Gargellen) 
Brandnertal (good prices) 
Klostertal Sonnenkopf (a small but well affordable one)   
Lech/Zürs is more posh but compared to swiss prices it is not too bad!!! honestly!!! 
Damüls/Didamskopf high up in the mountains little villages, nice areas!! 
Montafon (=valley, very good prices for families and kids!) 
Brandnertal and Klostertal are smaller but good prices and very nice too.     
well ;D and this is only the closest parts (it takes u 1,5 - 2 h from zurich to get there!) a lot of swiss ppl are coming cause its cheaper but pppppssssst don't tell everyone!!! ;D as if everybody knows there will be no more powder for me   ....

			Seen a lot of boards in brocki's here (2nd hand shops) but I'd steer well clear of those, really really old boards in terrible condition, usually with the clip on type bindings.    
for your budget you're really going to struggle, even ex hire boards are more then that. at the end of the season the out of town sports shops sell off old stock pretty cheap, we've managed to get ok boards and bindings for less then 150 chf, and new boots from 15chf (the hire type boots, but still new), that was a few seasons ago though, and the recent sales have been lousy.

I went to Athleticum, and they had a ski bag at 20 CHF (but the straps didn't look very sturdy) and only one expensive and small boots bag.    
In the end I went to the Migros SportXX at M-Parc and got both for 50 CHF.  Aldi might've been a bit cheaper had I had time to get there, but I'm happy with these.

			Been a few times now for both indoor rock climbing and using the aquatic park...Didn't realize it was built by Migros although there is an attached sort of mini mall that includes a small Migros supermarket, as well   
It's just across the border from Geneva and is a pretty good spot for both the climbing and the thermal baths...I think I still prefer the thermal baths in Lavey but this has some strong points, too...My only true complaint about   is that the chlorine level is too high for me...In Lavey you really don't feel like you're swimming in a pool of hyper-chlorinated water   
The climbing walls are quite interesting for those who are quite adept at it but not so great for the newbies (Like myself) as there are fewer 'easier' climbs...Far bigger than the escalade location just outside of Vevey (Perhaps 5 times as much)...My wife loves it though   
There's a special atm where the entry to the thermal baths is reduced by 50% on Tuesdays through the end of March 2012...Normal price is €33 for an adult for 4 hrs but that includes the 'spa' areas, otherwise just the pools is €17...Children I believe are about half that             "	Posts: 615	Join Date: Jan 2008	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 60 Times in 26 Posts	Thanked 511 Times in 247 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

Please note that the man who rents outs skis cannot speak English.  Or high German.  Or French.  But he knows his skis and the prices are reasonable.  He'll understand you if you speak high German but be ready for answers in Swiss German.

The only route I can see - would be Neuageri - Grundlen - Brame - Bolxli - Menzingen - Stalden - Brattigen - Erlenbach - Sarbach - Neutal - Sennmeid - Sihlbrugg.   
It is far from direct - but it pretty much stays clear of tarmac.

2932	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Tips for buying skis	some_randomer	1,583	9	Location: Zurich	26.01.2012, 20:43	"    As   said, most people in your position find a season rental from Karrer much better value and sense.      All skis these days are carvers. As you're new to the sport just ask in the rental shop for something suitable. They'll give you a decent all-round piste ski, and also deal with your questions about size and type. At 6'2"" you'll probably end up with a 170cm or so, but honestly the shop's in a much better position to judge than I.    
Boots and skis are interchangeable - rental bindings adjust to any size, whereas if you buy 2nd hand you may end up having to get the bindings remounted if they've been set up for someone with much smaller or larger boots.   
What else? Well, depending on your build and athleticism, make sure that the boots aren't too stiff. I've had several learners this year who are physically unable to flex their boots forward, which you should be able to do if you lean forwards with all your weight. Again, a decent shop like Karrer should make sure you get the right thing, but try this out just in case. I'd recommend trying a few sessions first, then perhaps buying your own boots for best fit and comfort, but if you buy them first you _will_ end up regretting it   
Oh, the last, but most important thing: Lessons! There have been quite a few threads about this recently, so I suggest you do a good search before deciding to book lessons with us in Engelberg  "	Posts: 138	Join Date: Jun 2011	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 56 Times in 32 Posts	no particular reputation at present

Visit ricardo.ch or cash converters shops like  , for second hand snowboards and Mirgos for affordable boots.  Of course, you have to do tons of asking and googling before making that final purchase.

I keep going back and forth as to whether or not we should try someplace new, or stick with where we have always gone and know the routine (the kids know it as well...) and have a great hotel where we like to stay.

			Hi and welcome. Please use the search function here, as there have been several threads asking exactly the same thing not long ago, with lots of great info.   
The Jura can be great, but conditions are not ideal at the moment.   
Many Swiss resorts are easy to reach by train and bus, like Torgon/Chatel from Aigle rail station, Haute-Nendaz from Sion station, and Verbier by train all the way to Le Chable, then cable car up to resort and above.

There is a small shop on the lake rd nr Versoix but can't see it being cheap, otherwise take a look in the athleticum in the Meyrin out of town shopping centre.

			One comment about the scratching. Do yourself a favour and give the areas where you will put the magnets a bit of a rinse and and wipe with an old cloth. You will get rid of the dirt that is on the roof of the car and lessen the chance of scratching.   
The other security measure is that you need to put the little strap with the plastic blocker on the end  . The part with the safety strap should be   (so the plastic pieces are grabbed by the driver and passenger doors). If the front magnet starts to lift off the skis will have less of a chance to fly off the car before you can slow down.

			I just saw this thread today.   
-weekday is better than weekend. But both ok. I would not expect get a tournament spot on the weekend unless you book much much earlier.   
- ask the golf courses about players without handicap. I have played tournaments where they allow one non-handicapped per flight.    
I have played in about 30 tournaments in the last 10 years organized through my company or group of friends, and not once have I been asked to show my handicap card. I don't know why, but it could be that they expect the organizing group to do the vetting?? But then again, we have been banned from Holzheusern because of the poor quality of play and slow play!   
- golfers paradise is known to sponsor tournament prizes, they give gift vouchers to spend at their golf shop. Worth asking if we have more than 20 players.   
- I suggest besides the Migros courses, the courses just across the border like Obere Alp, Steisslingen, Oeschberghof.   
By the way, anyone fancy a casual round sometime? I am 12 handicap in Thalwil.

The big 40cm long gouge and white patches of worn off wax were the clue to have them sorted    
They are freestyle ski's so maybe sking a little bit off piste on them wasnt the best idea.  I'll be back on my Salomon X-wings for the weekend as they have always been quite hardy! (Maybe K2's are a bit soft?)

2971	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Fishing- from India to Switzerland	V Badola	661	0	Location: Nyon	09.01.2012, 19:01	"   Namaste and Petri Heil to anglers here. 
I'm a fishing nut from India now settled in Nyon. When in India, I guide and run expeditions to freshwater and saltwater locations. I generally fish for mahseer, goonch, giant trevally and barramundi but thoroughly enjoy flyfishing for trout (yes, we have them in India- the Loch Leven browns and Norwegian rainbows).
I'm free most weekdays and need a buddy to harass local fish. Any fishing will do, the bigger the fish, the happier we are. 
According to my research, I understand one needs a license (the SaNa card) but is possible to fish on a day permit. The season's closed for trout and salmonids, but for Nyon the day ticket for the lake is 10CHF and for rivers it's 15CHF.
The fishing is catch and kill, but I don't know how I'm going to do that- my hands are so slippery, all fish escape the moment I unhook them . 
If anyone's heading out for a session, or if anyone would like to spend a day around Nyon, please let me know. The season is open for pike and non-salmonids. 
Cheers and best,

			Thanks all for the responses, offers and advice.  Apols for only coming back now, but Christmas travelling meant I've only logged back on.   
Looking to go to Hillseekers this week.  With my commute (Oberrieden to Opfikon), the roads are getting a bit silly at times and to be honest, it's fooking freezing early doors, so I'm mainly catching the train and doing the swim/run thing at lunch, with rollers in the evening.  Hoping to play it by ear and get out on the bike at the weekends.   
Thanks all again!

			Can anyone recommend any ski resorts which are particularly quiet midweek?     
Normally i'm a weekend snowboarder, but i'll be going fairly often midweek this year and i like the idea of having slopes to myself      
Might even attempt a few jumps in the park if I can find somewhere where there aren't 20 kids sitting around sniggering at my 10cm of big air, followed by faceplant    
Thanks

2981	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Gun clubs and or shooting ranges in the Neuchatel area?	tex-a-sours-rex	1,934	2	Location: Peseux	16.12.2011, 06:02	" 
			
			Hello,   
I'm a competition shooter here and I moved here from Canada (Meaning I came too, from a very different gun culture!). The general ranges here really are built just for that: Competition shooting. That means the 300m ranges are designed for the the Swiss military service rifles such as the K-31 bolt action rifle, the STG-57, and the STG-90. For the first two they use the GP11 (7.5) ammunition and the last uses the GP90 (5.6x45) ammunition. At the standard ranges this is the only ammo you can buy there.   
There is of course the Standartgewehr, a brutal expensive gun designed just for competition shooting. It also use the GP11.   
Most places frown upon the use of other firearms and they take the competition shooting very seriously. You must be accepted as a member, but of course you can come by to try things out and most are happy to see new members join. Most clubs have a year program where there are different types of shoots and you enter the results into a book and it all adds up in the end to decide the winner at the end of the year (best shooter).   
There are also clubs for 50m where you can shoot either pistols (theres more leeway for the types of guns, but still, it's for competition) or smallbore, which is the .22 .   
There are places for the crossbow, often 30m.   
Then there is the 10m air gun ranges, often indoor. There you shoot everything, but almost always using special competition rifles. (Anything you buy at a hardware shop for the young 'uns is not accurate enough)   
But almost everything is geared towards the standard competition shooting which every club has a similar program. Shooting at a range just to get some bullets out is not nearly as big here and not highly regarded. There are some places where you can do this though. Such as the Brünig-indoor shooting place. There they have everything; all sorts of ranges for everytype of gun, from shotguns to pistols, to any rifle really. (I go there to range in my K-98, even though it's similar to the Swiss K-31, at the regular club I go to, they don't like me bringing it, so you see what I mean by it not being the same as in the States). But places like these cost A LOT! But you don't join a club there, you pay per half an hour to rent out a range.    
As for ammunition, as I said, you can only buy the standard ammo that the competition shooters are using at most of the ranges, otherwise you have to go to a gun shop to buy ammo, and often it's limited. I mean if you have a M1 then it's gonna be tough. So RUAG ammotech is the way to go, they have everything, even the extinct ( ) 8mm for my K-98. And they have it all for both hunting and competition.   
There is of course always exceptions, and maybe a club in Neuchâtel is more open towards foreign firearms. But what I said is very true for most of the ranges here, I haven't heard of anything else.   
There's lots more info to give, but this is a start. PM me if you have any specific questions.   
Cheers,   
Arthur

			I really like the migros fitnesspark (on top: Pulse 5 and Stockerhof). They have a good selection of courses, but it is true you need to arrive early to be sure to go in.   
But the best part for me is the nice sauna and hot pool area. So if you are late for the course just go on the thread-mill by yourself and then indulge in the hot tub.

			Hi all.  Happy New Year.  Looking for a good place to have some serious work done on the skis in the GVA to Lausanne area.  Would even consider going to Annemasse if it was worth it.  Specifically, the place needs to be able to do a base weld (oops) and not just throw some p-tex into a hole, which I can do myself at home.  Would love to find a small, locally owned shop that cares about stuff like this rather than a sports equipment chain that just happens to tune skis as well.  Anything up in St. Cergue/Les Rousses or Gex fit the bill?   
Thanks in advance for any recommends.

			The French side is normally cheaper, but if you go through the ski company- you'll find their deals are the best value around- and as said you'd find a bunch of young Brits, Ozzies and Kiwis to board with. The prices quoted can be reduced if you go in for a 'filler' eg one or a few people asking them if they have any weeks when they can give a reduced price to fill spare spaces. You could also ask if they have any weeks when they need extra help in exchange for board and lodgings.  BTW they also run some weeks in other resort, including Arosa, Crans Montana,Leysins,  Haute Nendaz, etc. The accommodation is simple but right on the slopes- fabulous.   
Check them out on Face Book they've just added some great piccies.

			There is a C curve on the middle of the track you should be careful with. I got to know the tree there on a first name basis. I think they put the net because of me, otherwise tree would have to put a restraining order. Say hello from me.   
Go in the morning: the track gets really bumpy (arse hurting) after midday.   
And keep an eye for scrudge ski guys that decide to take the sledge track up instead of paying for an elevator ticket back up to the ski tracks.   
Have fun.

I've emailed them to let them know they got the wrong Oberwil!

Would love to catch up I am a middle skill skier and there are not many runs on Flumserberg I don't know (maybe 2 I have not been on yet)   
Send me a PB if you plan this friday 23rd to be there

			There are also some shops that do a hire arrangement for the season where typically new equipment is hired to you and then at the end of the season you can choose to return, continue to hire for next season,  buy . I know many people who do this at a shop in Laufen (Basel land   ) and they reckon this is the best way. As a novice adult skier you may opt for a boot that is less performance and more comfort orientated, as you progress in skiing you may choose stiffer or closer fitting boots. By doing the season rental you are not tied in to having bought boots that you may out-perform after 2 seasons but you also benefit from fitting guarantees and beign able to change boots.    
In Zurich, I believe this store near Hubertus tramstop will rent skis and snowboards for the season:   There are probably other shops that have this arrangement too.

			That's correct, there are many shooting events open to the general public...they're called ""Volksschiessen"" and you'll be able to shoot a .22 rifle and if you reach a certain point level, you receive a medal. You can also form a group consisting of 4 members, where you compete against other groups. Some traditional Swiss companies, own their own rifles and participate regularly on such events.

			bikes are probably cheaper in the states, but not by a huge margin for inexpensive ones. The hassle of packing and shipping it probably cancels the advantage.   
There's quite a vibrant used bike market here, people tend to keep bikes going for decades. Check out   for starters.      Railway station bike parking is always a bit of a rough and tumble. Not the best place for a 12lb carbon frame, shall we say.   
A medium grade 20-year old steel frame bike is quite a popular choice, good enough for happy commuting, not desirable to steal and not the greatest loss if it is lost.   
Here in Geneva the popularity of single-speeds for commuting is growing.      The Swiss cycling season is unofficially February through November for the tougher grade of cyclist, and April through September for the softies. There is also a significant core of HTFUed cyclists who carry on as long as there is no snow on the ground. It just depends on how fit, tough, warm, and crazy you are.

			I would offer my services as instructor, however treading on the toes of the local ski schools is also not a good idea and whilst I hold a current certification unless I'm employed by a school I don't think I have liability coverage.   
If I don't end up in US working with an adaptive school then I may be around and will happily offer some informal coaching (because I enjoy it).   
In the meantime I'll offer a couple of key insights:   
The main thing is get good boots, if you buy them spend the time to get them fitted properly, these are the key to having a good base, remember you are going to have them on your feet for several hours at a time. If you find a good shop they will look at the shape of your foot and recommend the boot that best matches your foot shape, any shop that just gives you the one you like the look off is a shop you should run away from, also they will tell you to come back after a few days so that they can do any tweaks that are required.   
For beginners the key thing to remember is that when you turn don't stop turning until you are pointing slightly uphill this will help you keep your speed under control with very little effort and is also the easiest way to stop    
And finally if you have a lesson and say you want to learn to ski expert trails don't be surprised  if they take you to a beginner or intermediate slope as you need to learn the techniques somewhere where you are comfortable and at ease rather than worrying about being on a steep slope, once you've grasped the techniques then they'll take you to the more expert terrain

I guess it does depend on the group and what kind of programme the instructor has set up. But it is fun! 
I was always hungry like crazy after a session.

			I'm an exchange student and will only be here for one semester so buying pants is not really worthwhile. 
It's just a one time trip in Zinal organized by my university xchange group. 
And they advised us to rent everything here in lausanne maybe because of time since its not a lot, and waiting in lines to rent equipment might take out a lot of time.

Are there any english speaking mountain people in the Uri/Nidwalden/Obwadeln/Schwyz-sections? I am considering joining the SAC, but I am a bit worried that I'll remain as an outsider with my poorish german skills... Any experience on the sections in these kantons would be appreciated.   
Also, I would be more than happy to meet other english speaking people, who are skiing, skitouring, mtb:ing or climbing these georgeous mountains around us. Anyone out there? I am looking for people to share these hobbies with; mountain sports aren't really the kind of ventures you can or should do alone. So, trustworthy and happy people, experienced or novice, raise your hand!

			There is actually an English speaking golf club,  a proper association fully accredited in Switzerland (without its own course) where you can play with other expats.  They run tournaments, allowing people to meet up at times suiting them, within a certain time period, e.g. two months.  At the end there are prizes as usual ... its a good group actually.

			We've been several times now with our kids (now 7 and 4) to Grindelwald. Ski lessons are excellent there - they have a great ski school with it's own big separate area for the kids who are complete beginners. Older ones ride the cable car with their teacher. The only thing I would say is if you want morning lessons (which are usually best for kids) then you need to pre book. There is also a brilliant daycare right at the ski school if your kids want a non-skiing afternoon of drawing/playing/mucking about and you yourselves want to do a bit more skiing. The other thing we always liked about Grindelwald is that being such a touristy place there are loads of non-skiing things to do (like sledging, skating, swimming, snowshoe walks, just riding the train.)

Sooo if anyone is interested in joining the league the website is here...        
and if you already have a team, here is the code to join my EF'ers league

			Since the cost of pilates classes is quite high in Zurich compared to other cities in Europe or the US, i've decided to buy a nice selection of pilates DVDs at all levels from Amazon US and they were great: huge selection of effective exerices. it's like having a personal pilates instructor at home for a fraction of the price.

			In Switzerland, almost all of the junior programs are connected to the professional teams -- so for example, if you live in Rapperswil, the Lakers have a junior program that has teams for players from age 6-22.    
If you're looking for something more recreational, look into joining a team from a smaller town that doesn't play at as high of level (example Dübendorf vs. Zurich).

			Just turn up. But the only day I know they definitely play is a Sunday at Waffenplatz, but I dont know what time, possibly 1pm. You might want to email someone and find out. (Sorry I dont actually play). Think now summer is over they no longer play on a Monday night or Friday lunchtime. They are a friendly bunch though and always welcome new players.

It covers Männlichen, First and also the Mürren/Schilthorn area. It also entitles you to half price tickets up the mountain during the summer season. Happy skiing/ boarding...

			Hi,   
Sorry, I have been in the UK and had limited access to my emails. I have not had any luck so far finding athletics clubs, but I will email the BSC Old Boys Club, so thanks for that.   
I had previoulsy called the Rugby club, but the ladies coach hasn't called me back yet, but then being in the UK I didnt have my Swiss phone on, so will need to chase that up.   
With regards to the type of training I am looking for, while at Bootcamp, it was strength, endurance and speed training etc, so covered everything. When I was younger (I am now 29), I used to do Sprint Hurdles, and although I'm not sure if hurdles is for me anymore, I would be looking for the training for sprinters as appossed to long distance.   
Thanks again for advice and help,   
Emma.

3115	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Elliptical workout (Questions to the experts)	Nil	2,437	35	Location: Basel	08.10.2011, 00:11	"    Not as much space as a treadmill, but more than an exercise bike. Nothing beats an exercise bike for space. A recumbent/sitting down one is also the best for your back. I've used ellipticals and a normal exercise bike and couldn't hack it after a while for the simple fact you have to focus as much on keeping your back straight. Just being able to sit down and focus on your kicking gets rid of a major annoyance for me.   
Not to derail the thread, ellipticals are good since there's also arm movement, but I also found that to be a bit overrated. Most of the movement was generated by my legs and momentum. My arms didn't do as much as I would have liked. I have resigned myself to the fact that focusing on upper body (rowing machine, for example) or lower body (exercise bike) at a time is the best solution. For a mix of both, you've got swimming.

@ stephen_NE 
Some will take your word if they need the green fee or are not busy but most Swiss golf clubs will require proof of handicap from a association that they recognize. I have heard of people getting an online membership from a club that is far away and being rejected at golf courses.  
Certain courses in Switzerland, such as the private ones around Zurich (Breitenloo, Schönenberg, Zumikon) will require a Handicap of 24 or less for green fee players and only let them play Monday - Friday unless accompanied by a member, then they can play on weekends as well. Most of them have higher green fees for Migros and ASG-I card holders.  
With a valid handicap record from a recognized association, you can get your card at Migros or ASG-I both of which are members in ASG (Swiss Golf Association)   
If you don't want membership in a club you might want to look into the ASG-I.  
A good source of information is also swissgolfnetwork.ch you can click on the course and get all the relevant information.    
Most of the clubs that have a T next to them are more public as you can book tee times online.  
Private Clubs like Breitenloo don't have tee times for members. I don't know how they handle visitors but I know there aren't many   
Hope this helps

			Hello all,   
I am looking for other stay at home Moms/ Dads to do some hiking and or  biking with during the week (and possibly the weekends). Since my older boy is  now in the kinderkrippe on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, that frees me up to  be able to carry the little one in a backpack and go for a hike.  We have 2  backpacks, so if you are interested but don't know if you would like to  invest the money, you can try out one of ours before you buy.    
Also,  I have just bought a 2 seater bike trailer.  So if anyone wants to get  out with their bike, I can now do so with both kids.  I also went as far as buying the  cross country ski set for the winter, so we are mobile!  Let me know if  you are interested and we can set something up.   
Cheers,   
Maria

			Another good site for routes is   one. It's designed for people to download the tracks or routes to their GPS unit but is quite informative even just as a reference, or you can download to an Apple or Android phone. I think most tracks also have elevation info so you can see how much climbing to expect easily.

3138	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Bikepacking - a tempting thought	zhigoolet	3,230	21	Location: zurich	04.10.2011, 01:43	" 
			
			Go for it! What is the worst that can happen?   
I found myself in exactly the same situation in April this year, when my girlfriend and I came up with the fantastic/crackpot idea to ride from Zurich to Calais despite neither of us owning a bike at that time, nor even rating as amateur cyclists.   
Even if you know the countries you want to see, pick a route that takes you through the most scenic and interesting regions to make the most of both the cycling and your time off the bikes.   
Decide whether or not you want to be fully self-sufficient when you tour. Cooking for yourself and staying in a tent is great if you are on a budget, but you don't get to enjoy the local hospitality. But at the same time there are plenty of budget accommodation opportunities (see 22 Yards' post), which means lighter loads with no tent and cooking system. We opted for this, as over the course of a one week tour the cost difference was marginal and a fresh bed and hot bath work wonders after a long day on the bike. There is of course the middle ground of camping, but eating out to save on the hassle of carrying, preparing and cooking food each evening.   
So in a simple and not so short answer to your first question, yes it is a great idea.   
Diet was not really a consideration for us. We were spending plenty of energy each day, so a good dinner in the evening to made up the lost calories and we tended to graze throughout the day. Basically whatever we fancied and what was available. No point being fussy if you can't get it mid-trip.   
Equipment is preference and budget. My only advice would be not to scrimp when it comes to cycling shorts and a hard wearing pair of gloves. There are far more knowledgeable people on the forum when it comes to bikes and technicalities, but you can make it on most bikes. I rode a cyclo-cross bike with a pannier rack stuck on the back, whilst my g/f had a more conventional touring bike. The only thing we did do was to splash out on durable 35mm touring tires and we were fortunate enough to avoid punctures.   
Finally on roads... Spend plenty of time researching your route. I think in the better part of 900km we rode less than 4hrs of busy roads and without doubt the busy roads were the toughest in terms of concentration and least enjoyable as a result. Big cities look great on maps, but are a nightmare to navigate around unless you happen to have GPS and the local drivers tend to have varying levels of considerations for cyclists. Ideally get on a smaller road and follow it for as long as possible, this way there is likely less traffic and you lose less time checking maps for navigating as you can just chalk off the villages as you pass through them.   
Best of luck!!!

3141	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	[Zurich] where to find cheap ski gear	MattM	28,862	44	Location: Männedorf	05.09.2007, 14:13	"    There used to be an annual sale of used skiing equipment at community-organized events called ""Skibörse"" all over Switzerland.  These are basically  flea-markets where sellers can bring their stuff in the morning and things are then sold in the afternoon.     
My parents always bought our skiing stuff there - have a look at your community's event calendar, maybe they're still organizing those.

			Of course, the catch is that what is important in swimming is what goes on under the water not what goes on on top, which is why youngsters who have learned by 'looking at other swimmers' usually get it all wrong!    
As the mother mentions the word 'coach', and the youngster is 8 and was swimming in a club in England, I expect she will be able to swim crawl, back crawl and breaststroke already. Fly might come later in the programme but our children were expected to be able to make a decent shot at it by then. Coaches/trainers don't usually get into the water at all. Nasty wet stuff, water.

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

			Hey.  I started with a TT bike from the very beginning,  did Ironman Switzerland after 5 months after bought the bike and then I got a road bike. If you intend to do sprints-olimpic-half IM, get a road bike and put aerobars. For full Ironman,a TT bike is good, as long as you spend 75-80% of the time in aero position.Studies shown that 90% of the drag is the cyclist body so,instead of spending an extra 1500euros on the aero frame-wheels,etc, lose 2kg and you'll be more aero. 
 I live in Dielsdorf, Zurich and I'm gonna have my bikes here next week. If you want to train together and change some ideas, let me know.

			I want to get my daughter into ski lessons, so I want to know if anyone has any good places in the Berner Oberland region where they have ski school for little ones. When I was little, my parents and I would go the mountain and I would go to a ski program where I skied for like half the day while they had some adult time. I'm sure I could find some info on local sites, but I wanted to see if anyone can recommend a place.

			Well, start doing a reasonable amount of exercise. I use public transport all the time so that involves plenty of walking to the bus/tram stations. And also when it comes to eating, making sure eating whole foods and fresh foods would be the best solutions as they are mostly low in calories and exactly what your body needs. I wouldn't say to cut out entirely on processed food but limit the processed food to as minimum as possible  Plus, going to the gym 30mins a day would already be sufficient if you're really tight on schedule.

3162	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Anyone fancy regular early morning runs near Seefeld?	Tonkington	552	0	Location: Zurich	29.09.2011, 20:53	" 
			
			Hi all   
I'm going to start going for a run first thing (would like to be home by 7.30am at latest) once or twice a week and wondered if anyone wanted to club together and make a thing of it. Should help me get out of bed if I know someone is going to be waiting for me.   
I'd like someone at a similar level of ability to myself. My 10km PB is 44:30 (at the end of a triathlon).   
Over winter I'll mainly be doing long steady runs so probably looking at an hour or so for the morning runs in the morning.   
I've done no training at all for the last month so the first couple will be painful.   
I live near the top of Seefeldstrasse by the Opera house. Would be good to get someone reasonably local as I don't really want to get on a tram to go for a run.   
If anyone is interested please get in touch.   
All the best. 
Dan

3167	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Functional Training Demistified	TatianaK	849	0	Location: Zurich	28.09.2011, 19:30	" 
			
			Athletic Functional Training Definition     
The methodology of athletic functional training traces its beginnings to physical therapy where it was originally utilized as a rehabilitation procedure with injured and recovering patients. Recently, the application of the same principles to the development of peak athletic performance, including professional athletes, has found an increasingly growing interest and popularity across a wide range of disciplines. The primary idea behind an athletic type of functional training is the extension of its practical applications to the process of conditioning, which are also correlated with everyday body movements, life style related activities, and athletic competition.   
Heres a definition of functional training as formulated by Craig Burton:   
All functional movement patterns involve deceleration, stabilization, and acceleration, which occur at every joint in kinetic chain and in all three planes of motion.   
However, the above quoted definition limits its scope solely to the specific manner of a physical movement performance and omits the very core essence of functional training  the functional movement itself  creation, recovery, or improvement of the structural movement, which finds its direct expression in daily life or athletic performance. The quintessence of the athletic functional training is expressed through a progressive exercise program that measurably improves motor functions (strength, speed, endurance, agility, and suppleness) and develops specific skills (functions) in relation to lifestyle activities or a particular sport discipline.

			Have you experienced your legs feeling heavy and tired after an exhausting traninig? Have you had your feet swollen after a long flight? How did you deal with this problem?   
There is a simple and effective procedure to remedy such rather frequent occurrence. Lay down on the floor on your back, close to the wall and put your legs up against the wall. Keep your hips close to the wall and your legs positioned vertical. Hold you position for 10-15 minutes. Stop the exercise when you feel that your legs are getting numb. First, lay your legs flat on the floor for another 2-3 minutes and then  slowly get up.   
This simple remedy is used by athletes and it comes from the 18th century noble Englishman, Sir Isaac Newton, and now we can say after him  gravity works. When you keep your legs higher than the rest of your body, then your heart has a difficulty to pump your blood to the periphery of your body (elevated arms and legs) and must overcome the force of gravity.   
During the progression of this simple exercise you will feel that your blood circulation in your higher positioned legs is going to decrease, giving the feeling of tingling and, sooner or later, numbness. Therefore, the blood ceases to circulate in the feet and lower legs. First, you feel tingling and then numbness in the legs. The blood that departs from that area ""takes away metabolic waste products (in the form of the lymphatic flow) down toward the lymph nodes that will purify the system.   
This procedure is easy, simple and very effective, but it is not intended for individuals who have symptoms of cardiovascular disease, general circulation disorders, or hypertension. Consult your doctor if you're not sure about your heart condition.

			Great job Niranjan. And nice pics!      I've always heard that altitude sickness is not correlated to physical fitness and is mostly determined by genetics alone. Here is   that points in this direction: ""We conclude that habitual physical activity performed at sea level does  not play a role in the development of altitude illness at moderate  altitude in a general tourist group.""      I'd be surprised if this was entirely true. Any expert here?

			If you leave it centered to Zurich you could try ASVZ. I think it is open to non-students as well (paying membership). Their range of sports activities offered is vast.  
Other fitness centers with presence in different cities: 
fitnessplus; Holmes Place; Kieser Training; Silhouette    
But you might find out that the Intercity-Card of Migros Fitnesspark was actually the best offer. I had attempted a comparison over two years ago and it seemed a fairly good offer.

I figure the lesser know routes (within reason, I'm definately not going up a TD north face ) may actually be a lot safer (as well as enjoyable) due to the much lower traffice on them.   
It's a bit of a dream to do the Matterhorn, one to get out of the way rather than just read and think about it. Maybe next year (I hope!)   "	Posts: 272	Join Date: Aug 2011	Senior Member	Groaned at 6 Times in 6 Posts	Thanked 155 Times in 101 Posts	annoyed a few people around here

Mine is half carbon but at my level of ability I wouldn't know the difference. All I know is that the balance is nice, I can ride my bike without hands! It made me feel like a kid again!

			I enjoy watching tennis on TV but the Federer-Djokovic semis on Saturday 10th 2011 was painful... 
It was one of the best matches I've ever seen, along with Federer-Nadal in Wimbledon. But the 2 match points on Fed's serve that he managed to let go and then the collapse in the next 4 games was painful to watch...  
Is it a turning point in his carrier? Is it over for  Roger's big wins?

I'm brand new in Zurich (starting my masters at ETH) and interested in finding people to climb with.  Never done Klettersteig (via ferrata right?) but i've rock climbed for a little bit more then one year.  So sign me up for that introduction event!   
I'm also very interested in trying out the local outdoor climbing areas. I have more or less all of my rock climbing gear with me (including a rope) so I guess I'm looking for someone who's interested and knows about good climbing areas close by (I was climbing 5.7/5.8 back home, don't know what that translates to here).  Is there maybe like a group here that goes climbing?

			Demi-pension essentially means renting a horse from an owner - demi pension usually implies 3 days per week, while 1/4 is one day per week. Lessons are not usually included. Private lessons typically run around CHF 50-60 per hour, group lessons: CHF 40.  If you ar looking for lessons there is a wide selection of stables in the Geneva countryside and neighboring France. A demi pension will run around CHF 300 per month, a bit cheaper across the border in France. What is your riding experience? If you are relatively experienced English rider, I may be able to help.

			Hi there and welcome,   
There is plenty of good riding in the Jura north of Geneva.  We go that way a lot, and also further down the other end of the lake in Leysin, Les Diablerets, Champery to name a few.    
Still hoping to do a trip to Verbier this year, and maybe Chamonix if we get time.   
For some ideas, you can check out these links:         
Also, in July there is the Passportes Du soleil where you can do an 80km route (nearly all lift assisted) around Champery, Morzine, Avoriaz.  Done that the last 2 years and it is a very impressive way to see a lot of places quickly, with plenty of technical riding (if like me, you prefer to keep the wheels on the ground, there are always routes around the jumps etc. the majority would be classed XC/All Mountain).  Link  .   
Please post if you find some interesting routes, or shout i you fancy meeting up and doing a group ride sometime.   
Cheers,   
LoyalRoyal

Funnily enough, she said the absolute worst part was the the long, flat, straight next to the hockey stadium. If you live in Fribourg, there is preparation training every Wednesday evening at the Moncor forest.

			Hi   
I'd also recommend datasport's website to see what is coming up         
Or join a tri-club like free radicals   
For hiking there is a yahoo group you can join     HikeSwitzerland@yahoogroups.com   "	Posts: 12	Join Date: May 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			I've been doing all kinds of Internet searches looking for chartering a sailboat in the 15 meter +/- size anywhere near Geneve for a day sail. Seems like there are lots of motorboats for rent, lots of small sailing dinghies, etc., but I can't find any sailboat larger than about 11 meters. Any ideas out there?

3232	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	MTB groups in Upper Valais region	Feronia	1,148	3	Location: Visp	13.08.2011, 12:37	"    The vast majority of the trails there are in the moderate range.  In  order to find the hardcore trails you have to know where to go.  Just  avoid Jeizenen.  There are a few really good enduro/ A.M trails right  above Visp.  The most convenient would be to take a bus from Visp B.H to  Bürchen and ride back down to Visp.  If you go a bit further up and  then head west (down valley) you will find some of the best trails in  Wallis.  This is where a lot of local guides take thier clients.  (are  you listening Erie, here would be a great place to check out if you haven`t  already )  There are also a couple of really sweet DH trails from there but you wont find them and I swore not to tell.  (top secret)    
Here is also another trail worth checking out.    "	Posts: 47	Join Date: Aug 2011	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present
3233	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	How to speed up recovery after exercise?	m_dalloway	3,215	43	Location: Tokyo	22.08.2011, 19:52	"    Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory agent.   
When you do a lot of exercise for the first time in a long time you will generally: 
1) have tissue damage from over use (this is generally a good thing - put very simply it's how the body builds new muscles) 
2) have damage from lack of oxygen (because your cardiovascular system is not used to heightened need for oxygen in this new/unusual exercise state) 
3) have damage from lactic acid build up (a by-product of exercise and burning all that sugar and point 2) 
4) and for riding a bike, you'll have a sore but, but that's another issue    
Leaving aside point 4, points 1-3 all result in damage, which is usually characterised by calor (warmth), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling) and rubor (redness) - the ""cardinal"" signs of inflammation, and initially identified by some chap called  .   
Ergo, ibuprofen, and anti-inflammatory agent works wonders.    
History and physiology lessons aside, I've a hunch that that the OP might be wanting to fit without the ""quick fix"" use of drugs.

3238	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Fly fishing around Zurich	2x2	3,481	10	Location: ZH	17.04.2011, 11:00	" 
			
			Graubunden is a pretty good place to fish, you can get a cantonal patent which allows you to fish most everywhere, unlike most of the other cantons where sections of water are managed by individuals/groups, and you have to get a day/year license from them, assuming some are available. Rivers are off limits for three fixed days a week, I can't remember which ones offhand though.   
Personally I'm a member of some local fishing clubs which give me access to sections of rivers in Zürich, and I fish high alpine lakes as well. Fly fishing the bigger lakes that have Freiangelrecht is an exercise in futility and frustration. (float tubing, on the other hand, works great on the bigger lakes, but finding out which lakes allow them and which don't is another matter.)

The first game will be played at home Zug, but the second match will be away at Basel. This will not be till next year as the swiss rugby season is has a 'winter break' due to the snow.   
I will keep you posted regarding the match date, at the moment on   we only have the first half of the seasons fixtures up.

			This is exactly as simple as pumping up a tyre although you will need a high pressure shock pump. You will find pressure guides for your hardware on the internet but the best way is to adjust the pressure to achieve the recommended sag for your fork or shock (probably 25% of maximum travel) Search youtube for fork sag for instructional videos.   
If your shock is losing pressure at a fast rate then you will need a service with seal exchange.    
Cheers

			Hello, 
Grammont (at least everywhere it's written like that) is peak above Taney, quite easily accessible from Taney, time estimation would be around 2-3 hours. Beautiful views on Lac side, and little bit also towards Valais and Mont Blanc range.  
Just follow the road after Taney, rocky road continues quite high through small pass and after that it is a pleasant walk in grass pathway. No possibility to get lost.

Most schools make little money out of the training but make their margins on the sale of new equipment so it's in their interests to convince you to buy (from them) rather than rent.

			Hi OP   
Agree with most of the posts already in this thread.  A couple more thoughts:   
* Swimming in a wetsuit is different than without one.  If you do go down that path, try to get some practice in beforehand.  I find that I need to ""roll"" more in order to stroke properly.  If you are really worried about the cold, you *could* swim in a surf wetsuit (I saw someone do that at the Zuri short distance tri) but it would be a last resort    Definitely take some time to swim in the lake immediately before the race.  It'll help to warm up the muscles and hopefully settle the nerves.   
* If you can't get a race belt, then make sure you at least have some elastic for the race number (like the stuff from a sewing shop).  Sometimes they give it out for free at the race but not always, so best to be prepared.  Tie the elastic to the pre-punched holes in the number.  When you're in transition, just step into the elastic and pull it up over your hips.  So much easier than messing around with safety pins!   
* A proper tri outfit is totally worth the money, and it'll make you feel fantastic and somewhat professional    Wiggle.co.uk is a great place to get your tri gear at decent prices (already mentioned by someone else).  I got a 2xu two piece from there and am very happy with it.   
* If you are at all ""endowed"" then even if a tri top with a shelf bra won't be enough during the run.  Get yourself a simple sports bra  .  Try swimming in it, and running in it, beforehand so you know if it has the support you need.   
* Wear socks for the run if you've never tried your shoes without socks before.  It won't be any fun if you get to the end and your feet are all torn up (speaking from experience here).   
* If you get the chance beforehand, do a BRICK training session one week before.  That's a bike training, followed by a short run.  This'll get you used to how alien your legs will feel when you get off the bike and try to run!   
* Have stacks of fun!  Triathlon is addictive, I hope you really enjoy it   "	Posts: 19	Join Date: Jun 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 4 Times in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

Sometimes for these activities I need to make the initial arrangements and contacts on behalf of my clients, but once the kids start the activity, things seem to go very smoothly.    
Good luck.

			Trip update:   
It was just a brilliant outing, weather was superb, too many boulders to choose from (ok, there really was something in my range too  ). I won't describe it as very hard-core trip, we were mostly just enjoying without worrying about grades etc. A great start for what was the first ever (to the best of my knowledge) English forum climbing event that was offered for everyone. Thanks Snowflaker for starting, and geinitz for coming along and making it more fun.   
Others: You can turn on the speakers watch the  * and feel jealous, or join us next time and feature in the video and feel smug      *Sorry, as of now this has to be downloaded and viewed using real player; I will upload it on internet later, when I figure out how to.

			Near Kreuzplatz there's       
Looks pretty exclusive, I doubt they'd let me in there to find out the price    
No swimming pools that I know of - try City, Holmes Place, or I think there's another thread on here somewhere about gyms in Zurich.

			Not doing the Xterra, maybe I'll give it a try some time when I have the funds for a bike, wetsuit and all the goodies  
I did my first triathlon in Nyon on Sunday (without wetsuit and on a really old road bike). 
I trained for swimming at Nyon Colovray, there is a pool and the lake is great to train in with lifesavers from 1pm. La Plage in Nyon is also very nice if you don't want to pay for entrance. 
That's all the advice I can give. Will definetly be a spectator on 10 September in Prangins. Good luck with training and ENJOY!

In addition, I am thinking of spending a week in the francophone Jura.

Oh and if you're teaching the LesMills Bodypump then the next quarterly training is 10-11 September in Zurich.

3289	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Child bike seat recommendations please	lucia2	2,229	12	Location: Bern	25.03.2010, 12:36	"    I read something similar, did you see it in the   magazine - a great publication on practical cycling and types of bikes that get ignored by the mainstream bike press. I think they'd be very interested in a write-up about your frankenbike version of an xtracycle. I'd also love a cargo bike or to convert my commuter using the xtracycle kit, but I just haven't been able to justify it to myself let alone my wife yet.   
As for problems with loading a child of that size into a regular kid's bike seat then you can get super heavy-duty kick stands with two legs that could support the whole weight of the bike and child, giving you two hands with which to do the task instead of having to hold onto the bike with one.

			Wow....talk about someone up there not wanting me to go gymming.    
After my failed visit to the Puls5 Fitness Park last Tuesday, I decided to go to the on in Stockerhof to give myself a kick start. After registering myself (in German.... ), I spent an hour working out before heading back to the changing rooms for a shower. HOWEVER, the magic electrical locker device would not open my door. After several efforts by the staff to open the lock (""this is the first time this has ever happened...!""), the technician was called and arrived at 22.15 (1.5hrs after I'd finished at the gym!) and took about a second to drill into the locker and release all my worldy goods.   
To make matters worse, I then got on a tram going in the wrong direction, before switching to one going in the right direction which then broke down.   
Off to a flying start    
On the plus side...I got to practice lots of German yesterday   "	Posts: 148	Join Date: Feb 2011	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 116 Times in 76 Posts	earned the respect of many

			I took a quick look. Didn't follow her workout, was curious about her food. It's a decent program, but she's cutting some things out that she could really use. She says lean protein, but she's leaving out grassfed beef and bison and other game. It can actually be leaner than chicken/turkey and provides different nutrients not available in poultry. Plus, she's only eating egg whites? The yolks are SO good for you! My holistic trainer and chiropracter eat lots of eggs everyday and are really healthy. I'm on a new program now and am losing at a nice, safe pace while eating 4-8 whole eggs each day.

Those board were actually what got me into skateboarding because I wanted something similar to snowboarding for the summertime. They have much softer and bigger wheels than traditional boards so are faster and effortless to use and the boards have a flex in them which gives a really cool ride.  
I could never skate normal boards, can now a bit, and was immediately able to pick this board up and ride.

			My wife did it, lost some weight and didn't put it back on, and the diet is fairly easy to live with for 1 person. We know a couple who fell for it, and had different things they could and couldn't eat so it made their meals a right PITA. The service is crap at the gym in Zug to, she had all the gushy we'll do this, revue that, monitor the next BEFORE she signed up... and they only kept the initial meeting, which the dame was late for as she was outside having a fag and had forgotten. I can't remember the price but it was over CHF 800 iirc for effectively a blood test, a diet sheet and lots of wasted time going to appointments they made and never showed for.    
You could enrol with WW online and get the same results (actually friends did and had better results than my wife) and have a well subsidised weekend in Milan for CHF800.

3322	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	On the use of hiking sticks in the mountains	guest	3,120	29	null	null	"    The problem isn't the experienced people who generally know how much water they need for themselves. It's the people who don't go into the mountains that much and are not acclimated. Tell them they only need a litre and they will be getting uncomfortable quite quickly on a hot day or above about 2200m. Many people do not realise the effect altitude has on their bodies until they experience it themselves and it is better to err on the side of caution and have a little too much water than too little. Especially if a trip can end up taking longer than expected. Realistically we're not really talking about life or death, but I've heard of a number of cases where poorly prepared people have gone into the back country and ended up calling in helicopters purely because they were under prepared.    
On my trip last Saturday I took two litres with me and pulled the last sip out of my drink pack with about 30mins to the end of the day. Most other people in the group I was leading did the same. We did have the option of getting top ups along the way if necessary, but even in Switzerland there are a few areas where top ups are not always possible.    
My questioning the OP was not for experienced people as they should know their own bodies and skills better than any consensus statement can account for, but the thousands of less experienced people who go into the mountains regularly. For these people saying 1L of water is enough and leave the poles at home may not be the best advice. That is the point I'm trying to get across. People who are regularly in the mountains will know what works for them and what doesn't.    
As someone pointed out the best thing is to be well prepared.

So wondering  
1) Are there people on here that fancy diong some more of this? 
2) Are there groups already out there that do this?

3330	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Hahnenmoospass?	MattL	948	2	Location: Bern	01.07.2011, 10:12	" 
			
			I've ridden the Hahnenmoospass once, going from Lenk to Adelboden. On the Lenk side, it is paved until around 1600m, and then is unpaved for the last few kms. I was on my cyclocross bike with tires that were about 32mm wide and had a light tread - that was ideal for the surface. The unpaved section is extremely steep, averaging 15% for long stretches, so it would be hard to keep enough traction with regular road tires on those parts, although some of it would certainly be rideable. You also need seriously low gears - I was only just able to keep my 24x28 gear turning (with 700c tires, so a 23 inch gear). As far as I remember, it was paved all the way from the top down to Adelboden.   
Another great little pass in the same region goes from Zweisimmen to the northeast to Zwischenflueh, in the valley that joins the Simmental at Oey. I believe that one was paved the whole way, I certainly did it with my regular road bike without any trouble.

			We are planning a week-long hike in the Enagadine region and, for one segment, were hoping to hike from Lavin, up to the Macun Lakes and making our way down to Zernez on the other side.   
It seems that the hike would be much more difficult on the way up from Zernez, which is why we have chosen to approach it from the other direction. However, we are still a bit concerned about the descent, as many have commented on the steepness and scrambling.   
Can anyone comment on this? Is it safest to return back down to Lavin or would you recommend taking it on?   
We are not very experienced hikers, although we are relatively fit and adventuresome.

			I hiked up to the Lac Blanc via the Lacs des Chéserys from Col des Montets when I did the Tour du Mont Blanc - not sure if this is exactly the same path as you would be taking from Vallorcine, but it might be.   
The initial climb is steepish but regular, just adopt a steady rhythm that suits you and you will be fine. The Lacs des Chéserys are stunningly beautiful. Between the Lacs des Chéserys and the lac Blanc, you have to climb a couple of ladders - these are not completely vertical and are about 4 or 5 metres high if I remember rightly.  The Lac Blanc itself is very touristy - hordes of people walk up from La Flégère which does rather spoil the site. If you are planning to stay there overnight, I would imagine it is lovely once the crowds have gone.     
The whole of this itinerary is in very barren, rocky terrain - no forest at all, and little or no shade. We set out very early (6 am from Tré-le-Champ) specifically for this reason, to avoid suffering from the heat.   
I have not done the other legs of your tour so can't comment on those at all, sorry.      Have a look at the Tour des Muverans in Valais - beautiful from one end to the other, and in less frequented country than the Aiguilles Rouges:   
Day 1: Ovronnaz to Cabane Rambert 
Day 2: Cabane Rambert to Derborence 
Day 3: Derborence to Alpage de la Vare 
Day 4: Alpage de la Vare to Cabane de la Tourche 
Day 5: Cabane de la Tourche to Ovronnaz   
I posted a description of this tour (in French) here:   if you're interested.

			Hello everybody!    
I have belonged to this forum for about a year now, (I think) and it's been very useful. I've met quite a lot of my friends through this site and am on it almost all day, everyday!    
I am a runner living in Thun and wondered if there were any other runners in the Thun area. I know there are plenty in Bern, but I don't want to get on a train for twenty minutes when I could just step outside my door and go for a jog. Running alone does get tiresome though.  
If there any runners in Thun who would like a running buddy, please respond to this thread or PM me; I'd love to hear from you!    
Thanks!

If someone wants to post the German details, the notice was on page 6 of the latest Migros paper.

			Hi, 
Searching for swimming lessons in Zurich - weekends only. Both Sat and Sun would be fine. Prefer to start now !! Or after 02 Aug 2011.   
I have a job that requires me to travel during the weekdays. No fixed schedule of travel, but essentially it means that I can't stick to any course on the weekdays.   
I have a 1 year Sport Abo in Zurich, so access to the Hallenbads is not a problem.   
Would like to start with front crawl and then move to other strokes. I have learnt a few techniques some 25 yrs ago. However, would like to start as a complete beginner. Objective is to get into some shape and improve fitness levels (currently ZERO now).   
Cheers, 
A

ElggDK	1,165	5	Location: Ottawa - Canada	17.06.2011, 11:06	"    one might be a bit more technical than you want but it is an absolutely   day out. It is a lot more physically demanding than 800m of climbing suggests.   
It can be made technically easier and physically more demanding by Starting in Melchsee-Frutt instead of Engelberg and riding up to Balmeggerhorn. Then you can descend the road on the last section instead of single track. I can easily send you a map marking the sections to look out for and how to do it the less technical way... Or send you a GPX for the route as it is described. It is technical though I've taken groups on the route twice and both times a couple of people opted for the road option on the last descent.    
I'll be guiding that route (technical version) on the weekend after (July 16th) and everyone* is welcome to join free of charge. It's a great day out in the mountains with a good bunch of people.      *Everyone who is happy to accept that it is a technical tour and there is an element of risk involved in riding technical high alpine routes. We move at the pace of the slowest rider and don't mind if people walk sections instead of riding them if they are unsure.

I have started Running also for the reason to improve my lung capacity and get fitter. Before, I wasn't sure to be able to run more than 20 min without wheezing. When Mountainbiking, I'm usually not affected. Have you checked what the allergen is in your case? Or is it only related to 'Anstrengung'/Excercise-Induced? I think its important that an allergologist will help you find out what form of asthma it exactly is. Then he can prescribe treatment if necessary. My asthma is not alone excercice-induced. What helps immediately is to reduce the excercise - stop for a while and regulate the pulse and lung function by inhaling/exhaling. If this problem is serious, move med - swiss sports medical center at Klinik Hirslanden can advise you in detail about further prevention.

3402	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	MTB routes in Swiss Romande [FR]	Eire	-	-	Location: Tir na nÓg	26.10.2007, 16:49	"   Davos Dorg Train station    XC (July - October)    4 29Km may not sound much but 1400hm is...    4 (some tricky rock sections and switchbacks on descent, some tricky climbing).   
Start out from Davos dorf by heading into town, round the one way sytem and turning left at the EGG bar into Dischmastrasse. Folow this to the start of the valley where you go past the Lumber yard, then turn left to In den Bulen. the trail is now sign posted.   
After the climb (av 12%), the trail darts through to the Fluela valley by a short section of single track, leading to a fireroad. Then the trail heads up parallel with the river all the way to the Geust House at Tschuggen, good climb (ave 8%) but not technical.   
Now begins the real ascent. At Tschuggen the trail leads through the guest houes garden past the little church. It is pretty hard going (ave 12%) with rocks and switchbacks to contend with until it hits a wider path around 2200hm   
Once past the Pischa Berg station you follow nice rolling (and rocky) single track to the Horli where the trail cross the ridge and starts descending. At the top before the descent is a nice bench if like me you want to put some pads on and have lunch.   
The descent is I think tricky with loose rocks, loose dirt and switchbacks, no jumping required though. Half way down you will be treaded to the most fabulous view of Davos the Parsenn and Klosters and a 180 degree panoramma. The best view of this area I've seen.   
After the view point the trail got harder for me as it was quite overgrown and became a foot wide and about 1/2 foot sunken, made some corners hard. also hit my head on a few branches. Became quite hard to see more than a couple of meters of the actual trail.   
The end of the trail was a nice fast run through some easy single track before coming onto a farmers 4x4 road, across the railwayline, round the lake and back to Davos Dorf.     
This trail was about as much as I could handle, in fact slightly more, I could do maybe 75% of the climb and 80% of the downhill. I consider my self an XC rider of average ablity and fitness.    
However I'm very glad I did it, it's 80% singletrail and I only saw 5 people during the entire ride. Plus the view of Davos - wow!   
I also had an endo near the end due to a rather large hole / rock combo that I just didn't see - wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't been slowing down to give way to two hikers, who, by the way, didn't stop or ask if I was ok as I lay sprawled across the track - they just stepped round me.....

			Hi there,    
I'm new to the forum and having been living in Grindelwald since December, now the summer is well on it way I'm looking out for people to go paddling with around the area.  Back home in the UK, I paddled lots on the sea and in the surf and a little on white water and am now looking to get out more on the local rivers.   
Anyone up for doing some white water trips or just a paddle on Brienz or Thunersee please get in touch,  
Look forward to hearing from you, 
Cheers,

			I go to a pilates class in Oerlikon taught by Catherine Wiget and her prices are quite a bit lower than that, currently chf 35 for single lesson, max 6 people. She is also one of the best pilates instructors I've come across, in part due to the small groups (prices in London much lower but twice as many people) and speaks excellent English. She gives the instructions in English and German which is nice for my language learning!

3408	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Sore knee from single leg squats	grimmus	2,570	13	Location: e	08.06.2011, 16:19	" 
			
			Also form could be lacking while performing the exercise. similar to running technique you should form a near straight line from the trailing ankle joint, which is in flexion (as it is pushing you off the ground to propell you forwards), up thru your knee, hip and  shoulder. This approxamate position means the all the major joints in the action so all the muscles can work to there max before going back into the recovery phase of leg motion.  
You maybe unconciously using this same form while performing the exercise. from a biomechanical point of view, this means that with this slight lean forward your shoulder joint (observing from side on) would be over the knee of the lead leg as if goes forward and plants into the gound. as there now is exta load being placed on the leg this would mean that the majority of the load is spread over the knee (not so much a prob in running because it is only body weight and the mechanics of forward movement). If you feell more upright performing the exercise it will force the knee to stabilize and pülace extra emphasis on the Quad muscle and glutes, major muscles in running. Also as i mentioned before this forward lean can be attributed to lack of core strenght. Good form avoids injury, hits all the right muscle, hard, and protects and uses all the joints efficiently. Hope this paints a good picture for you and may lead to some answers. 
PM me to chat further, i like talking fitness and the body in sport with people   
Good luck!!!!

			A friend of mine is interested in doing some of the Jura high route (the part close to Basel). I have several maps but I remember years ago having a small guidebook in English specifically for this route - it was a kind of pocket size book with very clear descriptions in it. Brilliantly simple and small guidebook to carry round. Of course now I can't find it (probably I have loaned it... doh!)   
So, does anyone actually have a copy of such a guidebook that they'd like to sell/give away - or just info on where you got it? I'm pretty sure that I got mine (about 10 years ago!) in what was then Jaggi bookshop (now Thalia) but they don't seem to have it now.   
There's plenty of guides in German I know, but my friend would like one in English. Search on Amazon only pulled up one guidebook which seems to be also for ski trekking and that's not it (and it's not currently available).

			Re test-driving for size and geometry: this definitely makes sense.   
For example, each 56cm bike will feel different depending on the brand and the set-up.   
One option is to test-drive in Swiss shops and then buy on-line from abroad (without getting into the fairness of that).   
My preferred choice is to holiday in the US and bring a bike back with me. That way, you can test drive many bikes and you can use it for the holiday too. It costs CHF200 to take the bike back with you on Swiss International Airlines, plus you need to get it boxed up for flying. Was very easy.   
A friend of mine buys CHF 8000 bikes on-line from a small shop in Ireland.

I have been down twice to do it. First time it snowed about a foot in early September, and it looked very white, and rather impossible. 
Second time we did the Gemelli to the summit (a very beautiful route, particularly the flatiron section) and descended into Italy. When we walked back  the weather got rather unreliable with quite a few thunderstorms each afternoon. Not ideal, so we took the cautious option and headed back north to Zurich   
Sounds like the Via del Veterano was very good condition training.

ihihihihihihi   It was very very difficult I must say. My boyfriend tried to do what his father did to him: hold the bike from the back to help keep my balance. It might be ok with a 5 year old kid, but it's not an easy thing to do with a 55kg woman on a bike   In the end he just sat next to 3 old Finnish men on the bench and the 4 of them were cheering me up while I fell    
In the end I managed to learn how to balance by not using the ""normal"" way of getting on a bike (foot on pedal and moving one leg over the seat) because I find it too difficult to do if you have still balance problems. Only way for me to get on a bike is with both feet on the floor and lifting body.   
Then comes the stiring problem, but my arm scars are proof that I still need a lot longer to master that    
My husband tells me that when I am ridding a bike I look like a little witch on a broom stick. Wild hair flowing, speeding like a little child, and screaming ""hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii"" down-hill   "	null	null	null	null	null	null

They have childcare, but I have no idea what it costs. Why not call them and ask? Most of the staff seem to speak reasonable English.

3460	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Advise what bike to buy in Switzerland	Jose1984	811	2	Location: Zürich	13.05.2011, 13:52	" 
			
			Where did you ride when you used to have a 140mm bike, what kind of riding do you generally do, and was the bike a hard tail or a full suspension? What is your preference of going up vs. going down?   
For riding most places outside of the mountains and even a lot of trails in the mountains, 100mm will work just fine especially if your preference for climbing or flat terrain is larger than your preference for descending. If you want to get maximum enjoyment out of the down hill parts while still being able to climb, I would recommend somewhere around 140mm. If you really like going down and tend to avoid climbing you'll have more fun on something at least 160mm.

			If you're looking for something local, try the Einsiedeln area -- lots of hikes with good elevation gains but no technical skill required.    
Also Glarus has some great hikes that are remote, but only an hour train ride away from Zurich....one of my favorites is the Foopass:    
One last suggestion would be to head to Appenzell/Toggenburg. The Santis in Appenzell tends to be pretty filled, but if you go Toggenburg and the Churfirsten, they are excellent and offer great views:     "	Posts: 7	Join Date: May 2011	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			Here's an easy one to follow. Start at the Zurich main station. Cross the street to the Landesmuseum (that building that looks like a castle). The hike starts in the park behind the museum (Spitzplatz park). Go to the end of the park, cross the bridge (the bridge on the right), then simply follow the Limmat River. There is a well marked path. You will quickly come across one of Zurich's most popular bathing areas on the river, nice place to have a beer and people watch (and swim). About 5km further down you will end up at a very pleasant island in the river, ""Werdinsel"" with great place to take a dip and a nice outdoor restaurant and lawn. You can either turn around and come back to Zurich, or continue another 5km to ""Klosterfahr"", an 800 year old monastary (nunnary actually) with nice outdoor restaurant, and places to hang out along the river. Very peaceful place, and they have wine tasting in their cellars on Saturday. After that, continue another kilometer or so down the river, and you will run into Glanzenberg train station: catch the next train back to Zurich, and you will be back at the main station in a few minutes. Tried and tested route, though I prefer do it on a mountain bike.

			You need to read the small print on the contract you signed. The industry is well known for automatically renewing contract periods.    
I crossed out this clause on the contract, manager said I couldn't do that, I walked away, 30 minutes later call from gym, ""We have reconsidered"".    
During the 12 months contract I developed feet problems (Arthritis) and asked if I could transfer active contract to my son. Answer was: only with a doctor's certificate.    
Definitely always cancel a contract one week before the latest cancelling date  . Better still don't agree to restrictions.    
Good luck, I think you will need it.    
Don't take any notice of the debt collectors. But if you get a Betreibung, Persuite, you must apeal within 10 days!

			I went there last week to redeem a coupon for a free trip after running the Zürich Marathon.  I went on a Friday night and it was pretty jam-packed, albeit with others like me who were taking advantage of the offer.   
I would imagine it gets less crowded on a weeknight, but can't say for sure.   
IMO it is too expensive for what you get *if* it's crowded, but you really cannot beat the views from the roof bath, if you have a clear day.  Go at sunset and watch the pink hue change on the Appenzeller Alps, it's really stunning.

3486	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Calling all Bern-area cyclists!	erin	651	0	Location: Bern	01.05.2011, 22:08	" 
			
			I just moved to Bern from Zürich, which seems to have the lion's share of cyclists. I'm not much of a group cyclist, but I'd love to meet some people who are game for spontaneous evening and weekend rides.    
About me: I'd prefer to describe myself as a cycle tourist (my touring bike being my all-time favorite), but a more local definition would be ""road cyclist"" and ""pass fanatic"". I am moderately fast on a road bike, but have no particular interest in speed...enjoying the scenery is more my priority. However, I'd be happy to train occasionally with more speed-oriented cyclists...triathletes? Giga-athletes?    
Weekends find me either climbing passes or making 100+ km jaunts from one point to another. I'd love to find another pass junkie to ride with, so if ""Klausen"", ""Stelvio"", or ""Albula"" are words that excite you, PM me!   
I do mountain bike, but I am very much a beginner. Any other road to mtb ladies out there, let me know. I'd be thrilled to ride with someone else who finds steep gravel roads terrifying. :-)   
Cheers, 
Erin

			Thanks everyone for your suggestions, I might end up doing several of them!   
In particular, it seems that you can get from Zurich to Weesen in 52 mins (42chf return, or 22chf with half price card):      This looks excellent, I think I'd love to do this! Roughly how many hours do you think? 12+? That just looks brilliant, I just need to find another person/people to do it with - it's a little too far alone! I'm thinking probably having to stay overnight in weesen or something, unless doing it the hardcore day/nighttrip way overtakes me! I'd be interested to know the suggested route - by the lake most of the way?   
Thanks very much people, this is great, I'm loving the idea of this mile high challenge!

			Hello all,    
Is anyone an Aktiv Fitness Member? I just joined in Dietikon, maybe it would be fun to work out together? The woman there spoke English to me in my trial day workout. Also, if anyone is looking to join and you give a referral those joined will get $50 chf back, so you can use my name for a referral  I think it is a very good price considering it is open 365 days a year and you can go to any center. Anyone have any comments on this center? I would like to hear. Maybe I'll see you there?

			This has been asked before, when I used the EF/Google search:   
- some of the following links with their contained links may or may not be helpful:           
Failing that, find a flat, gently sloping area, put on your skates and   safety protection gear - even tie a cushion to your butt, and get out there and give it a go. If you've ever skied or ice skated, it isn't so hard. 
I taught myself to ski, with a similar method, on a gentle slope - it's just a case of getting the feeling and the confidence.

3499	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Hiking-Trekking agency/contact for weekend	Nacho	1,406	7	Location: basel	24.04.2011, 09:00	"    No problem. The main reason I plug the link is that folk don't realise it is there. The various sites which are linked within it contain so much information for people new to hiking, or simply new to hiking here that it is an advantage to look through some of it BEFORE one really needs it. Even the marking of the paths here is 'new' to newcomers.    
The GPS Thread, in the same sticky, has around fifty hikes that I've done with Mr L. Nothing very wild in distance or altitude gain, but pleasant day or half-day hikes with pretty well all the information one needs. Public transport if possible, parking places and restaurants are often mentioned, the terrain and the map and pictures are included so that one can see what lies ahead.

similar path, I just recommend to use the underpass as that avoids dealing with the tricky bit in front of Co-op to Central and all those damn stoplights Then take a left there across a less busy bridge, still tricky but not as tricky as the Central route and then a right along the Limmat tramlines.  Plus I recommend the sidewalk underpath, a bit of a tricky turn so take too fast and watch for the a pedestrian., especially Dougal

Depends on your budget and where you live. I'm in Basel, I recommend to most people to hit a bike shop in Lorrach or, if they really don't want to spend much but still want new, Marktkauf (Rhein Center) - otherwise buy second hand here in Switzerland.

			Zurich has ""Schulsport"". This classes run for one semester (or more) and training is once a week. You pay nothing or else very little. I did a lot of those when I was little (Judo, swimming, athletics, rowing etc.). I loved it! They are usually run by the ""Verein"" and their instructors and you can afterwards switch to that ""Verein"" if you have found something that you want to practise more than once a week. You are actually just in time for the registration for the summer (deadline for registration is 21 of March)!    
The classes can be found in the attached pdf   and registration has to be done with this pdf    
Regarding horse riding there is a class (Feriensportkurs) that lasts one week (every day) for beginners where they also learn how to handle horses, clean them etc. It's in the pdf for Ferienkurse    
and you should be looking at   Reiten Reit11 26.29.4.2011 15.0016.30 Fr. 210. Reitschule Kolbenhof/Uto 9503 A

A normal sort of Intro would be nice if you can find time to do one. Weather is great for outdoor sports at the moment so I wouldn't be surprised if it took you a while to get around to it. Rain forecast for three weeks next Tuesday. Maybe you could do it then.

			Have a look at   and click on ""Cycling in Switzerland"" to see the national, regional and local trails.  I don't think you can download GPS tracks but you can print out very nice pdf maps from there.   
You could also see   and select Cycling or Mountainbiking to show just those kinds of tracks, zoom in, select one and download a gpx file.  I don't think they've got the whole national trails on there though.   
Lastly you can look at the relations in openstreetmap:   which seem quite impressively complete but I'm not entirely sure how you go from there to a gpx file.  It might be fairly easy though, and might be your best bet.

			Anyone want to go climbing outside this weekend? It will be my first time outside this year, probably be doing 5's and easy 6's. But don't mind holding ropes on easier/harder stuff.  I'm based in Zurich but we can meet out near the crag.   
I was thinking of going to one or two of these places in ""Plaisir Ost""   
28 Pilatus 
29 Rivelli / Telli 
36 Sunneplattli 
37 Rigi-Hochflue 
38 Chamiloch   
Any info on these venues gratefully accepted, or alternative venue suggestions. I don't have a car so am looking to travel on trains/buses.   
Cheers   
-John

			Hi Guys,   
I was wondering if anyone knows of a good strength and conditionig gym in Basel as I will be relocating soon. I am looking for large range of kettle bells, good selection of weight plates and power racks, heavy dumbells and prowler.   
Something in the lines of my current gym in Dublin would be immense, see link below:    
Thanks

			Hi Guys.   
I'm moving to Zurich at the end of March and I'm looking for an athletics club to train with and compete for. I found a few Suisse websites, but I don't speak a lot of German and I'm finding it hard to figure out how the athletics community works in Switzerland.   
I've noticed that a lot of the Posts on the Forum centre around ultra distance running. I mainly race 800m up to 5000m on the track in summer, and cross country and road races in the winter (anything up to half marathon). I'm currently training about 110kms a week (gearing up for the Melbourne winter).   
There were a lot of tears when I had to tell my coach I was levaing Melboure, and whilst I'm far from being a ""superstar"" I really love my running and I'm desperate to make sure I can keep going.    
Can anyone point me in the direction of a club or coach that might be able to help me out?? Any other general advice on running in Zurich also welcomed gratefully!

			for custom fittings you could go to an ski shop like for example the one in front of the Einsiedeln train station. ( don't remember the name )   
I made my SIDAS/Conformable insoles there.   
You can also use the Specialized insoles that come with some shims for the canting   
Now I have orthotics custom made ( while I was in Peru ) and I can tell you that make a big difference   
Custom Orthotics > Conformable insoles > Specialized insoles.   
Sports orthotics can be quite expensive here though.

			Skied the Portes du Soleil last week from les Crozets to Avoriaz/Chatel - a very mixed week, with very wet and heavy Spring snow - diablolical at the end of the day. Fresh but very heavy 'powder' on Wednesday- which got soft and wet later in the day- very hard work. Went to Verbier yesterday, and headed right for the top at Col des Gentiannes- great, but very changing conditions from slope to slope depending on orientation- from very hard to wet and spongy. Still a great last day for the season. Made even better by watching a pair of Golden Eagles compete for the best soar with some parapenters. Ski season over for me, with a big smile- despite a very gammy knee I enjoyed every minute on the slopes even now I'm an OAP!

			It sounds as if you already have some experience and are prepared.  Even in summer you can get into snow or bad weather, particularly as you increase altitude.  I have only been in the area from late Spring to early Autumn.   
From Grindelwald you can experience a massive variety in the weather with around 3000m variation between Interlaken and Jungfraujoch.

			[QUOTE=grumpygrapefruit;1156377]  on the Flumserkleinberg between Flums and Mels is a stunning location. You can actually walk around the whole lake in less than an hour but has lots of little bays and inlets.   
I went fishing there 2 years ago (but didn't catch anything, but that's not the point). You can get a day permit from the Fish shop in Flums (strange opening hours though) or from the Tourist office in Bad Ragaz and maybe in Mels.   
Thanks Grumpygrapefruit. 
I have just phoned the tourist office at Bad Ragaz to enquire about a permit for Chapfensee and she said the lake is not open for the fishing season until May. She said i could get a permit for Giessenpark for tomorrow, but i can only get the permit from her office today before 4pm. I won't get there in time now, so will have to put off my fishing trip for another day! Ho hum

			Sorry, 
I can't help with links to St-Paul en Chablais. We need some of the members from Evian to chip in.   
I live about 30 mins from St-Gingolph and know the area well but I always drive along the French side of the lake to Evian and Thonon. Even the road sucks.   
They've been talking about improving the transport between Switzerland and Evian for years but nobody seems to want to pay for it. So the SBB trains stop at St. Gingolph and SNCF stop at Evian. Problem is, there's not much on the French side between St. G and Evian except for a few hamlets so it's probably not worth the cost of running regular public transport.    
As you drive along the road, you follow a disused railway line so at one time St-G had a link to Evian. Maybe links were cut during the war, I don't know. St-Gingolph was a centre of resistance against the occupation and the French side of the  town was burnt to the ground as a reprisal by the SS. 
The intervention of the Swiss army brigadier Julius Schwarz was pretty heroic:    "	Posts: 899	Join Date: Mar 2011	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 43 Times in 28 Posts	Thanked 796 Times in 347 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

Uncle GroOve	2,752	28	Location: Mendrisio	21.03.2011, 19:10	"    I'd need to look at the map again to confirm which route I was planning on Monte Bar. Its essentially a long mostly paved climb up to just below the summit, then skirt around the summit to a saddle to the east. From there follow the ridgeline singletrack the whole way around the valley until you end up dropping down not too far from where you started. I can't remember the exact place names wiithout the map in front of me.    
The Trans-Provence is not to be compared with a normal ""Trans"" Event. It is very tiring but you are not racing the whole event. It pays off to ride the climbs as slow as you can and save energy to enjoy the timed sections which are all single track. There are a lot of hike a bike sections and you do need to be fit, but the fitness you require is more to be able to handle 7 long days in a row rather than to be able to race all day for 7 days in a row. You are not timed on the Liason stages at all. Once you get to a timed section you can take a break, chill out, get your energy back and then race the timed section which is predominately descending (some short climbs in the middle). There is no reason to push yourself to the level where it may be dangerous if you are prepared well enough to be able to handle the distance/altitude gain. The event is about riding a lot of really good single track, not about spending 7 days riding fire roads from one side of the Alps to the other. To put it into context the Pro's that are entered in the event for more from the world of Enduro/Freeride rather than XC or Marathon.    
You wouldn't get me doing a normal ""Trans"" event to save my soul, I'm going back for more with the T-P.    "	Posts: 1,069	Join Date: Feb 2008	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 7 Times in 5 Posts	Thanked 720 Times in 376 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

And when weather isn't permitting, well then it doesn't really permit for table tennis either.   
Send me a message if you're ever keen to play on a weekday, as I can almost guarantee a game.      Well, if you were, I'd probably have to make a trip to Zurich just to watch!

			the 661 D30 stuff is the way to go!  light weight, non bulky and it works.   
i originally had the kyle straits knee pads, but my knees were basically rubbing together when pedalling they were so bulky!  especially when riding stuff like mega avalanche with plenty of sit down pedalling.   
definitely a worthy upgrade to the D30's...

			Annecy is fine. There is a sailing school and a big camp site at Saint Jorioz. about 10k from Annecy on the right hand side of the lake. Also right at the edge of town, on the same road there is the excellent municipal camp site & loads of sailing boats. I suppose there's a school there too (Les Marquisats).

			Yep, that's the issue.    
In fact, I've now realized that there is more than just the page that a friend gave a link to - there are about 8 pages on Switzerland, starting on page 98. They also have an interview with Alain Rumpf, who works at the UCI, and I've met him through other EnglishForum friends. He describes one of his favorite rides as going over the Col du Sanetsch, and I have to agree with him. You start in the vineyards of Valais (Wallis) and end up almost 2,000 meters higher next to glaciers and can then take a cable car (with your bike) down the other side into canton Bern. Because it's a dead-end road for cars, it's almost completely empty and extremely peaceful.

			Posting a link may well have made sense to those who knows nothing about it, however, I'm looking for someone who does!   
As for CMD itself, it's not as ridiculous as it may appear. As part of my terms of employment in Australia, I had to train in CMD for the duration of my employment. I have an extensive background in martial arts, having trained in Ju-Jitsu for 16 years, as well as Kobudo, Kickboxing, Krav Maga & CQC whilst in the military, so I'd like to think I know a good method of martial arts training when I've tried and tested it!   
CMD is aimed primarily at self preservation, and it certainly achieves this and in a remarkably quick fashion. It's downplay in it's training approach is designed to create a student who trains without ego or an air of supremacy. However, this can be easily adapted and put to good use in a more competitive style and has been used in both the UFC, Pride, K1 & WEC by the likes of Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson, Thaigo Alves,  Mauricio ""Shogun"" Rua & Buakaw Pramuk.   
The idea from the guy who set up the CMD program was to find people who have their own studio's and for them to get in contact and apply to become a registered CMD Trainer. It's worked most notably in South Africa, America, Malaysia, Australia and the UK, with schools in other countries too. There are two studio's in Germany, but driving 4 hours to Königsbrunn or Dachau would be highly illogical!       
All the students in this video are all ex work colleagues. As you can see, most of them don't look like trained fighters, but this being their second or third week training, it's not bad progress at all....

The rooftop bath and whirlpool (CHF32) was a great place to be on a cold, gloomy winters afternoon in Zürich but take a towel, CHF4 rental for 1 teatowel!! is rude and you need a big towel to keep warm between the roof and showers.

			I guess I'm lucky that I haven't made an order with CRC in the last couple of months, because despite being a frequent customer, nothing dodgy has come up on my credit card. According to the reports, CRC are doing all they can to trace the source of the problem, and I expect that in the future they will be at least as secure as any other site, possibly more so now given the attention caused by this security lapse.   
BTW, in case you're interested to see just how massive the CRC operation has become, then take a look at   posted recently at Bikeradar.   
Local bike shops can hopefully get you a decent price on many parts, and the other advantage for those who are not so knowledgeable is that they can make sure that you're getting the right / compatible parts - I've heard of people buying stuff online before, then having to pay for it again when they realize that it was not what they needed, which negates any potential savings. BTW, I now work for a local bike shop, so am now extra-biased in my opinion (and have less time to post about cycling on EF  ).

Shimano's lowest-end road stuff is the 2300-series, then Sora, then Tiagra. So, Tiagra is two steps above the lowest-end. 2300 is rarely available from aftermarket retailers, but comes on a lot of entry-level road bikes, which are often priced similarly to the Athleticum model listed above. 600 CHF therefore appears to be good value for such a well-equipped entry-level machine.

3590	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	An interesting article for the Ultra Sportsmen and Women re. heart damage	Uncle GroOve	1,179	5	Location: Mendrisio	09.03.2011, 13:22	"    It should be obvious to any layperson that anything in excess is  harmful, and that includes ultra-running/training, and yeah, those of us who didn't receive sports degrees also knew it. What this study shows is just one  specific aspect of damage that I suppose had insufficient  scientific evidence, surely a bunch of bright scientists wouldn't be  wasting their time if it was already known    
That said, I agree in general it is all old news, even that running  ordinary marathons is harmful (not necessarily to the heart but for the  body's immunity, joints etc.). Striking the ""right"" balance is difficult: what is ideal, what is acceptable, and what is excessive, is a highly individual thing, depending on one's genetics, physical state (as well as mental health  ).    
Sad thing that I observe is the dichotomy: ultra running is catching up fast, some of my old contacts organized the first one in India a few months ago, a country that has incredibly high rates of obesity/sedentary life related diseases. Countries as a whole are getting fatter, while those who are already into exercise are (sometimes) going extreme. It is like the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer  , only in this case both sides are losing.

			The wednesday evening running group will start up again (soon) - when I can sort out a date - this week is out for me.   
Finding a good time is difficult because of long/short/odd working hours.   
We go all over Zurich - but tend not to run the trails of an evening - although the various Hashing groups do - BiTCH (every other Tuesday) and ZH3 (every Thursday) - both of which have meetup groups online.   
My wife used to walk back across Zurich at night and never had a problem - even through parks. Mind you, she has also been know to cycle across South-Central LA to get to university - and also through some districts of Washington DC which are no-go zones!!!

			Shorrick - this terrible recent incident in Evolène is absolutely tragic. I know the resort so well, as I used to take groups from UK there regularly, both kids and adults.  The child fell on the steeper bit   and could not be seen from the top. Of course there are no attendants all along the lift, as 100000s would be required. The poor girl slipped to a well protected (thick mattress type protection tied around)  pylon, but her helmet was not fastened properly and therefore slipped off- she was then deflected away from the access ramp and piste to an unprotected pylon. The case made me shudder, because I have taken so many kids there so I could directly relate to this. Many kids, and adults, do not wear their helmet properly fastened/tightened- and the resort can hardly be responsible for this. One could perhaps say that the teacher/school should have reminded kids about the importance of wearing their helmets properly (as a teacher I did so at the beginning of the holiday, and repeated this every morning before setting off + checked regular offenders) - perhaps the teachers did. At the end of the day, if a teenager loosens her helmet during the day - you can't be there every minute to check (although again, as a teacher I did regular checks throughout the day). At the ski school my grand-son attended, ski instructors checked their helmets every day.   
Another teenager from my area died a couple of weeks ago in Nendaz. A group of girls chose to go and ski on a piste that was clearly marked as closed and dangerous. They slipped under the double orange rope and danger signs- and one of them died. Nothing the resort could do- sadly, and terribly tragic. They were 6th Formers and had signed a pledge to follow all regulations and safety - but were allowed to ski in small groups without supervision - just as were were when I was a 6th Former in CH in the 60s. A discussion on the wisdom of this is taking place now with the teachers, parents and school authorities. Sadly the result may well be that Ski Trips will no longer take place, as insisting on supervision/qualified instructors, would push prices beyond feasibility. Teachers are already saying that they will no longer accept to organise such trips.

			Welcome to Neuchatel - how about introducing yourself and you'll find there are some really nice people here. 
Most folk in CH would much prefer to keep fit outdoors at week-ends, cross country skiing, skiing, walking, hiking, cycling. There is fabulous country out there just above your head in the Jura - why stay in to exercise? There are also miles of walking, running, cycling paths all around the lake going either east or west from Neuch. But of course, each to their own - hope somebody will come up with a good idea.

			I think you are going to have to get a map out (on-line if you like) look at the skiing places which you will find on the web and check out the conditions there at the moment. Even if someone tells you of a good resort with good pistes, they might not be suitable for beginners next weekend.

			Closer to Zollikon, Activ Fitness has classes in Tiefenbrunnen. Their membership is also a lot cheaper than Holmes Place.        
Classes are in German. They also have locations in Stauffacher and Central which means you have many classes in the week, in Zurich.

			I asked around at work for good gyms to join (I just moved to Zurich), and I work with several alums from ETHZ. They told me that this is a gym for academics in this city. They gave me the contact information, I called in yesterday and they confirmed that I could get membership just by showing them I have a University degree and that I am here in Zurich legally.   
The lady on the phone was a little unclear about the University degree part. Apparently the system in much of Europe (other than UK) is unlike the 4 year College + Graduate School system I am used to. She did enquire as to the exact nature of my degrees, including the institutions before giving me any details. She told me that I was eligible, and even sent me the forms!   
May be worth calling them at 1-632-42-10 before you go.

3612	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	willPower & grace in Sept.	KimSF	712	0	Location: San Francisco	02.03.2011, 02:22	" 
			
			Hi everyone,   
I teach a class called willPower & grace. It's building quite a following in the US and will launch at Virgin Active in the UK in April. There's also a great instructor in Stockholm.    
Anway, I'm planning a trip to Geneva in September, and while I'm visiting my family I would LOVE to teach a class or workshop.   
So, I'm looking for suggestions for studio space. It could be a gym, or a dance or yoga studio. I need hardwood floors (Marley is ok, too) and mirrors.    
willPower & grace is a mind-body cardio class. It's barefoot and grounded in a positive philosophy. We don't use any equipment -- just your body weight! People love it for lots of different reasons. Runners love it because of the foot training. Athletes like it b/c it improves their balance, coordination, and performance. Yoga people like it because it flows and fuses many yoga postures -- and it gets your heart rate up. Older folks like it because it helps with balance and range of motion, and it's gentle. New moms like it because it's intense and helps relieve stress and get their new body back in shape.    
Thanks for your help!   
Kim

3614	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Quality Bike hire in Zurich	wakemalcolm	8,323	9	Location: Ratho	24.06.2008, 19:37	" 
			
			I could be able to rent high quality bikes in Zürich   
I have a 50cm Trek 5200 and a 58cm Madone 5.5 with full triple Ultegra that I would be selling. Great for a couple for example ( man and woman bike )   
I guess the best moment to sell them would be at the beginning of next year's season and not now that we are past the middle of the summer.   
So if somebody is looking to rent a high quality road bike I could provide that service.   
If someone would want to buy them also I am open for offers.   
I am still not sure about the price but the security conditions are clear.   
I do have an accident insurance that covers my bikes in case of something happens, only excluding the cases where the bike is used for racing or competition. I have to make sure if this covers also riders others than me.   
In any case :   
1. You should have a liability insurance ( Civil Responsability ) and sign me a document assuming responsability for all damages that could happen to the bike during the hire period.   
2. If you don't have the RC because you are visiting, I could rent it to you if you make a warranty deposit that would be refunded when you return the bike in good condition.   
Remember those are Carbon Fiber bikes and bikes I don't ride. I know they are accident free so I can guarantee that.    
But, if you crash with the bike and you hid that fact to me to save yourself problems, you could be putting into risk the next rider that could rent the bikes or the probable next owner.  It is much better to declare it and let the insurance take care of the problem.   
This is still on the ""thinking to"" phase, I guess it is better to put them for rent and then service some people, specially the EFers, than just to be on my cellar waiting to be sold.   
If you have advice to give me about this ( even if you want to convince me not to do it ). Please send me a PM or post here your thoughts.

			Another 'rule' for group riding - triathletes, leave your aerobars at home (or at least never use them during the ride). Compare the picture at the top - bad aerobar usage by the guy at the front - with the lady in the picture below.    
You never know when you'll need your brakes! (I'm not being anti-triathlete, I'm one myself, for my sins).

			Water aerobics classes are fantastic for pregnant women. Just a few precautions to follow in a standard class:   
Your heart is already working extra duty so pay attention to your heart rate.   
Avoid doing abdominal exercise when prone. In the last few months don't do full contractions.   
Water level should always be above your navel.   
I taught water aerobics 3-8 hours per week when pregnant with my first daughter until two weeks before she was born. Her delivery was so much easier since I was fit when she came.   
All the best to you and your baby for a healthy pregnancy!

			Let me try this again!!   I just went there today to check it out.  It is absolutely beautiful.  The S2 train I was on did not go all the way to Unterterzen , I had to get of at Zeigelbrücke  then take a Regional train the other 3 stops to Unterterzen.  Then I took the cable car up to the ski area at Flumserberg.  I am so envious of your trip tomorrow.  What a fanatasic place to learn how to ski.     
I stopped and had a beer at the ""Sport Hotel Knobleboden"" the 1st level stop on the cable car.  Very reasonable rates for folks who want a ""get a way weekend skiiing or snowboarding ..  65sFR a night ( 3 night minimum and they have a hot tub    )    
Have fun tomorrow.  If you get a chance can you let me know what is a reasonable price to pay for ski rentals and where you recommend to go for ski rentals?   Thanks...  bring your sunglasses   ( I wish I was not going to a job thing tomorrow in Pavia ... or I would be all over this )   
Thanks Ciao  
Lauren

			Yes, there is yoga in Zug, Baar and Hunenburg - in English.   
It is Anahata Yoga- see the website at   there is an English section on the site. Classes are held in all three towns.   
Many of the students are English-speaking, so the classes are also geared to them.    
There is also an English-only class on Wednesday mornings, 7:00-8:00 a.m., at the Tanz Atelier in Zug. Gubelstrasse 19A (behind Kaktus outdoor clothing store, by the train station). Check the website for contact info.

I'm a 11th Grade student IB diploma student, in our program we have CAS (creativity, action and service). Im interested to learn a sport here, something like badminton, tennis or basketball. I've seen a few places that offer a play area without a couch. Are there any places that offer courses in any sport? (sports mentioned above preferred).

			Hi All 
Just thought id let you know about a great training in Zurich where you can loose up to 600 Calories per hour. Its a dance, cardio and strengthening workout for your whole body and guess what...it's actually fun.   
Check out the website   or contact me for more details.   
You can come to any of the 22 courses per week to see for yourself. For those US people around, you may know Jazzercise because it's v. big there. Otherwise take the chance and find out what it is.   
Ive been an instructor for over 1 year and have done it 2 years in total and i am madly in love with it. So what are you waiting for

			The mornings on the lake have been beautiful the last few weeks and not so cold - although Thurs was a bit chilly at -5 deg C.  Running outside is not so bad - as long as you dress correctly, stay well hydrated and are not coming from the 45 deg heatwave in Aus.  
I run some outdoor circuits 2 mornings a week and a couple of my clients are preparing for the London Marathon.  They are running most lunchtimes and have found the weather ok (just not when there is the Bise wind) and there is also a Glocals ( ) running group 2 evenings a week and on Sat. A few of your long endurance sessions can also be substituted with cross country skiing or snowshoeing up in the mountains - that's if the snow ever comes back.   
There is a Silhouette gym in the area, but it might not be so cheap for 2 weeks - but take a look at the website.     
Good luck with the training.

I preferred the first option: to build a solid base through Alpine hiking and rock-climbing, with the idea that if I am still fascinated by a more dangerous sport like mountaineering, I might put the skills to use, else rest on the fact that it is the journey that matters, not the destination.    
""Clueless"" is a rather strong word; I do often climb with expert mountaineers, such as those who have done Eiger N Face, things that are not in my wishlist  but we talk about it and form my opinions. I did admit I am an advanced beginner, right? So what exactly am I pretending?       Sorry, but I have to respectfully disagree. Briethorn is not couch climbing. Reading many reports and getting information from diverse sources is very useful if you want a balanced view. I for one don't believe in pissing on the electric fence to test if it conducts.   
I have to agree with Hordur who is highly experienced in this matter, and worked as a mountain rescuer too.        Since when did climbing a particular mountain become essential to have a meaningful internet discussion?   In any case, English forum is just a starting point; the OP should soon go to more specialist sites like hikr and SP.   
 Secondly I consider Matterhorn to be objectively too risky (for my taste, that is); last year I managed climbing up to PD; this year if my interest lasts, I plan to go for Dent Blanche which is maybe a touch harder but much safer. So, no, I don't intend to climb the Matterhorn. But I intend to continue to air my views about it   "	Posts: 9	Join Date: Oct 2010	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

3688	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Ski Bindings re-mount To Centre Position	edster	959	0	Location: Baden	19.01.2011, 12:36	" 
			
			HI everyone.  
I assume from the ski posts that this forum is filled enthusiastic and experienced skiers and snowboarders alike.    
I have a question that you guys may be able to help me with.   
I have been skiing For 3 seasons now, 2 of those on my K2 extreme twin tips. I would say I am intermediate/advanced skiier.. Black runs are no problem but mostly do jibbing around the piste and through tree runs. Also try to go offpiste if weather permits but still on the beginner level.    
So I have my Ski's set up quite traditionally, I am however thinking of switching to centre mount, as switching backwards is a bit of a hassle, the balance does not feel right (need more momentum for the first switch). I guess  centre mounting would fix that problem.    
However the question is: Will it compromise the ski integrity if i remount my bindings for a centre mount position?    
And does anyone have any Pro's/con's ridning centre mount? I mean Performance offpiste and on piste... Is there a big impact?    
Thanks Guys!

			Hi everyone!   
It has been a great weather in Zurich this week, so I came up with this idea. Go hiking to Uetliberg every morning for a week. I had a knee surgery so I have to do some training before I can start skiing again later in the season.   
So the starting time can be either 6am-9am, or 12pm-3pm,  the actual starting day can vary depending on the interest as well as frequency, i.e. every day for 7 days or every other day for 14 days. But I am thinking maybe by this Friday.   
So if you also have some time flexibility right now and want to get in shape or just meet the sunrise in one of the nicest places in Zurich, I am waiting for your PM.

Apparently there was some trouble a few years back with the resorts misrepresenting. I heard that Swiss Tourism got a lot of complaints and threatened to remove resorts from this site if they had more complaints. I've found the reports to be fairly reliable with this lately. Remember that some resorts will measure upper snow depth on glaciers, and hard essentially means icy, but in general the reports on this site are accurate.

			The boot buckles most definitely have to close, and your feet also need to secure and firm ... you will find a pair.... do not compromise.     
Try different brands in a specialist shop. Sometimes on the mountain is better to rent so you can bring them back if they are uncomfortable.  Boots that open at the back might be worth a try...

			Hi Poot,   
I tried it on November 20th.  I started in Altdorf at 7:45AM.  I made it to Brusti at around 10:30, and put on my snowshoes (Pic3).  I had a quick lunch near some huts at around noon (Pic5), 1800m elevation.  The closest I got to the pass was Angistock, 2060m elevation, at around 1pm (Pic7).  Pic6 is my last look at the pass, before making my way back down.  I took Pic8 a couple of minutes after that, on the way back down.   
I had given myself until 1pm to cross the pass, to ensure adequate daylight, but I fell short by about 1.5 hours.  The snow was too deep.  But what an adventure!

3710	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	question about snowboard width and foot size	gongyj	2,861	6	Location: zurich	29.12.2010, 12:57	" 
			
			Do a Google on snowboard riding angles, if you don't understand the above too well. There is a huge variation, depending on style, what you want to do with it, etc. A bit late I know - but in general I would never advise anybody to buy a board before renting and having some experience (preferably a few lessons - bad habits are hard to lose!). Personally I use a slight duck stance (-5 on the back foot) because it is much kinder on my knees, and 28 on front. If your board is really narrow, it might be a racing board, far to fast for a beginner and not good for turns- racers ride with feet at incredibly sharp angles forwards, so feet overhang is no problem. Do you have bindings on them? Most Swiss with racing boards have raised bindings for hard boots.  I'd seek advice from the snowboard instructor in resort. Bonne chance and have fun. (Don't forget to use knee pads and hand/wrists supports- not worth cutting down on those!).

			As Zappa and JLF suggest go see a sports therapist. Best thing to do.    
A decade ago, I busted my right knee while playing hockey. I could not run for more than a few minutes without the pain in the right knee flaring up.  My self inflicted therapy included hot packs and pain killers (a la Mr. Cricket). The youth in me phoo-phooed all suggestions of visiting a doc for a month until, well, the pain became unbearable. First I went to the orthopedic department of the local medical college, and they found a guinea pig in me, until a kind soul sent me to the right kind of doc, however, by that time it was a little too late. No, not that I lost the leg, or that I have to drag it around or anything, but the hockey days and the long distance running days are effectively over. No, I wouldn't have gone on to win Olympic medals, but daimn running felt good.    
So, so, unless you want to become like me - i.e. confined to dreaming about running, you'd better go see the right kind of doc.   
Good luck, and speedy recovery!

On topic, I got one of those neck things that's a bit of fleecy tube then a long polyester tube and it's useful for all sorts of conditions.  It's probably got a name, but I don't know what it is (snood doesn't really fit the bill).   
It can be worn round the neck, it can be pulled up to cover most of the face or worn on the head - with the top of the head exposed or not.

			Hi Tupac,   
Take the TPL bus that goes towards Grancia ( I don't  remember but I think its the bus number 5 to fornaci - do confirm before  you get on it) - do not take the post bus to grancia.   
The bus  drops you on the motorway about 500 meters before grancia (which by the  way is the home to all the factory outlets with shops on big discounts -  and offcourse ikea   !!). You'll notice a sports mall on the left  midway between the TPL bus stop and Grancia (when you're walking towards  grancia).   
I remember seeing a whole set of dumbells (2-3 pairs of weights + rod + box) for around 49 CHF.   
Good luck !

			A  vertebral subluxation is what chiropractors refer to when a vertebra  has lost its proper alignment with the vertebra above and below. This  can lead to muscle spasms, a reduced range of motion, and neurological  irritation. If the vertebra loses its normal range of motion and  position, it can also cause a misalignment in the rib joint and can  refer pain into the rib cage. Pain can travel along the intercostal  nerves.

I was interested in trying out Zumba for a laugh and to get fit. Does anyone know of a good class in the Lausanne area?   
Many thanks!

			And here is the 2003 WC XC race track. There's a permanent timing facility available, which means that the trail is still in service, obviously.     
Alternatively you can always ride your way *up* to the Monte Tamaro - but same caveats re. snow/ice apply....

3733	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Training after the flu - what to do...?	guest	1,174	0	null	null	" 
			
			I was in great shape just prior to dec 25th. Had been doing my 3x gym workout per week (cardio , weights), just felt really fit and ready for the new upcoming MTB season.   
Since the 25th I've been down w/ the flu. Just 2-3 days of the nasty stuff, but still feel weak, I'm perspiring at night and not sleeping really well at all...still got residual headache, bla bla.   
Anyhoo. After all *that* cr@p will have hopefully gone away, how should I resume my workout regime?.... I'm looking to get back my cardio condition back into shape as fast as possible, but without doing any collateral damage whatsoever, as I will have a new bike waiting for me in March  and I want to be out there ripping ASAP    
Thanks!

			I can very, very highly recommend Dr. Speck in Pfäffikon:  . In October I had a shoulder operation and it went very well. On Friday I met him, on Monday afternoon he operated. He was recommended to me and is fantastic: patient, answers all your questions, makes you feel as if you are the only patient he has in his office etc. The operation was in the hospital in Einsiedeln, which was also great. The anesthesiologist stopped by the next day to ask if everything was ok. The hospital is next to the ski jumps, so I can imagine they don't lack experience with knee injuries.    
Whatever you decide, good luck.

			Back again! If your daughter swims laps in all four strokes then she doesn't need swimming lessons as such, she needs a club. Uster is one of the ones with the highest standards fairly near Tann Rüti. Another club trains in Zürich Oerlikon - Limmat Sharks - also high standard. Meilen I'm not sure at the moment. Their pool is closed so I don't know where they train. If none of those suit you, Wädenswil has a club too but being on the other side of the lake it's more time consuming to get there. As there are so many ex-pats in the area, you'll likely find that someone will speak English and anyway, for swimming you need to talk 'swimmerish'.

Date: Monday 3rd January 2011.

If there is enough interest I will pop it up on the calender.   
If you cannot go on the above date please do not post, as it just gets confusing. ( this is not meant unkindly   )

Back then you'd snowshoe 2 hours up the hill and ride down in 20 minutes. Finito....   
Nowadays people get killed by mini avalanches when snowshoeing above Bellagio (lake Como, Italy) or Monte Bré (Lugano). Hardly what I call ""extreme"" slopes / hills / whatever. As much as I love boarding (long story) I am very reluctant to go off-piste anymore. And yes...

3748	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Ski boot advice needed please...	guest	5,049	34	null	null	" 
			
			hello,  
Ittigen is right, the best would be to rent new boots in the early season. 
The next best is spending 2-3 hours in a shop with lots of choice. 
Makes generally have their particular boot shape, that's why we tend to come back to our favourite brand when buyng new boots. 
At a certain price level, and in their respective genres boots tend to have the same technicalities.   
As for racing boots, they used to be hyper stiff, but nowadays they tend to have a softer forwars flex.   
Anyways, you will have it heat moulded and have a custom  inner sole, so when you try a ski boot, the most important is the tongue (which can be heat moulded sometimes), and the general flex feeling.

			I'd think ChrisW is right. Even though your net-math is very clever, you'd need to hang out a bit to sell at the reasonable margin. Is the hassle worth it? 400CHF+ and you have no trouble just drag and drop the bikes, also in case of any damage happens to them no risk by renting you left with sth hard to sell. To be honest I don't find 1400CHF-minus such a poor deal for 2 tech bikes for 3 weeks ready to get trashed at your extreme convenience...

			Not long back there was a  about safety in cars. It's in SG dialect, but I think the pictures tell their own story.   
The first part concerns dog transport in cars. In a soft box, for example, in addition to the fact that the dog might easily be killed or badly injured, the passenger would also be endangered.    
Then the danger of other goods behind the back seats in the boot of the car is shown. The speed is given as only 50 kph but the force of things in the back of the car which went straight through the back of the seats injuring the passengers gave me quite a shock. The experts themselves were horrified at the damage done by stuff that was actually fastened down on a trailer.    
Main points are that the things should be securely fastened down against the partition, without play, so that nothing can 'gain speed' through the crash and have extras force to fly forwards through the car. If the back seats are not being used one can cross the safety belts and close them to give extras support to the seats themselves.    
This danger would apply to travelling with skis and ski-boots too.

			Another recommendation for Silhouette by Lindenplatz.  The gf goes there and is very happy with it, plenty of courses and decent machines and sauna.  No pool is the only downside, if that's your thing.

3775	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Skiing or Snowboarding on Saturday - Davos?	Pops	596	0	Location: Kanton Schwyz	09.12.2010, 20:40	" 
			
			Hello All,   
Again I seek pastners for some activity - this time downhill sports. I am off to Davos and invite anyone to join. I snowboard and am at the stage where I feel I am going fast, rarely fall, but lots to learn yet. I like to take chances and push my little limits. 
Feel free to add to the thread or PM me. I would probably take the train or if a few people come along I could take the car. 
Could be a fun social ski or a good time to explore the area before business picks up at the resorts. 
Let's go!

3777	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Classic or Skate	dodgyken	1,000	17	Location: Democratic Republic Kenistan	06.12.2010, 17:12	"    I am a pretty good downhill skier with 30+years of experience under my belt. Based on that I tried classic, since 'surely it can't be that difficult'. Quite a frustrating experience. The following winter we booked ourselves an instructor for just two hours and - surprise, surprise - it really wasn't that difficult after all.  
If I were you I'd spend one or two hours on cross-country gear on my own just to get a feel for the equipment. Then I'd book an instructor for two hours - time and money well-invested.

			This whole Skier vs Snowboarder happens only amongst tourists and weekend warriors.  The next time you go to a mountain pay attention to the locals.  Skiers and boarders riding with each other, drinking a beer with each other, and digging each other out of avalanches and saving each others a$$.   How you get down the mountain is irrelevant whether its on Skies or a board or even a ski bike.  (so long as its not those stupid mini skies (snoller blades)  No one likes those things. lol     As far as which is better its all about personal preference.  Props to those who do both.  Carve the icy hard pack on skis then float the pow on a board.

			Local bike stores should have lots of cardboard bike boxes that you can use for shipping, the boxes that bikes get delivered to them in (so they'll give them to you for free instead of putting them in the recycling). There are lots of online guides with tips on how to pack your bike safely in one of these, or the bike shop will normally do it for you for a decent price (probably less than US$50, maybe a lot less).

Pretty much the answer, though anaerobic fitness is probably more important in skiing than aerobic fitness. So intervals are better training than running 10k (though either are better than none). Though of course, the answer could also be to just ski (you are in Switzerland afterall).

			If you have any kid toy/sport troc around (flee market), go. I found a very usable set of skis woth binding for me and my 4yr old (10fr each), poles (6fr each), boots (15fr each), and helmets. And even the cable to attach a child to you when you are training (10fr). None of it looks very pretty and won't last for years, but hey, I could care for fashion, I can't wait to dig my skis into the slope. Some people have bought new skis and so want to get rid of the old stuff without wanting to make ton of cash on it, to make space in the basement or attick...worth the try, really.

My 5 cents for what it's worth.

			You might be able to ski down to Brunni from Hochstückli but you'd have to walk back.     
In Rothenthurm, there's a ski lift called Madern but I think it's closed this winter due to lack of customers.   
The other ski lift in Rothenthurm, called Neusell, is a popular tiny resort for the locals.  However, I don't know of any feasible routes one can do with your snowboard from Stückli down to Neusell.   
Your best bet is to snowboard all the way down to Sattel valley and then take the gondola back up again.

have you trained before? if so, talk to your former instructors and ask if they know- usually groups are quite international and they may be able to recommend a sister group near you.    
if not, try the different ones and see which one you like the best. and if you haven't practiced before, start working out now because it isn't easy  !

			Since if a beginner skated from 9.00 until 10.45 they would hardly be able to walk to the changing rooms afterwards (been there, done that), the group is probably split into groups with similar ability. Maybe to accomodate all the folk who want to join she is making three groups, starting one of them earlier and you are one of the the earlier ones.

			I am of the same school. I would like to hike around more etc. It's harder to do now with the weather and the short days. I live on the other side of Zurchersee and would be happy to meet up during the week, after work, for a walk around. Better than sitting at home and or going alone. 
It seems that the recurring events get more attention than these one-off invites. Shall we set-up a weekly hike/walk and just change locations weekly? I live around Obersee (the small lake attached to Zurchersee) so it would be better to do things between here and Uster rather than in Zurich. 
Ideas: 
Rapperswil - Schmerikon - Train back - I think in the dark would be no problem. 
Around Uster See (maybe rollerblades if warmer) 
I will try and do some research.

If money's not as issue, a good one is the Plaza (  ) at Villereuse (a few tram stops down from Rive). My brother tried out a bunch of gyms before settling on this one, and says it's the the best. He got a corporate discount (can be negotiated down to around 1500 CHF per year) I went once and can vouch that their facilities are second to none. And they've got a bunch of classes.

Was up at Engelberg yesterday and was pretty limited in terms of accessible terrain but fairly amazing weather/snow given how early it is in the season.   
I did a Master's in Lausanne and ended up skiing in Verbier/Portes Du Soleil quite a bit and was thoroughly impressed with the backcountry terrain, hope to find something similar at Engelberg/Andermatt/other resorts near Zürich.   
So if your down let me know via PM or reply and look forward to hitting the slopes soon.   
Leon

			Okay,then tomorrow (Sunday) we do the  Chli Aubrig. 
I will travel down on the train from Zurich and I can arrive at Euthal Post at either 08:20 or 08:50 - probably take the earlier train. 
I will wait at the Euthal Post until either we are all there or else 09:00. 
Please send me a PM if you are thinking of coming. 
I have a red rucksack - look out for me. 
I chose this realitvely shorter route because I have to be back in Zurich at around 18:00 (that should give us plenty of time . . maybe to have a beer too ). 
Looking forward to seeing anyone there. 
Anyone is welcome .

			Just apply for a weapons permit at your cantonal police. If you're not from one of the black listed countries and have a C permit it should be business as usual. Once you have this, then you can purchase your peashooter as any Swiss citizen would. Citizens of certain countries can even do this with a B permit if I'm not mistaken.

A bicycle without an engine was the original version, so it gets to use the shortened name ""bike."" Strapping a motor onto a bike came later, and so has the modified name ""motorbike"" - if you want to shorten it then you could say ""moto"".   
Just to be inconsistent, I will grant you that a ""biker"" is someone who rides a motorbike and not a bicycle, the latter are always ""cyclists"".

			but hes still only beginning.I am currently teaching my son how to rollerblade.  Kids ""get it"" so fast.. Every weekend (usually Sunday), we practice along this stretch of pathway:       
Its great, very flat, and no cars.  Very good for trying stuff out, at any speed you like.  If you lose control, you can ditch into the corn field to the left side.   
I have been skating since I was small also.  Not a professional or anything, but can teach the things you are asking for.  I taught my wife too, and she is pretty good, if I do say so myself    
If you dont mind me teaching my son at the same time, you are welcome to join, we can set a time by PM if you like.  Most Sundays for a couple of hours I'm there - until the weather cools down I guess!

			Hi All 
I am about to live in Luzern for at least a year. I am arriving in few months from now and will be living 5 min from the city of Luzern. 
In the mean time I am visiting in the city and try to figure out how will I handle the move. [ I am coming from a very different place, outside of Europe] 
I am looking to continue with my GYM habits and work out every day. 
I prefer a place in which there is a big and nice work out area, swimming pool and other facilities  
since there are few GYMs in town  what would be the best choice? Which is the best one? 
Also can anyone recommend a personal Martial Art trainer?  
I am practicing Kung Fu for some time now [basic/fun level, not a pro] and would really like to continue doing so. I am looking for trainer that speacks English and can work with me almost on daily basis     
Many thanks! 
Gilberto

			Glad you like to board and flippers idea. Now I have no idea how you feel about dogs - but if you like them, why not offer dog walking services if you have time. Walking with a dog is so much easier and 'motivating' - and if you have been feeling down, a great way to meet people. When with a dog, people who wouldn't dream of talking to a stranger normally - suddenly get all chatty and smiley. There are also SPA/dog rescue that are desperate for volunteer dog walkers. Bonne chance - hope you feel better soon.

			I believe , as has been said before, it is not nessacarily what you eat, but more how you eat it.  In fast paced cultures there seems to be a tendancy to wolf down food which often means you over eat as the message from your stomach that actually you are satisfied doesn't arrive until you have over eaten. The best explaination of this I read was in a book by Paul McKenna  .  the book is very interesting though I'm not very impressed by the self hypnosise cd.  Also I would say from my experience here that the culture holds mealtime in higher regard.  Less people eating aldeskco but going to the canteen for a leisurely repast.  Still I don't think you can exclude exercise as modern life styles don't tend to be very active.  If I spent more time exercising than writing this crap maybe I'd be thin.

There are plenty of ski resorts around Luzern you can try - Melchsee Frutt, Engelberg, Klewenalp. A bit of a longer trip will take you to the Berner Oberland. Andermatt is just under 2 hours away.   
Or you might try Germany - Feldberg, for example. I've no idea about kindergarten style facilities - try the various websites.   
I know people with younger kids have found   to be quite handy. But no child care - one of you has to stay with the sprog. I've seen plenty of babies/toddlers playing in the snow, sledging, being looked after by one parent.

			This   seems to answer a lot of really great questions (not just about shaft care).     
Another website I read mentioned lighter fluid as a good cleaning option, and a lot of the guys I played with in the US will use rubbing alcohol.  Using very small amounts of either will quickly remove the grime on the shaft.  I found it greatly improved the quality and feel of my shaft.     
Most of the time though, if you are going to use any solvents, they need to evaporate quickly (ie-be highly volatile) such that they don't affect the finish of the wood significantly.  Also, if you are going to use something like this, you should be aware that it *could* react to any coatings on the wood (dependent on what coatings might have been used).  Used sparingly, I don't see using solvents as a problem, but for a really expensive cue, like the one you are mentioning, you may not want to take any chances... Hopefully the link helps.     
Good luck, and hope to see you Monday.       PS-Ignore UTH for now.  He is just trying to wind you up (and is possibly a bit jealous of your cue)...    "	Posts: 219	Join Date: Oct 2009	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 108 Times in 64 Posts	made some interesting contributions

But just because someone is ""professional"" or ""specialized"" means nothing to me. For example the OP calls himself a professional; he received advice from other ""more professional""s based on which he was making some suggestions which were quite dubious to say the least.   
I too think, lke frankzappa, that there are many cases where orthotics are justified/necessary, but most cases can be rectified by taking the simpler step suggested by the other posters.

3859	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Where can I go cross country skiing now?	amaxwell	1,002	2	Location: Zurich	26.10.2010, 12:35	" 
			
			I am biased I know - but the very best place to cross country ski is here, in my native Jura mountains. Instead of going round and round on a valley bottom, you can link up to 100s of kms of well groomed pistes on top of the mountains, with magnificent views over the whole of CH and the Alps. But you'll have to be a bit patient - it snowed a few times- but defo not enough yet. If you'd like more info on the Jura, where to hire kit, etc, do get in touch. Can't wait myself. Last year was fabulous here.  "	Posts: 15	Join Date: May 2007	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 3 Times in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			early season demo days are not very useful to judge powder skis unless you are very lucky with the snow. best bet is to look for a freeride-type ski shop wherever you go and see about arranging a test/demo/rental. the larger resorts populated by freeriders will have the most selection - engelberg, verbier, chamonix.    
having said that, don't be afraid of a wide powder ski. i'm only on my 4th ski season (after about 8 snowboard seasons) and i ski a variety of skis but my favorite ski is already 130mm underfoot. if you are already a decent skier, don't even bother with a ski under about 100mm, otherwise you aren't getting the float benefit that wide skis give you. i'd look for something 110-120mm with full rocker.

It did get my attention for a few seconds... before I wisely decided to forget about it  
I don't think I'll be doing it next year either: one of the reasons is that it seems to be poorly organised and to lack participants. I couldn't find any starting or ranking list on the website but I remember seeing a spreadsheet elsewhere with the final results: not many people took the start and much fewer actually finished.  
So my guess is that you would be riding pretty much alone during one long miserable day, in the middle of traffic, with no ""race"" or ""event"" atmosphere whatsoever. In this case, I'd very much prefer to do this ride with a few friends, without any ""support"" (read ""entry fees""...) nor official timing (who cares?).

			Bit late to be a useful reply for your going there tomorrow, which was today, but I've played squash there a few times and can recommend it for that. It's a good place but I think it only has a big gym and squash courts, I don't think they have tennis or badminton. All courts are glass back apart one, think it's court 6, which we call the sweat box! It's open on Sunday.

			If you're really planning on doing 2 months in the mountains (and my goodness, you could), and you're someone to hedge bets against injury, I'd also buy a membership with Rega.  They help run the Swiss mountain rescue (with Swiss Alpine Rescue) and they're the guys with the helicopters.  It's $30/person or $70/family, and that waives any fees associated with being rescued.

			If you cannot find a public swimming pool in Wohlen and I cannot find a pool in Wohlen, then there probably isn't one there.    
Pools are expensive to build and expensive to maintain. School pools are often not open to the public - changing facilities are not suitable and wages for safety and cleaning personell will cost far more than the entrance fees bring in.    
When folk have asked me to give them lessons, whether paid or not, I usually throw back a few questions and ideas. It gives me a good idea of whether the person wants to be able to swim or is prepared to put in the necessary time, effort and money into learning. More than one 'I cannot, because' in the replies or reactions and I drop the idea of giving lessons like a hot potato.    
I wish you all the best in your search though. There must be a swimming teacher out there somewhere...

			Hi,    
my name is Donal. I own the cafe du cerf in Neuch. MY wife is from the US and I lived there for almost 10 years. I was thinking about having a Sunday night football. I get the games through SKY see (the following for all live games  ) for 2010 season. Was wondering if you or the team might be interested in starting something up. Was thinking about wings, mini burgers etc.. and pitchers. It would be on the 2nd floor of the bar so it would be more or less Sunday Night Football Fans Only. if your intersted drop me a mail at  , if not no worries, i'll be here watching regardless, come on you GIANTS!!

			The Total-Sport deal is pretty good. We thought about that for our 3 children. As it was we bought some skis and they hand them down to each other. The boots are more complicated and we have mainly got by with second hand. Renting at the resort can be very expensive - I wouldn't do it.

			I highly recomment Fitness Park: I was a member of Update Fitness two years and hardly (like once in 2 weeks on average) went there.    
However, since I joined Fitness Park this January, I've been going regularly multiple times in a week because there is a lot you can do there. The equipment is new and the latest.    
There is a swimming pool, hot bath, massage parlour etc. And most importantly, atleast for me, there are courses - from yoga, cycling to bodypump etc. - that you do in groups which is a lot more fun and keeps you interested in these activities! I find the staff very friendly and helpful!

3947	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Hiking on Mount Pilatus this Sunday (12/09)	polionamen	2,261	0	Location: Zurich	08.09.2010, 18:40	   Dear all,   I wanted to see if there will be interest to do the Mount Pilatus, near Lucerne, this Sunday.      Myself: 28yo French/English guy. I am a bit out of form as I just moved to Zürich and I have not sorted all my life yet. I recently did Weggis to Rigi Kulm in 2h20min though (hike time was 4h30 on the trail) so there is still a bit in me.      The hike:    Alpnachstad station to Pilatus Kulm.    1700m ascent, around 20km, about 5h00 hike time to go up and 3h30 to go down according to guides.    I would be looking to go up in 3h-3h30 so not as fast as my Rigi hike so we can have some conversation. Maybe even slower if people find that daunting / we can have more participants     I may want to use the cogwheel train on a small section to go down, as I've never been in one and it looks like a different experience. A small section costs CHF 9.50 with the Halb Tax.    Also, I don't like going down much.

			Yeah, you really must be new in town. Anyway, there's one up in Vezia which is one of the ""cheapest"" one around here, if you can call it here. You should check that one out.     
I also used to lift weights back in the day, but quite since I've been here in Lugano, I've come to the conclusion instead of paying almost 1k to go to the gym for a year, I'm gonna get my own equipment, much cheaper and way more practical, that way I can work out all the time!

Once I wrote to them and they called me and explained how I could buy family tickets.

			Hello   
Would very much welcome company on a run - helps with that extra bit of morning motivation! On weekdays at/before 6AM, duration about 45 mins. Weekends before 9:30 am. My routes vary but am open to others as still very new to Zurich. I prefer to meet near Central or Bellevue.   
I am not a beginner nor training for a marathon - just really enjoy going for a run to keep healthy therefore speed isn't my goal. Prefer a relaxed pace. Happy to hear from you whether you wish to go once a week or several.    
Thanks 
SJP

			Naturally the weights depend on the movement, the muscle you're training  and what you're trying to achieve.   
If you can do only 5 reps,  that could be quite much in the beginning. Especially in the beginning I  would use lighter weights and do more reps so you get used to the  movements so you learn how to make them safe.   
But naturally after  a while you should start raising weights if you want to achieve  results. Quite typically heavy weights mixed with low number of reps are  for max power as low weights + high number of reps to firm places. When  you go below the surface it is actually quite high maths. You can even  make aerobic exercises which (properly made) can be a lot more effective  than just plain jogging.   
Normally I don't actually use any  machines, instead I prefer free weights.

Zymogen, it was nice meeting you and hope you are feeling better by now! 
No worries. Bella Tola was under the clouds anyways( mountains on the other side were in sunshine!) . And like I said, mountains won't go anywhere. There is another chance!

			I would be interested in getting together for a run, and my husband might on the weekends (he's doing the JungFrau marathon in a few weeks).  We live on the west side of the lake too, and also tend to do more long distance rather than more fast paced.  And, we're also from Atlanta - So we just might know some of the same people!   
I think it would be great to set up one night each week for a group run, meeting same time / same place each week and anyone who can make it shows up (we had a lot of this in Atlanta for cycling, and it's a great way to meet people plus get a good workout).  I need to get to know the local running paths a little more and then would be glad to help put something like this together.

No. we do it for an experience of a lifetime. CHF 10.000 is fine, but if we go too much over, we might not be able to afford it, and currently, we look at ca. CHF 12.000

4001	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Davos MTB Bahnen Tour	ih999	1,779	6	Location: Zurich	11.08.2010, 19:14	   Excellent, thanks for the good advice Patrick and Eire.  Heads up on the route is much appreciated.    I think well just go for it and push to get it done in one day.  Sounds like a good challenge and if we dont make it well finish it off the next day.  Doesnt sound too technical for our group then, just a lot to do in 1 day.  Hopefully it will be as good as the trail we rode out to Sertig from Davos earlier in the year.  That was awesome.  The rest of the lifts were still closed then though.   Ive found the single trail maps very difficult to follow.  Even in Flims yesterday on the Runca Trail I wasnt exactly sure we were on the right path.

			Hello - does anyone know of a place that offers team sport practices (e.g. soccer practice) for toddlers (ideally 3-5 years old) in Basel City area? 
I have twin girls who are 2.5 and am looking for a sport activity (doesn't have to be only on the weekend, they go to daycare 4 days/week so can go to the sport practice on fridays).   
Thanks in advance

			Sounds like you're in good shape to me; I can't even come close to 1.5 h for a half marathon.  Of course, training for a long-course triathlon is different than training for a half marathon, but it sounds like you are prepared for a good season of training.  If you haven't already, I'd recommend checking out some books:      (by Joe Friel) is a bit hard core for me, but it contains all the basic training principles.      (also by Joe Friel) has a bit more specific advice for longer races, but a lot of it overlaps with The Triathlete's Training Bible   
There's another book,   by Henry Ash, but I haven't read that one.  It has specific training plans for the 70.3, though, which might be helpful.   
Books are informative, but the most helpful things for a beginner are to join a team and/or hire a coach.  These will help you plan your season and make sure you are on track during your training.  I don't have experience with the teams here (there are threads that link to them on this forum), but will be coached by fellow EF-er, advntur.     
If you're looking for training buddies, there's the Wednesday night Zurich group that Niranjin mentioned, and in warm weather, there is a Thursday night ride in Zurich.  Some of the other endurance athletes out there might be looking for a training buddy, too...anyone else have advice?

			Hey folks,   
I've been toying with GPS logging of rides for a while but never really found THE site to use for uploading to in order to share the rides.   
So based on some site recommendations from others and the ones I know about I went ahead and uploaded a GPX file of the Zugerberg ride we did 2 weeks ago to the various sites.   
What I'd like to do is get feedback and opinions and maybe find out some other sites that I don't know about so that I can make a final decision.   
Here are the various site links that I've tried so far - all the links are to the same GPX file uploaded.   
The reason I'm asking for opinions is that sometimes a guest will see more ads etc. too - and i'm wondering if they become too intrusive for some users.   
Here they are in no particular order:                   
Thanks all   
Cheers, Jase

4017	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	2nd Hand Road Bike Advice Required	rocksteady	779	0	Location: N/A	06.08.2010, 03:08	" 
			
			Hi all,   
I am moving to Geneva in 3 weeks time.  Given the terrain around me, it would be mad of me to  not take up road cycling   
From my research a good second racing bike offers excellent value for money.  I would not say I am au fait with all brands (bar the major ones like trek, giant etc) , but I did like the look of a CUBE Aerial - their entry road bike.  Does anyone know where I could possibly pick up a second hand version of this bike?      
I read on the cycling sticky that Igvelo ( ) is good.  I noticed that they have an event on the 4th of September, would it be worthwhile going to?     
Ideally I would not want to pay more than 300-500 for the second hand bike..   
Apart from CUBE, is there any bikes of a similar standard that offer good bang for my buck.   
Any advice on how to proceed is appreciated.

4020	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	MTB tyres	Chuckle	1,473	16	Location: Baden	17.07.2010, 16:50	" 
			
			Read something interesting about tires. It's a study of the the  effects of tire pressure and tire width on rolling resistance (it's  translated into english, despite what the filename might suggest).       
Basically the conclusion is that when travelling offroad, the wider the  tire and the lower the pressure, the  the rolling  resistance. Makes a damn good point for going tubeless.   
It's not completely exhaustive, for example it does not say at which  tire pressure rolling resistance would begin to increase again. It also  doesn't say much of the effects of rotating mass for using a heavier  tire. It says they controlled for it, which I assume means they removed  the effect it had on power input required so they could study only the  power loss from rolling resistance. This means a bit more study to get  the full picture.   
I attempted to (poorly) calculate the effects of rotational mass on  power output by using the cycling calculator at:   
By adding wheel weight and drag, and controlling for power, according to  the calculator it would costs about 1w per 100g wheel weight  .   
Comparing that to the rolling resistance study, on surfaces with  medium/high base rolling resistance, the loss of power from the increase  in rotational mass is far outweighed by the gain in power from the  reduction of rolling resistance.   
All of this also ignores the fact that wider tires with lower pressure  will also give superior grip compared skinny tires with high pressure,  which will also save you energy when you're not spinning up hills and  sliding off corners.   
My amateur conclusion would then be.. Always run the lowest possible  tire pressure you can without getting pinch flats, and if you're riding  more than gravel roads run the widest tire that will fit on your bike.

			To apply for 6 nations tickets through the official outlet you need to go through the National Rugby website of the nation hosting the game. 
E.g England v Wales you need to go to    
Bear in mind some of the tickets for the games have already gone on sale and are already sold out and now being relisted on other ticket sites for big bucks    
For more info on how to get tickets you may want to    
Otherwise try googling the match you want tickets for and then you should get the results of all the ticket auction/resale sites.   
If you are a serious rugby fan, it also helps joining the fan club as you get access to advanced ticket sales/priority ballots though you will pay an annual membership fee for this.

Looking to play either tennis or Badminton on Tuesday and / or Thursday nights. Based in Zug so can meet up after work either in Zug, Zurich or Luzern....or somewhere on that route.   
Nothing serious.....more fun to be honest!   
I would say I am a average player in both sports.    
Can be doubles as well......male or female   
Totally new to Switzerland so would need some help on where you hire tennis courts.....   
Anyone interested please let me know   
Thanks.....

			I would be keen too - although I have a baby due 2nd week os March so won't be too available. As for fitness I am probably average _ I commute from Thalwil to Opfikon which includes some steep hills but have never been on the mountains.   
I guess that after a ride or two we will know what the group is - and if you pencil this one as a training ride for the unfit ones and a recovery ride for the very fit ones it wont matter too much    
Hopefully meet some of you in March

They have a decent grading system - we did the Tour de Tavaneuse recently which was fabulous.

			Hi there   
Welcome! There are a few of us who run around the pace you are setting out to run (some a bit quicker/some a bit slower). We usually run together on a Wednesday and over the weekend.   
things are a bit slow at the moment as we have been enjoying a summer break after April Marathons (whilst others have been training for the ironman)...but if you look at the post for the thursday run this week from Lauregg from Enge you will meet some of the crew.   
otherwise I will pm you when we head out for a group run.   
cheers and goodluck!

Having felt suitably unfit and generally out of shape wathcing the ultra-fit men & women race around the Ironman Switzerland last Sunday, I have submitted a cheeky last minute entry for the long run in Davos this weekend. Clearly this has been done out of guilt and ignorance, but who doesn't love a challenge.   
I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who will be racing and whether anyone had a 3 day training regime for an ultra-marathon?

He left the bit about his handicap blank so they had a discussion. He said ""I used to be a member in the US and had a 10. But I have lived here for 5 years and am not a member there anymore and don't play so much anymore"". They asked, ""well, what do you feel your handicap is now?"".  He said 16, the b*stard.  They wrote down on the form 16, and sent him a card with 16 on it. They didn't even ask to see his card from his old club...  so it is worth a try.

4058	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Mountain biking in Switzerland	Archie84	3,189	20	Location: Singapore	27.05.2009, 15:50	"    That's not strictly true. There is an lot of riding in and around Zermatt. I have only scratched the surface of it when I was there with the bike. But my girlfriend went there last year for a MTB camp and they had a lot of trails to choose from. Also in the general area there are many other possibilities for mountain biking easily accessible. I have both the bike explorer and singletrail maps for the region and I would say there is no problem filling a few weeks there.    
The same goes for Interlacken, where you will still need to travel to get up to Lauterbrunen or Grindlewald to do some of the tours. I don't see any difference in either area.

This link lists all the rowing clubs in Switzerland.       
look under ""Clubs"" (ok that was obvious)   
Secondly I did some training with the following people (I had to before they would let me join the club). I'm not mentioning them for Commercial reasons but because the folk involved are current members of the Swiss rowing team so if you want additional training at your level maybe good to know about (both men and women). If you look under ""Unser Team"" you'll see their achievements maybe you have heard of them etc.       
For sure others on the Forum may have other contacts too.

The online shop is completely in English.   They have a very good selection.  They have an excellent (for CH) return and exchange policy and they have proven very helpful.   
This combination can be hard to find in specialist shops.

			Hi ya.   
Good to hear from you both! 
I have been interested in Tour du Dents du Midi since I climbed Cime de l'Est(Several years ago, it was hard as I was new here and I didn't know what I signed up for when my colleague planed this hike....). But are you climbing Haute Cime? Mmmm. Sounds really challenging...I would love to know the details. MAYBE I could be another nutter.lol    
I am up for any hikes. But not really sure about levels...I like easy hikes to challenging hikes. I haven't hiked much this summer yet, so I would like to start from easy ones.    
Not much on my mind at the moment, but since I did the planetery footpath in St.Luc last summer with friends, I have been thinking of climbing up to Bella Tola. Seems like nice hike up to 3000m for great view.   
I will post some ideas soon and see if anymore people is interested in.

4076	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Tour de France 2010: Two uphill finishes w/in 5km of Swiss borders	guest	4,155	24	null	null	"    The start on Sunday is the easy bit, see  . It actually starts in the community of Bois d'Amont, which is on the Swiss/French border on the road between La Cure and Le Sentier. After 10km they will pass right through the center of La Cure where you are staying, so you could just watch it from there.   
Saturday's stage finishes a couple km NE of Lamoura, see  . You are correct that it is not too close to La Cure. I doubt there is ever a bus running along that route. The best way to get there from La Cure would be by bike, or if you don't have one and don't want to walk then I would try hitch-hiking with all of the other cars that will be heading that way (or at least hitch-hike back at the end of the day). Since it is not a big town and many of the people heading to the finish area that day will stand somewhere along the climb instead of near the finish line itself, you should hopefully be able to get a pretty good spot not far from the finish line and within sight of the big-screen TV.   
For those of us who do have bikes and want to see Saturday's finishing climb (which is certainly the best place to go for Saturday's stage) then it is the road going from St Claude to Lamoura (which is the one that I was hoping it would be in the original posts in this thread when the vague details were first being announced). Here is the official profile:       
I'm still not sure whether the big guns are going to battle on this climb, or if they will all just watch each other and wait for Sunday to make their moves. Regardless of what the big boys do, there will certainly not be a sprint finish involving a big peloton, the main pack of finishers will probably not be very big (many of the sprinters may even get dropped on one of the five small categorized climbs that come earlier in the stage) and some people will be shooting for glory going up this climb, even if it is not the main contenders for the overall classification. I think there is a decent chance that a small breakaway that gets away early in the stage will survive and one of them will win the stage. That breakaway is likely to contain whoever has their eyes on the polka-dot jersey because there are quite a few mountain points to pick up on the climbs along the way. It would actually be a perfect stage for Jens Voigt to try to win, he does really well in breakaways on these medium-mountain stages. Unfortunately, he's probably going to have to stick with his team-mates Cancellara and A. Schleck and push the pace at the front of the main pack rather than going for personal glory.   
The big selection on the climb is likely to be made in first 5km because that is the part that is reasonably steep, which is between the towns of Rochefort and Septmoncel along the Gorges du Flumen. Above and below that part of the climb, there are several intersecting roads that may provide good access to the route even when the main course is closed.   
So my top picks for where to watch Saturday's stage would be:    
1) Somewhere along the steeper part of the road in the Gorges. If the big boys decide to light up the stage, then this is where it will happen, but that may be unlikely.   
2) In the village of Septmoncel - the village will probably have quite a lot of people in it all afternoon and will be a party atmosphere. Finding a cafe with a TV showing the earlier part of the race could be a great way to spend the afternoon (although many other people have probably had the same idea). By the time the riders arrive in Septmoncel, the steeper bit of road before will have them all spread out nicely so that you'll get a good look at many of them.    
3) In the final 1 or 2 km before the road flattens out in Lamoura. If there is still a group of riders together at the front of the race at this time then someone will make their final bid to escape and win the stage around here. If the big boys are still together at this point, then they will stay together until the end of the stage - the road is not steep enough and the finish not close enough to the top of the climb to make it worthwhile for them to attack each other - they will then decide to save their energy for Sunday's stage, where things are almost certainly going to come alive on the last climb.   
4) Near the finish line itself. There should be a big screen TV to watch the stage, plus you'll hopefully be able to get close enough to watch the prize ceremonies after the stage finishes.   
Timing: In Rochefort, the caravan is due at about 15:00, and the riders between 16:25 and 16:50. Times for the stage finish are 45 minutes after that. Note that the riders sometimes go super-fast or super-slow (for various reasons) and so they may arrive up to 30 minutes before or after the earliest and latest expected times. The speed of the caravan is somewhat adjusted for this so that there is always at least 45 minutes between the end of the caravan passing and the first riders passing.   
Anyone else got some good ideas?

			Hi all - I was just out yesterday with somebody who's been trying to get a group together as well.  We'll be meeting regularly on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 19h30 'at the three headed fountain next to the pedaloes in Ouchy, across the road from the Crepe restaurant. 
The running group is pretty new but the idea is to get Lausanne's runners together so that people can have a good run with good company. As the group grows we should be able to have a variety of speeds, distances and routes so there will be something for everyone.' 
If you need further info, feel free to send me a PM, otherwise I hope to see some of you on the upcoming runs!

Each of the refreshment stops had a trough to cool yourself. My hubby put a wet sponge under his cap which seemed to help. 
Saw quite a few with cramp, maybe worth trying taking magnesium if you think you might be one of those more likely to suffer from cramp and for gods sake don't ignore the warning signs of muscle twinging that sometimes occur before full on cramp.   
Of the four of us who did it i think we'd all recommend over estimating your finish time to get in the best start block and so reduce the chances of getting stuck behind slower runners on the single track sections, which can be frustrating as over taking isn't easy. 
A simple formular would be to add 30 mins to your normal half marathon time. A expected 3hr finish time puts you in the last/slowest block (5th), 2:45 in the 4th and 2.30 in the 3rd. In reality it took us all an hour longer than a flat course. 
If you want to be particularly competitive then starting near the front of your block and running the course before hand are good ideas. There are all sorts of tactics that could be deployed to this course.   
and lastly we stayed on and enjoyed the area (running and climbing) for the following week which was a splendid idea and highly recommended. 
other fantastic running routes are; 
Belap - Blatten vie Riederalp furka and the new-ish 124m suspension bridge. 
and Ried morel - fiescheralp via the panoramweg.   
both are quite long but  stunning and in a non race day you can just take your time, plus it was so nice to be high above the valley heat too.   
happy summer running

			What level of fitness are you at? And where in Zurich are you based?   
Good locations to run in and around Zurich are Uetliberg - from Albisrieden and Triemli - to Adliswil.    
Zuriberg from the Zoo to Witikon - up to the top of Dolder - with a plethora of paths.   
A little further out you have the woods from Zollikon to Kusnacht to Zollikerberg. And the Kusnacht Tobel (valley) is also a great run.   
I also run in Amden - which is an hour down the lake - and has more aggressive hills!

			If you know in which area you'll be living, then search for ""fc <area name>"" (eg, ""fc witikon"" for that area, or ""fc uster"", or whatever). Get in touch with the team via email, explain your situation, and go for it! When we were in Witikon we got an offer of a place on the team for our 8-y-o son, but the timing was impossible (he didn't go to the local school, so was out of synch ...). Trying again in our new place, hopefully the local team here has training we can get to!   
Was rather special at the Football Camp last summer, we had a trainer from FC Zürich leading the camp, and one of the junior trainers from GC Zürich (who used to play for Witikon) assisting. Great feeling, especially as the FCZ trainer brought along a couple of FCZ U-17s to help run the 'camp'. (sorry, if there are no tents then it's not a real camp!! Especially if you're only there a few hours a day for the week.).

			not ""dodgy"" sellers, but you get what you pay for.   
Mostly you'll find old bikes at low prices and rather OK bikes are ""standard"" prices. And there is a seller there (Re-Cycle ) who has very nice bikes at rather high but reasonable enough prices.   
The bikes are checked by the mechanics team before getting accepted to be put for sale in the velobörse, however this checkup is not in-depth.    
But you can assume that the bike is in OK conditions and is safe to use.   
Worse that could happen is that you end paying too much for a particular bike, ( being ""too much"" a relative concept )   
There is a team of mechanics to give advice about a bike, usually there is a long row of people waiting for the advice though.   
Tonight I am going with my friend to the Wintertur festival so I am not really sure if I could come early tomorrow.   
Anyway If I come it won't be for long, I am still looking for the elusive vintage Bianchi, but there is a very low probability I find it there anyway.

I am an ageing (45) mid grade rusty trad climber having spent too much time on southern sandstone, so am looking for someone of similar experience. 
I do not currently have much gear here, just a harness and a few crabs so will need to bring more with me, ideally looking for a climber with a lead kit and who knows the area. Also interested in climbing at the Basel wall. and odd weekends away

			Hello!   
I am visiting my friend in Zurich for 2 months.  Looking to climb (primarily bouldering, but open to everything else) with some other people.  Hoping to get some outdoor sessions - if anyone knows some good spots or is planning a trip, hit me up!  I've brought basic gear (shoes, chalk, harness) and camping equipment.     
Been climbing for a couple of years.  Travel has kept me away for a couple months; am climbing B3's at Gaswerk - think once I'm back in form I should be working on 4's?  Going to Minimum today.  Hope to hear back and eventually enjoy the outdoors when the weather is nice!!     
Cheers, 
Vincent

This was one of the great World Cup shocks and  most shocking of all  it's fully deserved. Spain did not create many clear chances and Switzerland, quite simply, did a number on them. one might bemoan their anti-football tactics but nobody could dispute how well those tactics were planned by their marvellous manager Ottmar Hitzfeld and executed by remarkable group of players.

			Hi there, we have been really keen members of a local David Lloyd: Swimming pool, tennis and gym under one roof. My son (8) is in the performance tennis group for his age, my daughter (6) is knocking at the door already, and we have just plenty of fun doing all these things together as a family. Now we are looking at moving back to Switzerland at the end of the year and have started investigating: plenty of tennis clubs in Zurich with junior sections; plenty of swimming pools; plenty of gyms - but no club that offers the package. What are people's views on this - aren't there any such clubs or have I just not looked hard enough? Thanks for all advice, in particular focused at (junior) tennis within good facilities in 'Greater' Zurich.

4137	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cycling tour 'out and back' from Zurich	Kark	1,458	15	Location: Ottawa Canada	22.02.2010, 19:08	" 
			
			Hey all,  The tour I was gathering info for with this thread so many weeks ago now is done now, so I thought rather than just disappear into the ether I'd touch base and offer an executive summary and thank you all again.   
The tour ended up covering a little less distance than I'd though initially but I did manage to tick off almost all the passes I'd set out to do and overall the trip was a smashing success!   
I started out from Zurich on the 31st heading south to Monza via Meiringen, and the Grimsell, Furka, Gotthard passes all which were open, though only the north (Hospental) side of the old cobbled Gotthard road was open. The other side being covered in snow. 
From Monza where my new friends at the   workshop were very welcoming helpfull and generous with their time I headed up to Lecco, Ghisallo and Bellagio to see the Madonna dei Ghisallo and nurse an aggravated knee with a couple easy days. 
Then a day spent getting up and east over to Tirano.   The route from Colico to Tirano being the only stretch I would look to avoid doing it again simply because it was boring as hell.  ..like stationary trainer miles. bleh. 
From Tirano the next day I headed up towards Bormio with Stelvio in mind but just could not ride  the mortirolo. not knowing when I'd next get a chance at it.. so up I went.  That was really hard. The first few km I wondered if I might wake up on my back with an oxygen mask and a crowd around me, but then I got used to the effort and the rest went really well if really slow. 
Back down to Grosio and on to Bormio and up Stelvio.  The Prato side of Stelvio was still closed, but I was so roached out by then I was actually relieved.  So, I headed back and down Umbrail to Mustair to call it a day.   That might be the hardest day I've ever spent on a bike. 
The following day, I headed back west via the Offen and Fluela passes to Davos and the next day just over to Klosters to be a tourist for a day before training it back to Zurich to prepare for coming home.   
Over the next week I'll be posting some pics and details of the ride at a blog in case it's of interest;     
Nevertheless, I'm very appreciative of the tips and links I was offered here and the other info gleaned as well.  You lot have an incredible country to explore.  A feast for the eyes, and the cycling / scenic opportunities are simply astounding.  I'm already formulating plans for another trip.     
..maybe with my 5&5 all-mountain bike to do overland passes. hmmm, ..would definitely call for a rotor size increase, but yeah. That could work..     
Anyway, 
Cheers! 
Mark

4138	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	road biking the (french side) big passes?	PTKate	713	1	Location: St Cergue, canton Vaud, CH	15.06.2010, 18:20	" 
			
			The passes in the Vaudoise and Fribourgoise Alps are all very nice, although I would call them medium-sized rather than ""big"" because they top out at   1400 to 1800 metres altitude.    
Col des Mosses is the most accessible but the least fun - the road up from Aigle is normally a bit too busy until you get past the Leysin and Diablerets turn-offs. Doing it from the other side is fine, because you do the busy part going downhill, at the same speed as the traffic, but then it is not that long or hard.    
Doing Col de la Croix from the Rhone valley is the longest climb in the region; take the road up from Bex because it is much quieter than the one from Ollon.   
The nicest climb I've done in the area, and probably the hardest (over 1100 m of climbing in 13 km) is just north of Col des Mosses. It doesn't even have a proper pass name, but is normally referred to as ""Les Agites"" as far as I can tell. It starts one village north of Aigle, called Yvorne, and goes up to a valley that contains a military area and a reservoir. You can then follow the road around the reservoir to get to the Les Mosses area, or another road that comes in above Leysin, or follow the road down the river to Montbovon (the top section of which is now only open to cyclists). However, you can't go through the military area between around 9am and 4pm on weekdays, except during their break during most of July and August (but I'm not clear on the exact time and date restrictions). There's also a tunnel near the top of the climb that has restrictions to make sure that traffic is only going in one direction at a time. See more details on   (I'm the one who wrote the description and submitted the statisctics for it   ), this is the profile graph from that site:      "	Posts: 376	Join Date: Jan 2007	Senior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 115 Times in 73 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Just wanted to let everyone know about some free fitness sessions that are being run over this summer on a Wed and Sat (sponsored by the Communes and insurance companies).    
Its called Urban training and its about using the city surroundings to keep fit. A bit like the bootcamp concept - so dips on benches, pushups in the park, lunges etc - but you can do it on your own or with some friends.    
All details are on the website -  
Here you need to subscribe and answer a few health related questions - all in French I'm afraid, but I managed with my basic french  Its limited to 20 participants and is run by a personal trainer.    
The workout is designed for beginners, so don't worry if your just getting started with your fitness, but also don't expect a full-on workout. You should at least come away with some new ideas.   
Please note:  I am not associated with the training, I just tried it the other day and thought some of you might be interested.  Happy training.

Its a really nice route, I did it from Illanz to Reichenau but there is also the possibility to start at Flims and ride down to the Rheinschlucht. I'd do this one if I was going to do it again.    
Its definitely worth doing, the scenery is great and there are some fun sections of trail along there too.

			not sure if this should go in the sports/activities thread, but anyway....   
for anyone planning on swimming in Switzerland,   is an interesting add-on to an EU report addressing bathing water quality in Switzerland.   
apparently, the quality is good, except towards the French side, there are a couple of red spots. This (kind of) follows larger trends in Europe where the quality of French bathing water does not meet mandatory values.     
the full report on all EU countries can be downloaded as a PDF from    
happy reading & swimming

			At 2.500 m they will hardly be yellow hiking paths but more likely red and white mountain hiking ones.   
If you actually mean, YOU have never got lost, that's fine. But I've temporarily missed the path quite a few times in my forty years of hiking here. And most people I know have too.   
I agree that it is fairly difficult to get completely lost in most regions, the paths are usually well-marked, but if the signs have been removed (the trees with the marking on are sometimes felled! or something has grown over the marking, or something is put in front of it; if the stripes are on a stone and it snows...  but in  mist without a map, a compass and an altimeter, it is really not that easy. Even here.

Get your old club to email or fax it through to you.      The process of getting your Migros Card operates with typical Swiss efficiency....give them your handicap cert, they will then invoice you, pay the invoice and they will send you the card in the post.   
Migros Golf are based in Otelfingen ( ) so call out there and they will give you the form and other information etc. Once you have the card you can logon to the Swiss Golf Network and book tee times ( ). I think that there are 7 Migros golf courses in total, but not absolutely sure about that.

If you're shipping from DE and paying Swiss MWSt and admin fees then it adds up. If you can just nip over the border then it's a different matter.    
There are also multiple Hollywood style racks available at decent prices in Germany. No doubt they are solid, functional and quality but they are quite agricultural compared to the more expensive alternatives. You pays your money and you takes your choice. For DH bikes, you are correct that solid heavy build is the key factor.

			No problem in Zürich. I used to go to work by roller-skates for years within the City. Most sidewalks are paved.    
There are a few zones you can't do with skates (Niederdorf, cobblestone and some parts beside the lake (some gravel), but normally not a problem at all for experienced skaters. As mentioned there is also the night skate on monday, different routes and a lot of people, some streets closed for traffic during the event.   
Fall and winter you'll find it hard to skate...

			The slopes are not the problem - it's the lifts!   I think a lot of places do their lift and cable-railway 'overhauls' in late October and skiing may start in November - it does depend on the snow situation of course though and some don't start until December anyway. Even for the artificial stuff they need fairly low temperatures.

			best bet for beginner wakeboarding is the cable system at estavayer-le-lac on lake neuchatel. it's probably the cheapest and easiest way to learn.        
there's also a wakeboarding boat club that does wakeboarding just in front of the olympic park in ouchy. just walk the lake road to the far east end of the park and you will see a sign at the water's edge. not cheap tho!

			My average speed is around 30 Kmh reaching around 45 Kmh on flat areas, but I doubt I could keep as high during more than 2-3 hours,    
I went once with some girls who wanted to do the lake tour.   
I had to wait for them as they rolled at under than 20 Kmh average.   
There were not climbs on the Geneva-Lausanne-section, I guess maybe there would be some at montreaux, and by experience, the bike paths on the french side are less good than the swiss and in some places there is no bike path and you have to cross the french towns sometimes with a lot of traffic, usually many french cars that come back from Geneva.   
When we reached Lausanne ( from Geneva ) after more than 3 hours then they gave up and decided to go back by train  ....

			The final Stage of the 2010 Giro is in Verona, an individual time trial on the 30th of May, a Sunday.   
I will go to watch it, and though that maybe other cycling fans from here could like to join ?   
The train trip is 6 hours  and cost CHF 172- roundtrip when you have the half tax according to the SBB web site, leaving at 07:09 from Zürich HB track 7 arriving at Verona at 1pm.   
Just in time for the TT, it starts at 2pm and the last man should be arriving at 5:40 pm   
A possibility could be if we are several to go by car, sharing the trip expenses.   
Any takers ?

			Just a short note: the fitness training is good, and extremely valuable - part of the success of the Rugby team is this fitness training, and they've been national champions for most of the past 25 years. They're understanding if you have trouble 'keeping up', as I sometimes do, but the important thing is to be in there and moving!   
So, for your first visit, rock up about 20:40 so you can be introduced to the equipment and some concepts ... but after that it's great to get into the water right on 20:00! Most of us (hockey players) do get into the warm-up, but some have jobs with late meetings that hold them up - part of the joy of working in companies that sprawl across time zones!

			Stretching *after* running is the current wisdom these days. It's argued that your muscles have warmed up and are looser post-exercise and so you'll not only be able to stretch easier, you'll be stretching them further than if you were cold.

			I moved to Wil between Winterthur and St Gallen a few months ago, I am looking for people to ride with in the area. My German is limited, I can say hello and order a beer at the moment but thats about it.   
I ride both Road and MTB Single track. I would be keen to meet up with anybody for regular rides or if anyone knows of a club in the area to join up too that would be great...

4241	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Bike trip May 13-16	mars	529	0	Location: Zurich	06.05.2010, 15:48	" 
			
			Hi all,  
I am planning a 2-3 days biking trip between May 13-May 16 with low grade of technical difficulty, with a level of fitness of 3/5, part of it on road and part of it off-road. We are perfecting a route now where the other principle, besides it being not a technically difficult ride, is to enjoy the great views of lakes and mountains in Switzerland     
Would like to know if there are people interested in joining. I will then share more details about the route.  
I know May 13 is just around the corner but if I would have planned this trip earlier I wouldn't have been myself..  I will book the hotels before the weekend ends so if you want to join, let me know.

  Sounds really good, where do you climb? I am running tomorrow with Grimmus if you are interested at around 6, but I would love to climb sometime.  
What kind of climbing do you do, and when do you usually go? 
looking forward to it!

			I've been running with Care Vevey Athletisme for nearly two years (although I struggle to get along to their winter runs). Their website with lots of information is   . I run with the second ""groupe hors stade"" which meets twice a week - Mondays up near Mont Pelerin and Thursdays in St Legier. The Monday run is longer and harder - usually about 75 minutes which includes around 15 to 20 minutes of reps. Each week we head out in a different direction, and it's nice to get to know lots of different paths and the scenery is obviously lovely! The group is predominantly female and quite friendly - I'm the only non-swiss runner, so conversations etc are all in French. If you're interested, the details for contacts are on the website. Unfortunately, I can't go for the next few weeks due to holidays and lack of childcare, but should be around a bit more towards the end of the month.

Pyros	1,828	2	Location: Geneva	04.05.2010, 12:25	   Hello Ben     Sorry, I’m not familiar with Korfball, so I can only give you some directions to ask further…It’s not the same apparently, but Korbball is similar and is played in many gymnastic clubs in Switzerland (there is also a league for this I believe).     So maybe you could contact the gymnastics association (Turnverband),  explain your situation and ask if they can refer you to the right person in Geneva (if the answer does not come up here). They are involved in many not so popular sports.      Korbball and Swiss Gymnastic Association (Turnverband) Tamara Zuber      Or maybe better you could contact the „department for sports“ of Geneva    Contact details are on the  right  of the page (DIP – Coordination du Sport).     Or if you want to play netball, EF of course is the source       Hope you will find your answers and have a good move to Geneva!

			I was used to riding a mountain bike when I was in Australia, but I'd really like to get a road bike for riding to work this summer in Zurich. I don't see myself doing massive outdoor mountain biking tours so it seems like the road bike is the best option. Something light to get over the hill between Orelikon and Zurichsee. Probably looking at 300CHF tops although I know that im in Switzerland so I guess I can stretch it a bit. Any suggestions?

			Sounds similiar to the last stage of the Panorama Bike, from Les Paccots to Montreux, plus a bit extra. I was thinking of the Charmey to Les Paccots stage, past Gruyere, Moleson etc. I know the area pretty well and the scenery is stunning. Couple of longish climbs, but nothing I probably couldn't handle. Be interesting to cycle along something I might have skiied down.

			The lake road obviously gets you there fastest and easiest; the views are still very nice and the road is plenty wide enough so that the high traffic volume is not really a problem. The wine road makes for a nice ride with even better scenery, but is still reasonably busy in sections (I use the road going through Villars-sous-Yens and Lully to do the bit between Morges and Aubonne). If you want a real workout then go up Col de la Givrine from Nyon, into the Vallee du Joux, then back over Col du Marchairuz.

also, my husband is swiss and we live in the u.s. he loved to mtn. bike in switzerland and regularly laments about how biking in the u.s. is just not the same as in switzerland. granted, you might throw yourself into your biking and miss out on other sports, but depending on where you live in the u.s., you may not ever experience the kind of cycling you'd find in switzerland.

			Hi! 
I am a 37 year old Swiss 'girl' looking for English speaking people to join me for an inline tour in the Bern area every now and then. I am not precisely a racer, I simply would like to have fun while exercising. You need to improve your German, I need to hone my English speaking skills - so why don't you drop me a line?  
Looking forward to your answers!

4292	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Road Bike fit, getting rid of pain	Rahul	4,145	14	Location: zurich	09.07.2008, 12:07	" 
			
			What is all this about back ache and frame sizes etc?   
Once you have been in the saddle for four hours, your back will ache. Riding position is not your normal posture unless you are born something like Neanderthal Man.   
If you have raced competatively, you will know that you will actually often move your body along your saddle forward or back an inch to change slightly the muscles you use as you would pull up on your toe straps as opposed to pushing down on your pedals to relieve your muscles.   
Measuring all your body dimensions and using some table is not going to mean it is the correct frame, though might help.  Some of us have more rounded shoulders especially when cycling in a crouched position so I don't think all these measurements mean that much.   
The pain generally goes the more riding you do. perhaps you have not been on your bike for a while.   
I went out on an old mountain bike for the first time in two years and only rode 1.5 hours along the canal tow path for two days in a row (no suspension as that is for wimps) and I have had a back ache for the last three days so badly that I have been walking around like Neanerthal Man. I just put this down to my body not being used to it (plus back accident in 1998) and I am pretty convinced that if I had continued riding every day I would be OK.

			Hi guys, not sure how I missed this thread!    
I'm rowing with SN de Genève, and did the Thalwil and HoRR races with them over the last month. Would be great to catch up with any fellow anglophones if you are racing at the rest of the summer regattas...   
Baden were not bad last year - we had a few races against them. Seeclub beat us at Thalwil but they didn't race HoRR. They beat us in the 4- last summer at Swiss Champs, but I think that was basically the Swiss lightweight squad boat, so not sure if those guys will be making an 8+ this year.   
Cheers, 
GS

			Hello all.   
I'm quite happy to see the weather starting to make a turn for the better!  It seems that it's about that time to find some soccer...   
Anyone have any leads on pickup soccer or recreational teams?  Maybe anyone who has the need for an extra player?  I have some Dutch heritage so you know that means I have to have a little skill at least  ;-)   
Since moving from California last November, it's been refreshing to live in a place where you can actually follow some soccer on TV!  It's got me quite pumped so I'd love to get back on the pitch!   
I live in Bern city and have a pretty flexible schedule so I would love to hear some input.   
Thanks,    
Remko

			Hi:   
You can always try the Felix Buhler stores; they are all over Switzerland. Check out their website    
Now for my rant since I just got back from riding my beautiful Friesian horse and am just perplexed:   
For the OP, why would you even think of putting the family pet on the menu for dinner?    
Anyone who has any respect and feeling for these beautiful animals would never eat them and you actually want to ride one? WHY? Next time you go riding, think about how they are slaughtered (yes, I am white meat vegetarian and I will not compare a chicken's brain to a horse's OK?)   
Some countries are now starting to ban horsemeat and my horses' passport (yes they do have one for crossing borders) state the new EU law that Friesians cannot be used for horsemeat.   
You may go on how cows are sacred, dogs are specialties in other countries blah blah blah, but a horse should NOT be used as meat. The really ironic thing is that most horse meat is from the US and they are brokendown / drugged up rejects from the track that are sent to the killers. You really want to eat that ""good"" meat?

You are unlikely to need it if you have an accident on the slopes as they (rescue) can usually get to you quickly. But if you are seriously stuck somewhere less accessible, and could be out for more than a few hours lying still (i.e. due to injury) or worse a night, then it could mean the difference between surviving and not.

 I was a very good player some years ago. Not playing for about 5 years and putting on weight   made me not to take up your request. Hope you find one soon. Its a great sport!!

			Hiya Kleine, thanks for your post. Basically what Fraser said. We may well start the ZH Wednesday Evening Jogging group again shortly, it's still a little dark out there in the evenings.    
I can also let you know when we plan on running some Greifensee or ZH Airport training runs. Both of these routes are just over 17 clicks, and flat. In the summer we go a little nuts and run up the Uetliberg, because it's there, and we can.   
Can you PM your details if you want to join our runs and I'll let you know when we plan on going?

			I asked around at work for good gyms to join (I just moved to Zurich), and I work with several alums from ETHZ. They told me that this is a gym for academics in this city. They gave me the contact information, I called in yesterday and they confirmed that I could get membership just by showing them I have a University degree and that I am here in Zurich legally.   
The lady on the phone was a little unclear about the University degree part. Apparently the system in much of Europe (other than UK) is unlike the 4 year College + Graduate School system I am used to. She did enquire as to the exact nature of my degrees, including the institutions before giving me any details. She told me that I was eligible, and even sent me the forms!   
May be worth calling them at 1-632-42-10 before you go.

Find most gym's are designed with the masses in mind. Not a problem really just means more reps.

4346	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	New to Skiing - the nightmare	leylak	7,468	75	Location: Zurich	29.01.2007, 12:58	"       Ski beginners should ALWAYS start with proper lessons, preferably one-on-one.  You'll learn nothing useful from a friend/relative and will both end up being really frustrated.   
    It's never too late to learn - I started skiing at 28.  However, the earlier the better and you can see the difference with the skiiers who leaned as kids.   
   Flumserberg is a good place to learn - it has a quite large nursery area with a couple of different runs that you can do once you have had a couple of hours tuition.  There's a good ski school there with English-speaking instructors available.

We had a couple of lessons from one of the instructors at the Murren Ski School called Jens, who was excellent, and spoke fluent English, Italian, German, Dutch... You can also hire telemark skis and boots from the Salomon centre which is just by the Schilthornbahn gondola station.

			I was riding a 2006 Litespeed Vortex (6/4 Ti frame) and I bought a 99 Merlin ti frame (prior to the Litespeed purchase of Merlin) off eBay for $500 - it was going to be my rain bike.  I outfitted it with an old Ultegra group and found that my 7 year old ti frame with straight seat stays rode better then the new Litespeed that had bent seat stays and all sorts of fancy shaped tubes.  Then, to confirm the ride, I took a Serotta for test rides, and I became an acolyte of old ti bikes. So, I updated the group on the Merlin to a mixed Campy group.     
I haven't ridden a Moots, but it's sort of my holy grail of bikes.  But, I certainly understand the cost issue.  You might be able to pick up a vintage Merlin off eBay and build it up.  If you do, make sure it has Merlin headtube badge and Merlin stamped on the drop - a lot of people have taken Ti Sports frames and put Merlin decals on them, and tried to pass them off as vintage Merlins.     
You can strip all the decals off the merlin, buy a box of Scotch Brite pads, and after a few hours of polishing, you can have a brand new brushed ti finish.     
Enjoy finding that new bike - after riding, buying bikes has to be my favorite sport.

My favourite is the amphipod is it's shaped for your hand and leaks the least but my overall preference is to use a waist belt for short-ish runs and rucsac for longer.

			I saw Dr Luthi there very recently. I was very happy. When I described my injury he examined my foot very thouroughly and knew exactly where the pain would be.

			Thanks for posting this Fiola -- I slack on the promotion of this event since we don't try to bring in too big a crowd (can't imagine keeping tabs on too big a group racing through some of the places we'll go!).   
As for the entry fee, for 3 days of stage racing including transit (trains etc each day), Fri evening meal and Sun post-race apero, tracking beacons and live website, technical base layer, all your maps etc . . . it's very reasonable.  For those with a Swiss halbtax or GA, we can reduce the entrance fee substantially so get in touch if you're curious.   
Here are some pics previewing the course:  .

			Hiya, 
I have never been skiing, and i would like to give it a try(about time)...I am thinking of taking private lessons as they are price worthy and easier to grasp. My friends have tried group lessons(5 people) and its unrealistic, its always waiting around for the instructor since hes busy attending other beginners...so i though its best to take few private lessons if i really want to learn to ski. 
I am thinking of going on the weekends in March, sort of a continuos effort. please email me if anyone is interested ..the prices i looked up were 135 for 2 people in villars/saas-fe/hochy brig.. so i would say 3 people at the most to get the most out of it.. i have heard villars and saas fe are the best ski resorts for ski virgins... 
thanks and hope to hear soon... 
chaya

			I think this is the most recent thread with cross-country (nordic) related skiing info (last posts in December, although it extends back a couple of years). Since the Snowsports 2009/10 is primarily focused with the gravity-assisted type of skiing (not that there is anything wrong with that...) I was wondering (would like to propose) if a separate sticky could be made for nordic skiing information (say reviews of trails, links to snow conditions, where to rent/buy gear in Switzerland etc. etc.). It seems that it gets mixed in and is tough to find at times, but participation seems to be increasing both on EF and amongst the general population. Of course, the name of the thread would need to be changed and I'm not sure if that can happen or not (I'm rather new to the possibilities of the internet). So perhaps someone could advise me if this idea is not so prudent and I can begin a new thread and try to collect as much of the info from other posts as possible.   
I was personally out today at the trails in   and it was fantastic. It took about 2.5 hours from Zürich each way and requires paying an additional 8 CHF fare (return) for the Postauto from Sarnen up the hill. There were about 25 km of trails and they have both skating and classic, although for the most part these are separated from each other (which was nice). The nicest part was that the trails wind in and out of wooded areas a lot more than both Einsiedeln or Rothenthurm. There was also a lot of nice terrain change (more hills and dips). If you don't mind the time it take to get there then it is a great option.   
So I'm putting out a call for all of the other nordic skiers to throw out their favourite sports. It would be great to have a list of recommendations here from other English speaking folks.   
Please let me know if I should make a new thread and start accumulating info there.

I bought a Fox air-can service kit locally and it was more than twice as expensive as the UK. Next time I asked the guy at the shop to perform the service and he charged me the same price for the parts and the labour as he had previously charged for the parts only. This time the price was comparable to what I would pay in the UK.

			Pay-per-use gyms tend to be pricey - you might find it cheaper in the end to stump up for a 6 month membership (even if you're only here for 3)   
Last time I checked was the Migros Fitness Park, in 2007 admittedly, but that was 30chf per visit for non-members.   
Midweek 5-a-side, I'm not sure about.  There used to be a Sunday 5-a-side kickabout organised on here, as well as   which is likely to be busy again once the weather turns the corner, but as for midweek stuff I'm not aware of any.   
Depending where you're working, the company might arrange something - I know mine does.

			If there is a cross-country ski racing club near you it might be worth inquiring there to see if they know of anyone who might be interested in selling some of their kit. Racers have a (rather expensive) habit of constantly upgrading their equipment, and it's not unusual that you can score a set of relatively new skis/bindings/boots in almost mint condition for an excellent price if you know who to ask.   
Given the relatively delicate nature of poles they are the one thing I'd make an effort to buy new. But I'd still wait until the end of the season to score some deals.   
HM   
PS-If you really do think that you're in this for the long haul, make sure you get skis that are appropriate for your height/weight/skill level. Long skis are harder to handle, so go for something shorter and with a relatively high camber (i.e. amount of flex) to make things easier.   
PPS-Zimmo's suggestion of season rentals is also excellent if you think you'll only be out a few times a season.

4397	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	How much should custom ski boots cost?	hemflit	5,602	22	Location: Zurich	30.01.2010, 19:30	" 
			
			Hey folks, thanks a lot for your responses! It's a relief to have a more complete picture, too.   
To answer a couple of the questions that came up -   
What the man did was essentially 1) take a stock boot, throw away its liner (well, not literally) and expand part of the shell using heat and a machine; 2) make a new foam-injected liner molded to my foot; and 3) make a supporting whatchamacallit inner-sole thing. All this based on some serious measurements (""stand on this computerized pressure plate... now make this motion...""). He also promised to correct the fit for free if anything was wrong with it - not only this season, but in a few years too, if needed.   
Normally, with a modicum of luck with rental boots, I used to easily ski for one day, a second day would become an annoyance, and a third day just too much trouble to be worth it. So short Saturday+Sunday ski weekends were quite doable, but real ski holidays would have been a waste of time. We'll see how I fare now in about 12 days.   
If anyone's interested, this is the place where I had it done:  . Though again with the caveat that I haven't yet tested the boots out for real, I can only say all the best about it.   
(Please be nice to me, and if you ever talk to him, DON'T mention me as a customer who was surprised by the price. It's a very easy kind of thing to misinterpret, and I don't want him thinking I had a complaint, because I didn't.)

4398	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	St Moritz or Davos for ski trip and where??	JoD	4,524	6	Location: Lausanne	17.02.2010, 12:58	" 
			
			Both resorts are spread out into different areas. St, Moritz had Corvatsch, Corviglia, Lagalp and Diavolezza. The two main areas are Corviglia which can be accessed by funicilar from the town itself, or by Gondola from Celerina. Corvatsch is a bus trip away down by Celerina. I would not stay in St, Moritz itself its over rated and over priced. Celerina or Pontrasina offer much better value for money and a more authentic experience.    
Davos/Klosters is also a resort with many areas. Parsenn is the main area which can be accessed from both Davos and Klosters. Jakobshorn is the next largest area and is accessed by cable car from Davos-Platz. The other areas, Rinnerhorn, Pischa and Madrisa are all a bus ride from either Davos or Klosters.    
Davos is a little closer for you then St. Moritz, but I personally don't find the town as nice as the towns like Celerina etc. Klosters is quite a nice town to stay in, in the Davos/Klosters resort, but also a bit more exclusive and expensive.    
In terms of variety of terrain for skiing both resorts offer a lot of choice. I find the towns in the Engadin valley a little more charming then those around Davos, but I don't think you can go wrong with either place.

It just depends how much is too much. When I sink in up to my knees (often if the surface is partly frozen the snow 'gives way' quite suddenly) I find walking to be too much like hard work! So I prefer to use snow shoes and sink in a lot less.     Quote: Niranjan      BTW: why should ""the snowshoe users may not be happy when winter hikers make great holes with their walking boots."" How does it bother them           If several hikers make large, deep holes close together, the snowshoes sink in at quite an angle instead of lying flat on the snow. The path being only two snow shoes broad, to avoid this hole, I have to go into the deep snow beside the track. The first person up makes the track in the deep snow of course, but if I can follow someone else, I do. This reasoning probably won't satisfy you, but don't forget that not all of us are young fit males! I suggest we continue this discussion when you are nearer my age - say in thirty-five years time!

			Hi there.  Is anyone planning on going sledging this weekend near Zurich?  We are looking to go somewhere in the area, have never been, and are looking for a good place to go.  Lots of websites are in German and our language skills are still a work in progress.  If you are going, we'd be interested in tagging along...     
Thanks for your help!

			Was looking forward to maybe sitting in a cool pub watching some winter olympics action (I just found out they actually have an olympics in winter) on saturday night in Zurich and the usual English/Irish/Australian/seppo/Afrodenonesian pubs are getting a little tiresome. Anyone got any tips for a nice, decent sports-watching pub in Zurich?    
I've been recommended the News bar next to HB by a workmate, but she said that there's not too many places to sit and its always packed. Wouldn't mind a place that had some relatively cheap beers too....(ok i might be asking a bit there  )

			Hi there Billy no mates,   
I've just arrived in Baden and have decided to learn to snowboard. I am in a similar situation, i.e. no buddies as of yet.   
I am an intermediate skier but am trying boarding because it presents a new challenge. I had my first go last weekend and once my bruises have healed I will be heading to Davos to tackle some bigger slopes. I'll be going this Saturday 13th Feb and have a big estate car. I'd be looking to share the cost of the deisel and some tales of near misses after a good day on the slopes if you are interested.   
If you can be in a convenient location for me to pick you up on the way then you are welcome to come along.   
Cheers,

4426	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	[Oerlikon (ZH) or nearby]Anyone swimming?	erin	3,462	27	Location: Bern	09.03.2008, 23:54	" 
			
			Hi swimming adepts, 
I am new to this forum. I have been swimming on national and European level before I decided that combining studies and serious sports is just too much in the Netherlands. So I quit. Ever since, I have tried a few times to pick up swimming, but swimming alone is not the most exciting thing to do.  
So Erin, I am interested to meet up for swimming as it's just not as easy to give up after 2K.  
I have tried to swim in Oerlikon, mostly between 7 and 8, but in the tempo lanes, there seem to be some people that definitely don't belong there, but a few lanes further. (Besides the fact that many just push off the wall, just before I'd like to make a turn, while there would be plenty of space behind me). So perhaps if it's a few of us, things get streamlined a bit more. 
I'm not sure how often you'd like to team up, but twice a week would definitely be feasible.

Having Göschenen as the destination rather than Andermatt did seem rather odd.   
Sounds like you got virtually identical weather to when I visited over Christmas. The lift operators were advising that it was pointless taking the lift to the top station due to the white-out at that time. That made it very busy at the middle station.

4444	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Where do the Swiss Romands prefer to ski? - Survey results	sojoh	1,023	4	Location: Vaud	02.02.2010, 16:04	"    Eire, you're right that resorts are more touristic, but that's because they had to have a certain number of hotel beds, be equipped to transport a certain number of skiers, and have a certain number of guests who spend the night every season.  The magazine gives a very detailed explanation about how the survey was conducted.    
I agree that the quality of skiing can be better at the less well known resorts. It can also be considerably less expensive. I think that we paid Sfr. 58 at Villars on Saturday and Sfr. 43 at les Crosets on Sunday.    
I just thought that I would post the results  on EF to help people who may be trying to figure out where to go skiing in the French part because there aren't as many suggestions as for the German part of Switzerland.

Are you thinking of joining Arena225 in Tiefenbrunnen?    
I'll might take out a one month subscription starting this weekend. I think it's 190CHF  - a little pricey but 4 or 5 sessions a week would make it worth it.   
Silhouette in Theatrestrasse could be a better option (within walking distance of Stedelhofen), but I don't know what it's like or what the monthly rate might be.

1- Get to resort 
2 - Drink 
3 - Get boots and skis 
4 - Drink 
5 - Hit the slopes, pick yourself up 
6 - Get boots and skis on 
7 - Find top of mountain with hardest black run 
8 - Have a nip of something to fortify yourself 
9 - Point skis downhill and pretend to ski 
10 - repeat to 7-9 to end of day 
11 - Get drunk in bar afterwards 
12 - Repeat 7-11 to end of holiday       
Living in CH has taught me to ski properly...   But for those who ski once a year on a package holiday, this is their MO.

4472	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Looking for a personal trainer in Zurich	GoHawks211	3,454	2	Location: Zurich	13.01.2010, 02:24	" 
			
			Hi guys,   
am a personal trainer from Zurich I have just seen your dialogue and have some information which might help additionally. This is a good recommendation with the sand bags (= plyometric training with additional weight). 
But I would recommend not to train plyometrics every day and not with the same intensity. 
If you combine strenght training with plyometric training (using stretch-shortening cycle with jump serials, power moves etc.) you will have best results. A weekly shedule could look like this -  
it is not recommendable to traing plyo and strenght training for same muscle group on the same day to prevent inuries.     
strength legs low int. + upper body high int plyo     
 upper body high intensity strenght + legs low intensity plyo     
rest     
legs high int. strength + upper body low int plyo     
upper body low int. strength + legs high int. plyo   
Also, work on jumping and landing technique with balance and coordination training ( e.g. balance or squats on instable surfaces like a rolled mat or an aero step) and train on proper surface, preferably shock absorbing like grass, rubber mats or suspended floor.   
hope it helps, 
have a good day,    
Jens Baltrusch

Either that or I'm looking for a running partner/s who fancy meeting up now and again. I ran my first marathon at Lausanne last October and have done a small number of half-marathons, I don't have a set routine, but it tends to be a long run on the weekend (between 20-35km), but during the week it can be shorter runs (between 5-15km).   
Mince pies, beer, wine, xmas and fractured elbow, means I need to start training again   
I'm no athlete, equally I could try to help you train if you are looking to achieve your first half-marathon/marathon, I'm not a personal either, just a 31 year old graphic designer who likes to run...

As for backpacks, you might hear some recommendations such as Salomon vs. Raidlight, bottles vs. bladder, backpack vs. waist pack etc. Ultimately though, it is purely a matter of individual preference, running style, race needs etc. just like shoes.    
If you are thinking of using it in flat city marathons, probably a waist belt pack with a large pouch should be ideal because the waist is the most stable part while running.    
For longer mountain races where you need to carry a lot more gear, a backpack may be required.   
Not seen a good selection in Zurich; buying online may be a good option which you can check through the manufacturers' websites. Either way, as you already know a bobbing backpack can be such a kill-joy even if you don't get chaffed skin, so I hope you find one that your body likes soon   "	Posts: 162	Join Date: Mar 2008	Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 33 Times in 19 Posts	made some interesting contributions

But you are correct you can get a Post Auto from Chur to the talstation for the Rothorn Gondela. The Rothorn Gondela station is on the Rothorn side of the pistemap about half way along the length of Heidsee. You can buy your ticket there and then take the local bus to any of the other entry points to the mountain. I recommend Parpan or Fadail. Alternatively if you want to get on the mountain quicker... I am pretty sure it is possible to get off the bus in Churwalden buy your ticket there and then take the lift up towards Statzerhorn directly from Churwalden. This should save you about 15 to 30 minutes depending on ques and waiting time for the sports bus at the Rothornbahn.   
It is possible to ski/board from anywhere on one side of the valley to the other. but my personal recommendation (particularly if you snowboard) is the are between the Statzerhorn and Scalottas lifts. There are plenty of varied pistes here for all levels, the traverses are well enough constructed that you don't always have to be on one edge as a snowboarder and there is a reasonably possibility for nipping off between the pistes in search of some powder.

There is a seat lift and a pull lift there. The pull lift has a slightly flatter slope then the seat lift, but the seat lift will be a touch easier to use when you are learning to snowboard.

			Did you check alternative option of getting marked down gear from last year e.g. Migros, Oschner? There are few threads on the EF explaining were the members bought their equipment from. Perhaps not advice that you might be seeking for, but it also might be worth trying a few different models available from local suppliers e.g. Intersport at least to get an idea what exactely fits you as far as ski boots comfort, right ski length and binding type are concerned... just the thought.

			Think your best bet is to stay on or near the lake, run direction Paudex, Pully, Lutry and back, staying on the main route national road.  Pretty well lit up.   
I used to run Pully all the way to the track of the Lausanne Uni and back, by way of the pedestrian quai from Pully to the Quai d'Ouchy, where the Parc de Denantou begins.   
A little tricky in places, esp with a flashlight ('torch' for my English cousins), but on a full moon there is no better place to run next to the lake.  Absolutely magic.   
Best

			Hi Tim,   
I row in Geneva, but have come across quite a few of the people from Lausanne (there are actually two clubs in Lausanne -   and  ) and also from Neuchatel.   
Have you rowed before, or are you looking for beginner courses?   
If you are interested I can put you in touch with the coaches at RC Lausanne and at Neuchatel.

			I'm a big fan of Les Diablerets. The train ride into it is amazing if there has been recent snow. For novelty there is also Glacier 3000 nearby - go there if the weather is clear for the view.   
Verbier is another good bet - it's a major international ski resort. Buy the 4 valleys ticket and go all the way up to Mt Fort, for the view more than for the skiing.   
Have fun.

4507	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Article on Switzerland's National Bike Routes on major UK cycling website	guest	1,856	0	null	null	" 
			
			An article on "" "" has just been posted on BikeRadar.com, a major UK-based cycling website, which is run by the publishers of several cycling magazines in the UK (e.g., Cycling Plus, Mountain Biking UK). They seem to love the whole route network and the services offered to cyclists here. In fact, the article almost sounds like it was written by the tourist office (which is unusual because that site is usually very objective and doesn't mind being critical). There are a few things that I think could be improved about the national bike routes, but I guess when you put it into the perspective of what is offered in other countries like the UK, then it is idyllic.   
They also posted a nice photo gallery of pictures taken while riding in Switzerland, here are a couple of nice ones:           
BTW, it is not too cold to ride right now - I just did over 100km yesterday in temperatures between 0 and 4 C; just get the right clothing and you will be fine (if you're riding on the road, then a bike that can take slightly wider tires and full fenders also helps). This is a beautiful country to go cycling in, even in the winter   "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			Makes a lot of sense but consider finding something with releasable bindings. With the fixed bindings you can still put a lot of force on your knees if you take a tumble even with only 1m skis.

I have been telemark skiing for a couple of years and I'm hoping to do some back-country skiing day tours and a perhaps a couple muli-day trips while I am here. I am an expert in alpine skiing, but left those skis at home in Canada in favour of my telemark gear. I also have x-country skis with me as well for more flat terrain.   
I'd be happy to hear from anyone who would like to meet up for an outing.

			Since I spend a lot of time in Zermatt, I thought it would be fun to meet some local people.  I'm 27 years old, male, and enjoy many sports.   
I'll be there next starting this Saturday for about a week.  Planning to do lots of snowboarding. I'm fairly advanced on the snowboard and can definitely make it down any official slope at a good speed. I also like to go in the powder whenever possible.   
I'm American, but I've lived in Zürich for the last 4 years to study at the ETH. Now that's finished and I plan to stay in Switzerland permanently. I'll start a new job in January.   
It would be great to meet anyone who's interested in hanging out, either on or off the slopes. Here's a link to my Facebook profile:  . I'll check my messages while I'm there also. Best way to contact me would be to send me a message on Facebook, ideally including your mobile number.   
Please feel free to forward this message to any friends who might be in Zermatt next week too.   
Cheers, 
Bobby

			Hi,   
Has anyone done the PADI Nitrox course?   
On the PADI website, you can do 'elearning' for this course, but they charge $195 for the course.   
Is there really that much to it?   
I have the PADI AOW.   
From my undestanding for Nitrox, the big thing is to learn the new tables in order that you can work out your time between dives etc...

3 months is 500 CHF, 1 year is 1000...this is supposedly a special offer, but for as long as myself and my girlfriend have been here (a year and a half) it has been the same.   
We live in Versoix and my girlfriend has got into a situation whereby she has to renew her membership with Silhouette in Mies even though she doesn't want to (contractual thing). This means that she will have either a 3 month or 1 year membership which she doesn't want to lose the full amount on, so she is willing to sell it on for 300 (three months) or 800 (the full year) if you, or anybody else, are interested.   
The manager at the gym said this is a perfectly acceptable thing to do, the membership can be officially transferred. She has not yet confirmed which length membership she will take, as she has been looking for someone to transfer it to first, so anyone willing to take it will get the full term of the membership, probably starting from mid-January/beginning of February, which is the time limit she has been given to renew.   
If anyone is interested please post on here, email on either of the following addresses or call her mobile. Maria Cole - 0798629433:      "	Posts: 4	Join Date: Nov 2006	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			you can have a good fit for your boots in the city.   
there are 3 ways to have your boot fitted:  
1- the insole, it's heat fitted and costs about 90 CHF. it takes 15-20'.  no need to go to a ski resort for that.  
2- heat or pressure fitting the shell. Usually done for free when you buy the boot at the store. Takes some time (overnight clamping for pressure fit) and sometimes a few visits, so it's better to have a shop closeby. 
3- inner shoe fitting. The inner shoe is replaced by a special one filled at the shop with foam. Costs from 250-300 CHF. Is not a precision technology, and requires a good artisan, so it might (or might not) take back and forth testing. A skilled artisan for this job is extremely difficult to find. But the mainstream bootfitters such as Stöckli, in St. Légier, do the job well enough.    
Phone Aubert sports, Schaefer sport, Yosemite or Passe-Montagne (excellent for telemark) to check if they do one or the other of these fits.

However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish.

You can get more info here:   In order to enter the competitive tennis and get some points in classification, you need a licence CHF60 a year (2 x CHF30 summer and winter season). This is usually organized by club which you join in April/May, but it is too late for that now and you need to wait for the next season to start. What you can do is apply for such licence from   anytime of the year.   
The amateur torurnaments are played all year round and the leagues are played only in summer season. It is usually a draw with Tableau set for seeded and unseeded players. If there are less than 4 players they make sort of Round Robin to play against one another, but only when number of players who entered is too small. In league the captain decides who plays against whom in home/visitor team.   
Pricewise, IMHO the tourneys are quite costly between CHF70-CHF80 (winter on indoor carpet) and CHF50-CHF60 (summer on clay court).

			Hi all   
I would like to spend some weekends with snowboarding, but I don't have any equipment or clothes for this. I'm in Swiss only till end of December so I don't want to spend lots of money on this. I found several links with equipment rentals in Zurich, but I didn't find information about clothes. Could you tell me where I can buy cheap jacket/pants/gloves/glasses or rent them for a weekend or so? And how much will this cost?   
Thanks in advance, 
Vladimir

			I've read the several threads on gyms and know of a few in Zuerich. I wondered if anyone knew the closest to Hottingen?    
Even if it were a small one within a hotel or something.   
Dream scenario would be free weights, swimming, sauna, maybe some classes.   
OK scenario would be machines, so long as there's a fair choice.   
Any pointers would be gratefully received!

			Hi Muppet and CapeN   
So, yes, happy to arrange something after 21 Sep.  I am 36, had horses as a child, sold the last one when I was 16 and then stopped until I was 30.  Did local competitions but certainly nothing serious.  I have some appalling habits (particularly since I have done a lot of western style riding recently) but keen to improve.  You both sound like you are much more advanced but I would be delighted to go riding with you.  If either of you can speak a little german we could check out kolbhof (since we all live v close to it)? otherwise, I am pretty happy with Waldhof (just would be good if it was nearer).  I can go Mondays/Wednesdays/Sats/Sundays.  At the moment am going to Waldhof most Weds at 11am. CN, let me know if you want to come to Waldhof tomorrow just to take a look around.

			Hi,   
I am a regular five-a-sider who moved to Au near Wadenswil a few months ago. Can anyone help with suggesting some people to play with?   
It doesnt have to be in Au - I work in Pfaffikon (SZ) and can play there or travel to Zurich as long as I can get there on time. Weekends fine too.   
I would also be interested in going running after work - I know there are a lot of expats in Pfaffikon (SZ). Or swimming, or squash! Just need to get my lardy arse up and into some sort of exercise before the Rosti and pastries take a hold for good...

			We are currently trying to expend both our junior (10-14 years old) and senior (14 and up) teams for the Swiss National Championship in May. If you know any girl or boy who wants to be a cheerleader in a competitive program, it's the best time to join. No need to have a cheerleading experience to join. A background in gymnastics or dance is a plus.   
This cheerleading team is a competition team only. We do not cheer sport games. We only do cheerleading as a sport and participate in Swiss National and international competition. After the Swiss National we will participate in a European cheerleading competition at Disneyland Paris in September. We also travel to several camps each year to ensure a safe skills progression. I am a USASF certified coach.   
We will only accept newcomers for this competition season until the Christmas break. Next tryouts will be in June 2010. Take this chance and please spread the word about it.   
Feel free to call me for any question 078/660.68.22 (Joëlle Krummenacher)

Feel free to give me a call or email me (078/660.68.22 or email on the website). My prices are very affordable. I also sell poms and anything for cheerleading.    
By the way, I know a team that are in the process of changing their uniform. You might get their old ones for a good price. Their colors are blue, white and silver.   
By the way, I coach a competitive cheerleading squad in Renens and we are recruiting for our team to compete in the national championship ( ). I am also active in the romand and Swiss cheerleading association. I'd be happy to help your cheerleaders getting any help they need.   
Please call me and I'd be happy to help you.

			Hello I have a stable at home.    
I take in ""pensionnaires"" for 450 CHF per month. This includes feed (natural mix of grains), stable with straw bedding, hay 4x a day. The horses are turned out in the pastures every day. Possibility to have riding lessons or have your horse professionally ridden. I also go hacking with my horse on the weekend. Beautiful rides in the forest.    
We're in Servion but probably a bit far for you. But we do have a spare stable now if anyone's interested?

			Probably the best solution. Found out that Bubikon has a long waiting list for new members, which may mean that life for people trying to get more experience on a golfcourse can be difficult. The last Handelszeitung (nr. 34 Aug. 20-26, 2008) brought out a special on golf, listing Golfclubs in Switzerland with relatively easy access for newcomers (without mentioning possibilities for people with Platzreife). 
Possibilities not all that far from Zürich: Affoltern am Albis (golfclubaffoltern.ch), kyburg (golf-kyburg.ch), Fricktal (which was mentioned already.

4571	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Underwater Hockey Switzerland on tour!	martinreed	2,033	0	Location: Zürich	16.11.2009, 20:44	" 
			
			Further to my previous posting about underwater hockey ("" ""), I am delighted to report on our first overseas trip since the Zürich club came into existence. Text and photos by Jos Visser.   
For further information on this most breathtaking of sports, that can be played on an equal footing by men, women and juniors, please see the Underwater Hockey Switzerland website,  , or simply message me.   
Martin Reed 
Underwater Hockey Switzerland             
Parma is a lovely city a bit south of Milan. It has cheese, it has ham, it has beautiful girls and, since this is Italy, it has beautiful boys. It also has an olympic swimming pool which is very well suited to playing underwater hockey. This very fact prompted about 200 people from all over Europe to come to Parma on Saturday 12 September 2009 to battle for the Parma Cup.   
Now this is a bit of a well-kept secret, but USZ (Underwater-Sport-Zentrum Zürich) has a fledgling underwater hockey section, led by former British national team player Martin Reed. We don't yet have enough players to field a tournament-strength team but we still wanted to compete and Martin pulled in a bunch of friends from other cities and countries in order to get a full team together. The resulting proud Swiss team consisted of: 1 Englishman, 1 Romanian, 2 Germans, 2 Americans, 2 Dutch, 1 Kiwi (New Zealand), 1 Columbian and 1 real Swiss person! Our goals were modest: score more than one goal in the tournament and Win The Party.       
Our first game against Genk (Belgium) did not go all that badly. We scored an early goal but were unable to keep the advantage and lost 2-1. The second game we played against the French national team under 19. They were very, very good and quite frankly we did not stand a chance. I forgot the final score but it was quite embarrassing.  The French team went on to play in the tournament final which they lost to Dordrecht (Dutch city team).       
In the subsequent games we improved our game but were still unable to win a match. This goes to show that in underwater hockey team experience only goes so far: We had two national team captains on our team (New Zealand and Germany) plus a fair number of very experienced players, but all this individual quality does not help a lot against teams that are coordinated and have their tactics figured out. It also did not help that NZ captain Lisa Thompson was recovering from a broken arm and was playing as a southpaw.       
In the final game (for 13th/14th place) we met the British Ladies Masters (over 32 years of age) team. This was our best game so far and the teams were evenly matched. We came to 2-2 and then a bad decision by an Italian referee did us in and the British ladies scored 3-2. Our appeals were unsuccessful and that was the final score. Incidentally, because of an oddity in the tournament structure, the team from Genk we played against in the first game ended below us in the final ranking!       
Fortunately due to the dedicated partying of Joëlle Meijer (NL) we did win the party and that gave us standing invitations to join tournaments in Rome and Ljubljana.

This is reality of playing tennis in Switzerland, which at the first glance also shocked me, but what can we do??? You can only find it cheaper by special arrangment e.g. companies make it for their employees or if you know the people. You can of course get some discount if you buy a seasonal ticket so called Fix-Platz.

4574	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Tennis partner advanced level - Luzern	dendeze	1,732	6	Location: luzern	14.11.2009, 12:01	"    What you might want to do is to get an active licence to be able to play tournaments in your category. Although you are not shooting for Swiss ranking, but I think it will be the fastest way to find players on your level sport-wise and to train regularly. Another option is to live your details at reception in the  sport centers with indoor tennis courts (e.g. in Vitis) and they will match you with similar level player looking for tennis partner. If you would like to get the licence, then the info should be provided on the same website  . It costs only CHF 60 a year ( 2 x CHF30 for summer/winter season) and it is worth it because you can enter any kind of competition and thus make regular friends.

			Just did a curling evening at the dolder ice hall up on zuriberg.   
You must get together ten people, call them in advance and set a date, pay 390chf upfront for the whole group (40chf per person).   Our evening was on a Friday night from 8-10pm.   We went at 6.30 and had fondue in the complex while we watched the ice skaters.    Then from 8-10 we had an english speaking instructor teach us everything we needed and then we played a few games.   
To find out more google the dolder ice hall.   
Takes a little organization but it is good fun.

4578	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	"Any Running ""Beginners"" in or around Villeneuve?"	janeprinsep	615	0	Location: Villeneuve	12.11.2009, 18:38	" 
			
			Hi 
I'm a Mum of 2 living in Villeneuve (along from Montreux) and I am keen to start running.  I am hugely unfit at the moment, after putting on weight after having 2 babies in the last 2 or so years, but I am really keen to get my running shoes on.   
Does anyone know of any clubs in the area where they offer REALLY easy training for beginners, or are you in the same kind of position as me and perhaps really want to ""get out there"" but lack confidence.   
I had started training last year, and got up to being able to run 4kms or so (pathetic I know...), but then I hit upon some personal problems and it all went crashing down!  I am determined this time that running will be able to help me keep on top of such things!   
It would be great to hear from anyone who could help, or anyone in a similar position.   
Thanks 
Jane

			I used to be a teacher of salsa, merengue and danzon. I am originally from Mexico and have danced all my life. But now Im into finance and almost have no time to do it. 
However, as I used to do it in the states, I will go to your house and teach you and your friends. For 1,2 or 3 hours from basic to advanced. That way you dont have to feel ""embarased"". I will show you how to listen to the beat, listen to the melody (which is pretty easy) and then teach you to forget about COUNTING! and start having FUN with it! I believe that here in Zurich, people count too much and forget about what salsa is all about...having fun!!! Actually it is pretty easy.  
Let me know if you are interested. I can travel around Zurich area only. Due to work I am book almost all the time. But I have some time on wensdays. Obviously I can teach in english, french or spanish. 
A BAILAR!!!

			For families with children who are just learning to ski I can warmly recommend Sattelegg close to Einsiedeln/Willerzell. We were there again this week-end and it is a really nice and family friendly place. The slope and the lift is perfect for beginners. They have a ""tellerlift"" and the two old farmer guys always help you get on it.    
For slightly more advanced I can recommend Ibergeregg and Brunni.

			Hi All   
The Basel Stadt Lauf (5.5K) run takes place on Saturday the 28th November.  
This is a very special run, well supported by the locals of Basel and runs through the centre of Basel under the christmas lights.   
We start from next week Basel stadt lauf training groups for all levels of runners at the Basel Dragons running club.    
The training sessions starts on this Monday 26.10.09 at 18.30 and Thursday nights at 18.30 for the next 5 weeks.   
For 20 chf you will receive membership for 5 weeks (2 sessions per week).  
You will get coaching, advice by qualifed coaches / team leaders. 
Use of the club house showers and bar facilities.  
You will a taste of what our club normally offers including invites to night outs along the way.   
To top that if you run as a member of the Basel Dragons club at the stadt lauf you get free food at the after run party in Pickwicks pub in Basel.    
All non members are also welcome along to join the party and cheer on the runners on the night.

4611	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Mountain Bike - New Brakes	Chemmie	927	6	Location: Zurich	22.10.2009, 14:40	"    Additionally, you will likely need to shorten the hydraulic lines to fit your bike, which will certainly require bleeding afterwards.    
In case budget is a topic of particular importance, I would mention Shimano BR-M 535 brakes. I picked them once as a spare brake, and am since then amazed how well and reliably they work for a price of 100Euro a set. Weight is  of course not the strongest feature, but the stopping power is no different to  XTRs on my other bike.  
A pair of budget Hayes HFX-9 were a disaster for me. Was almost happy when they broke down.  
On the contrary, was very sad when this year I cracked off the brake lever of a 12-year old magura louise. The mighty piece of german craftsmanship did not tolerate a silly fall.

			I'm a beginner swimmer and really want to take swim lessons this fall. Personally, I think a group setting would best. Unfortunately, my German is far from decent and I don't want to spend half the lesson just trying to figure out what's being said.   
I think, therefore, that private lessons with an English-speaking instructor is the only option but I would still like to do it with one or two other people so that we can help and motivate each other. Besides, it's a good way to meet others, right?    
Is anyone interested in joining? I'm looking for options here and there. So far I located this in Oerlikon--http://www.well-fit-11.ch/html/index.php?id=24. I think the price isn't bad. For two people, 45 minutes is only 32 francs each (not including entry into the hallenbad, of course.)   
Please let me know. Thanks!

			Hi, our team plays in the corporate league here in Lausanne and we are looking for players.  The league is competitive but fun, with a variety of skill levels.   
Most games are in the area, and we average about 1 game a week.   
We're looking to add a player or two, so drop me a line if you are interested.

			Hi Amit, 
I am also in Neuchatel and a snowboarder. Thoughts are turning to the winter season and the chance to get on the slopes but since I am new to the area I haven't figured out where the nearest slopes are. Maybe we can meet for a chat and make some plans? 
Let me know,

An orienteering course set from Switzerland's Spiffing Ales brewery.   Travel on foot, or on mountain bike, and finish with the freshest beer in the Zurich region!  Earn points by visiting as many checkpoints as you can in up to 5 hours.   
Some will run, some will walk, and some will mountain bike . . . but everyone  enjoys the beautiful forested ridge overlooking the Zurichsee and with views to the Alps.  Everyone also gets pizza and sweet nourishing beer at the finish!

			You could always try looking for a mother and child gymnastics class - I do one with my 3 year old and she loves it.  It's not too strenous for the Mums, but it is exercise, and if you walk or cycle to the class it all helps.  Your local commune / gemeinde would probably have the information, or if you can make sense of their website, the FSG / STV should give you links to local clubs ( ).   
I'd also recommend buying a bike trailer - we bought a CTS Chariot when our daughter was 6 months and it's done literally hundreds of miles.  It's great for trips to the parks or shops, and also longer all-day rides.  Whilst you miss the close contact of the child seat option, it's more comfortable for the child in poorer weather and doesn't affect the handling of the bike as much.  It's certainly a great work out for you!   
I have run with my daughter in the stroller (we have a BabyJogger, which is good for running) but to be honest, once she got past 18 months it wasn't much fun.  On any sort of uphill I almost ground to a halt as the Jogger with her in was so heavy...  Perhaps it'd be better on a flat paved trail than cross country.   
Good luck with whatever you choose to do!

I would rather be playing etc. I dont get anything out of watching it anymore. Niether do former team mates.

			Hi guys    
i agree with all that is said here, the Ice bath theory is something I don't enjoy either as I used to have them some time ago, but it had to be done straight after a run to reduce the swelling of the joints and muscles and quickens the recovery time between runs.   
The oldest treatment I still think is the best is R.I.C.E. 
Rest, Ice, Compress and Elevate. Elevation is a great way after a run to drain the lactic acid that builds up in muscle areas and stop painful knots building up in muscle areas and the rest is to stop the damaged, bruised or bleeding tissue and will speed up the scar tissue replacement which in turn heals the damaged area.   
Nice to hear a few old friends on here, Basel Dragons running club has now gone over the 100 members mark and runs with between 35 and 40 people most sesions. W also had over 54,000 hits on our website last month for running advice and tips.   
Regards to you all.

			Insurance policies are not always logical.  My policy covered me for trekking as long as I didn't use specialist equipment.  Initially, they included trekking poles and crampons as specialist equipment.   
They seemed to prefer people to go out unprepared.  I got it sorted once I explained the irrational idea of their policy.

4650	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	ski training at home sans weights?	phdoofus	1,326	6	Location: City by the Bay	23.09.2009, 21:45	"    Good advice.... One thing to really watch out for if doing this is to keep your stomach really tight. (You should be doing this anyway) but if you do the overhead versions if there is any tightness at all in the shoulder area you tend to compensate for getting the hands up by leaning back. This makes your lumbar spine extend more then it should and could cause some problems.    
The tips are good. It really does up the effect for the exercise and focuses it a little more on the core then the standard versions, but may not be for everyone.    
BTW... as for core. Its importance can not be emphasised enough for any sport... but all the exercises I have described do actually have a core element to them too. This is why I didn't put more specific core exercises into the programme. I wanted to make it as simple as possible and something that people might do rather then decide it takes too much time. There are developments and add-ons that can be done at any time, but I think that is a good starting point given that we are at least 8 weeks from the start of ski season.

At the moment they are better than the scandanavians, even if the world's best male orienteer is ... french!   
You can find out all about it by Googling ""orienteering world cup zurich 2009"". That gets you the pdf of all the info.

			Try posting it as a definite event in social events forum. This usually works well for this kind of thing and as for a starting point why not go for somewhere obvious by the lake at Ouchy. Then you can easily do a first walk by the lake, where it's impossible to get lost.

			Hello, 
We are thinking of moving back to Switzerland having lived near Basel for 10 years. 
What is it like living in Lugano? How big is the English group?We may be at the Eden in two weeks time so may take the opportunity to meet up for the 10am Sunday coffee. Is there the sort of warmth of feeling that the Italians have? Or is it very traditionally Swiss?

			Switzerland is so small and the maps so good that I bet any warm springs have been long since 'appropriated' for thermal baths and hotels built to accomodate the bathers - with a post bus or a cableway to reach the place too.    
I'd love to be wrong though.

4676	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Panniers for a Tandem	Loz1983	1,436	2	Location: Zürich	09.09.2009, 17:58	" 
			
			You should search through the posts in the   of BikeForums for info on tandem panniers, and post this question there if you still don't find what you're looking for.    
Ortlieb are certainly the most waterproof, but are definitely only medium-sized, and are not cheap. As already mentioned, rain covers are made for most panniers, and in my experience that combination has kept my stuff dry in some pretty bad conditions. As long as you spend a decent amount of money then you should get something pretty durable - The cheaper models are normally lacking in terms of the attachment system and durability.   
Hopefully your tandem has a sturdy rear wheel - at least a 145mm wide hub and 40 spokes would be recommended for tandem touring. If you have less confidence in the robustness of that wheel, you may want to consider distributing the load a bit more evenly across the bike. Using a handlebar bag can give you lots of extra space (just make sure you don't have shifter cables in the way, but there are ways around that problem). On a tandem, you can also use a couple of frame bags. We have a quite large one that goes under the top tube behind the captain's seat-tube that we find very useful, we got ours from  , but hopefully you can find one in Europe somewhere.   in the UK carry a lot of tandem-specific parts and accessories, but I don't see that bag on their website. Plus, we sometimes put another smaller frame bag under the lateral tube behind the captain's seat-tube.       
Adding front panniers can get expensive because of needing another rack and paying for another set of bags, plus the racks are difficult to put on some forks (although never impossible, unless the fork is carbon). However, it is certainly an option that I would consider if my rear bags still weren't big enough or my rear wheel wasn't sturdy enough.   
There are also bags made to fit between two panniers on top of the rack - get a long skinny one so that it fits well, many of this type are too fat to fit between panniers because they are designed to be used on their own. Of course, if you're camping then that is the ideal place for a tent, so you can't use one of these. Here's a small image of the one we use with panniers, which comes from  :    "	Posts: 1,091	Join Date: Mar 2008	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 300 Times in 177 Posts	Thanked 5,424 Times in 1,946 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			I'm looking for fellow runners in the Geneva area interested in getting together to do some weekly (weakly?) interval training on the track.    
I'm interested in just some basic training (repeated 400m, 800m, 1600m intervals, ladders and the like) with warm up and cool down and all over in about an hour.    
I'm more or less equidistant between Centre Sportif de Versoix and Centre Sportif de Colovray (which I believe is being renovated) but I could go elsewhere.    
If you are interested or there is already a group in the area, please let me know.

			How do you know they're using barbed hooks? You'd have to inspect them pretty closely in order to tell.   
That being said, most places don't allow them when you're fishing without a license. Lots of people probably break the rules out of sheer laziness or simple ignorance, but it's a good habit to get into anyhow. I crimp the barbs on all my hooks, I've never noticed that I've lost more fish, it makes fish easier to release unharmed, and that little tiny piece of metal isn't worth a fine.

			Hi Gabe,   
There is a nice place on the lake at Biel/Bienne (Bieler See). I think it is near La Neuveville which is at the Neuchatel end of the lake. We saw it the other week and looks great. There is also a spot on Lake Neuchatel but I am not sure of the area, might be St Blaise but close to Neuchatel. I am sure Google can tell you. 
Have fun.

			I am in Zurich for the next 2 months and would love to get some form of wakeboarding in,before it gets to cold...either on a boat or one of the tow-rope parks. I have have been holding off on going to the one in Switzerland just because of train ticket prices and the price of the park.    
But if anyone wanted to rent a car together, I would defintely contribute to that to head to the park in Germany.   
I would also contribute to do renting a boat or however its done on one of the lakes.   
I am solid kiteboarder so though its been a while since ive wakeboarded, i should be just fine.

4687	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	SEEKING PITCHING COACH for Zürich Amateur Baseball Team	edwhitaker	1,612	0	Location: Aargau	03.09.2009, 21:53	" 
			
			The Zürich Eighters were founded in 2008...hence the name.  On Sunday afternoon we play our last games of the 2009 season (our first) in Lausanne.   
To continue to improve through the winter and prepare for the 2010 season, we eagerly seek an experienced pitching coach.  As baseball-lovers know, pitcher is the most difficult position to develop, and as general coach of the Eighters I have reached the limit of my skills and experience when it comes to pitching.   
The team consists almost entirely of young Swiss guys (mid-twenties to mid-thirties) with little to no baseball experience until we began training a year ago.  Everyone is unbelievably enthusiastic, eager to learn and improve.  It is wonderful what these guys are doing for baseball in Switzerland.     
I was a walk-on last August and after unsuccessfully pursuing a few other coaching options through the 2009 season, the team's leadership installed me as coach 2 weeks ago as the American guy with the most know-how.  However, my know-how consists mainly of little league almost 20 years ago, a few softball teams in Chicago in my mid-twenties, and a lot of watching the MLB.  To this point it has been sufficient, but I could really use a hand.  Needless to say, it is difficult to find baseball coaches in Switzerland who aren't already associated with one of the many already existing teams.   
We train every Monday evening in Oerlikon, and once it starts getting too dark too early, not to mention too cold, we will move our training indoors to the KV Business School at Escher-Wyss Platz, also on Monday evenings.   
The pitching coach would not be expected to be present at each and every training, but motivation, enthusiasm and a good rapport with the team are highly valued and the more you include yourself the better.  Myself and one or two other players handled all the pitching responsibility during the 2009 season, but my goal is to familiarize every player with the fundamentals of pitching.  Lack of relief options has been a major handicap, and general knowledge of pitching techniques would (needless to say) also improve our batting.   
The position does not pay.  We are a brand new team and so far we have all paid our own way (league membership, players licenses, uniforms, equipment, etc) outside of a few nominal sponsors.  What we have to offer is a fun group of guys, and baseball baseball baseball.  This might be a really fun freetime option for somebody new to Zürich or to Switzerland.  It has been a great social and athletic outlet for me so far!   
German proficiency is not a must, but would be helpful.  I speak fairly well, and when the jargon gets too thick I will lapse into English, but the levels of English comprehension among team members is variable.  For a newcomer this would be a great way to brush up!   
If anyone is interested please respond to this thread and we can exchange information and discuss further details.  More information is available at   (team site) and at   (Swiss Baseball and Softball Federation site).   
Thanks! 
Ed Sutton

I am living in Zurich and recently contacted an instructor for a training session of the famous Pose running method ( more info at the website   ).  
He is from Geneva and will travel to Zurich if he would have a group of several people, so i am looking for anyone interested in a training day of the Pose running form. I was thinking towards the end of September on a Saturday or a Sunday.  ( if i am alone i would have to travel to Geneva... long way) 
The price for a training day is 250 CHF.   
Reply to this thread or send me a message if interested.   
Thanks

			Thanks.  That helps a lot!  I'll write to a couple of them and see who responds.   
I can speak some German and plan to learn more. I'm willing to do the lessons in German as well... I'll just need to do a couple private lessons first so I feel confident with the language.

			Shoot me [a private message] -- there is an orienteering meet in Zug on Sunday that a few of us are going to, I can show you the basics if you'd like.   
On a related note, we just confirmed Sat Nov 21st for a one-day orienteering event from the   south of Zurich. We'll have both a ""foot"" and a ""mountain bike"" division, and with great beer to go along with either!

			It just hit me that going over the great Grosse Scheidegg is not required to be ""hard work"" -- perhaps could take the post-bus up its eas side from Meiringen, then ride down the west side to Grindelwald and Interlaken. Or if you want to do   work, take the bus up only as far as Rosenlaui.   
Cheat. 
If you insist on riding every single kilometer, you won't have a story about how the official mail delivery vehicle had bike racks mounted on back, with a photo of your bike on the rack. 
You won't have a story about how bringing your bike on the famous Swiss train system wasn't as easy as people say.   
When you get back home, not many people are going to care exactly how much total distance you covered, or if you rode every mile through some regions they never heard of.  
They're going to be asking (or thinking) things like: 
* so did you see the Matterhorn? (north wall of the Eiger?) 
* do all the cows have bells? 
* how come there's no snow-covered peaks in your photos? 
* what was the cheese like?   
* castles ? Not what most people are asking of Switzerland. But the route posted so far goes right by one: The castle on the little island at the east of Lac Leman / Lake Geneva is was really great inside -- I'd say worth budgeting fewer km of distance to have time to enjoy and explore things like that.

As a matter of fact two of the pack leaders noticed that I was straining my puny legs with high torque (at just over half of their cadence) and that happened to be my lowest gear. This happened on both my Sat and Sunday rides. I am not sounding it as an excuse why I lagged, just that there is opportunity to learn and improve. I am planning to do something about it tommorrow.   
I noticed some people aren't too happy with the amount of ""nonsense talk"". Well, behind the funny side, as far as I am concerned I find a lot of motivation and education from reading such posts...physiology, biking habits, technique etc which have considerable value to newbies   "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			Having assisted on many OWD as a Divemaster in Lake Zurich, I can only say its not that cold, its a lot of fun and when doing drills such as flooded Mask, no salt water to sting your eyes!   
Personally I love diving here more than say the Red See... too many tourists so I end up feeling like I'm diving along a Highstreet...        belonged to Mark Fyvie, the founder of EF, so I'm sure you'll understand that there are no new events offered.   
@ OP are you affiliated with the dive school? Your post sounds far more like marketing than actually discussion about sports and fitness... Mods commercial section might be more appropriate

			great bike path along the Rhine, you need to take a train, car and or ride out to Sargans. Only negative is lots of fast cyclists there. It is flat along the Rhine, beautiful, sometimes windy....not sure how long it runs...           
It does turn into dirt at some point, but there is defintely at least a 5 or 6 km clip of asphalt.  it may be longer, I do not remember....it is a great area to ride nonetheless, you find all kinds of variety. mountains, flats, hills, Liechtenstein.

			I have to agree rather.    
The 40 minutes or so on the river was a lot of fun, but maybe not worth several hours of queuing... and i didn't bother waiting for the ugly   commemorative glass or cheap wurst either.   
Next year (if ther weather is good) I hope they focus more volunteers on the necessary services (ie, allocating times to ticket holders, returning bags) rather than on handing out glasses that are probably just going to be filling the Brokis or bottle banks by the end of the week anyway.

4750	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Info on MTB route Davos - Durrboden - Keschhutte - Bergun - Davos	Harriet and Patrick	1,260	0	Location: Gattikon	03.08.2009, 22:41	" 
			
			Hey,    
Route: Davos - Durrboden - Keschhutte - Bergun - Davos 
Length 75 km   
I'm thinking of doing this mountain bike route this coming thursday and was wondering if anyone on here has done it and could possibly give me some info.   
It's the route that forms the Davos Alpine Marathon just I plan to do it in reverse because I see from the Davos bike map that is the reccomended direction. It also means if I get tired I can catch the train back from Bergun.   
So, what I would like to know is whats the technical level (for those who know Davos, I consider the Weissfluhjoch - Strelapass - Panorammaweg - Wolfgang route to be on the harder side but within my ability).   
Are there many definate walking sections?   
Are there any really dangerous sections?   
Sometimes it's nice to get a heads up!  
Thanks in advance. 
Patrick

			This might be totally wrong, but you may have tied your shoes too tight..... sounds odd but it can cause problems with your toes. Alot of running clinics do sessions on tying laces, and when running long distances you would be amazed the difference it can make.

			There is a pool hall that also has some full size snooker tables.   
Billiard Center Basel 
Steinentorstr. 35   
Next to the Hauwaage tram stop just below Paddy Reilly's.  There is a sort of alley/carpark that leads to Aha! nightclub (used to be Mad Max).   
The pool hall is on about the second or third floor - there is a lift and the correct floor is marked.

			Hi there. Posts slip off the visible first 'page' of the Forums very quickly.    
If you don't get any answers, I suggest you do a bit of searching and see if you can find others living in your region who have answered in Threads on sport subjects. Then you could try a PM to those who have posted lately and look likely candidates to fulfill your request....    
Good luck - hope you find a soul-mate soon.

Then you can keep a look out for polka-dot swimsuits, I am sure there will be one or two   You can also watch the competitors and get some tips and tricks on setting up and the transitions. There will be English speakers there and I am sure they can answer your questions.   
Good Luck

			Well I did try it in the end........and I belive it's the first and the last time.    
I rode there the first day through the woods towards Uitikon, and could I find this place?.......even though i had a map with me it was no where to be seen, so hot and bothered I peddled home again.    
Then the following day, I decided to give my Navi a go at it, so stuffing my Tracer VP into my car (and it does fit in a Mk2 TT with just the front wheel off, as long as you put the passenger seat forward,) off I went.    
Well even with the Navi it was a pain to find, but in the end I did find it.    
Let's just say, it didn't live upto expectations.......The place is tiny and not very interesting at all.    
There are some man made trails, a bit of pump track and some jumps, plus a northshore (that I steared clear of as it didn't look that well maintained) but basically you could get around the whole thing in around 10 minutes or less.   
I didn't like at all, the tree branch lined artificial trails, and the pump track was just wrong - came away with a bad impression, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.    
I was there on my own anyway for around an hour or so, whilst I guess all other people were off doing some far more interesting trails.......   
Will definitely go further a-field next time to find something better.    
Cheers,   
Phil.

			Hi   
Having bought a decathlon road bike 3 years ago plus plenty of othere stuff from them I would say they represent excellent value as the specs are (almost) always good and their range of level is good. Service is not quite so good and I would recommend that you speak a reasonable level of French as Mulhouse store staff rarely speak any english.

4808	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Advice on flying with a bike and what bike to bring?	Dusty	1,381	4	Location: Vaud	22.06.2009, 17:56	" 
			
			A DH rig will definitely give you more freedom to fully explore the trails, but I expect that you could do so pretty well on a XC machine, too. I wouldn't be too concerned about shipping the bike. Investing in a proper box might be a good idea if you plan to use several times, but you do have to consider whether you have the storage space for a hard box. I've frequently used cardoard boxes from my LBS and not had a problem, although I haven't shipped my carbon fiber baby yet.   
As for slick tires and locked-out suspension making it a road-worthy machine, then certainly give that a go. However, the gearing and riding position may still be way off what you would get by having a true road machine. If you're buying brand-name bikes like Trek then buying in France won't save much money, and could cost more because they charge more sales tax. There are several online retailers in Europe where you can pick up a decent road bike for a good price, although these often don't have a wel-known brand and you have to be your own local bike shop with setting it up, fitting, tuning, etc. By September, they should start selling off last year's models at pretty good prices (10 to 25% off), particularly for brands who are making major changes to their line-ups for 2010. If I was you, I'd wait until I get here and search for something like that.   
There is currently a pro' road cyclist who is actually from Orbe - Danilo Wyss. I believe he is currently on the BMC Racing Team, who do most of the big races in the US.

    We want to start a Roller Derby league (ideally based in Zurich, but flexible) and need players who want to be a part of something new and exciting in Switzerland.   
We want to set up a league much like Stuttgart and many other European cities already have...       
We're looking for girls aged 18-whatever who want to be part of a team and part of learning a new team sport with a very cool group of women. This is a fun and full contact sport that we can all learn and share experiences together. The closest league to us right now is the Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz, and they started much like this a couple years ago.    
Questions?  Good!   
I've never been on a team before.  Is this for me?  Probably... lots of girls have never been on a team until they join derby.   
How is this sport different? Attitude, Teamwork, Fun. We take on new names on the track, form closesly bonded teams, wear flashy uniforms, and then we sell tickets and play in front of a crowd of hundreds of cheering spectators. Anything we make goes directly back into training expenses.   
What is Roller Derby, anyways?  Check out our sister league at   or google (or youtube or wikipedia) ""Roller Derby"".   
Does anyone REALLY play this? In July the first European tournament will be held with 12 teams in attendance. In Canada and the USA there are hundreds of teams.   
What kind of people play this sport? All ages and professions and fitness levels can find a place here... Roller Derby attracts a very diverse group and binds them together like no other sport.   
Is this a real sport?  Are there rules?  Yes and absolutely yes.   
Check out the 400 league strong Women's Flat Track Derby Association.      
This sport looks hard! Do I need to be super fit or be a super skater? No. Just show up and we'll share skills with one another and learn and get fit together.   
Looks like fun, but I'm not a girl.  Can men play?  No - this is an all-female sport.  Men sometimes choose to become involved as referees, coaches, trainers, etc...   
If interested simply in learning more, contact us (Swiss Army Wife and Crash Test Ref) or message one of us using our facebook site...       
or E-mail us...   
See you soon,

4825	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	How to select a Mountain bike	guest	1,488	1	null	null	" 
			
			Wheel size is pretty much always 26"" and all the standard bikes you will find in the shops are that size. The exceptions to this rule are generally fairly specialised machines.   
Frame size depends on brand and type of bike. In my opinion you are borderline between what most manufacturers would term medium and large. You are the same height as me and I ride a medium frame. A smaller frame within reason will make it easier to ride more difficult sections of trail.    
As for bike type, it depends on what you want to do with it. If you want to just ride on nature streets and do non technical tours then a fairly basic hard tail cross country (XC) bike will do the job. The better quality of components will make the bike more expensive but also help it to handle more abuse if you decide you want to venture into more adventurous regions. The problem with XC bikes is that if you ride something that is a bit difficult it takes more skill to ride the bike. This is where Full suspension XC bikes or even All Mountain (AM) bikes come into play.    
All Mountain bikes are usually full suspension but more importantly they have a little bit more relaxed geometry which makes them somewhat more fogiving and a little less freaky to ride when the going gets rough.    
It mainly comes down to you, what you want to do and your budget. The Trek Fuel EX's and the Specialised Stumpjumpers (fully) are good middle of the road bikes that will allow you to do easy going day tours but are still capable of being ridden on almost any trail you can find. You could use these bikes as a starting point and then look at something similar from other brands or decide that it is too much/too little bike for you and go for a something else.

			Googling around with various word combinations I came up with this  , which seems to be connected with this  but cannot remember exactly how I found it!    
I believe on the 'slowUp days' there is much less 'normal' traffic on the roads which means more room for bikes and more fun for the cyclists.    
Of course, this event could be something completely different from the thing you are looking for so it might be worth keeping your eyes open for posters or suchlike.    
Hope this helps.

			Not field hockey...but if you fancy giving Camogie a try there's a team in Zurich which competes in a European league with teams from Brussels, Luxemboug, Paris etc...   
Games and training are friendly and any skill level from beginner to expert is always welcome    
(For the record, I'm on the hurling / GAA team, not the camogie)   
Cheers & welcome!

My son who will turn 6 y.o. in July, and he has expressed some interest in playing tennis.  I wonder if there is a weeklong tennis camp in Basel where a young, English speaking beginner could learn the basics of the sport, hopefully with other children.  I thank you in advance for any tips.

			Yes there is one here in Zurich I believe       
I have researched this before and I believe the Full Golf Swing Simulator is one of the best.  The other golf simulator that is high quality is linked below       
I have played on this one at a demo event in Melbourne.  I think they would be really cool in bars for Nearest to the pin challenges or three hole tournaments or whatever.  The only problem is the cost is very high and clearly not the real thing.  They generally predict draw and fade quite well and would be a lot of fun with a few mates and some beers however I don't think it is a substitute for the real thing, however could help improve your swing, again probably more expensive than a driving range though.  I think the about golf simulator was about 70,000USD to buy.  Hopefully in the future this price comes down a bit.

I'm a BSAC diver and was wondering if there was a BSAC affiliated organisation, or a general dive club (i.e. not a PADI pay per dive firm) in the Zurich area.   
There seem to be a few BSAC clubs outside of the UK, so here's hoping that there is something over here in CH.    
Hope to hear from you soon

			When I first came to berne, I played a lot, through Volleyball Club Berne. A great way to make friends and learn Swiss German.    
Open places - games are set up at Marzili (under the Monbijou bridge) - just go along, make friends, ask to join in. I play once a week at Eichholz at lunchtime in the summer. Bikinis welcome. Afterwards we often go clean off the sand by swimming in the Aare back down to the zoo bridge or Marzili.    
Or visit the national Beach Volleyball Center in Beaumont, near the Weissenbuhl train and tram 3 stop. I'm sure you could live a live of nothing but volleyball, sand and sun right there: I'm planning on some daiquiris and suntan now.     
Ask on swisscc or meetup or CS to find some players.       
The couch surfers are often having a BBQ at Eichholz.

The best it to arrange tennis, like you did, via EF or other fora and also inquire in sport centres for tennis partners. You usually leave your name and contact details with your level on the notice board and people contact you or you find some of the contactds already hanging there. Anyway good luck with your visit in Sept. and you can contact me if you need any more info in tennis matter.

I need someone in the Solothurn area to lead a group hike down Weissenstein  on July 20 and on August 31. You needn't be a professional, just personable and English speaking. Of course, you should live in the area, be comfortable leading a group and speak English. We pretty much have the route in mind, just need a chaperone for our guests.

All you need is a properly fitted pair of shoes, a suitable sports bra (for women) and some comfortable sports clothing that makes you feel good.         A. Just a good all-round diet, with plenty of fluids and a slight emphasis on low-GI carbohydrate. Aim to eat 50% of your calories from carbohydrate, 25% from protein and 25% from fat. Only half-marathon runners need go wild with pasta.         A. Nothing ..(except cross-country skiing) burns more calories per minute than running. But don't forget to eat and drink enough to exercise at your best in the first place. You'll still win out.       A. The easiest way to make sure you're running at the right speed is to go with a friend and make sure you maintain 'chatting' pace - even when the going is tough you should still be able to get a few words out, even if they're just ""how.. much.. further..my coach is a ****!""         A. If you're new to running, we'd call going from doing no regular exercise to doing a run-walk programme pretty good progress. Don't measure yourself against other people - if you're running or walking further, more often, more quickly or more easily, you're making progress. Improvements come in steps       A. Feeling a bit achy after running isn't uncommon. Minimize it by starting and finishing each run with a few minutes of gentle jogging or walking, and do some stretching when you finish your session. If your ache turns into a pain then you may need to ease up, or take a few days off running.         A. Whatever shape or size you are, the very fact that you are out there and getting fitter means you have plenty to be proud of. More likely than not, anyone who looks at you when you're training is envious of your get-up-and-go. Whether you're in the gym or in the park, hold your head up high.     Race day approaches!!!     Q. I've never been in a race before. What's it like?    A. It's fantastic! Busier and friendlier than you could imagine. Just don't be tempted to dash off too fast at the start - that's the most common mistake. If you start slowly, you could spend your race overtaking and moving up the field - what a confidence boost!      Q. How should I prepare on race day?    A. The golden rule is don't try anything new. Have a familiar breakfast (or afternoon snack, if it's an evening race), a glass or two of water or juice (try and stay off the beer), and make sure you'll be wearing shoes and clothing you're really comfortable in.       Q. How fast could I (should I?) go?    A. Most beginners' goal is simply to finish the race with a smile on their face. but if you need to calculate a goal in your training programme, break it down per kilometre and set your watch.     Q. What if I'm last?    A. Why not take a look at the previous year's results for your race? That way, you'll get a good idea of where in the field you might find yourself on race day. Even if you do come last, you'll probably still have a great time and get the biggest cheer going courtesy of the marshals, commentators and all the other runners especially if you run with a running club like the Basel or Zurich running clubs who promote themselves on the EF.

4885	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cycling Group Zurich	squirrel plus	1,437	3	Location: Zurich	07.05.2009, 14:30	"    Valid point, and good to clarify before the ride. But IMO, in rides of this level aerodynamics won't matter all that much (e.g. me  ). Around 26-27 kph on a touring bike, and maybe 29-30 kph on a road bike...I guess this much variation can easily be absorbed in the breaks. So I suggest decent streetbikes should be welcome and focus on more people/fun than stats. Just a suggestion.

4894	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Setting up bike correctly	magic	2,312	6	Location: Geneva	27.04.2009, 13:09	" 
			
			I forgot about another important way to adjust the reach on a bike. First, you can move your seat forwards or backwards where it clamps onto the seatpost. However, this often only gives you an adjustment range of +/- 10mm. If you want a bigger adjustment, you could try changing your seatpost.   
Different seat-posts come with different amounts of 'set-back', which is the distance between the center of the post and the center of the clamp that holds the seat rails. This can range between about 0 and 25mm. I believe 20mm used to be quite standard, but now it seems that many seat posts, particularly for mountain bikes, have no/zero set back (i.e, the seat mounts directly above the post). Rather than adjusting your reach by changing your stem, you might be able to change your seatpost instead.   
When we got our new tandem, I was amazed by how short the reach was. The top tube was only 5mm shorter than on my single bike, which is the dimension that I had made my choice of frame size based on. Then I realized that the stem was 10mm shorter than the one on my single bike, and the seat post had no set-back, whereas on my single I had 20mm setback. Therefore, the reach was actually 35mm shorter, which is a HUGE difference. I couldn't comfortably hold the tops of the drop-bars, the only place I liked was having my hands grasping the very top/front of the brake hoods, but this didn't give me very much control. By changing the seatpost and stem I was able to quickly get it setup much better.   
However, changing the fore/aft position of your saddle to change the reach of your bike is not ideal because that should really be determined by other things. The old advice was that you should set the horizontal position of your seat so that when your cranks are horizontal to the ground, your front knee is directly above the front pedal. However, this rule of thumb (known as Knee Over Pedal Spindle, or KOPS) has since been heavily questioned, and there are several other theories. Keith Bontrager has a long essay on this on Sheldon Brown's website,  .   
I've never worried too much about the horizontal position of my saddle in terms of how it changes the effective angle of my seat-tube. I have always found a seatpost with 20mm setback to be quite comfortable, and have only adjusted the horizontal seat position to get the reach to the handlebars right. However, when my wife was recovering from knee problems, she played around with different seat positions to try to avoid any further aggravation in that area.   
EDIT: This all provides further evidence for the theory that the most important dimension of a new frame is the top tube length. Getting the reach right by buying the right size frame is the best way to do it. Getting the reach right by changing the stem will alter the bike's handling slightly, and changing it by altering the horizontal position of the saddle will affect the pedaling geometry. In contrast, getting the saddle height right can be done by raising or lowering the saddle, which doesn't affect too much else, making the seat-tube length pretty unimportant. In fact, after top-tube length, I would say that the head-tube length is the next most important measurement, because the head-tube length constrains the height at which you can put the handlebars, much more so than the seat-tube length constrains the height where you can put the saddle. Anyway, I'll stop babbling now.

			Well...I can't add any more to this thread I'm afraid.  Due to various reasons, we ended up staying closer to home and doing a 38km route north of Lausanne, around Chalet-a-Gobet, and winding our way back towards town, as offroad as possible.   
It's a nice ride, not technical but has some ""cheeky"" climbs, some flowing downhills and gets the lungs working (1315m climbing  )   
Am definitely interesting in trying the route at Saleve though, possibly a mix of routes 2 and 3 as it looks like they pretty much link up...so if anyone is planning to go up there please put a post up.   
Cheers,

			Hi, I've just moved to Basel and very keen to train for some long triahtlon races while here. I've been training on my own but completely sick of my own company. I've done a number of Ironman over the years and am planning on doing the Alp D'Heuz triathlon in 3 months. I really need to get out on my bike but would like some company on the hilly rides over the weekend. I'm also very keen to join a good swim squad. I hope someone can point me in the right direction.    
I've notice that the tri basil group don't start training again until mid May but I was hoping for something a little earlier. Any advice would be welcome.   
Thanks

			I'll give the very commital answer of - it depends.  Some days I ride on the flats and thereby can go faster (~22 to 25 kph) and others I'll do hills which naturally slows me up considerably.  All depends on the amount of beer consumption the night before, mood, weather...the normal stuff...hope that helps.

I played in the Juniors there hmmmm let's see, just over 30 years ago!! One of the guys on the commitee, Thierry Charbonney, was our goalkeeper at the time. The club only had two teams at the beginning, the juniors and the first team. A ladies team came a couple of years later. I have some great memories of those days. The club is a lot bigger now than it was then but I am sure that it is fairly well organised. CS Chenois is a large organisation with a soccer section, volleyball section, etc. Well worth a try.   
However, if you want to have a bigger choice, here is a list of clubs from the Geneva Handball Association website:

Pragel is closed still. The Sattelegg one is one I've been wanting to do for a while. If you wanted to meet in Pfaffikon SZ tomorrow and attack it from there I would be game. The weather forecast is mixed, similar to today, which hasn't been too bad so far. (Cue huge rain shower!)   
I'm not sure how strong I will be after being sick since Saturday, so pace wise I might be taking it very easy.

4911	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Beginners to running / jogging	Running man	1,258	0	Location: Basel	19.04.2009, 10:42	"    Always run at a relaxed and comfortable pace. This isn’t the Olympics – it’s a lifelong fitness quest. To check your effort level, start a conversation with your training partner. You should be able to speak without gasping or feeling out of breath. If you can’t, then slow down.        Once you reach the magic 20-minute mark, build up to 30 minutes (then 40, 50 and 60). Don’t make the mistake of trying to get faster – don’t try to run your 20-minute course in 19 minutes. Increasing endurance is your first priority.  
Dont look at a watch or even wear one at first as you only compare yourself to your last run. This can be totally demoralising and the biggest achevement is you are out there in the first place.        I don’t have to re-tell the old children’s story here. Running works just like the tortoise-and-hare race. It rewards the patient with weight loss, steady progress, less stress, more energy and a host of health benefits and penalizes the overeager with injuries, burnout and the like. This isn’t a sport for sprinters. Be slow, not sorry.        There must be a billion runners out there, so don’t feel bad if you see someone who’s faster, thinner or smoother-striding. Running is your activity – make it work for you, and don’t worry about anyone else and enjoy it and feel good about what you are acheving.      It's good to start ith other peole going through the same thing as you and come and join us for a run on  , see the calendar.

			Sempachersee has 2 18 hole courses and is worth the visit.  The lakeside course is quite tough and long, woodside the newer one and a bit less fearsome.  By June they will have mowed the hay so it wont be quite a gnarly as before hand (2-3 feet deep, 10 feet off the fairway.)   
Küsnacht is also quite a typical Swiss course not far from Holzhäusern.  Ive never played it but hear it's OK.   
Both are private but will allow visitors who are members of other national golf clubs.

			For all tentative maybe's, undecideds and 'would rather have teeth pulled than run' of you out there - just to say it's great to run in a group - much easier to ignore breathing problems when trying to focus on conversation! Two groups now so different paces, tips from the 'Running Man', great motivation from others - what more could we ask for??! OK,  hot and cold showers? bar? good company? All there! (facilities are great!) - so glad to say the socialising is on the same footing as the running (sorry, no pun intended!)   
Join us and see - make new friends and get fitter - nothing to lose!

4925	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Road biking starting from Lucerne	guayoya	1,223	2	Location: San Diego	10.04.2009, 17:55	" 
			
			Actually there are loads of biking addicts here, so your husband (by that time) won't feel alone. You might explore the numerous cycling threads on EF to know more on this topic. Btw there is a cycling celebrity here who shares the same name   
You can check out the ""calendar"" on the EF and find rides based from Zurich and other places. perhaps closer to Lucerne.   
I recently did this route through Lucerne if that may interest you.      
If you think of renting bikes from Zurich I can recommend shops, but renting bikes is quite common in Switzerland, and you should easily find some in Lucerne, especially given that it is your hometown and it is a tourist spot. Also, you might want to give him a bigger surprise by actually riding with him instead of just arranging a ride .   
All the best.

			Be very careful when using those high pressure water jets.   
Your bike could have many of the bearings being ""non-sealed"", like the headset and wheel hubs, or even the bottom bracket.     
Modern bikes and more expensive models have sealed bearings, others don't.   
You could wash away the grease on those bearings and to regrease them again you'd need to dismount the bike.

			This is actually what I was looking for and it perfectly suits for offpiste riding slightly wider and more flex skis. I really like 103V but they are quite hard to ride on the powder but not impossible though. I might also get twintips for fun so it will cover all the facets of riding next season.   
Shame unfortunately, there wereno sizes for Fadzi only those 178cm models and no boots either!    
I will do some research and let you know soon about the boots.

4933	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Test data for a large number of MTB AM/EN/CC Tires	philh	3,158	0	Location: Altendorf SZ	04.04.2009, 19:06	" 
			
			Hello All,    
Thought this may be of interest.    
I'm sure i read about this article a while back in Bike, but couldn't for the life of me find it the magazine, so I've been trawling around the net and managed to find it online.    
It's test data on various tires, and makes interesting reading.  
Here's how it works;    
RR - Rolling resistance - lower is better. Measured at 2,5 bar or 36 psi on a test roller with 50kg load   
Flattening height - puncture height - higher is better. Distance from which the tire flattens after being dropped from a certain height, it is dropped higher on each test.   
Thorn - puncture resistance using a metal thorn. A is the best.    
Cornering stability/ability - pretty self explanatory. Higher is better.    
Traction - Higher is better.   
Tire types/usage - AM All mountain, EN Enduro, CC Cross country, you get the idea.    
Will try and put these into a spreadsheet when I get a second.

			Been on Uetliberg today, and although indeed have seen some snow here and there, the trail is in near perfect condition. It is a little wet, but not muddy. While it may be challenging not to get dirty at all, the surface is as grippy as it gets. I guess it actually even may get too dry by sunday.  
No riding on the weekend for me though.

I have heard of soccer (footbal) and handball, some mates at work did those. So it does exist. It is generally via a club rather than through work colleagues as you find in the US. Just my two cents, probably not so helpful.

			To get back to the OP's questions, I have a few suggestions.  Note that I have not hiked most of these trails myself; I go later in the summer to be able to hike at higher elevations, over passes that are likely to be snow covered early in the season.   
Choosing three hikes in the Valais is as painful as having to choose   desert from the desert menu    
The OP is planning to hike in late May early June, so higher elevations are tricky, and in any case he writes:   So here goes! Whichever you choose, enjoy   "	Posts: 11	Join Date: Dec 2008	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

4942	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Anybody ever cold-set a bike frame?	Patxi	1,982	3	Location: Near Luzern	01.04.2009, 18:32	" 
			
			If it's steel you ""should"", with a bit of luck, be alright as long as you're not spacing it too much.   
Couple of things to note though - it's worth checking the welds on the chainstay and seatstay bridge before going ahead. If there's any sign of cracking then obviously don't proceed! However if there's rust it might also be a sign the weld is degrading and could fail as you stress the tubing. On a Serotta you should be alright though unless the frame hasn't been looked after.   
Sheldon's advice is, as ever, good but I'd also suggest putting piece of timber along the length of the seat tube between the tube itself and the timber you use as the bending lever. This will spread the load over the length of the seat tube reducing the likelihood of denting it.   
Oh and be careful not to just bend the dropouts as you do it.   
Otherwise give it a go! ... or you could always instead try and source some nice retro components and build it up as it used to be!   "	Posts: 1,323	Join Date: Jan 2008	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 76 Times in 42 Posts	Thanked 1,508 Times in 705 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Hi Carter, I will have to bother you once more. During the 6 months you spent with them, how frequently were you doing teh training, like 3 times a week an hour each? If I get the 10 sessions is that enough you think or should I go with the pay as you go and need hourly sessions.   
Thanks for the feedback

I have traversed to the avalanche runout spot on skis from the top of the Totalp lift which also gets you to meirhoftalli. To say that there is a mountain range in the way is an exaggeration. There is a ridge which separates the two valleys, but you can access both sides from the saddle in the middle. The avalanche conditions can very easilly be similar in both places, and there are steeper slopes on both sides of Meierhoftali.    
Eitherway it was on a directly lift accesiblie off piste area on a resort where you are advising people to go.   
Edit: I will allow myself to be corrected. It is not possible to traverse to the release point from the lift I said, it is however possible to get very close underneath where the avalanche came down. It is still in the same general area, and not particularly good advice to be saying anywhere off piste is safe to those who are not in some way educated in assessing the risk level for themselves.

yes, agree, if you do get stopped, though you need to be up-front about moving, as they will have a record if they go to the database...generally, if you are saying you are moving and you bought the bike in xxx etc., I think they generally will let you through, unless you look or talk in a dodgy manner.

Plus the run back down to Klosters must rate as one of the best in Switzerland and the Parsan run down is a steep and often icy black run.   
Pizol is not a major resort. But is a good 30 minutes nearer Zurich than Lenzerheide or Klosters (and cheaper), but unless there is snow down to the Rhine valley, which will likely be the case at the end of March, you need to take the cabin down...

Even so going through Zurich is not so much an option for me. I will get stuck in traffic at Burkliplatz, The ferry to Horgan or Over Seedam at Rappi are my preferred routes. Possible meeting points Are Uster, Rappi, Horgan depending on which resort will be best.    
There is a slight chance of Föhn tomorrow and if so I will avoid the resorts that get most effected by it. Hoch-ybrig gets a little effected.

			Hi There   
I really reccomend you running with a group as you will get many different pieces of advice from many sources, the thing is you have to find the one that works for you.   
I would reccomend the Zurich running group that has been formed. I think they sound at your level. We have started one up as well in Basel from April 2nd for both beginners and 30 to 40 minute runners.  
I was a qualified British Athletics coach back in the Uk for many years and helped coach many levels from Internationals to beginners and the best advice I always give is run with a group, because you bond new friendships going through the pains and gains of your challenges.   
Regards   
Running man   
p.s. and also look at the runners world website back in England it gives lots of good advice.

			I'd second Eire's post.   Now is a good time to look for last years bikes on sale.  You will often get better equipment than buying a current bike.   And often they only change the coluor anyway.  As for the specific question, yes in my view 105 is a better series - although I am a Campagnolo man myself.

			Well our two kids have used Bobo's at Flumserberg and the Snowli school at Grindelwald. They've also had a few hours each with a private instructor at Flumserberg. IMHO, the Bobo school was OK but I agree with the comments about group size, especially at weekends it's very busy. The private tuition, also at F'berg, was very good but not cheap at CHF 170 for two hours. The Snowli school at Grindelwald was the best though with excellent facilities and a staggering number of blokes and blokettes wearing Swiss Ski Instructor red outfits. The children did a one week full day course at Grindelwald and I think this was the best tuition they've had. Both of them really enjoyed it and the teacher/pupil ratio was good. The facilities are excellent. 
The cost for two children for one week was around chf 800.

			Salsa Lessons....   
I guess I can't help you, I never took lessons in Zürich or elsewhere, so I don't know who could be good or bad.   
However there are many teachers and schools, you could go and check for yourself if you like the style and price of the school.   
Here is a link to the salsa.ch website that has information about schools        
I posted on the Blog my post about places to go to dance and how to learn without a teacher.

			We're late in promoting this as the event is only next weekend, but hopefully there is still time for some adventurous runners and those into orienteering to come out and enjoy the long orienteering course we have set.   
Details are online at   (March is our 1-day event south of Zurich; in April is our 3-day Alpine Stage race for the real endurance nuts).   
The March 7 course starts and ends from the Spiffing Ales brewery in Uetikon (Alte Kleindorfstrasse 65, 8707 Uetikon ZH -- about 10 mins from the Uetikon banhoff), and we suggest you down your sample beers   your go at the course; but it is your choice.   
You have lots of choices, in fact: Come out for a fun day in the woods!  All instructions, as the beers, will be in English!

If Lance can maintain consistent performance throughout the season and then do well in either the Tour or the Giro it will help his credibility. However, if he suffers at any point it could be seen to support the blood doping theory.    
I think he is in a lose lose situation. It will be very difficult for him to win the Tour or Giro in which case people will presume he didn't win because he didn't dope! Of course if he has an off month at some point and then suddenly destroys everyone in either of the Grand Tours...

			This sort of thing is not without precedent of course.  South Aftrica was banned from playing cricket in most countries because of the Apartheid regime (and some say Israel is practicing Arpatheid now....including Jimmy Cater).  And of course there was the 1980 Moscow Olympics and then 1984 LA Olympics which had all sorts of countries refusing to participate on political grounds.   
There was even some in the US calling for boycotts of the Beijing Games this last summer.  Steven Speilberg was pressured to withdraw from the Opening Ceremony organising job due to the Tibet issue.     
I wonder what would have happened if their was a major sporting event in Iran, Cuba or North Korea during the Bush years?   
I suppose it will always be impossible to separate sport from politics.

The Osteopath is concentrating on the allinment side of things and I hope there will be some progression.   
Regarding keeping fit, its hard, I did start with strechting exercises 3 times plus physio, then moved onto running once or twice a week as there seemed to be some improvement.    
Then 3 months ago they said it still wasnt healing and after the MRI to stop all fitness and only go swimming.    
I go once a week but it doesnt do much for me.   
Ive missed the snowboard season, football season and put on 6/7 kilos as well. It sucks monkey arse!

			Male players who are reluctant to accept women in their games are often afraid that they might be outmatched. Being dribbled around or conceding a goal to a girl can be a terrible psychological blow to the male ego. The deflation of the latter is reason enough to encourage women to participate.

			Hi, I tried a few places in Basel but didn't find any that really suited me.  A lot of the clubs were very male dominated and add to that the fact that a lot of them considered wrestling to be part of kickboxing I stopped going.  I have to say I didn't feel too comfortable putting my head between the legs of some random Swiss guy with a whole class of men looking on    
If you do find any good clubs please let me know as I would be really keen to come along once I move back to Basel.

To be honest there are very few resorts I know of that I would say are not suitable for boarding.

			Aeschbach at the rue du Rhône used to do that using Conformable insoles and also did the Salomon and Atomic insoles, But I asked some 2 years ago about those soles and they didn't had them on stock. Probably they are doing it again.   
Ask also at the Ochsner Sports shop or SportXX or the specialized skiing shops if they do it or they could lead you to some place near. or in France close to the border.   
For example there is an ski rental and shop at Geneva center, don't remember the name but is or at the Rue du Neuchatel or the parallel, rue de Fribourg, very close to the rue des Alpes, you'll see it it has 2 doors one giving to each street.

I was a part time swimming teacher while i was back home. Am posted to Switzerland for some new projects. 
I got my BTC (Basic Teacher's Certificate) and am working on my STC (Swimming Teacher Certificate) at the moment. 
These certificates are endorsed by the Swimming Teacher's Association(U.K.).

One tip, billiard tables can be found in Schaan at the Central.

			I just signed up to the local gym and it already makes me feel like a new person, it is so nice (minus the inconvenietly short opening hours) and I have also signed up for the tour. It will be in English so I have to wait. So - I have a few questions for the pros here, I would like to start some good cardio. I already started the eliptical, 30mins every other day for the beginning. What would be the most efficient cardio combo? Should I stretch before? Afterwards? Both? I do not need to lose weight but need some solid postpartum ab work. Thank you for your insights..

			I think you are being optimistic for a fresh layer of snow as the little bit of snow that fell will make no difference whatsoever to the resorts. There might be some more on the horizon for next week though.    
I think there might be a couple of us going to Amden tomorrow, but I am not sure yet. I am going up there this afternoon so I will see what conditions are like and then decide about tomorrow.

			Hello,   
Is anyone here a member of the schooting club in either Zurich or Adliswil ? At the end of this year I will get my C-permit and with it the 
permission to buy guns etc. I want to follow a 300 m rifle training course  
to get some basic gun safety training and maybe become a competing 
member of one of these clubs. 
If you are a member of either club, are they any fun or not that much ? 
Are the training courses also open for, ahem, 'older' beginners (I am 36) ? 
I can only find info about 'jungschutz' (youth) beginners....   
Any help is appreciated !

Also do you know anygood langlaufen shops?? i like the idea of renting a setup for the winter but i cant seem to find this in basel!.

			Thanks everyone for your replies!    
In terms of ski places close to Lausanne I am going often to Los Paccots, and also to Villars/Les Diablerets area. If someone knows about any good ski shops/boot fitters there, it would be the most wonderful. If not, I will certainly think about going to Leysin and possibly to Davos. I also read on a skiing forum about Mountain Air ski shop in Verbier, it was recommended by a few people.   
Again, thanks for all your help!

			This is from the Rothorn, (Zermatt)  saw it from the cabin, but there was only one lonely snowboarder. Looked good, but it was not so near a piste that you could have crossed back. Are the rock areas visible and avoidable as you go down  ?       
BTW, for off-piste, I can recommend the first lift on to the left leaving the station below the Weissfluhjoch on the Parsenn, Davos. There are rocks intermixed, but clearly visible, its great to ride there and you are in sight of the piste, no flat spots. If you like steep, the left side of the piste, flatter on the right. From the left side, you need to cut back onto the piste to the right when you are still 300 meters from the lift, otherwise you'll have to climb back. The right side can be ridden just until you are above the lift entrance. 
This area is really great for ""new"" off-piste riders because you can explore this area gradually, and turn back earlier to the piste if the rocks or unknown gullys ahead freak you out.

			If you are a Cross Country Skier or are looking to try it out, I can highly recommend to you 2 little side by side villages right next to Zermatt.   
They are Tasch (umlaut over the a) and Randa.  There are 12 km for classic or skating.  Tasch and Randa are typical Valais villages.  They are pristine and peaceful.  If you need some nightlife or shopping, Zermatt is literally a 10 minute ride away.  Trains run every 20 minutes so all 3 villages are very convenient to each other.   
I am also going to recommend an excellent teacher:     
Reinhard Zeiter 
Mobile 079 409 0389     
I use him as a teacher and I can say that his method is logical and each step builds upon the next.  In addition he explains why he is teaching a particular theory which is important in the learning process.   
btw, he also does mountain tours.   
Regards, 
Fraueli

			We went to Francois Sports, out in Bremblens just above Morges. It's a huge shed-like place on an industrial estate, specialising in rental stuff. ( )   
A season's rental of skis, boots, sticks and kids' helmets cost around 800 CHFs; that's for 2 adults and 2 young kids. We went first thing on a Saturday morning some time in November, and only had to wait a few minutes for someone to sort us out. He was amazingly thorough, and it took around 1.5 hours to get everything just right for us, fit of boots, best type of skis for beginners, all the bindings adjusted for height and weight, etc. We were delighted with the service.

			Any decent ski shop should be able to send your bindings back to the manufacturer for repair. Very unlikely that you will find a shop willing to try to repair them.    
I used Quattro Sports in Engelberg once to return a pair of bindings to Atomic. I hadn't bought the skis or bindings there but they were nice enough to handle it all for me.

			The first 3-4 years here we used to go EVERY weekend, rain shine, good or bad piste conditions.   
Must admit this really paid off.   
Also when hte conditions are a bit iffy, then the lift Queues are less, but often the restaurants are full, so when you want a quick break that may prove more difficult.

Just look at how the others do before you try getting on one (make sure to point your skis in the right direction before you grab hold of the anchor, and avoid getting hit by one. Better let one or two go than fall over the first thing you do).  Try not to zigzag when going uphill, and be a bit careful when you're getting off so you or the anchor won't hit anyone else when you let go of it.

			There was only that one lift open so the queue was massive (plus the pictures were taken later in the day)   
Opening further lifts is all dependant on snow (looking at the forecasts there is due to be some this week)   
best place to check for laax lift openings is       
There are quite a few resorts starting to open (Davos is due to open on Friday I think)

Hi   
Another option is Athleticum.  In both options though if you can avoid going on a saturday it would be busy as they are very busy and the attention you receive is a little poor.  If you go when they are not so busy it's busy.  If you must go Saturday, go early.   
Look luck and enjoy the season

			Great suggestion Kate. 
We picked up a pair the other week and have found them a very good (tough) work out. I still prefer my roller skis for general cross country training, but the fact that the skikes have a brake and go off-road, make them very versatile and much safer. Perfect for people who have not skied before.   
Beware - you will get a very good, all body workout. Its not the same as cruising along on the roller blades. I guess that's why I like them.  "	Posts: 376	Join Date: Jan 2007	Senior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 115 Times in 73 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

Now, no need to be a steller athlete.  Couch potatoes are welcome.  Only one person in the group so far has run marathons before.  Running a marathon is not ony great exercise, and an accomplishment, when your in a group and supported, it's great fun.  (And this is coming from a person who thinks pizza, gelato, chocolate, and wine are essential parts of life.)   
So, who wants to have a little fun???    "	Posts: 294	Join Date: Dec 2007	Senior Member	Groaned at 4 Times in 4 Posts	Thanked 122 Times in 62 Posts	earned some respect

As I don't think you are here in Switzerland yet, I hope you realise that 'hobbies' like this, can be quite expensive here - and it may not be easy to find exactly what you want, if you need the lessons to be in English.

Having a whole season Winterpass one can play more than 10 times, of course availability and time permitting.

			I just got back in town (Zurich) so apologies for not responding sooner.  I'd be up for some training or racing but there aren't many events in Switzerland!   
As for organized trail runs, I'm not aware of a central site that lists them all.  Compared with the US, trail running in Switzerland doesn't seem to be as big an organized activity (in Boulder, Colorado -- as a contrast -- there are trail runs and ultras nearly every weekend!).   It's a shame as there are thousands of trails and beautiful venues, just not many organizations making it happen.  I have lots of long running routes through the Glarner Alps, Mythens, and Luzern area (it's where we hosted Untamed Switzerland this Spring:  ) if you feel up for a day on Pilatus, Stans, etc.     
If you're looking for an accredited trail run to earn points towards qualifying for future races, I think there's one in Soll, Austria in the next couple weeks that's well established.  It's too far for me to travel to, but it might be worth it to you.

			I've heard relatively good things about diving around Zurich and have seen divers in Lake Geneva. I swam in Lake Luzern recently and the viz was OK. I suspect that, if you like tropical diving or cold water wreck diving, Swiss diving is going to be limited. However, these seem to be the positives: There is a dive shop in Basel, but it is in the process of closing down. The owners are retiring. It is located next to the Tram 1 and Bus Route 36/50 stop at Kannenfeldplatz. They have a lot of stuff heavily discounted last time I went in.

			SNOW!! Don't even suggest that!!   
I am trying to convince my colleagues that this is a good and reasonable trip.  I have 3 kids (aged 4,8,11) and I like to give them decent challenges.  We've been around lake Zug twice now (although Carly, 4) had to be rescued (by my wife, in car) halfway around the last trip since she was becoming too quiet on the rear 3rd wheel behind me and I was concerned she was getting a bit too cold.  This was around a month ago and we cycled for about 3-4 hours in the rain.  I had underestimated how cold it can get here in late summer.  I love the idea of a challenge and some discomfort: it makes you appreciate the luxuries in life - like a hot shower and mug of hot toddie!! 
Thanks again - I'll let you know how it goes.

			I've seen people going pretty hard and long on the treadmills and bikes in the TC Airgate gym in Oerlikon, it often seems the norm...   
...some for example wearing the EWZ vests (electric company - there's a ewz premises nearby, so presumably it's their sporty employees), the same vests I've also seen worn in the Zurich triathlon.   
No pool in the gym itself, but Hallenbad Oerlikon (50m pool, usually with training lanes set aside) is but a 5 minute walk away.

			My two cents:      This is exactly what I'd recommend you do. There are tons of great places to ski, and I think if it's your first winter here it would be a shame to limit yourself to just one or two. I'm a big fan of Portes de Soleil, and there are lots of other excellent places a bit further afield than French-speaking areas. Joining a ski club would probably be the best way to find out about day or weekend deals. Sometime the SBB do train+lift pass deals as well, which could be of interest to you.      Anyone over the age of eight would be bored witless there, not to mention that for the past two years they haven't even had snow.   
Anyway.

			I've windsurfed on lake zurich less then a hand full of times. In a word its terrible. Exactly as Abfab says, gusty inconsistent wind that shifts all over the place.    
Unfortunately, Föhn is pretty much the same. Urnersee is where all the locals go and I've heard so many people speaking of epic Urnersee Föhn sessions. I've sailed a good few times in Urnersee now with Föhn and have been very dissapointed. Yes it gets insanely windy, but the quality of the wind is really bad. 45 degree windshifts and 20+knot changes in windspeed out of nowhere. Add that to a waterstate that is as confused as I have ever seen anywhere in the world and it makes for a challenging but not neccesarily terrible enjoyable sail.   
Aegerisee in Föhn is quite a bit better, but you need quite a strong one to get all the way up there.    
Best conditions I have had in Switzerland are either light Thermic with a 6.8 and 110l board in Silvaplana or  really strong Bise on Lake Neuchatel (3.7 and 80l board) Bise is much more consistant then Föhn and it is around the right time of year for getting it about now!

			Hi All,   
Apologies for my late response, Im just back from a holiday.   
I have a company for coaching children called InterSoccer ( ) and we do after school coaching for 3-13 year olds for boys and girls of all abilities in Geneva region and Vevey. However we do holiday courses in Zug and Zurich which might be relevant for your children (as well as Basel, Bern). We have soccer camps this October half term in all of these regions which will be announced on our website shortly, the Zug camp is in Baar and Zurich is at Seefeld. We will be starting after school courses in both of these regions in 2009 and will be looking to source coaches in these areas soon to hopefully give children more soccer opportunities.   
Some of the children who come to our camps are already members of clubs but also many are not. Unfortunately I do not know the local club scene in this region although I have heard from parents that there is generally a waiting list.    
Sorry cant be of too much help, some our junior coaches who assist at our camps and are at schools in zurich/zug might be able to help more in october with advice.   
Cheers

5162	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Choosing which Mountain Bike to buy	nathan-rahl	1,445	14	Location: zurich	05.09.2008, 20:50	"    I've found three other options on Chain Reaction.        
I bought a Be-One road bike off CRC and have been really happy with it. I reckon the bike was good value for money for what I got and I have been happy with the bike so far. This one seems to be marginally better speced then the GT, so personally I would think about this one. The advantage of the GT is you can probably find a shop in CH somewhere and go and sit on it to see how it fits. This bike like the GT will be quite cross country orientated but will do you quite well for day tours out in the alps too.       
This bike is more a trail bike. It has more suspension travel on the front and appears to have a more relaxed geometry to make you feel more secure on technical decents. If you really want to ride technical trails and put this above all out speed then this could be a good bike. I don't know much about the brakes and the components are around the deore level in the shimano range. Seems like a good value bike for all mountain riding to me.        
A little more expensive, but a bit better speced then the others. If you can afford this and want an XC bike I would go for this one. You may be able to find a dealer here where you can take a test ride too which would be a plus before ordering.    
If you want an XC bike and can afford it I would get the cube. If you want an all mountain/trail type bike the Sarecen could be a reasonable bike.    
I will make a small disclaimer that I have never ridden any of these bikes and am just giveing a gut impression based to the specs given on the site. Google might be your firend to get extra info on these bikes. I know it helped me when I was ordering my road bike from CRC.

			Hello Guys, moving to Basel towards the end of September and would love to find some people that kitesurf. 
I guess, spots are 40-60 min away and probably inconsistent...but would love to check out lake kitesurfing if possible. 
I've seen some windsurfers on the Forum, but not sure how compatible we are...maybe?  Our launch needs are a bit trickier. 
Thanks in advance.

There is a reduction from september 1st.  The area is really nice to go out on the lake.

Both are 3 or 4 hours travel from Zurich though.

No offense taken, just jumped at the opportunity to poke some fun!   
As for the time of year to go up there, I first went end of April this year. Where the ticket machine is, the barrier was down, padlocked. OK, leave car, hike up. Above where you walk through the farm (alt. 1320m), the snow cover was still about 3 feet, and after postholing up to the weekend cabin we decided to turn back. The sign by the barrier said the open season would start the 10th of May, so we decided to wait at least 6 weeks for the snow to vanish. Well worth it!   
It's one of those gorgeous hikes that only locals know about and is definitely off the tourist horde horizon.

I just tried to thank blueshrimp but see that he has been banned.   
Anyway, I followed his instructions and went on this hike yesterday and it is absolutely fantastic!! I travelled nearly 3 and a half hours from zurich to get there, but it was definately worth it. The hike can also be done in reverse, but be warned, it will be a lot more work and will take a lot longer.   
If anyone else has done some nice hikes recently, I would love to hear about them.

			Other fun hikes in and around Zurich:    (the old moat): start off at where the Sihl passes under HB (platform 3 side), follow it to the first bridge on the Bahnhofstrasse side, walk down the steps then simply follow the moat all the way to Bürkliplatz.     : grab the 7 tram to the Zoo, pick your route from the yellow signpost and get trucking.     : take the 13 tram to Meierhofplatz (direction Frankenthal) and hike up the hill. Walk the ridge to Zürichberg/Zoo.     : take the S4 or S10 at HB to Giesshübel, walk back across the bridge over the Sihl, follow the Sihl upstream to, e.g. Leimbach or Adliswil (where you can take the funicular up to Felsenegg on the Albis ridge) or get the S4 back to HB.     : tram 14 to Triemli/S10 stop Triemli, walk up the hill (Hohensteinweg) to the Panoramaweg (recognizable by the globe lampposts) bordering the Üetliberg forest. Walk all the way to Albisgüetli where you catch the 13 tram downhill to the city. If you like to be in the forest, walk up another 100m, there's a road running parallel to the Panoramaweg.

			I just thought I would update you on how the tubing went...   
In the end we set off from Uttigen, and ended up at Camping Eicholz in Bern, and I have to say I had a blast!    
I went with 6 Irish guys, and we had some craic. The weather on Friday was a tad windy so we put on the short wetsuits to keep us cosy. Luckily we escaped any rain, and the whiter-than-white Irish even managed to get a farmers (or tubers) tan.    
The Aare was around 18.5 degrees, so it was no problem to get out and go for a swim.    
I would highly recommend it if anyones looking for something different to try out.

5205	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	HIIT - High-intensity interval training	alaind	1,627	9	Location: .	08.08.2008, 19:56	" 
			
			So we all agree. High intensity endurance gives the most bang for your buck. I have always thought that most running plans are too slow & high mileage. If you are going to run and you're not getting out every day then make it count. Warmup, 20mins fast then warm down. Or if you're headbanger like me, leave out the warm bits. Do fast/slow if you must, but I doubt that it raises the metabolism any more than my method. I, at least, could get pretty decent results (35 minutes for 10k) off about half the mileage that the running magazines recommend. And my weight has increased 2kilos in 20 years.

			I bought a regular backpack and a laptop sleeve.  That way the pack is everyday use, or laptop carrier.  They are about 10-12L big most likely.  Try the larger Athleticums.  I tend to really like their bags and even purchased a nice Salwa bag there for my backpacking travels.   
It is important not to buy a cheap bag as they tend to fall apart.  Eastport, Jansport, Salwa, and other brands are good.  I really beat up my Jansport and it takes it very well.   
Also, look for many divided chambers in the bag.  It always stinks hwen that one thing you want is way on the bottom of your one large compartment.

			Hi all:   
I will be moving to Zürich within the next couple of months and need to find a reputable barn/stable in the Zürich area for my 5 year old Friesian.     
I have found the following link for the one near Binz called Reitschule Kolbenhof and am going to contact the manager.    
However, if anyone has any   that would be great.   
Locations would be East of Zürich (no further than Uster) and West, (no further than Birmensdorf), south (Wädenswil). We would like to avoid areas near the airport if at all possible.   
Can you please email me offline?     
Thanks!

5216	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Cycling in the winter.	etc	3,319	15	Location: Zurich	01.08.2008, 14:47	" 
			
			Hm most people here seem to have a different approach from me. I take the usual Dutch approach which meaning I have non of that expensive 'special' cycling or sports gear.   
What works best for me in winter is a cheap windproof fleece winterjacket which I bought at vogele. Under this I wear a simple T-shirt and that's it. It is cold the first km but after that I am fine. Considering trousers, I wear normal jeans when cycling. This stuff works for me also below 0, I've gone on cycling trips during which the water in my bidon frooze   . My cold spots are toes and fingers...   
My only consession to winter is that I ride around on spiked tires (bought from veloplus) which work great. My cycling to work route takes me through the forest, the dirt roads don't get salted or anything so the tires 
are really necessary. I wiped out a few times every winter before I had these tires, never since.   
Just keep on cycling and change your clothing as the temperatures get lower and lower. This allows you to slowly adapt your clothing and it gives you a good idea of what you need to stay warm.

			Re: how far away is Bern from Baden.   
Trains are good.    
Basically, since switzerland is so small, it doesn't really matter where you live, one can always find a crag that is at most an hour or an hour and a half from everyone. I regularly meet with climbers coming from Zurich, Lausanne, and Zug, often on the same outing, we just meet somewhere not too far for all of us.   
This is for outdoors climbs. For regular, gym rat climbing, obviously, it is more convenient to be in the same town, but I'm not picky.   
Later,

			Do the ride that you enjoy the most!   
If it's nice, you'll keep doing it...  and traffic sucks, even courteous Swiss traffic.   
Everything I've read about riding in car fumes says that you get less fumes riding a bicycle than driving in traffic, since (supposedly) cars accumulate the pollution inside the cabin.  So keep those windows closed!

			Hello,   
sorry for being rude. My name is Renah. We can play at the TC Montchoisi. We have to pay 30 CHF for the court but we can't book a court in advance. So far that's all i know but i keep on searching. 
But if you don't mind, we should try it one day. we show up overthere and see if there's a court available and if not there's a court near the Olympic museum. What do you think ? 
FYI my availabilities to play are in the evening ( from 7 on) and during the week end. Hope it can match your agenda. 
Keep me posted. 
Renah

Yesterday I went to the range at   very nice facilities. We walked some of the course it was in absolutely fantastic condition.    
Fees for joining where not so bad either.   
Do you know of any other golfers in the vaud area? Maybe get a EF golf tournament on the go?

			If you are certified to sail in another country then send your certification to the national governing body in your country and ask them to issue a HOCC (Helmsmans Overseas Certificate of Competency). You may get away with your certification as it stands but officially you should have the HOCC as far as I am aware. It also depends on what you qualified in, if you qualified in a dinghy then they may not cover you to sail a 30 foot keel boat.

 I have already made contact with someone in Zürich who can arrange a game however I would also like to organise a couple of games in Basel as we are flying there and will stay there the night before we fly. 
Many Thanks

			I know the season doesn't start for another four months at least but now the summer sales are on, I was wondering if this is a good time to pick up some cheap gear for next winter? In particular I'm looking for a pair of Oakley goggles and a new pair of boarding trousers but would be interested in seeing any bargains. 
Most of the places I've checked out that I shopped in during the winter have completely changed their stock to summer sports/ skateboarding kit.    
Although the guy who runs Amalgan did say he'd let me look in their store-room after business hours, and I recon a few other shops would be up for this if you have something specific in mind, I was wondering if anyone knows of any boarding/ ski shops near Zurich that still have a decent selection that can be browsed through normally? And if so, is cheap at the moment?  
Or am I best to wait till November if there are going to be start of season sales?

When I took lessons at the Binningen riding school about 15 years ago the instructor spoke English. My daughter has been riding at a couple of different riding schools just over the border in Germany in the Kandern area (about 30 minutes from Basel). She's going to riding camp for a week in August near Kandern.

			Well, in Vaud it is emphatically  ; in Geneva it is equally (perhaps more!) emphatically      No idea what the residents of the French side call it.   
Disclaimer:  It has been many moons since I spent much time in either canton, so the   may perhaps have become reconciled to its official name.

No? The   is the day before, or you can   instead. (Although the Zugspitz one is in the German Alps, which is a bit far from Zurich.) If you're looking for something a bit less extreme, there's also a   happening not too far from Zurich on the 18th.   
Have fun!

5279	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Windsurfing in Switzerland (Neuchatel area)	ehalahmi	3,365	8	Location: Vaumarcus, Neuchâtel	15.06.2008, 16:29	"    In Yverdon you will probably get strong Bise a few times a year (maybe 5 or so). Water/Air temperature totally depends on the time of year. Bise appears to blow strong enough to windsurf more in Autumn. This means that water temperature can be anything from 22deg or more in September to less then 10 deg at the end of November. Air temperature is always cold in Bise.    
You will also get a few Southwesterly days a year (Maybe 5 to 10) that that are sailable on Lake Neuchatel. These days are a little warmer and can happen at any time of year. During the summer with a strong SW storm you could have 20deg air and water.       If your used to surfing warm water, cold water SUCKS! I grew up sailing in cold water, and it was a shock to the system when I moved home from Maui after living there. Modern wetsuits are very good and they make conditions bearable. When it is really cold it takes some time to get used to the feeling of wearing booties etc during the winter. You will get used to sailing in cold water, and spending some extra money on a good wetsuit is definitely worth it. t will make your days sailing so much more comfortable.

			Maybe we should find out some background info first before giving loads of advice!   
Bike for transport or Sport? 
Distance expected to cycle? 
If for Sport, Road or Offroad? 
If offroad, Nature Streets or Singletrails?   
If You are just looking for a bike to potter around to the shops and stuff over short distances, then there is nothing wrong with M-Budget bikes.    
If you are biking for sport then it is well worth spending some extra money and avoid the budget grocery store bikes like the plague.

Wow your fiance sounds like quite an athlete! I actually didnt do IMSA. When i moved to Basel i decided to rather do one of the europe ones instead (give me more time to settle in and not have to battle out the winter on my bike!). So, i am doing IM France in 2 weeks time, and silently ****ting myself because i've had an awful knee injury for past few weeks and dont know if i can finish......fingers crossed.   
WOuld love to get togther for training. Are you guys from SA? Enjoying Basel?

			I can recommend Metabief (in the FR Jura near Vallorbe). It's been open since about May 1st on the weekends.        
It has only 1 lift but there is a proper DH course there (with several variations). It's not difficult except in the trees where it gets rather slippery when wet. The dirt course is pretty sweet, nothing too difficult. A good spot to warm up the bike skills before summer and the big DH resorts.

(randonnees pedestres)	turbodella	2,224	1	Location: Oakland CA	29.05.2008, 09:23	"    This community seems to have quite a few cyclists (both road and mountain), a small number of climbers, and very few hikers.  Or maybe hikers tend to be more solitary?   
I will be hiking in Switzerland during late July and August, but my plans are pretty set at  this stage.   
I can, however, point you to some  .  I would suggest that you order them online (free!) as I have found the PDF versions rather grainy.  The Tours brochure may be the closest to what you need, as it describes a very large (20+) number of village to village (using huts) tours; some of them are way beyond the 3-4 hours you are seeking, but I believe that others may fit your needs.   
Each of the lateral valleys in the Valais has its tourist office, and most organize a ""Tour du Val de Whatever"", with special rates for the whole package (or, in many cases, parts of it).  You will find a list of tourist offices, with their web sites, on my   page.   
I spend most of my time in the Valais, so cannot help much with the rest of this wonderful country!

Yes sir!  At least, that's how I do it.  I guess when I was raving about the compact, I was forgetting about where I used to live.  Flat-land USA.  So, I had a standard double.  That I would swap out for a compact if I was going to be driving out and hitting up some major hills.  Since that'd only happen like twice a year, it was no biggie.  Also, I sort of enjoy wrenching my own bikes.  I'm a proud girl who loves to get her hands dirty, but also loves her pink cycling jerseys.

			In case someone is interested I got a Trek Fuel 100 that could be for sale.   
I say could be, because I really like the bike but is just a tad to high for me.   
It is a 2004 model, 19.5"" full carbon frame, full front and rear suspension, full XTR, tubeless racing wheels and v-brakes.   
I'll sold it if someone is interested. I want to get me exactly the same setup but on a 17.5"" frame.   
Or if maybe I am lucky someone has a similar setup on 17.5"" and is looking for a larger frame we could trade them.

To assist them in advising, I think what you need to state is your intended usage plans.   
Almost everyone I know in Switzerland with a bicycle buys a brand new, top of the range bike, uses it once or twice and then leaves it forgotten in the  cellar bike rooms. 
If this is what you plan then the Aldi bike will be fit for purpose.

We did a full route from Thun to Lucerne on the touring bikes, climbed around 1600m and covered 118km. We were above the snow line for the pass itself, but the road is cleared.     
Warning - section betwen Schangnau and Südelhöhe has offroad/gravel track sections and is unsuitable for road/racing bikes. Route 4 provides a suitable detour to avoid this.

Well depends on the route, but if we take some of the steep sections that MBLume has taken me before (14%), you will be hurting with a heavy bike .   Yes, you can probably get up them but you might wish you didn't

			There's an open golf course not far away from Baden (i.e. you don't have to be a member - and golf memberships are fairly expensive in Switzerland). It's owned by one of Switzerland's largest supermarket chains.   
Here's the link (German only I am afraid):       
And you need to pass a test in order to get access to the greens (Platzreife).   
Having played golf (very badly) in Japan where anyone can play (however bad you are), it was disappointing to find this restriction, although I can understand it given the limited number of courses here.

			Hello,   
I'm leading a small group of cyclists through Switzerland in June. My guests are primarily North American and would like to meet up with local Swiss (or local residents), so am looking for someone in (around) Gstaad and/or Rapperswil to ""Host"" us at their house for a supper/BBQ or something similar in order to foster a cultural exchange. I can subsidize the event for around 40 to 50 Chf per rider. We'll be around 6 or 8 people. We'll be in Gstaad on June 8th (sunday) and in Rapperswil on Thursday June 12th. If those dates don't work, we'll be passing through again in August and September.  
Thanks 
john

			Thanks for this guys.  I'll check out the links and areas.  Though it sounds like most of Zurich has pretty good access to good areas, being squeezed between the lake and the hills as it is.   
Any suggestions on good bike shops in Zurich aswell.  You know the sort of place, wall to wall of shiny bits staffed by social misfits who live, eat and breath mountainbiking and any customer who sounds a bit gemutlik is politely directed to the next bike shop down the road.

That is pretty fast, I guess if the pro's are doing Alpe Huez in 38 minutes or less, I can easily see Sattelegg in 26. I barely make it to Vorderthal in 26.    
Agree it is a good local ride, one of the closer mountain passes to Zurich. And not too high so can be ridden early and late in the season.

We will meet up every Tuesday weather permitting from now on to get out for a spin on the bikes.

			Hey guys   
I've just started working in Zug. I'm keen on the old weights (machines and free weights) as well as a bit of low impact cardio (dodgy leg and all). I was wondering how you'd rate the weights and cardio at Migros?   
The website seems to emphasise the ""wellness"" side of things more than the fitness which is why I'm asking.    
As far as I can tell it is the only gym in Zug, but if someone else knows anywhere else please let me know! Migros does appeal as I sometimes work in Uetlihof, Zurich and the Inter City card means I can go there too.

5344	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Day out Schaffhausen/ Kreuzlingen	am1	676	0	Location: Sydney, Australia	23.04.2008, 22:21	" 
			
			I had a great day out around Schaffhausen last weekend. Get hold of a bike at either Schaffhausen or Kreuzlingen and follow bike path 2 between these towns. This path is well sign posted along the entire length. Full details of all the bike paths in Switzerland can be found by purchasing the veloland guide from   ( I think). It is about 50kms of flat bike path and quiet roads. You basically follow the shore of the Untersee until you get to the Rhine, passing Stein-am-Rhein which is worth a stop and look and finishing in Schaffhausen ( or vice versa depending where you start) with the many beautiful buildings to be found there, and just to finish in style the Rheinfalls at Neuhausen. I just have a townbike so speed was as fast as I put in effort for and it is dead flat and really relaxing ride. The trip is through fields , old hamlets with water fountains and either starts or finishes by the water, and there is always the train along the whole route if you really can't be bothered putting in th effort. 
Thoroughly recommended

They announce sunny weather this Sunday (20th). I live outside of Zurich, in direction of Baden, have a car, and therefore could meet somewhere between Bern and Zurich (such as Olten).

As a keen basketballer, I was wondering if anyone knows of a local basketball competition? I don't have the time to dedicate to more than 1 or 2 nights a week, but I would be interested to see what is out there.   
Additionally if anyone happens to live near a court or a school with some basketball facilities, I would love to know where such things are. I don't mind if it's indoor or out door, I would love to just have a run.   
So any advice or information is very much welcome.   
Cheers.

			Hello,   
we are organising tennis meetings for this season.   
link here :    
maybe it would be interesting for you to come and participate.   
There are many tennis instructors in Zürich, you can get information about them at the Mythenquai this saturday or at the Vitis center where we'll move the event in case of rain.   
one of our participants is a tennis instructor so you can meet her then.   
As about tennis instruction in Switzerland, AFAIK, the licensed instructors work in connection with the clubs and the city managed tennis facilites with prices ranging from 80-120 per hour or if you get group courses a little less.   
I know some instructors that freelance ( without a swiss license )  for around 50-60 / hour.   
I took a lesson with one of them , He usually teaches at the Mythenquai and the lesson went well, but I can't recommend him to you as I feel he didn't teached me the right technique from the beginning.  Maybe that is his method and he gets more demanding when you start to improve.   
But when I took my real lessons  ( in Peru ) with a pro instructor, he corrected me from the beginning the technique and I realised that I had learned all wrong.

			Any idea what sort of dance you want to learn?  If you want to learn social dance there are a couple of instructors who know English at K'Danse.  There are a couple of instructors at Tango Folies who speak English, if you want to learn Argentine tango.  Many instructors in group classes do not want to spend time translating and saying everything twice.  If you're serious about studying dance, you can take private lessons with an English-speaking instructor and you'll learn faster.

			Due to weather and possible trail conditions I am giving 2 other options for a MTB meet up this Saturday.    
Option 1: Meet in Ticino and do a tour down there. The weather should be sunny, and warm. The trails will be dry as they have had very little rain down there. I haven't picked out a tour yet, but I did a fun one down there over Easter so worst case scenario we could do that one again.    
Option 2: Meet in Gurten and do some skills practice on the trail there. You can get train up and ride down all day long. Its a really fun trail and good for improving your skills. Weather should be dry and about 12-14 degrees.   
Option 3: Go to Jura. Trails will probably be wet, we might get some rain, and it will probably be below 10 degrees!!!   
I have posted an event for this meet up. If you are coming please register  .

Just find the thread and missed the ride (I suppose it serves me right for doing searches using cycling rather than browsing the threads in this section).   
As an enthusiastic beginner, I'll be interested in joining some group rides.   
As much fun as cycling round the lake on my own is, it does get a little old after a while.

Yes, they have public courses. 
The green fee is about 60 CHF for 18 holes. If by any chance, your husband works for Nestle, he can get a membership at the Lavaux golf course for CHF 2'300 / year. 
If you have a handicap card from just about anywhere in the world, its good enough to be allowed to play at most courses. 
The one in Lavaux is about a 25 minute drive from Vevey, and the one close to Montreux is about the same distance on the other side. You can even go to courses in France less than an hours drive away and cheaper than the ones in Switzerland. 
You can rent the clubs sure, but I think that would be quite expensive and I would recommend that your bring your own clubs.

Just wondering if there are any other ex-pats out there joining in the Berner Grand-prix on 10 May 2008? If anyone is looking for company, then let me know. We could meet before or after the race or take the Train from Zurich. I've already signed up for the main run (Das Original 10 mile/16km) which I completed last year in about 1h25m if I remember rightly.   
Also if anyone is interested in training runs before 10 May, up to the race distance in the Zurich (Wollishofen) area prior to the race, let me know also!       
Cheers 
Grahame

			H there,   
I had moved to Switzerland about 3 months ago and managed to establish good contacts with a few advanced players including professional instructor. Nonetheless after a while you might find it that... unless you are German speaking or know some people with whom you have had opportunity to demonstrate the level of play, then it is only more accommodating.    
You might check out a good indoor tennis centre called Vitis in Schlieren, which I regularly play at and I would recommend judging by the fact that prices are not very prohibitive. In Zürich prices vary and are usually higher than on the outskirts. You might also check   where all the clubs in Schweiz are listed.   
I would like to to play regularly at least 2-3 times per week with intermediate or advanced players. I more less play on the level at R3 or R4 according to the local ranking methods (R9-R1) where R9 is a beginner and R1 advanced. If you are willing to try singles or doubles let me know. 
If need any help regarding how it works here I can try to answer your questions...   "	Posts: 5	Join Date: Feb 2008	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			If you are looking for a bargan, go to Jumbo, Migros, Coop. Make sure you get carving skis for them. YOu could even go to a ski rental shop and buy some old ones or maybe even free. 
Nothing wrong for buying for others, just be sure you keep in mind their weight and height. Beginners don't need the best anyway, ladies or men, most are neutral. Get them fitted and adjusted to their exact weight by a pro.

			Salsa_Lover has mentioned   already, but I'm not sure if it is public of reserved for club members (see link). Then there's also the   complex with six tracks, same applies here.     's a list of sport facilities of the city of Zurich (without the baths). They're usually public but club members may have priority on some of them. The mentioned Sihlhölzli is the biggest facility to my knowledge, but it is situated near a busy road. I'd check your options in your own commune first, it's an infrastructure many of them can provide.

Thanks for the reply. It seems that those sports are not practiced here to any great degree. I have been using the Uni Basel gym, which has squat racks and that is ok, I was wondering more from the training side, as I'm only really starting out and would benefit from some training advice and coaching.   
I'm not much bigger than you either at 79kg ;-) but I'm working my way up the strength ladder. Have you by any chance heard of Crossfit?

			At least on the snow reports for cross-country skiing, the reports tend to be overly optimistic. There are often bare patches in the middle of the trail despite them claiming to have a very good base, which must have been measured at the very best spot rather than an average. They will also generally claim that the overall conditions are ""good"" / ""gut"" when I would classify them as marginal or poor. About the only useful and accurate statistic seems to be the amount of trails open.

Any other suggestions? I'm mostly daytripping from Bern, but could go further afield for a weekend or at Easter. And I'm sure there are others who could also use this information.

			The local football club is Zug 94 but four years seems too young. Have you seen children of this age playing football in clubs in Zug?   
There's a list of clubs that are active in the city of Zug  . Maybe some other sport clubs welcome younger kids, too?     
ps. You should update your location in the profile.

			Do bare in mind that there is no central federation at amateur level, so if you have an idea as to where you will live, go in the Regional Verbaende section and choose the Verband you'll be part of and contact them.   
I'm pretty sure you will have no problems finding games to ref, there is a chronic shortage of refs.     
The football season in the amateurs league goes from early August until early December, then winter break, then it restarts early March up until June. There is not that much indoor football I'm afraid.

5412	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	how many skiing lessons do you need?	cremebrulee	8,788	25	Location: Zurich	07.02.2008, 13:03	" 
			
			I think the best advice so far has been to split the lessons up. Once you've been told how to stand, shift your balance and string together some plough (or parallel) turns, depending on your aptitude it will take you one to ten hours of practice before you're comfortable getting from top to bottom of a baby slope. There's really no point paying for lessons during this time, you just need to practice. 
When you're happy with that, get more lessons to show you parallel turns, carving, better technique etc and keep practicing what you learned. 
When I started, I had a week of all-day group lessons and I would have been better off having a one hour lesson each morning and practicing on my own for the rest of each day, which is effectively what we did, except we ended up paying an extra 5 hours each day for the teacher to watch us practicing what he taught us that morning.   
Obviously if you're rich, by all means have permenant lessons. Even pros have coachs and can benefit from lessons, but I'd say the most cost effective way to learn is to have an hour or two of lessons and follow up with private practice till you feel ready to learn more.

5415	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Skier to Snowboarder, the transition...	MattM	2,324	36	Location: Männedorf	26.02.2008, 12:20	"    How they feel in the store is (unfortunately) not necessarily a good indication.   
I enjoy skiing and boarding in equal amounts.  While I do own my own snowboard kit, I have always (in the past, at least, I've decided to splash on some ski boots in the end-of-season sales) rented ski boots.  I've tried on boots that were uncomfortable initially, but quickly ""bedded in"" and were fine for the rest of the day.  Conversely, I've tried on boots that seemed fine inside the building, but nearly had me in tears after less than an hour of skiing.   
Snowboard boots, while softer, are no panacea either.  I've had more than enough of them cause me pain.  Even the boots I own, for the first two days I used them, were agonising - but once they'd moulded to my foot (or my foot had moulded to them  ) they were (and are) like wearing a pair sneakers.   
While I would encourage anyone to try both skiing and boarding, I must echo the sentiments already expressed that ""bad boots"" should not be a reason for changing from one to the other.  If ski boots are painful, then you either need better fitting boots, or you have very weirdly shaped feet - and in the latter case snowboard boots are unlikely to be much better (although you might get lucky).   
It's also a bit like buying a motorcycle helmet, in that certain brands have certain shapes, and some people just don't fit into some of those shapes.

			Langenbrueck's got a couple of T-bars, but doesn't get much snow.   
There are a couple places in France nearby, and Feldberg in Germany.  But the drive is on slow roads, and to be honest, you'd be better off just going to Flumserberg or Titlis and get much better conditions.  They're only a little further away, but much higher in altitude.

			Heya    
Your best bet on looking for stabling is to go and visit them,talk to the people.  I had the fun of looking for new stabling for my ex racer last year and I found looking on the net to be ok but one really needed to talk to the people who will be doing the day to day care of the horse/pony.    
Look for a place that has lots of paddocks, many I looked at didnt have nearly the amount of paddock space that I would ecpect for the number of horses be stabled there.    
I would highly reccomend my stables in country Aargau ( ) but I not sure that this would be an option for you... I think your looking more at the mountian areas??    
As for insurance, I am not sure about insurance for transporting but I used to have insurance for giving lessons through  Die Mobiliar (  ).  This used to be about CHF400 per year if that helps  you to compare anything.   
All the best for the move and I hope everything goes smoothly.

5436	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Yoga	Neonfish	4,444	9	Location: Canton Vaud	03.03.2007, 21:49	"    Hi, we at   in Zurich will feature an 'Easing Back Pain' workshop at our yoga studio on May 27th, 2007. This workshop will be taught in English.   
This workshop will bring you the knowledge, understanding and practical techniques to enable you to reduce and manage back problems.   
We usually recommend our clients when they indicate to have back problems to consult with a nearby osteopath. Like this we can rule out that there is any clinical condition causing the back problem.   
The good news is that research has shown that only 10% of all back pain needs medical attention ( x-ray, operation, etc., yoga probably not appropriate ). In 90 % of the cases no medical attention is required and can resolve completely through yoga.   
You are more than welcome to drop in to our studio and ask for me so that we can assess what the best way forward is for you; If a group class would or would not be suitable for you, if you need a private program etc.     
Best wishes, 
Andre

airgate is actually now right next to a tram stop, if you take number 11, because they recently extended the line.

			Would love to come, but only for the weekend and need a place to stay. Can you recommend a place in Montreux to stay, so that can join you in your drive. I have started skiing recently, but feel absolutely fine on reds and even some blacks. Skiied in Verbie a few weeks ago and loved it. It is a relatively long drive from Montreux to Verbie, expecially if there is Lusanne traffic. Would you have space for my skiies and boots in your car also?

I agree, a racing bike with 23mm tyres, an aggressive riding position, and a stiff frame wouldn't be ideal; however, I'm happy on them with a touring bike with 28mm tires, drop handlebars, strong brakes, and a cushy steel (cromoly) frame. Fat tyres and suspension would be complete overkill for the parts that I've found, although you could certainly use that kind of bike quite happily.

			Most of the hotels at the ski resort will be booked up at weekends, I would suggest trying hotels at Bad Ragaz if you don't mind a short drive - only about 15 miles I guess. It's a nice town with a few decent looking hotels and good restaurants and there is also the casino. Most of the other towns round here are pretty quiet in the evenings - in Flums you have the delight that is Henry's Pub and the Baghdad Palace Kebab House.   
If you want something really quirky, you could try this place on Flumser Klineberg. Run by an English couple and their 8 lamas....       "	Posts: 20	Join Date: Aug 2007	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Engelberg is only a little further away from basel that feldberg. The skiing is adequate for beginners and learners (although in my opinion not so good for intermediates, where really long blue runs & would be better. The reds & limited balcks are fine for a day out). Do remember that Engelberg, like Saas Fee, is north facing. This means you don't get to ski in the sunshine & it can be several degrees colder than other villages/resorts & inadequate kit would be a mistake!     
You might like to try Davos or Klosters. They're not too far away, certainly when compared to Zermatt & french 3 valleys. You'll be lucky to find hotel accommodation at short notice though.   
My best find is this website:  . It is in english and has lots of well thought-out features for finding ski resorts & providing information about them.   
Where ever you go, get there early (not later that 09:30) or you could end up parking a long way from the lifts, and kit hire will can take a while - Oh, and pre-book lessons!   
have fun!

Climbing times: weekends, but I can make it in the evening as well.

There are hotels (mostly Austria, but some in Switzerland, Italy & Germany) called Kinderhotels that have excellent childcare, and are really child-friendly, ie have eg built in baby baths and all the baby equipment you might need so you don't need to lug loads of stuff  with you

			Hey Noogie,   
Sorry but I can't help you with the climbing... my fear of heights stops me with that!   
But as for the snowboarding, pretty much every resort has a snowboard school. You can just decide where you like to go and then check out the school there. If you are going to head away for a few days it leaves more options open to you. Traveling back and forward from Davos, Laax or Lenzerheide can be a bit tedious, even though thats what I normally do myself. If you do decide to go this route I can recommend the Primus school in Lenzerheide. I took a one off lesson there once and they were really good.    
If you are looking for somewhere that is easy day trip distance from Zurich then most people here on the forum will probably recommend Flumserberg to go and learn. Personally I find it very cold (sun only really shines on one piste), and the lines at the lift can be horribly long. I learned from scratch in Hoch-ybrig,and despite one or two anxious moments on the first day it worked quite well.    
You can check out the website myswitzerland.com for  , they allow you to select the resort by region and it gives you information about the resort as well as a link to their website.    
If you have anymore questions just ask.

They also do powder days, if you register with them they will send an email when ever there is a forecast for snow, the first good day after the snowfall then they organise the powder days. They cost 135CHF for the guide, any extra expenses such as lift ticket you need to pay for yourself. If you don't have an avalanche transceiver and necessary equipment you can also rent it from them. This is my tip for getting in more powder then you ever dreamed of. Most of the day trips they do are close to Engelberg, so they should be worth checking out.   
If you have any other questions just ask. I hope this helps.

Oh... None of the resorts here discriminate against snowboarders, if they are open they are open to all.

How was it?    
Am looking for somewhere to go tomorrow. Engelberg was top of my list, but has been closed today due to strong winds, which look set to continue for the weekend....   
Any insights re snow conditions, how many lifts were open etc, would be gratefully received     
thanks

Location is (as always) the astroturf at Brunau, check the links to the right if you have any questions.   
No need for existing Footylist members to re-register, would be nice if those new to the community did.   
Goals (7s and 11s), ball, etc will all be available.

5496	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	buying new marathon bike	Dr D	1,951	15	Location: uster	02.12.2007, 12:28	" 
			
			Marathon generally refers to MTB marathons in my humble experience.    
My girlfriend and I just ordered new bikes at a LBS in Zurich on saturday. This guy is offering 15% off bikes ordered before the end of December which is quite a good discount by Swiss standards. He will build you a semi custom bike, pick your frame and he will get a build kit together for you to build the bike you want.   
I personally was looking for a bike that I could do marathons on, but could still take to a bike park or do some alpine descents on without shaking my back teeth on, so managed to put together a 12.5kg bike with 140mm of travel (A little heavy for a pure marathon bike, but I just want to participate not win!)  Most marathon bikes are hardtail or have only 100mm travel at the back I think he could put something together for you without a problem.      is his website, I can highly recommend him. My girlfriend bought her first bike off him, and now we have just ordered two shiny new bikes.

I sorta feel like I'm posting a personal add but what the hell....   
I've started doing yoga at the Bikram Yoga studio and just thought I'd see if there is anyone else out there either already going or interested in going? I work in the afternoon so I tend to go at either 9:30 or 12 during the week.  
I've also been looking into some other studios around Bellvue and will try to check them out sometime too.   
I'm not really ""hard-core"" or anything, but I like the workout and its taken me a bit of time to get back into it after moving here. Plus, having someone to talk/hang-out with would be nice! My boyfriend is great, but that only goes so far      
PM me if interested

5536	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Tennis: Where is the cheapest court in Switzerland?	HAT	1,688	4	Location: Zurich near Zug	04.11.2006, 16:00	" 
			
			Hi 
I like to play more tennis but am limited to the high robbery prices here at around 50chf per hour per court (after 1800hrs usually on weekday and on weekends). This is the price around in Baden areas, Birrhard and Baregg.   
I tried going to nearby Germany which cost about half that price, but the driving is a pain.   
Anyone else have prices to contribute on where to get cheaper hourly rates? (not yearly or winter abonnement pls).   
Also, anyone for tennis? I am not a beginner but not a hard-hitter. 
You can PM me.

			Had swom for a couple of times at Oerlikon. During weekdays seems pretty crowded, and even in the ""Tempo"" lanes you get people nearly with no clue how to swim (i.e. it's impossible to train properly). After 8.15/8.20pm the situation gets better (tempo lanes gets occupied by proper swimmers) but you don't get much time afterwards. Around 8.45 they start to modify the lane disposition, then get rid of some of them making a big pool-lane and leaving the few lanes available for some scuba course. Oh-oh, I said 8.45, weren't the pool closing at 9pm? Maybe I don't remember exactly... will check tomorrow.   
This was on Tuesday, maybe other days will be different. But I've got the impression that it's possible to swim decently only on lates during the weekdays.   
Situation is completely different on Sunday. Yesterday have been there from 4pm to 5.30pm, it's been beautiful. An entire lane for me, have been able to achieve 10x100 front crawl with 30"" rest (next step is to reduce rest from 30 to 15""). Then some mixed sessions, ah, I have to buy a tablet to grip on for doing legs, there are no tools available for the free swimmers in the pool.   
The pool is pretty clean and well made. I have to admit swimming on a 50mt pool makes the difference, as you don't have the possibility to give you the sprint every 25mt and gain some distance relaxing the muscles, but I think I will get used to these 50mt :-) It also passes quicker to do the 100mt as it's just 2x50.   
Now waiting for somebody to join me.       
Fabio

			Which RYA licence is it... there are many schemes.   
Dinghy Dayboat Scheme and Cruising Scheme are probably the ones you are talking about. If you have level three in the dinghy dayboat scheme or day skipper in the cruising scheme then you are eligible for the Helmsmans overseas certificate of competency which will allow you to sail overseas.    
Depending on what you want to rent or sail you may not need one. I was told that to rent a boat on the lake in St.Moritz that I could just come pay my money and go. I didn't try this yet but it will be interesting to see!   
My guess is if you want to rent a dinghy they will probably let you off after checking out out. If you want to rent a keelboat or cruiser you will probably need to show some paperwork.

I'll then get a meeting with FC Hard to thrash out the details.

5575	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	"Mountain Biking Trail with ""boardwalk"""	DaveA	3,348	24	Location: Appenzell	22.02.2007, 14:36	"    Um, basically go up the Käferberg or Höngerberg depending on which bit of Zürich you're coming from (I start from Bucheggplatz), go though the ETH Höngerberg campus heading west and through the forest, keep heading west over the Gubrist and you soon get to the Altberg - it's just west of Regensdorf. There's a nice  route up which ends at a cafe/restaurant, and a heisse Schoggi later, you can then go back down the lovely single trail all the way. It was a bit muddy, but then trails round Zürich are renowned for that. Anyway, it's ideal for a post-work run in the summer.    
As for the Singletrail maps, I'll see Thomas Giger (they're his baby) on a course in early April so I'll try to remember to ask him what the story so far is on the  Romandie coverage.

I'm arriving in Lausanne on Friday for a month or so to do a language course. I wanted to know if there's some sort of a swimming club or a non competitive team or group practicing together. I'm a student at Tel Aviv university and usually swim with a couple of friends; we do around 3-4 partices a week, mostly just swimming laps, 2-3km max per practice, freestroke style. Though we try to improve both our strength, endurance and technique from time to time it's still just amateurish in nature with no other pretensions (just enjoying the swim, the practice and the company      If theres something similar I could join for the duration of my stay that would be great, I did something similar in Germany and really enjoyed the experience.

			Hoochie! They're called Zelttuch or Militärblache in German. The official liquidation shops of the army are:           
Dick's Army Shop must buy them there, too (probably in large quantities). So it's second hand material. Both of the above shops have their offers online but not in English. You'll have to download some PDFs to know all the offers. Swiss Army hoochies are not rectangular but square.   
Although every hoochie is second hand, there are some differences in age: The hoochies with red spots in the camo pattern are the newest. Hoochies without red spots that have a camo pattern on both sides are older. Some of the older ones are marked with yellow paint at a corner, this is the lowest quality and means that they are leaky. But I don't think they're on sale anymore.

			I am just putting together notes for an article about swimming areas 
on  . Tell me if you think I should add something. 
Graham     
PS In Monbijoustr, find the Titanic building, 
and come and visit me sometime. In the summer I  
often go for a lunchtime swim at Marzili from 12 to 2. 
Ask for me at the reception desk.  
Graham Tritt     
--------------------------------   
City open-air swimming areas   
Marzili 
The place to be and be seen, for the young.  
It's no more the ""meat market"" of bare flesg 
that it was a few years ago, there are typically five thousand people  
on any hot day. 
Nearby under the Monbijou bridge, two beach volleyball courts. 
A walk up the river, a kilometer to the Schönau bridge (cross to reach the Dählhölzli zoo) 
jump in and float back down. For good swimmers only, and always go with someone  
you can trust.   
Paradiesli private for women, and an area at the other end with 
river pool which in principle is private for the men. 
European style changing rooms - open to view, so your hanging clothes are  
reasonably secure. A private room for women to change, men don't need this, of course. 
On a few evenings there is openair cinema, but the choice of movies is pretty limited.      
Ka-We-De, 
next to the Dählhölzli woods and the Zoo. 
A large shallow pool, which in the winter is an ice rink, and  
a smaller pool which is the only place in Berne with a wave generator. 
Excellent with children, there is a 60 meter slide. There is an entry fee here.     
Eichholz, in Wabern, follow signs to walk ten minutes from the No 9 tram station. 
There is an occasional bus 29. Nearby there is a large park for recreation  
including grill areas. The best place if you want to stay long in the evening. 
Swimming is in the river, on a warm day you can float two kilometers down to  
Marzili and walk back.     
Weyermannshuus 
A large pool, more than a hundred meters across, 
the best location for families with small children.     
Wylerbad, in the northeast, a short walk from the new Wankdorf railway station. 
A large swimming pool, a diving pool, plenty of room for sunbathing, 
good for families.     
Lorrainebad, a pool built on the Aare riverside, river water only. 
Reached by a walk of ten minutes from the Lorraine quarter, 
it has a a good location for sunbathing (FKK area).     
Surrounding towns 
It is worth making a visit to each of the pools, you will see which  
you like best.   
Köniz Weiermatt, newly renovated, a great area for family and young, 
with water slide. Expensive for Bernese (5.-), near bus line 10.         
Muri, pleasant and relaxing, with pool and river sunning and swimming area. 
Cheap for residents, it is a long walk from public transport   
Belp - river pool on the Aare, picturesque natural setting, 
a five meter diving tower. 
The only public transport is the Airport shuttle which stops nearby, 
but it is a perfect stop on an Aare bicycle tour.   
Ostermundigen, on the east side under the hill, 
excellent for families, with slide.   
Hirzenfeld, a pleasant location between Bremgarten and Münchenbuchesse. 
It has minigolf range and tennis courts, and the longest slide (88m).   
Münsingen - a large and friendly area offering lots of sports, 
next to the Aare river.     
Further away 
Strandbad Thun, pool and lake swimming,  
A half kilometer away, near boat hire, tennis courts, and the stage for musicals on the lake 
 there is a little island where you can barbecue and swim.   
Aarberg, on the Postbus Berne to Aarberg, or a 10 minute walk from the railway station.    
Murten, a large hall and an open pool, water slide, volleyball, and access to the lake. 
Nearby on the lakeside promenade (in Muntelier) there is also a large open area where you can swim   
Biel/Nidau 
A very nice pool on the side of lake Biel. It is also possible to swim in the lake for free 
from a park at the Neuchatel end of the town.   
Lyss 
A great park area, with openair cinema in the summer.   
Worb - four pools including one for diving pool, sport and grilling area.   
Kerzers - close to a rail station, and next to the Papiliorama butterfly and 
bird paradise ( )    
Also Kirchberg, Uetendorf, Spiez, Steffisburg, and other towns.      
And it is worth a trip to  
Schiffenensee betwen Fribourg and Murten (camping and minigolf) 
Faoug and other lakeside  
beaches on Murtensee - Sugiez, Motier, Muntelier 
Burgseeli in Goldswil near Interlaken 
Estaveyer le Lac (with waterskiing) and Portalban on lake Neuchatel     
Schwarzsee, Lauenensee,  
Aquaparc in le Bouveret Valais

			I'm looking to join a velo club that has an English speaker or two. I'd like to have a group to ride with that trains to race. Preferably around Wadenswil, Horgen, Richterswil. Any tips appreciated. I've ridden with the Wadenswil club but my lack of German made it tough to communicate.   
Also - if anyone is planning to race at the Seeland Classic in Bern in May, let me know.   
Thanks, 
Velo

			Hi there,    
Firstly, you might want to check with the hotel, as many offer basic workout facilities (although not usually with free weights) or have arrangements with nearby gyms.    
I know of two gyms near to your area,   and  , but I don't know about short term membership. I'd suggest you call or drop in and ask. I'm sure McFit has a single entry option. It definitely has lots of free weights.     
There's a thread here where we discuss some of the Zürich gyms       
including this excellent review of McFit:     
Good luck,

			Hello to all the thrashers out there.   
Am looking to organise a golf network with a couple of guys from Bern & Geneva for this season.   
The premise being that we meet once a month form April through to October & play at a variety of courses.   
At present we have plans to play at : Moseedorf, Signal de Bougy & Oberkirch.   
We have a wide variety of handicaps from 14 through to 27, so it can be as challenging or as social as we want to make it.   
Anyone interested drop me a line to :    
Cheers

5629	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	I need some tips about bodybuilding	Rahul	1,732	14	Location: zurich	21.02.2007, 23:23	" 
			
			hi there,   
you can avoid the weight machines, that isolate muscle groups, altogether and still build muscle. All you need is a squat rack, a swiss ball and some dumbells. I would stick to free weights. This way your body will have less support and therefore will have to work harder to stabilise itself during the exercise. More calories burnt off!!   
As a beginner you will build up muscle and neural adaption quickly   
Remember to stop immediately once you feel you're not performing the exercise perfectly. Otherwise it's just bad information for your muscles.   
Cardio and Weight Training: Perform these on separate days if you want to bulk up. 15-30 mins of cardio will release glucocortocoids, which are stress hormones. These are catabolic which means they break down tissue and prevent additional muscle tissue being formed. As with the weight training do 5-10 mins of one type of cardio and then switch. Keep your body guessing.   
Nutrition: Very important as previously mentioned. The way the food reacts in your body is not because of any intrinsic ingredient in the food. It's due to the metabolic balance of your body. The rate at which your body burns carbohydrates (Glycolysis) and proteins and fats (Beta Oxidation) will depend on your genetic make up and your environment.   
I recommend the book How to Eat, Move and Be Healthy by Paul Chek. Pretty good stuff in there and easy to follow!   "	Posts: 264	Join Date: Oct 2006	Senior Member	Groaned at 5 Times in 3 Posts	Thanked 60 Times in 33 Posts	an excellent reputation

			Hi All,   
I was in Scuol (Engadine) for boarding on Wednesday and Thursday and thought I would give a little info for those wondering how the snow is now there has been a fall.   
Piste conditions were very hard pack, with only very rare (and small) ice patches, so ideal carving conditions.  Off piste was mostly non existant as it was very windy on wednesday and so the area is hard blown.  In a few accumulation places there is powder, but shallow (<20cm) uneven (fast changes from hard pack to ~50cm deep in little gullies) and quite hard underneith, not icy though.  An exception is one fantastic patch (traverse as far as possible from the top of the high T-bar to the right), includes 2+ walks over rubble, but then there is a full powder slope that pops back out onpiste without walking (or pushing if you ski!), its hard in places but mostly a nice 50cm gradient from the hardpack base to fairly good powder near the top.  There was a thin crunchy cap on it in most places, but nothing serious...   
The talabfahrt was closed as they are cosntantly making snow there (maybe open this weekend?), but we gave it a try and with the exception of one small area with lots of grass and rubble coming though it was a good run to town, but don't take your new skis!   
so general - if you like good hard pack for carving on piste Graubunden looks good at the moment...   
Andrew

The annual membership fee is quite fair and you can participate at all other offers as well. I do spinning there once in a while.

			Hi 
Flims Laax is open on the glacier but according to Radio Züichsee there will not be much skiing in this area before Christmas. At Ibergregg the kinder lift is open but its pretty heavy leg breaking stuff at the moment. We need a couple of days of very cold weather to freeze it all down. Last year we had snow early Dec but a warm week before Christmas so it did not settle down till Jan. 
Today its snowing down to about 700 meteres

Normally we provide a drinks stop during the run plus refreshments at the end before we head to the restaurant.       We normally take a small fee - about SFr5 - (known as ""Hash Cash"") for the club funds and to reimburse the hares for the cost of providing flour and drinks. Virgin runners do not pay anything. You pay for your own meal at the restaurant.    
For more info, check the BSH3 website: -         The Hash House Harriers is a running/drinking/social club which was started by bored expatriates in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1938. (""Hash House"" is the nickname of the restaurant/bar to which they retired for food and beer after a run).    
Hashing is based on the English schoolboy game of ""Hare and Hounds""; a Hash is a non-competitive cross-country run set by one or more runners called hares. The hares run out in advance of the other runners (the pack of hounds), and set a course marked by white flour.    
We welcome people of all running ability from ""none at all"" to top marathon runners. If you are not a runner you are welcome to stroll along.    
We endeavour to make our trails child and pushchair friendly making for an ideal family day out.    
We get people from all walks of life attending and it is a great way to make a few friends – especially if you are new to the area.    
For more general info about Hashing check this article.       
Cheers, 
Nick

			That sounds awesome, but I can't be sure of availability.   
I always used to run the City to Surf in Sydney in fancy dress with mates.  14km from the city centre out to Bondi.  Awesome fun!

			I'm watching via NASN, which I ordered as an addition to the Cablecom Digital package. Failing that, I'm sure its available on ESPN or something as well, for a fee of some sort. At least, I know they do that with regular season games.

Have you been running with the Zurich hashers yet?  Their boss guy, Chainsaw lives in Oerlikon too.  I ended up at a party there after this year's Sola run.  I think they finish their runs there quite often   "	Posts: 175	Join Date: Sep 2006	Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 11 Times in 8 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Ok I made it to river Rhine last week. The river was awesome! It was my longest non-stop mountain bike trip-->60kms :-) Coming back was torture for me.The journey was completely safe. People on the way were very friendly (I asked them for directions). 
I will be going there two times a week as long as the weather allows. Next time I will follow the river and try to clock 100kms. Wish me luck :-(

5663	Sports  Fitness  Beauty  Wellness	Muscle weight?	Nil	-	-	Location: Basel	14.02.2013, 10:26	"    For a normal adult 1-3 kilo fluctuations in weight can be due to a number of very natural things, such as water weight, your body retaining more nutrients in response to your increased activity level, etc. etc.  Keep up the exercise and don't forget- weight is just a number anyway; if your body feels and looks better to you (but that number doesn't change much), then what you're doing is a success.
