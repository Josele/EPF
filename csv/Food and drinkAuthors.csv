			Also on the hunt for good coffee in Lausanne, I tried Sleepy Bear with high hopes but sadly it missed the mark. The place looked good but the taste didn't follow through. Currently back in Sydney having all the coffee I can before returning to Lausanne BUT have come across a coffee truck that moves around the Lausanne area called Sydney Cafe. In La Ripponne twice a week. Might be worth a crack? Has anyone tried this?

When you get off the train in Zurich HB, walk towards the 'big clock' meeting point, past the L'Occitane shop on your right until there's a big exit on your right. Take it, walk out to cross the street and the street you want is right in front of you on the left side (Schutzengasse). Yumi-hana is on the right side about 60m farther.     
P.S. Love your Labi pup picture. Reminds me of the foster dog we had.

			I've always read that cooked rice eaten next day is potentially lethal. However.... many years of experience tells me that out of the fridge and dumped into a very hot frying pan with onions, followed a few minutes later with a few odd veggies lying around and finished off with a good glug of soy sauce makes an excellent fried rice that so far   hasn't killed me off.   
The key thing is to get the rice into the hot pan before too much else is added to cool it down. So oil and (optional) onions/garlic first. Once the pan is sizzling, get the rice in and bang up the heat to keep the temperature high. You get a sort of feel for when the pan is hot enough to have killed off anything dangerous in the rice. After that point, add anything else you want.

33	Food and drink	Coffee Machine recommendation ?	John_H	2386	36	Location: Nyon	19.11.2016, 22:23	"    Without going into the whole Zen of the perfect coffee thing, the two  factors in the taste of a coffee are: 
1) What beans you use. 
2) How recently those beans were ground.   
As to the machines, I've got through two myself in about 21 years, but I also happen to be the kind of guy who people say ""You're a handy type of guy, would you have a look at our coffee maker, the shop says it can't be repaired?"", so I've probably had about 25 of them apart over the years.   
Even amongst the top brands, some are just not very well designed, but some are real workhorses which are relatively easy to put back into service.   
Of the ones that I could return to service the three most common faults are 
1) Lack of cleaning of the machine. 
2) Damage to the control system or sensors. 
3) Grinder becoming caked up with bean powder.   
If you buy a machine with a weak mechanism and never brush the coffee powder off the mechanism, and vacuum out all the grounds, then the mechanism will eventually give in.   
If you aren't careful with filling the water reservoir then the moisture which ends up inside the machine will eventually do do the hoo hooey on you.   
To clean the caked powder out of the grinder you usually need to completely disassemble the machine. The cleaning is pretty straightforward, but getting to the bits which need cleaning takes a bit of time and a fair portion of jiggery pokery.   
When you are looking at the bottom of the market, go to a shop which has the top of the line ones as well and compare the mechanism. Some of the bottom of the line models are pretty straight clones of the more expensive ones, the easy way to spot this is to put the mechanisms side by side.

			It's a direct result of global warming. Erosion of the glaciers and ice fields exposes the rock to the elements thereby reducing the peaks.   
But if you insist on using your deodorants and running the AC in your vehicles this was bound to happen.

			Ok just in case you feel you have missed the boat (don't have 12 months for your mince to mature) and are having visitors from the uk, you can ask them to bring some mince pies and christmas pud.    
I looked on line and Iceland! won the top prize for mince pies and christmas pud. So I went to Iceland (for the first time in my life) and bought some.   
they are both delicious!           
If you want the gluten free version both of these  (free from and Iceland gluten free) are also quite ok, quite above average but not as good as Iceland non gluten free. Free From also do a christmas pud that i have not tried yet but I think the free from range is sometimes better quality than non free from so it most likely is quite ok, probably even better if you tzjuj it up with some brandy.             
whatever you do do not get the Co-op luxury mince pies - just awful. I don't think  even drenching them in brandy would help.

Long story short, we landed at the Dolder last Christmas with a (then) six month old baby.  Unsurprisingly, it was not busy -- and the staff could not have been more helpful or accommodating with the little one.  It was lovely.   
Sorry that this isn't quite what you're looking for, but hope this helps.

			OK, here is the scoop as I know it. ""Choosy mothers choose Jif"" vs. ""Mom loves Skippy, that's a hunch, cause she always puts Skippy in my lunch."" Now, based only on jingle power, which would you choose??   
Actually, Simply Jif is the only Jif for me. No added palm oil (ok, 2% or less rapeseed or soy is the claim on the label). I can tell because I am reading this off the almost-empty jar that sits in my pantry, the one that I just can't bring myself to finish off because then IT WILL ALL BE GONE. Horrors. Basically 98% peanuts. And just enough of the junky stuff to keep it from freezing your jaw shut or sticking your tongue to the roof of your mouth for a week, like the all naturals. Just by way of explanation, i.e., not all Jifs are equal.   
Cheetos, however, can't go wrong with any of them. Let me at 'em! 
Upa.

49	Food and drink	South Indian foods allowed to carry to Switzerland	Kanz	1401	14	Location: Basel	08.07.2016, 10:24	"    There are several Indian and Asian stores in Zürich that always have fresh curry leaves in stock. You can also dry them out or freeze them if you don't use the whole bag. Actually you can get most items in Zürich with a bit of searching, unless its a really unusual ingredient or a special brand.

			We're in a similar situation.  Want to bring my Vitamix 5000 but can't due to  
the voltage difference.   
I called Vitamix earlier today.  I asked about purchasing the european 
version of the machine in the US.  They told me that it can be purchased 
directly through them.  Cost is $699 + tax + $25 shipping/handling.  That 
is a lot more than the regular US version of the vitamix.   
Just for comparison, the regular 110V US version of the Vitamix for 
sale at Costco stores here is about $400 + tax.  They gave me some BS 
reason for it being more expensive.  Bah.  It's the same machine they 
ship to Europe, they just want to charge more for selling it here in the 
States.   
But $700 is still cheaper than the CHF900 prices I have seen.  Or even in 
Germany where I have seen prices of around 650 Euros.   
I'm trying to find a cheaper one on the internet.  I will definitely bring 
one when we ship our things over.

60	Food and drink	Le Creuset chipped	Catherine W	976	4	Location: Zug	21.11.2016, 12:06	"    That is the killer for any glass/porcelain enamelled metal surface. Putting a cold enamelled pot onto a hot element, filling a hot pot with something cold, quenching the pot while hot will eventually cause the glaze to separate from the metal. The problem is that the glaze and the metal contract at two different rates, heating or cooling the item rapidly sets up a tension in the boundary layer between the two materials.   
Not to divert every single thread into one about cars, but the exhaust manifolds on Jaguar and quite a few other classic cars are covered with porcelain enamel. They used to last a lot longer, but some of the materials used in the glaze are highly toxic and no longer used by the companies which use them, so although you can have them reglazed, they don't last much longer than about 3 years regardless of how carefully one treats them.

He said he had had an easy time, but his friend had kept his hives near the botanical gardens in Munich, and this honey was refused as it contained foreign pollen spores! I used to keep bees in London, and friends had trouble when their bees raided the sugar processing plant in East London and the collected sugar ruined his honey harvest.

69	Food and drink	Bought my first fondue pot and I need some help!	snsmith27	939	15	Location: Zürich	29.10.2016, 20:45	" 
			
			A little bit of cheese fondue chemistry .   
Is lemon juice required? Answer: No if you have the right wine.    
The right wine must be fruity and a little bit acid. Usually they have malic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid. They play a fundamental role in avoiding the ""splitting"" of the cheese fondue: when the droplets of fat don't mix with the proteines you get a mass of cheese floating on oil. All the acids help split the proteins molecules and facilitate the emulsion with fat.   
So if you add lemon juice you just add an insurance against the fondue ""splitting"". If you have a good wine like fendant then you don't need it. It's you last resort in an emergency case.

			you can get all the info on brewing online, there is a plethora of info out there.    
for basic, simple brews the set up is cheap. a plastic bucket kit with all you need to make 10L to 20L for around 70- 100 CHF. its super easy, pay attention to hygiene & follow instructions (yeah tough for us males) and you have pretty good beer in 4 to 8 weeks. Ingredient kits then cost 15 to 25 chf... just add water & sugar.    
if you have a decent size kettle (10L or bigger) you can then move to 'partial mash' where you steep grains (like making tea) and then add extract / hops. this can produce beer at evens or better than the craft beers we pay 3/4/5/6+ CHF for...    
if your prepared to spend a little more $$ you can move to all grain. Its actually simple & once you outlay the set up (large kettle & probably need an outdoor gas burner) the brews are cheap. Amarillo pale Ale i made on the weekend cost 20CHF for 21L.    
have a google of brew in a bag, or BIAB .. super simple.

			Add chicken stock to give the sauce fullness.   
Add dried oregano at the beginning, parsely and basel at the very end.   
Use red wine. And thinly sliced carrots.   
Put a stick blender in at the end and pulse to give it the desired consistency.   
Lots of garlic. A whole clove will do.

116	Food and drink	Sloe Gin - anyone making it?	jamiebae	1332	10	Location: Horgen ZH, Brighton UK	26.10.2014, 20:25	" 
			
			A couple of years ago, we made two batches, using the same Yorkshire Sloes.   
First batch was done the traditional way, where you prick the sloes individually with a pin. This a) takes bloody ages; b) stains your fingers semi-permanently the colour of an uncooked lobster's shell; and c) eventually leads you to prick said blue fingers instead of expected blue sloes - causing swearing, bleeding and searching for plasters. (Drinking spare gin while doing the preparation may not have helped here).   
The second lot we followed the recipe from BBC Good Food programme on't wireless. Mainly because I got so annoyed with pricking (and ran out of gin), leading me to Freeze the rest.   
When solid (about a week) drop the bags of sloes once on a hard floor from about 4ft up to shatter some, put in mixing pan, pour over with gin. They will crack and split impressively. Add sugar, wait, strain and bottle as all other recipes.   
We left these both to mature same amount of time (over a year) and WOW - what a difference. Frozen version was darker, sweeter, more berry flavours ; so much better. Pinned version was a sherry red (not a typo) and sharper.   
Freeze it. Easier, better, and more convenient.   
Regards     
Ian

I grew up (a very long time ago) in a plain vanilla suburb. Quite literally. Apparently plain vanilla was the only ice cream one could buy. At least that's what Mom told us kiddies.    
But once a year we went to a little town on the shores of Lake Michigan. As a special treat the first stop on our holiday was an old fashioned ice cream parlor in town, where all sorts of wonderous flavors could be found. What child could resist the siren call of green ice cream?    
Mint chocolate chip still 'tastes' of those lazy hazy days of sun, sand and fun on the Michigan shore...

128	Food and drink	Large Migros and Coop Stores	happyjuggler	1695	42	Location: Zurich	08.09.2016, 16:59	"    The best veggie options that I've found in a close proximity to each other, are around Limmatplatz. I believe that's only one bus ride away from you, so worth the effort. You've got India Supermarkt Maharajah just off Langstrasse on Josefstrasse, Denner is opposite that, and the Migros on Limmatplatz has one of the most diverse selections of veggie food. And if that's not enough, you've also got SamSeS vegetarian buffet restaurant across the road from the Denner en route to Migros.         
There's also an Asian store inside Hauptbahnhof by the Sihlquai entrance, opposite Burger King. From inside the station, just take the  escalators from the 'D' section of platforms 41, 42, 43 or 44 instead of the ones that lead up to the main station concourse / Shopville.

			I used to add that to real mince when making spag bol as a student..... certainly helped to bulk out the sauce without altering the taste and texture too much. Had to be careful about proportions though, using more than 25-30% soya to meat gave a cardboardy feel to the sauce.    
Wouldn't be tempted to use it now though, even if for some reason I decided to become vegetarian there are more interesting options out there.

Potatoes, rice, gluten-free pasta are all good, however, they're heavy going to eat day after day. Quinoa is really light and very calming on the tummy. Full of nutrients too make it a healthy choice, I guess. I am now a big fan after years of not really bothering too much with it.. thought it to be more of a fad than a sound food option.   
One thing for sure it's very expensive - I now buy mine in bulk as it's so much cheaper. One of my kids loves it; the other looks at it, makes a face and says: no thanks!

Actually a quick google shows ""The fats in bacon are about 50% monounsaturated and a large part of those is oleic acid.   
This is the same fatty acid that olive oil is praised for and generally considered “heart-healthy”.   
Then about 40% is saturated fat, accompanied by a decent amount of cholesterol.   
But we now know that saturated fat isn’t harmful and cholesterol in the diet doesn’t affect cholesterol in the blood. Nothing to fear""

			Ripe, fresh concord grapes are a thing of beauty. That spicy sweet taste... Ah, memories of home.   
The Americanos in our Coop last week were pretty awful specimens, tasting at best like a poor subsitute. And yes, tough.   
They shouldn't be.   
When you find a good bunch, though....   
I make a jelly (this is the traditional J in PB&J), once in a while a juice, more often a syrup. The syrup is wonderful as a base for a game sauce or a sorbet.

Also, I don't have a freezer, just a freezer shelf, so cook at the weekend and freeze is not an option for me...... If you haven't sorted somewhere to live yet, make sure you get a place with an actual freezer.  
Slow cooking is another option, get home from work to some great stew. be warned, meat is expensive, so veg stew might be more often on the menu than you are used to, mind you, horse is affordable, and if you've been eating cheap tescos and sainsburies ready meals......

			Coop and Migro definitely have the 3 main colours (blue, red, yellow).   
At any decent size Coop go to the bake decorating section, they have all the pastilles, decorations, and the food coloring haning on the pegs.  Even the food coloring is in these pink cardboard backed packaging hanging individually on the racks, which isn't so obvious at first.  You need to buy the colours separately, small cylinder glass shaped vials packed in the pink cardboard backing.

Tom is right about acid, but salt will definitely harden legumes and slow the cooking times as well. That's why I wont cook lentils in Bouillon, as directed on packets in Swiss supermarkets, as it often contains salt. I will cook them with some bay leaves, onion, garlic and other herbs. Or if Indian then ginger and garlic and turmeric. Only adding salt and acids such as tomatoes or red wine or vinegar towards the end of cooking.

180	Food and drink	Kochboxen in Basel. Did you try?	Lovely Lady	550	0	Location: Basel	17.07.2016, 21:51	" 
			
			I like to try new things, go to restaurants and cook by myself. My last ""discovery"" were ""kochboxen"".  
Kochbox is a bag or a box with cooking recepe and ingredients (vegetables, meat, fish,  herbals, etc). All is measured according to the recepe. 
What is the advantage? You don't need to go to the shop and you have a possibility to learn to cook a new dish.   
I tried kochbox from HelloFresh.ch and kochbox from Leibgericht.ch  
My experience: ingredients and recepies in both cases were good. 
What might be a benefit in HelloFresh.ch is that they can deliver in the morning and during the day, and leibgericht.ch only in the evening.   
What I really liked by Leibgericht.ch is that on their site you can choose what you want to cook (and with HelloFresh you get a fixed box of 3 dishes).   
The price also differs a lot.  To try 3 dishes of HelloFresh for CHF115 (trial box) from my point of view is exaggerated. 
For around CHF 100 I ordered  5 dinners for 2 people in Leibgericht.   
Who else has an experience with Kochboxen? Let's share!

			Oh man, how I understand you. When I made my pregnancy course, the  midwife told me to bring salty and sweet snacks so I have some energy  for the long work ahead.   
But on the D-day, they forbade me to eat because I could have to go  through a C-section. My husband got a nice tasty lunch while I was  labouring away, and I was STARVING.   
I was served some dinner around 18h30. Because it was evening and the  31st of December, there was no warm meal. So after 14 hours of difficult  labour, and having had the last meal around 18 the previous day, I was  given cold Fleischkaese and a bouillon. FLEICHKAESE!  :msns  ick:   
Hope you find some nice food!

Do you have a food/farmers market near you?  
Or one so good it's worth travelling to?   
I am very interested to find out what the Canton offers and would like to hear from people in all parts. Weekly, monthly, annual or ocassional festivals, please share details of where you buy food outside of the regular supermarket chains.   
Have found lots of info about Zurich but I suspect that SG also has a lot to offer. If I can get enough good information it will be compiled into a useful factsheet for other expats and visitors.

This is what I do back home, at my vacation house. Unfortunately here i do not have the time available to be spending two hours grilling.   
So between not grilling on weekdays, and grilling on gas, i chose gas.

I remember them having Myanmar stuff in there, but that's years ago. I guess all South East Asians in Europe will call their stuff Thai food as it simply sells better. Even all Vietnamese places in ZH seem to put Thai curries on the menu cause people keep on asking for them. Hard to believe that one of the most populous regions of the world could offer more than the same green chicken curry again...     
Just as you will find in Europe loads of ""Indian"" restaurants and no Pakistani... outside of specific places in the UK where the muslim community is so strong that it works again... (if that does not start a Friday discussion I don't know what would...)

100 grammes Rye flour 
150 grammes Sour dough starter 
If I am cheating or in a hurry a small lump of yeast dissolved in water 
Salt A good teaspoon full   
Everything in a food processor,with enough water to make it good and sticky.Into a bowl to rise for a couple of hours. 
Then in a colander lined with a well floured cloth till it doubles in size.   
Oven on full belt with a cast iron casserole in it. When the max. temp. is reached take the casserole out and tip the dough in. Lid on and on the bottom shelf for 20 minutes. Lid off and another 20 minutes. I use the starter that is left over from the missuses dough recipe. She got it out of Annabell. It tastes better but takes about three days to make.

Could you recommend me a good restaurant in Zurich whose kitchen is open during the entire day (during working days)? It does not have to be exceptionally fancy, but also not in the range of fast food. If you know a place be located at the west cost (i.e. Horgen, Thalwil) even better.

208	Food and drink	foraging for wild mushrooms..	Odile	4592	48	Location: Neuchatel	20.08.2015, 12:07	"    30 years, correct. Even if half has decayed there are areas where the ionizing radiation in mushrooms is still in the regions of ""thousands of Becquerel"" Foods with over 600 Becquerel are not allowed to be sold.   
(from Bundesamt für Strahlung, Germany) 
Bestimmte Pilzarten und Wildarten sind in einigen Gegenden  Deutschlands durch die Reaktorkatastrophe von Tschernobyl noch immer  stark mit    belastet. Der Süden Deutschlands  vor allem Südbayern und der  Bayerische Wald  sind davon besonders betroffen. In den letzten Jahren  (2011 bis 2015) wurden Werte von bis zu mehreren Tausend   pro Kilogramm bei Wild und bei bestimmten Speisepilzen gemessen. 
In Deutschland ist es nicht erlaubt, Lebensmittel mit einem Radiocäsiumgehalt von mehr als 600   pro Kilogramm in den Handel zu bringen. Für den Eigenverzehr gilt diese Beschränkung nicht. 
  Wenn Wildbret oder wild wachsende Speisepilze in üblichen Mengen  verzehrt werden, ist die zusätzliche Strahlenbelastung zwar  vergleichsweise gering, aber vermeidbar. Wer seine persönliche Belastung  verringern möchte, sollte in den höher belasteten Gebieten Deutschlands  auf den Genuss selbst erlegten Wildes und selbst gesammelter Pilze  verzichten.   
What I am saying is just be careful and don´t eat too many.

I never drink tea unless seriously ill (although my Swiss daughter loves it, and so we have all the necessary plants / boxes of fresh herbs), but I never divulge this.     
So, after discussing the coffee variation I usually have to point out that I also drink only Nescafe, despite having the latest designer Italian dispenser in my kitchen - well, to be more accurate it's in my attic - because it requires too much effort in the morning as well as takes up too much space in the kitchen despite looking cool.   
I know that this is a no-go, but the caffeine simply keeps me awake the whole night and I can't see the point  .

Restaurants serve what people want to eat and pay for. If that is not the ""WOW"" dishes it may be surprising to you, but it's the same principle anywhere.

			I have to go with the Landi Farmers Weiss beer. I was at a wedding a few years ago, and it's all they served. Then again as an auto mechanic he has been able to buy his own flat under the age of 28. Good man. I hate Finkbrau. Only beer in recent memory that wasn't skunked that I actually poured out after getting 20% thru the can.

			Hello All,   
Thank you for the wonderful suggestions.   
Especially 3Wishes      We were on vacation during his actual birthday, and we managed to make this cake (smaller version) using cupcakes and melted chocolate in the resort. Got real messy because there were a lot less utensils in the resort that we have at home   but it was worth it.    
The train was devoured in 10 minutes flat and 11th minute we were in the pool. Kids have short attention span, but we all loved the experience.   
The actual birthday celebration is the next weekend though, the expensive cake one that is    
Cheers All.

On a quick stroll through, I saw Kraft mac & cheese, creamed corn, quick grits, cranberry sauce and tons of candy.  It's all gross, but if you have kids clamoring for a taste of home, it might help.

			What are you looking for exactly? There are a number of places that will be open, depending on what kind of thing you are looking for.    
As mentioned you will find restaurants open. If you walk along the lake by the Casino, there are a number of the hotels you can pop into for a coffee/cake etc.   
By the boat station is a little place thats nice:     
The Heini has a couple of locations that are open on Sundays, one by the Lion monument and another in the old town:

292	Food and drink	Potlucks/cooking groups in Zurich?	kateling	703	0	Location: Zurich	03.03.2016, 15:17	" 
			
			Hi all,   
Does anyone know of any regular potluck or cooking groups in Zurich? I've had a look on meetup but only seemed to find vegan potlucks, or potlucks connected with talks etc. I'd be happy to attend a vegetarian or non-vegetarian potluck but the vegan ones would restrict my cooking habits a little, and I'd like something relaxed rather than connected with talks etc.    
I've also looked into Zurikocht and Vizeat, but the idea of paying a stranger to cook for you seems a bit awkward to me. I'd rather meet up, share food and swap recipes. Am I imagining something that doesn't exist?   
All tips appreciated, thank you!

			If you're looking for something slightly Chic, but still excellent typical Indian food, I would recommend the Nandanam near Lausanne train station. You may want to book in advance as it is often full (except maybe on monday or tuesday nights). Can be quite noisy on friday and saturday evening.   
Their website will give you an idea of the look of the place.

I was wondering if someone might know about a cafe/restaurant in Zürich called T for chai or Tea for Chai? I was told about it 2 years ago by a man and that it had jam sessions on Tuesday nights. I'm finally going to be in Zürich for a few nights and I'm trying to track it down, but having no luck. If it sounds familiar or you know it please contact me. 
Thanks so much.

297	Food and drink	Any Sauerkraut/Choucroute recipes ?	kittekat	1044	6	Location: Basel	27.02.2016, 17:12	" 
			
			For me the go-to site for more or less local recipes is chefkoch.de.   
An extra simple example: 
500g Spätzli (Chnöpfli in swiss German)  
3-400g Sauerkraut (white, sweet) 
100-150g dairy butter   
Prepare Sauerkraut and Spätzli as prescribed on its respective package,  let any liquid drip off the Sauerkraut (if applicable) and heat it in  the microwave if necessary. Melt the butter in a pan, high-ish heat so  it turns a nice golden (perhaps a bit brown) color (too much heat if it ""smokes"") and  pour over the Sauerkraut/Spätzli mixture. Done, serve.   
I love bread to go along with this. You can add roasted onion/ham and a lot of other stuff, but I prefer this very basic make.

IIRC there is some sort of ""fibre"" that you can get - expands massively when moist, which can be whisked with an egg - and a pancake made. Serve this with cottage or cream cheese - maybe with a slice or turkey or ham and you'll avoid a spike.   
Basically you need high protein + low GI carbs combined.

Step 1. Go to Coop 
Step 2. Buy the pork loin or two 
Step 3. Go to asian food store off Langstrasse or in HB 
Step 4. Buy char sui pork seasoning  or Lee Kum Kee char sui marinade 
Step 4. Go home and marinade the bastard  (add a bit of 5 spice for flavour) 
Step 5. Cook in oven with the grill setting 
Step 6. Eat, actually tastes better the next day.

			The cream cheese or Frischkäse here is the one that is spreadable. Not the one in blocks (like in US). If you use it as it is, your icing consistency will be very much like a liquid. But, you could do the trick by draining the water inside the creamcheese and store the icing in the fridge for a few hours before using it.

			Yep, the regular beef mince I buy from the Co-op is so lean I have to add oil to the pan when I fry it to stop it from sticking!     
Took me ages to figure out why my mince sauces weren't so tasty once I moved here - needed a smart friend to point out that if ""the flavour is in the fat, and there's no fat in Swiss beef, voila""!

335	Food and drink	Indian Restaurants in Zürich	Wollishofener	11317	50	Location: Glattbrugg	25.10.2012, 23:19	"    I am aware of several millions British people who regard the cuisine from ""Greater India"" as their own cuisine. But not only are there some other 10s of millions of Brits who do not feel thelike, there also are several 100s million people on the Indian subcontinent who will not accept that their cuisine is ""British cuisine"". This in spite of the apparent fact that a good part of all gastronomy folk in Britain of Paki-Indian-etc origin have obtained British citizenship.    
The woman of the ""Chef"" of the oldest Indian restaurant in Zürich (Raja Bongo Restaurant) is of Swiss origin, but is doing more of the cooking than her husband. Indian cuisine already in the late 1970ies became a heavy part of her life.    
Many Swiss regard Spaghetti, Salami, Tagliatelle etc as ""their"" cuisine, but not even Italians with Swiss citizenship would ever describe Italian cuisine as ""Swiss cuisine"". There are uncountable Swiss native German speakers and French speakers successfully active in Italian cuisine, but it for them still is, in a way not THEIR but ANOTHER cuisine, in spite of Swiss Cuisine having taken over Spaghetti and Salami etc long ago. True, the TICINO is a kind of ""Knautschzone""/""gears-synchronisation-tool"" between Italy and Switzerland which makes it easier    "	Posts: 19,029	Join Date: Jun 2009	Forum Legend	Groaned at 333 Times in 258 Posts	Thanked 11,716 Times in 6,858 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Lovely lovely place to visit   
Spectacular views to see, either before or after dining with them, its an american themed diner with great cooked food, my fella always has steak or a burger im boring and have a baked potato ( being vegetarian ) theres a lovely restaurant inside for winter and a beautiful garden to eat or just have a drink outside for spring/summer   
Theres hike paths to follow not to difficult for a lazy sunday walk and if you get there in time i believe they do an amazing sunday brunch from 8.30am-11.30am ( but weve never made that yet )

348	Food and drink	Storing or freezing cheese slices without freezer burn?	glowjupiter	902	7	Location: here	23.12.2015, 17:34	"    We don't slice our raclette cheese, we grate it like roesti instead as that makes it much easier to use the amount of cheese the individual prefers.   
To freeze the grated cheese we use ordinary zippable plastic bags that are laid flat in the freezer with the cheese loosely-packed and no more than perhaps 1.5-2cm thick. If we manage to remember we shake the bags once they're half-frozen, again laying them flat. That enables you to break off any portion if you don't need to thaw up the full contents.

			I used to bake a chicken for Thanksgiving, just because I hate the dry turkey meat. But seeing how Tom in Ticino is a foodie and knows his stuff, I did what he suggested - baked the bird facing down for a juicy breast effect.  Once it finished cooking, I drained the juices and turned it over for a few minutes for the breast skin to reach a crispy-brown look. It turned out great!   
Thanks, Tom!

			Some restaurant markups are ridiculous (Park Hyatt Zürich charging 4x retail making a 100 CHF wine 400 CHF) and are completely unfair in that they penalise people wanting to drink high quality wines. There are however a few places where the markups are more than fair and you feel happy about ordering something good off the card. The Carlton restaurant and James Joyce pub offer well selected wines at really fair prices in downtown Zürich. The Carlton is a bit more fancy (though the food is great and fairly priced) and James Joyce is great for a burger, actually good fish & chips, and perhaps the best club sandwich in Zürich. It takes a bit of research in Switzerland but fair priced booze does exist!

Oh yeah I know, for a long time the one doc swore it was milk, but when did no dairy it wasn't better, so I don't think it really is the case. She did eat actual corn though, we moved a few years ago and then boom it flared and since it's been tube after tube after tube of steriods. Even in 3 countries and different locations, it's here to stay it seems    
Strawberries are an issue too, blueberries are ok. I'd like to try to cut out tomato but she is dead against it, again she has been ok with it, it's usually 
corn that is the big trigger.    
She's had corn laced foods for weeks and her skin is awful, so without trying we did ""trial"" whatever is in the COOP version of traubenzucker, and it's not working.    
Cooking everything from scratch is a pain, but what can I do.

			They are really not difficult to make. Here's the recipe I make:       
For suet, place a stick of butter in the deep freeze and grate it into the mix in place of the suet. Treacle you can get at Globus and Jelmoli. If you own a pressure cooker, you can cook it by steaming with pressure off for 30 mins, then at 5lb pressure for about 2 to 2.5 hours. Pour a tablepoon of brandy over the cooled pudding then store, covered with greaseproof and foil in a dark cupboard for upto a month.   
We don't have a sixpence to hand these days, so substituted a plastic Grittibänzli figure.   
Cheers,

			Hi   
I'm after some collective EF foodie wisdom please.    
I love to bake, chocolate anything is a winner in our house, and I was recently made aware of this ""wet"" chocolate cake. My question is about the flour used.    
In both the German and English translated recipes I've found, it just says flour. Would this be the plain ""Weiss mehl"" or should I use the self raising flour I'm used to? There is no mention of baking powder as a rising agent you see. From the pictures I've seen the cake looks a little flat. So is it a low, dense, cake as well as one with a runny-ish/ wet middle?   
Many thanks in advance, 
Rufus   
And there should be an apostrophe in ""Sven's"" ... if any kind moderator would be willing to correct it for a slightly embarrassed stickler for punctuation please?

			To the OP, aren't you the one who has a Swiss boyfriend and you tried to live here once, moved back to the US and are now here again to make a fresh start?   
If so, yearning for obscure things like root beer is not the way to go.  If you really are serious about assimilating this time, learn to drink Rivella, be happy with Coke or start drinking wine like the rest of us.   
Did you not learn your lesson the first time?  Find alternatives for your big, cheap bottles of Tylenol, full-strength bleach, brown sugar and deodorant soap.  (And root beer.)  Love your boyfriend, learn his language, embrace his country and his culture and move on.  You can still be American, but you don't have to so blatantly act like such a stereotype.  It gives the rest of us, (and there aren't many left of us, quite frankly), a bad name.

My daughters too, although they grew up in Leicestershire, where I used to find tons of wild mushrooms, including Penny Buns- but mainly blewitts, bluelegs, parasols, oyster mushrooms, field and wood mushrooms and St Georges.

			Did you hear about the cut-price hitman, Arty, who was contracted to kill a clients wife? He was simply told she would be wearing a brown coat and carrying a black handbag whilst out shopping at the supermarket. He subsequently found his mark and strangled her in the dry-goods section. On his way out, he saw a second woman fitting the description at the fruit counter, so decided to deal with her too, to be on the safe side. Unfortunately for him, he was arrested whilst trying to make his getaway. The headline in the next day's paper was ...

			Hello   
I just happened upon this post as I was googling natural wine (made my account to reply here). There is an interesting natural wine merchant in Zürich,  , all without added yeasts or sulphites. I have tried some of their wines, which I enjoyed, and they have some interesting wines on their list. They have a private tasting cellar in Küsnacht where you can schedule a tasting, still planning to do that.

			Just before you enter the tunnel leading to the border crossing, turn right at the light. Keep going straight for about 5 minutes and the first roundabout turn left again ( enter at 6 exit at 9 ). 
You will then enter France through an unmanned border crossing called ""douane de Vireloup"" go straight and you will end up in the center of Ferney-Voltaire (Carrefour will be to your left), thus avoiding the lines at Ferney border crossing.   
Take the same route when you come back, the 5 min drive is a lot more pleasant than sitting in traffic.

			As a serious Roast Beef fan (when I'm in London I never miss visiting Hix's Oyster and Chop House) I must disagree with the suggestions hitherto made, much as they   make a nice beef meal.   
I've found that the closest you can get in Switzerland to a proper English standing Rib Roast is the Côte de Boeuf. BUT it has to be at least a kilo or two in weight. A teeny tiny Côte de Boeuf will not really give you a decent Roast Beef Experience. Although monstrously expensive, a large, aged (at least 28 days) Côte de Boeuf makes for a great dinner party dish plus provide leftovers for all kinds of things (such as thin sliced, on white, with mayo, English mustard and a good sprinkling of salt and pepper).   
Finally, is it me, or do others EFers find that the Swiss butchers remove so much fat, and the meat is not marbled  , so that unless you can afford a thick steak to flash grill you are doomed to dry meat (even if cooked pink)???

			My hubby makes his own BM.  
He makes a big bowl full that sits in the fridge and keeps us going for most of the week. it doesn't need to be fresh everyday, it improves with age    
Into a 2 liter bowl grate 1 apple (unpeeled) we prefer Braeburn. 
Then add 2 large handfuls of Migros   Reddy Birchermuesli Berries mix and stir into the apple. 
Next throw in some sultanas - only if you like them  
Next add 1 large tub 500g of Migros mixed berry or other flavour - stir again. 
Then put a mug full of [still] frozen mixed forest berries - stir again and then add enough milk to make it quite a sloppy mixture - it will thicken a lot overnight. This part needs and a bit of experimentation and tinkering to personal taste.   
Cover and put in the fridge overnight.  
The next day to will be very thick or solid and this is the time to add more milk/yogurt/orange juice (if you like it less sweet) to loosen it up, give it a good stir. 
Scoop into a bowl and enjoy!!   
The remainder will last 4-5 days in the fridge, but it wont thicken any more.

Spätzli, Rösti

Any idea? It has to be possible to get this stuff? :\

But yes, I agree - especially as a whole chicken can be cheaper than a couple of breasts.

I get the hearts and livers fresh and they're much better. I admit the ones from France are the best, not sure why. They just cook up better. Liver is hard for me to get right.   
I like to go to this place on Satuday mornings, but they're out of the way, so we pre-order and buy in bulk.       
Try their high-fat ground beef. Tastiest meat in the world.

As Mirf said, unlikely to have such ""customization"" on-site.   
Alternate to town center are the various cakes in the Migros and chocolate shops in and around the SBB.

445	Food and drink	"""On the Absinthe Trail"" from NY Times"	guest	1706	7	null	null	"     
Val-de-Travers absinthe comes in very many guises, from very many distillers- and with a great variety of plant mixes and also alcohol strengths- including some (natural) greens drunk with spoon and sugar ('blanches' also known as 'bleues' due to the blueish tinge when it is 'louched' with water are drunk without sugar just very cold water- from a wooden fountain up in a dale in the woods even better) - and of course the strength can be diluted with more water rather than less. We usually drink it with 2.5 to 3 parts of water- as the herbs and flavours come out much better with more, rather than less, water. Come over one day Wooli and I'll take you to all the best distillers here.   
But yes, some Rakis are really good- much better than the much too sweet Ouzos and Pastis (Pastis Pernod was invented in Pontarlier after absinthe was banned) - we had a representative from Pernod last night at our international outing, as they have reintroduced absinthes in their range- sadly not always sucessfully. They presented us with cocktails which were quite nice- but give me simple V-d-T absinthe anytime!

			DENNER is having one of their quarterly wine sales this Friday and Saturday (27th and 28th of Feb).   
They have  (including wines already on special). The 20% is based on purchasing a full carton (6 bottles).   
Depending on what you are interested in, you might find something.   
From my experience, you may need to look at a couple of stores because some stores are big into wine, others have a pitiful selection.   
It is best to look at their weekly flyer but often they still have wines from previous weeks on special (once again depending on the store).

			Some Asian grocery stores in Lausanne are Uchitomi, Mikado and Thao. If by rice crackers you mean senbei, traditionally it shouldn’t contain any nuts, as it is made from rice or potato. There is a type of senbei that contains soy nuts though. There are many varieties nowadays, ranging from sweet to fish and nori containing ones. Although pricey, you have more options online. I’ve regularly ordered from the Japan Centre ( ) .Also know of someone who orders from Nihon Ichiban ( ) and then there is of course also Amazon.

466	Food and drink	Please, what is the name of this pastry?	pogopossum	1384	11	Location: Dallas	30.08.2015, 00:48	"    What pisses me -- an American -- off about the American government's foreign food factory inspections is that while foreign factories are required to meet capricious standards, lest they be cut off from the huge American market, domestic food plants are not held to the same standards. Well, technically they are, but on American soil, the sanctions the government can take are incredibly ineffective.   
So the end result is bullsh!t like not being able to import wonderful European dry hams (prosciutto, Schwarzwälderschinken, jamon iberico, etc) because their factories -- while seemingly adequate as to not poison all of Europe and Asia -- don't meet USDA standards, while domestic American meatpacking plants that ship out millions of pounds of bacterially contaminated ground beef receive a slap on the wrist, but cannot be shut down with anything even remotely describable as ""expediency"". (It was only recently that one Spanish jamon iberico producer went through all the red tape to build a USDA-approved plant, finally allowing Americans to taste what I consider to be the finest ham in the world.)    
FYI, in USA, regulatory authority over the food supply is divided between the FDA and USDA, depending on what it is and whether it's processed or not, so both can and do conduct inspections domestically and abroad.

			Hi all,   
I just discovered a coffee shop in Schwamendingen! I think it opened in June. It's called Coffee & Deeds.        
It is a cute space and the coffees/teas are reasonably priced. They have a lovely outdoor seating area and an activity box for kids. The service is really friendly and they try to source locally.    
This coffee shop is some sort of initiative from the local reformed church. I do like the idea of buying an anonymous coffee for someone who might not be having the best of times (unemployed, etc.).   
I think it's a great little place and reminds me of the shop I used to frequent in San Francisco.

I  try to keep it under one month, but two months would probably be ok (that's just my personal guess, YMMV).   
If the plastic bottle was to tear apart it should be plainly obvious. To guard against overlooking any cracks you could thaw it in a big enough plastic container the first few times (or always, for that matter).

If I'm home all day and want to drink plenty of coffee I'll stick to my filter machine, but for a quick and easy blast of caffeine when I'm in a hurry, these machines are the answer.

492	Food and drink	Eggs	st2lemans	7898	68	Location: Lugano	08.12.2012, 16:35	"    The fresher the egg, the more difficult it is to shell after hard-boiling.  The trick to nice hard-boiled eggs is to store them at home for a week before attempting to hard boil them.  Plunging them into cold water after boiling stops the yolk going grey, it has no effect on the ease of peeling.     
The good news is that if you think Swiss eggs are difficult to peel after boiling, it only demonstrates that they are fresher than what you're used to.

Bread with caraway. Not sure if it was actually rye. Way too soft. McDonalds-bun soft. But 1kg for 4.20 CHF. Obviously geared towards large families ;-)

the store Eva's apples at Schauffhauerplatz is also vegan, most Reformhouses Egli also have many vegan products. Once you start searching you notice that there are quite a few. Additonally, many vegan restaurants are popping up, my fav being marktkueche near Bäckeranlage.

They are both delicious and my favourite ways of cooking pork chops, especially over charcoal.

			An easy and quick favourite of mine is salad with cervelat and Appenzell cheese. Very tasty!       
You'll need:    
1. 4 Cervelat sausages 
2. 1 tsp mild mustard  
3. herb vinegar: amount based on personal preference but generally 3 tbsp 
4. 1 tbsp mayo 
5. finely chopped chives  
6. Appenzell cheese (or your fav cheese - I sometimes use grumpygrapefruits' English cheese  ) 
7. small onion sliced into rings: skip this step if you arent really into onions 
8. 2 hardboiled eggs 
9. 4 tbsp Rapeseed or sunflower oil (I personally use olive oil)   
a. Remove skin of cervelat sausages and slice  
b. mix with salad, salt, pepper and eggs!   
Tadaaa!   
PS: gherkins are optional too.

Same for me.  I do my main shop at Aldi, but get a few other items from Lidl, Migros and Denner.   
Aligro is good if you have a big storage room or a big freezer to put stuff in as they tend to sell in bigger quantities, but not really cheaper than anyone else.  Their selection of fresh and frozen veg is very good.

525	Food and drink	Paleo - Anyone here doing it?	MacGregor's Daughter	12765	197	Location: Zug	05.04.2015, 11:12	" 
			
			I have been on something like paleo on steroids - keto. For me it has done miracles. I have always been active (running 2-3 times a week and gym 2-3 times a week for a total of 4 per week) and quite stable on the fat % and weight. Within 6 months of switching to ketosis i lost 10 kg, but its probably even more its just that i have also gained more muscle as i spend now more time in the gym than running (3 times in the gym and 1 run per week). First week or 10 days are tough, but now its not a ""diet"" for me, its a way to live and eat which i dont see changing in the foreseeable future. Indeed, planning, preparing and shopping for your food become quite more expensive and time consuming.      Not entirely true. For your body there's very little difference between refined white flour and sugar. The insulin response (spike) is about the same. This is what makes white flour unhealthy. I think there was a Nestle slogan some time ago which has a certain grain of truth in it - there are no bad foods, there are bad diets. Having a slice or two of bread a day is OK, having a loaf of bread with additives and preservatives isnt.

530	Food and drink	Gauge for gas bottle on grill	guest	656	3	null	null	"     
I had the same query when I first got my gas grill; how much gas is left in the bottle and is it enough for the next grilling session. So after looking around on the net, I found that a really simple method to roughly gauge how much is left in the bottle is to pour warm water down the side of it and run your hand down from the top to the bottom and you will feel the temperature difference.  
The propane absorbs the heat from the warm water and so you will immediately feel the coldness and know if you have gas in there or not.    
For a much more accurate way of knowing how much is in there and if you have enough left for your next grill session, you can use  .  
I found that after a while, I got to know by feel if there was enough for my cooking or not. 
I think if you are using your grill a lot, it would be worth it to invest in a second tank as there will be no scrambling mid-cook  and also, you will take an empty tank back to replace, not an almost empty one that you don't know if it's going to be enough or not one, I mean, it's just giving money away and I always say, ""it's better in my pocket than theirs"". 
Happy grilling   
Edit, if I had a spare bottle, I would keep it in an out of the way place close to the grill if possible, so if you need to swap it mid cook your heat loss is minimal. They are very safe, truly...

And it's always followed by jam roly-poly or bakewell tart - invariably with thick custard.

550	Food and drink	Brazilian Vinagrete Salad	Carina Joly	538	0	Location: Zürich	15.06.2015, 17:24	" 
			
			Hello everyone!   
As the temperatures rise in the summer (not today, though...), I would like to share the recipe of a vinegar salad typically eaten at barbecues in Brazil. Meat lovers eat it with meat, vegetarians eat it with bread...   
I hope you like it!   
Recipe:   
Cut tomatoes (2 or 3), onions (1), cucumbers (1), you can also add bell peppers (1) if you like. (The numbers give you more or less the proportions.)   
Chopped parsley and green onions can also be nice (I sometimes just use Schnittlauch instead of green onions).   
Some people like to cut a little bit of chili peppers (I maybe would put a half of a small one.)   
I like to either fry (in a bit olive oil) or boil the onions, so they are not so strong. If you like raw onions a lot, then you do not need to do that.   
Then you mix everything in a bowl and you must taste all the time until you get it spiced as you like   
I add one soup spoon of vinegar. Then I gradually add sugar. Unfortunately I can't tell you how much sugar because it really depends, but I can tell you that one soup spoon of sugar could be a start. When you taste it and if you like the sweetness, you start adding salt, maybe with as little as a very small spoon (tea spoon).   
Remember that it takes a bit time to get the sense of sugar and salt, so the ideal is to put some, go away for a few minutes, come back and taste, put more, etc... I feel that within a few minutes the taste ""grows.""   
I also add a bit of olive oil at the end.   
You can also substitute the vinegar for lemon juice. It also tastes nice!   
Let me know how it came out!

			Lots and lots grow in gardens around here- and the orange bells which contain the seed, or physalis in this case, are often used in autumn decoration. But if you want fresh local ones, you will have to wait for october I'm afraid.

574	Food and drink	what is weissmaisdunst?	1snow	2001	5	Location: wädenswil	26.05.2015, 12:27	" 
			
			I think what may come closest to Weissmaisdunst is Rheintaler Ribelmais, available at major Coops and Migros. It is finer than polenta maize and much more whitish but substantially coarser than corn starch.    
Ribel is a very traditional meal in the St. Galler part of the Rhine valley, originally a poor people's staple but now experiencing a revival not only among new-age grain-peckers and gluten avoiders.    
Bramata is the yellow variant used in the Grisons, and coarser than Ribelmais too; no substitute for Weissmaisdunst.

			Most of us foragers and gatherers learnt as babe in arms, with our parents- so it comes very naturally. The leaves of lilly of the valley are indeed similar from a distance, and poisonous- but once you know the difference, you just cannot ever get it wrong. Wild garlic leaves are much softer, the flower is totally different- but mostly the very strong garlic smell is the key- lilly of the valley leaves do not smell at all.   
And of course us foragers and gatherers also have many books to check, cross reference, etc. The first rule you learn is that if you are not sure, don't pick- leave well alone. Most of us also know the medicinal use of herbs and plants- and cross-check with many books and on-line sources.   
Ecchinococosis is indeed a problem, mainly in the East and central Switzerland (I live in the Far West). I pick wild strawberries in our garden- as they grow everywhere- but in the wild I stick to raspberries and blackberries which grow higher up. Sadly, the larvae are not killed by washing or freezing- so there is always a risk. Cooking does kill them- so making jam or soups, etc, is totally fine.   
However, foxes are everywhere- and can access market gardens or commercial growing land too- so are you going to stop eating all raw food?   
Personally I am much more scared about 'clean' dirt- pesticides, herbicides, etc- on my food, truly.

			I got a Weber Go-Anywhere Gas from OBI.   
It cooks stuff.  It's light and portable (the legs fold up to lock the lid so you can carry by the handle).  I like it, but it's just a barbeque; nothing to get excited about (edit: That wasn't a dig at you TiMow, I read about your excitement after I posted  ).   
It's the same as this one, so you can also order it online and pick it up from Markthalle the next day (I think it's about 30-40 CHF less than I paid for it).       
It takes the little dumpy gas bottles, so don't forget to get a couple of those.

 in the rest of CH:      (GR)   (JU) (VD) (BE)   (BE)    (ZH)   
There are so many good ones out there, you just need to look for them and don't expect to find them in your local coop.  As previous noted the site   is a great resource for swiss beer hunting  .

You may have to go to the markets at either Helvetiaplatz or Oerlikon and look out for Italian People and discuss it with them directly. Mum, when we were on Holidays in the Toscana, often purchased stuff in either the Toscana or the Emilia-Romagna

625	Food and drink	Turkish Dining Place (no kebab or imbiss food)	Olcayto	2590	18	Location: Zurich	19.10.2014, 19:24	" 
			
			I am from Turkey and lived /travelled in many different countries. Among those, despite the Turkish population, Zurich is the worst when it comes to decent Turkish food.Even Helsinki was far better! 
but back to the question, these are the restaurants in Zurich   
By Elvis Ocakbasi Restaurant : the food is tasty and service is the best.  As many other Turkish restaurants, the owner used to run a little kebab imbiss, then turned to a restaurant but the managing quality is still in imbiss standarts. weird decoration, loud music, mix of traditional and modern but not in a cool way.     
01ocakbasi: it is the last stop of tram 17. i have been there 2-3 times. food is ok, service is terrible , decoration is same like elvis style. i don t like there, but there are many who loves it.   
Bodrum: the name comes from Bodrum which is the most popular touristic town in Turkey. it used to be a small fisherman village in 70s. and this restaurant reminds me that Bodrum in 70s. Plastic table chair sets outside, simple food, slow but friendly service. I like the atmosphere but for it is not a place for everyone.   
cafe ferdinand: as mentioned in a previous thread, it runs as a italian cafe during the day and a turkish restaurant in the evenings  it is homemade traditonal turkish food like manti , dolma, zeytinyagli fasulye..ec. no kebab or such.    
valentins: the owner of bodrum restaurant and valentins are same. it is a family restaurant. the food is good, they don t have doener kebab but have similar stuff..(iskender, ali nazik..etc) service is friendly, prices are not cheap, decoration is the best compared to others.   
Bebek: it was the most trendy bar of 2014 summer and still it is very popular. the owners are swiss and the restaurant /cafe is inspired from the Bebek district of Istanbul. the menu is full with  turkish meze style food.  They have cocktails named as Gezi park, Mersini ..etc. As I remember in the menu there was ; borek, cacik, musakka, muammara, hellim kizartma, mercimek corba, kisir, ezme.. Service is great, ambience is number one. In the end it is not a Turkish restaurant and food is updated for Europeans ( no salca, or not too spicy) but still it my number 1 stop to have Turkish food

Anyone with any nouse whatsoever would be selling Blue Moon beer there already. Now I know it exists, I might approach them about it. Most City fans would assume it was brewed expecially, and if it is any good and as cheap as you say, devour it.

			I have had the same experience as you, almost exactly. I was being serious about pollutants, flouride, etc. There is also the effect of altitude on boiling point of water, so brew times differ for different altitudes. I think the milk is a biggie. Even here in Switzerland, the milk tastes very different in tea between farms (unpasteurised also). Then again, the blend of milks you get in a supermarkets here are yet more variables.

You can find it at some boutique cheese shops, or even Migros.

683	Food and drink	Stupid question: How to cook bratwurst on the stove without burning it?	Pancakes	4164	62	Location: Zurich	07.02.2015, 18:58	"    Yup, we make it right in the pan with the sausage. Slice some onions into thin slices. Half a small white onion should do for 2 people.   
When the sausage is about 5 mins from done, drop a small knob of butter into the pan away from the sausage. Once it's bubbly, add the onions and let them soften and brown, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon. Add a little bit of white wine on them if they look dry. Don't worry if they mix a bit with the sausage. Again, we cook this covered, not open.   
Remove sausage from pan when it's done. While it's resting, quickly finish the sauce. Turn up the heat and add a little bit of flour to the onion-wine mix. Stir to incorporate (kind of like making a roux) and then add more wine to make the sauce. Stir constantly so it isn't gummy! Add a bit of salt and fresh-grated pepper. If you don't want to use wine, bouillon works too (we use veggie stock sometimes).

I don't know if they'll catch on here, though, as you need a few things that aren't generally sold here (marshmallow fluff) and they weren't well received when I made a big batch of them for a school 'brunch'. Whoopies are the perfect kid treat, really, as the icing is on the inside of the cake and they're easy to eat while running around the playground (or elsewhere)   
Actually, your DiL is also a bit behind the curve as whoopies were big two years ago, eclipsed by macarons which are now being replaced for a new fad, madeleines.

They have a lot more in the shop than on line, including several Laphroig (my OH's favourite with Lagavulin).

But in spite of a slight difference of size, the Thing remains the SAME. If you in London or in Zürich simply walk into the next Restaurant around the Corner without having a Close look, there most likely will be a disappointment  --- not least as Food is always subject to your personal taste. What you find excellent and enjoy a lot, is rubbish to the next. What others praise as superb is rubbish to you

			Hi there,   
Myself (Gemma) and my bf (Mike) are new to Zürich and would love to organise a dinner party to meet some new friends! If you're new (or old) to Zürich and would like to join us for a relaxed evening of food and wine, let me know!    
To give you some info on us: we're both in our late 20's and working in Zürich since moving here in December. I work at a startup near Binz and Mike is a post-doc at ETH. I am British and Mike is Irish and we moved here from Boston where we had been living for a few years. We love to cook for friends and think it would good to try this in Zürich to meet some new people. We're not really ""foodies""... we just like to cook for ourselves and have a glass of wine while we do it!    
If you're interested send me a private message with some info on you and if you'd be able to join us next weekend (date TBD). We're living near Schmiede Wiedikon (Kreis 3).   
Happy Saturday!  
Gemma

697	Food and drink	Comelon burrito bar - good mexican food in vevey	vaud777	1622	0	Location: Vaud	27.01.2015, 12:51	" 
			
			Having tried mexican food all over switzerland, using some of the reviews of this forum as a guide, i am quite impressed by the food at Comelon burrito bar.   
The owners run a tortilla company that sells to Manor and perhaps some other places and they finally opened a small storefront in the old town in Vevey, just off the marche.       
(they seem to have more info on their facebook page)   
Prices are reasonable for switzerland (CHF 13.50/burrito, CHF 18 meal with chips and drink, or 9 to 11 for a quesadilla +4.5 for meal combo).    
Mexico is a a big place with all kinds of regional food variations, and mexican food in the US has all sorts of different regional variations as well, but to me the flavors, concept and price of this place are really good and worth a try - especially after trying place after place over the past few years and being very disappointed.  There are definitely aspects that aren't ""authentic"" but in the same way that a chipotle burrito isn't authentic either, but still tastes good (to me).   
It has a similar vibe to burrito brothers or amigo taco in lausanne, but has more seating.   
some downsides are the lunch only hours, potential for long lines at peak lunch time, limited menu and seating.

Only businesses can shop there.      Exactly, high-quality frozen is often the best.       I have never understood the point of stores selling thawed-from-frozen seafood. Cuz that combines the worst qualities of fresh seafood (perishability) with those of frozen (texture changes from freezing, especially if done wrong). If it's gonna be frozen anyway, why not sell it to me frozen so I can thaw it at my convenience??   
For what it's worth, the Indian shop Aggarwal receives air freight shipments of never-frozen fish and shrimp every Thursday evening (if I recall the day correctly). I need to try those shrimp...

 Try fresh orange juice, soya sauce and a dash of sesame oil. You could also add garlic and chilli, according to taste.   
Enjoy your fondue.

To answer Peebix's question, unfortunately they only operate during the Christmas market. They don't have a permanent stall or restaurant anywhere. So, next year it is then.

Now, the most common Swiss brat is the ultra-finely ground veal one (though often cheaper ones contain pork as well), but the pork brats here are pretty much the same as in Germany.

			If any of you have recipes eg.   that require a deep dish pie plate you will know that they are relatively difficult to find in CH.    
The typical CH glass pie plate is about 29-30 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm high. Great for certain tartes but not good for anything that has more volume.   
TopTip (Coop group) is currently selling a set of 2 glass pie plates (reg. CHF 24.90 for CHF 12.90). The one that is most interesting is the larger one that is 30 cm diameter and  (measured at the rim). The brand is borcam. The smaller pie plate is 24 cm in diameter and 4.5 cm at the rim.   
Their code for the product (if you don't see it) is 4.696.629

and then go and buy it on that day. The same idea is good

			Thanks for all of the suggestions!!!!! I've pasted them all in one place so far, so easier to access:   
Try usgang.ch or tillate.com for listings     
Start with a bar crawl around Niederdorf (old town) and check out bars like: 
-Cabaret Voltaire (Niederdorf) 
-Eddies Weinstube (Niederdorf) 
-El Lokal (near to Sihlpost, Google location)   
Check out Langstrasse, and bars/clubs like: 
-Gonzos 
-Zukunft   
Les Halle - ok 
Stall 6 - pretty boring and rarely busy. Awful for people watching. 
Clouds, the highest bar in Zürich (physically at least) - Posh.  
Rote Fabrik - average and overrated place, quite far from anywhere else, and very crappy service. Much better in Summer 
El Lokal - good, as suggested 
Rimini, on the river Sihl - not even open now... so pointless suggestion 
Hafenkneipe - Nothing special, but has live music occasionally... 
Schiffbau, has a bar on top - average, and layout not good for people watching. 
this is seasonal but should have winter bar:   - (Summer place)   
- Edis Weinstube for inexpensive wine and a laid-back atmosphere for chatting. 
- Paddy Reilly's on a Friday/Saturday night- usually charts music and a lot of people chatting and dancing. 
- Clouds at the Prime Tower, if you want to try some unique cocktails and enjoy a great view of the city.  
- Jules Verne bar is nice for this also... 
- Barflyz in Enge is another nice place for a chat, with good prices. 
- Meyers in Wiedikon is open late, and a fun dive bar. 
- Old Crow has a nice atmosphere and an excellent beverage selection. 
- Purpur and Carlton are both nice, but a little pricey for what you get (esp Carlton with their Tuesday afterwork ripoff).   
I've been in Mascotte, and a few other paid-entry clubs, and they generally get too crowded for me.   
El Toro Bar in Langstrasse- for Latin music.   
In the Langstasse area: 
- Bar 3000 (small but trendy) 
- Mata Hari (fun tiki bar)

766	Food and drink	Gandhi restaurant Luzern	PaddyG	1375	10	Location: Pensier, Fribourg	13.11.2014, 14:13	"    No we didn't  . As you said, it is indeed now a Chinese type restaurant, yet still has a rather nice, functioning website  .  
However, we spoke to the Indian guy at reception in our Jailhotel and he recommended another restaurant close by, the Gourmindia, which was actually very good. I had a rather tasty chicken with spinach and mint curry. And they had Kingfisher beer  .   
Another tip, for a cheap night in Luzern, you can't beat the Jailhotel; clean and functional with a decent shower in each room for only 40.- per night for a single occupancy room. Basically all you need after pogoing and moshing to Stiff Little Fingers  .

768	Food and drink	Rye Whiskey	ToothCentral	9870	70	Location: Chur	24.07.2012, 18:03	"    Templeton is a good one too, but my education in ryes was done in the U.S. where a large selection is very accessible so I quickly started to categorize and rate whiskies...especially by value.   
I found Templeton to be very agreeable, but at 35 USD, it couldn't stand a chance against a 20 USD Rittenhouse. Bulleit was also a staple of mine. They make a great bourbon at a decent price. Since you like Bulleit Rye, try Knob Creek's for a few dollars more; it is now one of my favourite special evening drinks. It is not twice as good as Rittenhouse, but it has more interesting flavors and is less fiery. I drink it on the rocks, while Rittenhouse makes the perfect mixing rye for Manhattans. Also if you get a chance, try the Thomas H. Handy...it's 135 proof but sublime!   
Speaking of which, I recently tried Cocchi's sweet vermouth. It's a very fine contender for the #1 spot which is currently held by Carpano Antico. I'm coming to terms with the fact that a Manhattan pretty much knocks me out by 20:30. If I drink just the rye I have no drowsiness. So I too am moving toward drinking just single liquors. I'm also a fan of Monkey 37 Gin made in Germany. It's excellent neat but also in a G&T.

772	Food and drink	White truffle!	thewiz	1247	1	Location: Männedorf	22.11.2014, 00:52	" 
			
			The market for white truffles is not easy, most restaurants buy only from their usual supplier, because the product is really expensive and guests expect high quality because of the price. 
The demand is not very high, even in zurich. 
Most restaurants have only truffles on special occasions, because the truffels loose weight (white truffles around 10 % in 3 Days ), so if you can't sell it in 3 days , you will loose a lot of money.

			Was at ALIGRO Zch-Altstätten/Schlieren today. Among their wines they have the Moroccan GUERROUANE, the Algerian CUVEE DU PRESIDENT and the Tunisian CHATEAU MORNAG, and some a bit overpriced Château Kefraya from Lebanon.      
Bought several bottles (including one Argentinian MALBEC) and on the march over to the bus station felt like a transportation donkey. But happy now with some good wines. And as I now know a fairly fast way from the bus 31 in Schlieren over a bridge and then just along some football fields will give Aligro further visits in future

782	Food and drink	Home sous-vide cooking	Caviarchips	2969	20	Location: Basel Stadt	30.10.2011, 20:10	"    It works on the basis that different parts of the meat transform at different temperatures -- hence, you can make a totally succulent, entirely medium rare steak with no risk of overcooking by holding it at a constant 55C until the entire piece of meat reaches that temperature.  Because you don't exceed that temperature, the meat does not cook beyond the desired point.   
You then finish it over a very high heat to seal in all of the Maillard-reaction yumminess.   
Chances are, if you've had a steak in a decent steakhouse in the past five years, you've had a sous-vide steak.  Sous-vide means that even the most hung-over line chef can turn out consistent steak after steak, each cooked to perfection.

			there is a titits right above the railway station inside. It's a vegetarian restaurant that has a really great buffet and great vegetarian and vegan options (they are all labeled if they are vegan or not)   
also in the pilatusstrasse there is a dean&david (I'm not sure if it's vegan, but it surely is vegetarian)

			We buy non perishables in germany. I send my OH and he gets the nappies, wipes, baby jars there too. We definitely see the savings in the long term as we usually put all the tax back aside and eventually it adds up to do the christmas shopping at the end of the year! So don't underestimate it    
We then spend about 600-800fr extra a month for a family of 4, plus that includes the entertainment food bill.

			Terrific rundown & excellent points, Magick...Grazie   
I'm willing to put in the time & effort to get a wonderful shot, complete with rich golden crema...and even invest in a high priced machine...But I also realize they come with risks, particularly in terms of a lack of warranty/repair that can turn something into an expensive paper weight   
I did get the impression the Elektra was more classic sports car whereas the Marcozzo seemed a bit more BMW/Mercedes but I think a good shot almost always involves a learning curve   
Temperature was something I learned from my wife, whom I met when she was working as a barista at a cafe, can be an overlooked yet vital aspect of the elusive perfect shot...I'm sure many of us have had a bad shot before as a result of a machine running too hot and burning it...And of course a great burr grinder - I had a Mazzer back in the US and the mini was the one I was eying for here as well

			I usually cook it in a pressure cooker. I have a small \ 2 liter cooker into which i add one cup of red rice , add 3-4 cup water and give it 1-2 whistle . 
This takes 20 minutes to cook. After waiting for ten minutes for the steam to cool off before removing the whistle and then the lid , i add salt as required and like to have it with spicy pickle. 
Total cooking time is JUST 30 min.

But - re-read your post as if someone else had written it- and then I'm sure you'll see how crazy the whole thing is. Driving further and further to get a bargain, maybe 10, 20% less- and then throwing 50% of it. Just sheer madness- in a 1000s of ways.   
This is not meant to be a personal criticism either- I hope you realise.

My favourites so far (but, I've only visited 100 breweries of the 250 or so in CH so far) are    
in BS:       
 in the rest of CH:      (GR)   (JU) (VD) (BE)   (BE)    (ZH)   
There are so many good ones out there, you just need to look for them and don't expect to find them in your local coop.  As previous noted the site   is a great resource for swiss beer hunting  .

You have to use 1/5 package in your recipe. If you have a good enough scale simply use 3.2 g.      
If you have measuring spoons, just meassuere first how many ml one package is and then go from there.

826	Food and drink	Marked down food on Saturday Arvo?	swamp rat	2449	28	Location: Lausanne	11.10.2014, 20:41	"    I agree with this. In the summer months, I'd sometimes swing by Coop on Monday, see what's marked down, buy some items and freeze them.   
Sometimes on Saturdays around 3:30 pm, the Coop starts to mark down items. That happened pretty much like clockwork at the Coop in Bassersdorf - but not always on the same items.   
However, I do think over time stores take note of how customers are reacting to these ""promotions"". If you make a trip to the store one time and you find no sales, you are probably still not going to leave empty-handed. I think it's a rather clever ploy.

Although I confess I didn't realise they had any Cointreau in them  But dry? Naah, they're much better like that than all soggy. More like a proper, i.e. British, biscuit      that's one of the most annoying things about US recipes that measure solids/powders by volume instead of weight. Same with flour - it's quite possible to fill a container, then knock it down and fit more in.    
And of course using proper metric measures means that even water quantities that we do measure by volume means you can still weigh them without any conversion needed (1ml=1g).

			Reading a book written by a distant cousin from Melbourne- about the links between Neuchâtel (and Vaud) wine-growers starting up the vineyards of Geelong from 1839 to 1890s when they were almost totally destroyed by Phylloxera, and later replanted. Fascinating history, and for me all the more poignant as 2 families of my ancestors emigrated then and were heavily involved in the planting and development of the vineyards, the Pettavels and the Tétaz.   
Anyone from that area?

			Making a brine measuring salt by volume is bound to fail as the amount will heavily depend on grain size.    
I used a 5% solution, where half of the liquid was vinegar (mixture of 2/3 wine and 1/3 apple cider). 
I added bay leaf, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, garlic, fresh dill.   
During the so called Sauregurkenzeit (July-August), you can get cucumbers, flowering dill, jars, and a big variety of vinegar at any German supermarket.

867	Food and drink	Indian paneer (cheese) in Baden	scorpion29	2328	19	Location: Baden 5400	21.05.2014, 22:14	"    I made mutter paneer bhurji last night using Coop paneer.   
I made 2 observations:   
- I found it a tad salty as compared to the paneer I'm normally used to. When making a dish with it, take this into account and reduce the amount of salt you add to the recipe.   
- I also found the texture similar to a semi hard cheese (Asiago/Provolone/Emmental). I'm normally used to a more crumbly textured younger paneer, rather than semi-hard/stretchy.   
It worked great in the recipe because I adjusted the level of salt, grated it and cooked it for a very short time. But there is a difference.   
In terms of convenience and not having to go into the city to an Indian shop, it's brilliant. Fortunately my local Denner is now selling paneer from a local farm and I'm really looking forward to trying that out.   
p.s. I am aware that asiago/provolone/Emmental varies depending on how long it's matured, I'm talking about the semi hard kind which I think is matured 2-3 months.

868	Food and drink	New sushi in Saint Louis	Village Idiot	1193	1	Location: Basel	19.09.2014, 11:25	" 
			
			What can I say?  I'm impatient.   
Instead of waiting for a review, we headed down to the restaurant at lunchtime today and were pleasantly surprised with the results.  Yeah, the place is never going to win awards for its authentic Japanese menu (it's the standard French-Japanese formula of set menus with sushi, sashimi, gyoza and yakatori in various combinations that you find in every Japanese restaurant in France), but they've not done badly.   
The interior decoration is nice enough and the place has obvious just been redone.  It's nicer inside than it looks from the street.   
The various combos cost between EUR14 for the smaller ones to EUR20 for the bigger ones.  We ordered the big sharing combo (""on veut un bateau, svp!"") with soup, salad, 8 nigiri, 12 maki, and 24 slices of sashimi for EUR48.   
Notably, the quality of the rolled sushi and freshness of the fish are much better than Fuji sushi (at the other end of Saint Louis).     
My colleague and I went in with low expectations, but they turned out to be unfounded -- the place is pretty good!  If you haven't tried this place yet and need a reasonably-priced sushi fix, give it a go.

869	Food and drink	Lebanese Restaurant [ZH or Winterthur]	Steven_K	3987	26	Location: Winterthur	09.07.2013, 17:50	"    If I'm in the vicinity, I'll stop by for a quick bite. Unfortunately I find their food just ok, nothing outstanding. I find it very strange that they use Thai sriracha as their chilli sauce. It puts me off to be honest. While I love sriracha, why serve it with Lebanese cuisine? It just doesn't seem right to me...And yes, chilli is extremely important to me!      Delices d'orient is a place I frequent often. I love the food there.  A couple of times, as soon as I walked in the door, they offered me a free hot crispy fried falafel as a sample. Great hospitality!    
It's a tiny spot with a couple of stools, and as long as you go during meal times, the food is fresh, delicious and inviting. I've also once been in the middle of the afternoon but I was unfortunately served 'warm drawer dried out chicken' shawarma.    
I often have their kafta teller consisting of a fantastic range of mezze on one plate with 2 large kaftas and a piece of durum/fladenbrot. Plus he makes his own chilli sauce  .   
Noonbar I have yet to try, looking forward to it...

I know I could order it online from pasar-indonesia.com, but am just wondering whether I could find asian stores around that sell it. In many asian stores that I often go to (e.g. Lian Hua in Wiedikon and Berninaplatz), I could only find Thai, Viet, and Filipino instant seasoning mixes. Thank you for the info  !

883	Food and drink	Water kefir grains and kombucha	augusta	1202	4	Location: Basel	02.06.2014, 20:55	" 
			
			Hi,   
I had some water kefir grains last year (and sent some to a few other EFers who contacted me via the other kefir thread). Unfortunately I don't have any anymore, but I originally bought them online from the webshop link posted somewhere near the start of that thread (sorry I am on my phone so can't link to it easily!). So if you have no luck finding a donor you could start from there.   
[edit:    
It took me a few batches to get the grains I bought going, presumably they were from frozen storage or something, and it takes a little tlc to revive them, but after 3 or 4 batches we were in business        
Yes you make water kefir using a sugar solution and usually do a second ferment after removing the grains, adding fruit juice or something else to flavour it.    
Good luck!

895	Food and drink	What are your favourite pantry staples?	harrypotterfan	556	0	Location: Wettingen	28.08.2014, 00:51	" 
			
			We are from India, and have not been too experimental in our cooking - we usually stick to Indian masalas and spices; the only non-Indian pantry supplies we buy have been restricted to: 
A variety of herbs 
Cheese (mostly brie, gouda, feta, parmesan) 
Vinegars (rice, balsamic, chilli, apple cider) 
Sauces (soy, tomato, fish sauce, sweet and sour, teriyaki, barbeque) 
Olives 
EVOO   
With the above, I my weeknight meals range from Chinese, Thai, Italian, Mexican (aside from the obvious Indian).  
Recently, at a friend's place, I tried pasta with tinned sardines and I was blown away by the boost of flavor from these.    
I'd like to know what are your favourite pantry staples from local stores here - sweet/ savory doesn't matter - would love to try new and interesting flavors in our cooking. TIA!

901	Food and drink	Quark - What is it ?! Here's Help !	Me Myself &amp; I	11702	39	Location: Züri	24.09.2009, 14:43	" 
			
			I bought a Quark Tart from Migros over lunch, not the Cheesecake kind, the freshly baked pie kind at the Gourmesa.    
Nice bit of sweet pastry with a very thin filling of Quark and raisins. I liked it very much and it was certainly worth the 3.50 francs.    
But what's with the dreaded raisins? The Quark Torte even had lots of raisins in it. Not my taste.

903	Food and drink	Great recipes from your local CH area...	Odile	998	7	Location: Neuchatel	25.08.2014, 16:11	" 
			
			Found a receipe in English for Pizokel:   
Pizokel with cabbage, Canton Graubünden (Bizoccals cun ravitscha)       Pizokel were eaten in a wide variety of ways. In some places when eaten by themselves they are known in Rumantsch as ""bizochels bluts"", or bald pizokel.    
If someone leaves a small amount of any kind of food on the serving dish for politeness sake, in the Engadine this is called ""far sco quel dal bizoccal"", meaning more or less leaving the last pizokel.       
Ingredients for the pizokel for four people:   
* 7 oz buckwheat flour 
* ¼ cup milk 
* 2 beaten eggs 
* ½ oz finely chopped Bündnerfleisch (air-dried beef) 
* ½ oz finely chopped Salsiz (spicy salami-type sausage) 
* ¾ oz finely chopped leek 
* 1 tsp butter 
* salt 
* nutmeg   
Ingredients for vegetable and bacon accompaniment:   
* 2 oz bacon strips 
* 1 pinch garlic 
* ½ oz finely chopped onion 
* 1 tsp butter 
* 4 oz Savoy cabbage 
* 4 oz spinach 
* salt 
* pepper 
* nutmeg 
* ¼ cup whipping cream   
For the pizokel:   
1. Put the flour, milk and eggs into a bowl and stir to obtain a smooth dough 
2. Braise Bündnerfleisch, Salsiz and leek in the butter, then mix into the dough. 
3. Spread the soft dough thinly over a clean surface, using your hands. (It will be too soft use a rolling pin.) 
4. Cut into strips about 2 inches long, and drop into boiling water. 
5. When they rise to the surface, fish them out with a slotted spoon.   
For the accompaniment:   
1. Cut cabbage and large spinach leaves into large pieces, but leaving no leaves whole, and cook briefly in salted water.  
2. Drain well. Braise bacon strips, garlic and onion in the butter, add vegetable mixture. 
3. Add drained pizokel. Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg. 
4. Stir in cream and serve immdiately

908	Food and drink	Where to find, what to call... Baking ingredients	SwissMiss86	2070	22	Location: Enge	22.08.2014, 11:47	"    The Thai brown sugar above is moist and you can form a ball in your hands.         You're probably right that the stuff in Coop in the little vials is flavoring. As I said, I don't need to look for it that often. I don't use that much and last time I was in the US I bought quite a large bottle of the stuff.    
But extract is available in Switzerland. What I would usually buy is always extract. You can get the bio Madagascar vanilla extract in the Aligro. I imagine it's not that expensive as I'm really cheap.   There is no way on earth I'd pay 18.90 for 100ml of vanilla. Though I do love the NOMU products. The sugar and spice mix is yum!    
You can also find the pods readily. I usually get them in the Migros.

She/he just wanted to know if it was possible to find a good burger here. If you had ever had a decent one, you'd understand that the meat in the burgers here often is quite bad.   
Despite someone living in a foreign country, you can't expect them to just automatically change their taste buds accordingly. Besides, if the Swiss didn't like hamburgers, then every McDonald's and Burger King that I see here wouldn't be packed at lunchtime.

All was super untill 3 weeks ago when I sat in for the first time and he brought me my fladen brot but with a lot of fat pieces in the meat and barely spicy enough. I can not bring myself to go there again.....maybe in a few weeks to see if it tastes better now  , just need to get that fatty meat taste out of my head first.

I should clarify that this obviously depends on who you're eating with.  People in big cities, or people more widely travelled are perhaps not going to react so badly. Both times this happened it was with more 'local' people who were friends of friends, or family of family (once in France, once in Ticino).

I know it seems stupid of me to ask such a question but I've never seen the word used before. Afterwards I looked it up in the dictionary and there it was. But surely it should be at least 'pre-made', that would be more like reality. I find it's not a logical way for a description - I could say that the new camera I have bought is also premade - simply because everything we have is 'premade'.

			Migros Frey Praline Branches or Co-op Parline Branches.   
They look expensive in their own foil packings and taste nice and resonable price especially if you get them in ACTION!     
Lindt chocolate really has hit the Uk market. 
I think they were lucky in that they had a large advertising campaign just when Cadbury's had a huge recall of their product. 
Lindt chocolate is cheaper in the UK than in Switzerland at the moment (rate of exchange). 
Lindt were only sold in expensive places, but now you buy it in supermarkets in the UK (Sainsbury).

The label on the bottle says Hugo and I thought it was the trade name ( they brought another one which was pink and was a fizzy mix of elderflower and red fruit but it also had Hugo on the label). The red one was very nice. Think I'll open the other on Tuesday before a girly lunch. 
It came from Lidl apparently.

			Wonderful Susan that he finally outgrew his allergy to eggs. Our grandson (8) in the UK is severely allergic to eggs and some nuts, and as you say- it makes life so difficult as few people really understand the severity of the reaction. Hospital now say he is unlikely to grow out of it as he gets older- he copes so well with it, but misses out on camps and nights away, etc. Hi dad went with him to Scout camp recently, and he was so happy. Both parents coach rugby at his local club so he does not miss out with sport either.

			I heart my cast iron skillets. Have two large ones (Lodge, Le Creuset) and 2 5-inchers that are at least 30 or 40 years old. Make GREAT eggs, surprisingly.   
But I digress. I use salt to de-crust if necessary and re-season with some type of animal fat after cleaning, wipe dry and re-hang.

953	Food and drink	Bad vegetables in Migros	Radha	5036	52	Location: Zurich	31.07.2012, 13:18	"    When I buy mine fresh, I store them (on the fridge's veg shelf) on a large platter next to each other, leaving gaps between the berries, as opposed to keeping them all smushed together in their teeny box. This way, sorting out the bad ones is easier and they tend to stay fresh longer.   
Another important thing is to leave the green stems/leaves on because cutting them off a long time before use will lessen the berry flavor and give bugs etc. a way to get inside.

Oat meal was the cornerstone of my plan  good to know the price.  Multi vitamin I have already.   
I am not yet in Switzerland.  I live in a place where one can buy a whole watermelon for 2.5 cents, and a meal of rice porridge for 38 cents.  I do have a computer and an internet connection.  I have prepaid accommodation for the whole time that I will be in Switzerland, occasionally with breakfast, will not be homeless.  I will have money for food in Switzerland, but I have a lot of obligations at home, and prefer to spend less.  I do not know if I will allow my self to go to a soup kitchen, I have not taken charity before.  This is not a solicitation of free food or equipment, but ideas and information is very much appreciated.    
Dumpster diving. -- eating discarded food found in a public place -- that is something that interests me.

			I don't believe in Pharmaceuticals. They give you temporary relief, if they work.   
If I start to get sniffles, which is rare, I delve into my supply of dried nettles and locally bought honey and make a tea.   
If I don't have any dried nettles, I'll nip into the nearby woods and pick some wild nettles, given the right time of year.   
Nettle contains a natural histamine and clears up any sniffles I have, if ever.   
I also add peppermint to the brew.

			I think it is real but a very exaggerated condition. Part of the problem is that the wheat we eat has changed dramatically since humans first started harvesting & grinding plants into flour to make bread. Old style wheat looks nothing like what we see growing today, old style wheat is about 3 times the height for one. Also given that bread, cakes etc are normally made of a highly refined product that bears little resemblance to what our bodies were used to I'm not surprised that some people have problems with it. It can also be a problem of overloading, wheat based cereal for breakfast, sandwich for lunch & pasta for evening meal; that is not balanced. Too much of any one food is going to leave you feeling crap whether that is apples or bread.    
Personally I avoid too much wheat/gluten, if I have too much my stomach bloats and feels very uncomfortable therefore I try to avoid it by eating a varied diet and using other forms of grain for my carb intake. If someone gives me a sandwich or cooks me pasta I will happily eat it though. Too many people use it as an excuse to not eat certain food.

Coop carries a  , the line is called Freeform. I love their cottage cheese.   
Personally I can't stand soy products. But Migros does have a nice  . I use that for desserts.   
I make my own hummus:   
Ingredients 
200g canned chickpeas 
2 tbsp lemon juice or more 
2 garlic cloves, crushed 
1 tsp ground cumin 
Salt 
3 tbsp tahini (sesame seed paste) 
4 tbsp water 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
1 tsp paprika   
Preparation method: 
Drain the chickpeas and rinse. 
Combine the chickpeas, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, salt, tahini, and water in a food processor, and blend to a creamy purée. 
Add more lemon juice, garlic, cumin or salt to taste. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Store in the fridge.   
You can also substitute half the chickpeas with a small boiled beetroot for a lovely earthy flavour.

I'm sorry but this is really not true. I've eaten Wagyu (Kobe) on a number of occasions and you can't eat it rare. Kobe is prized because of the tightly packed marbling and this marbling needs to have time to render all the way through in order to get the delicate, almost gelatinous texture Kobe-eaters are after. Kobe needs to be cooked to a minimum of medium rare and probably medium to soften the fat all the way through.

			It might also be worth to check out the Barkat store at the Schmiede Wiedikon. I have no clue what the concept of this store is other than ""We sell stuff from all over the world and cram as many loud people into our store as we can. Our customer service is atrocious, but we make up for it by selling awesome stuff that you don't want to live without anymore"".   
They have this godawful Nkulenu Palm Juice. I know that much. I tried it and I can see why someone would think that this is a beverage, but then to export it is a bit of a stretch.

Coke is around 1.20 for 500 ml, Dr. Pepper 1.60 for 500 ml and a ""regular"" brand-name soda (Sprite, Fanta etc.) 1.10-1.20 for 500 ml. Store brands sometimes go as low as .60 for 500 ml or even lower (e.g. M-Budget sodas in 1l bottles).    
I guess that Irn Bru, like Dr. Pepper, will always be sold at a slightly higher price than drinks which are well-known to the Swiss population.

There's a bit more about Swiss cheese than way too young vacuumed Emmentaler and Tisiter. In the lower Emmental alone, the heartland of the big holes, there are at least five cheeses (not called Emmentaler) that are delicious, especially when thinly planed, but you won't find them at Migros or Coop.     When American chefs slap a glob of whitish silicone goo on top of something and call it Swiss, there are no holes that could delight the eater.

1017	Food and drink	Beer Tap Rental for Private Events	Confloozed	1187	0	Location: Zurich	24.05.2014, 06:45	" 
			
			Since being here I have sought out this option numerous times, and since have a couple of personal options I can use. But I was thinking, since I had such a hard time finding the real thing, could others be interested in renting my tap system for parties and etc? I have a professional, mobile beer tap system that works for kegs with CO2 cannisters. It's always too expensive to have to rent the tap, then buy an entire keg, and the C02, plus the depos on all of these.      
So I was thinking, is there any interest, from say people on this forum to rent a tap system, where they paid a fee for the tap/Co2, the weight of beer used, and be done with it(putting a deposit down on the system as well of course, for parties, events, etc?      
I know from experience, if you try to arrange all this stuff on your own, the cost of beer is far more expensive then just buying bottles and putting them on ice. But, under my idea, it would either less expensive or on par, but it's always more kool to have your own tap. I tried to make this into a survey, but I don't see how to make that part of this thread work.     
So, is, there any interest? And if there is an interest, any suggestions on what a fair price would be for a service like this would be? Without working out details yet like, who picks it up, should it be delivered, and so on. Thanks.

Quite the opposite, in fact, which is why we succeeded so well. If we live in times and places of plenty we can eat meat three times a day, with some vegetable intake as well, and survive perfectly well. In other times or places we can live on an entirely meat-free diet, albeit needing a lot more of it to survive.    
Being an Omnivore does not require that you eat all kinds of foods, just that you can if you want to.

It does juices and smoothies, and prices are around 6chf for 3dl, and 9chf for 5dl. That's actually very similar pricing to the UK.   
Website here    
Location here    
Will give it a try one time and report back.   "	Posts: 9,274	Join Date: Mar 2009	Forum Legend	Groaned at 529 Times in 401 Posts	Thanked 12,065 Times in 4,728 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

1059	Food and drink	Fishmonger in Bern outside Coop/Migros?	HiBern	713	0	Location: Bern	25.04.2014, 17:58	" 
			
			Hi,   
After seven years living by the sea, I am slowly getting frustrated by the rather limited fish options at the Coop / Migros counters. Outside of the usual suspects, either fresh or frozen (salmon, pangasius, trout, saithe, cod...), it's difficult to find anything new. Sure, this is a landlocked country, but still, not all local freshwater fish species are even available (hard to find char from Lake Geneva here, for example).   
Tried to find independant fishmongers though local.ch, they suggest the closest one from Bern is in Biel/Bienne  . Any ideas on something closer to Bern? Or a supermarket with more choice (already tried the big ones like Ryfflihof or Wankdorf)? Maybe an Asian retailer?   
Cheers, 
Tom

1067	Food and drink	Mercato fish shops - Any good ?	guest	2982	6	null	null	"    I'd take that as a good thing. Implies that they're forecasting their stock and only selling actual fresh, rather than just having a stack in the back that may or may not be fresh.   
Their quality is the best I've seen here. Definitely sashimi -able if they say so. They've been pretty upfront about it too, telling me outright that a certain piece has been out too long to trust raw. All in all worlds apart from  I've seen from coop/migros, what with their glowing red salmon and all (should never be that red, it implies CO usage to hide the real colour).   
For the prices, yeah they're high, but go in about 30 mins before closing and everything in the fresh counter is 1/2 off. Yes, it's end of the day stock, but still better than coop/migros, and now cheaper.

This way producers can legitimately offload stocks of pears which can't be used for anything else.   
Often, it is the pear juice that produce the squits.

			So how did it turn out? It shouldn't have actually mattered what cream you used. If it was a cooked custard then the eggs in the recipe are your thickening/setting agent. I just use plain double cream when making custard tarts, sauces and everything else. I save the Gruyeres double cream for when I just want delicious thick cream to spoon over pies, fruit, scones etc.

And restaurants visits can destroy a budget in one go  
Compared food costs with relatives in the US, and they were rather horrified.   
CHF 35 sounds pretty usual to me.

Shell-fish trawlers don't 'accidentally' catch skate or any other fish. They just take the destruction of all other marine life caught in their trawl nets into account. Once the 'fruits' of their labours have been sorted on board, the rest, and there can be quite a lot of it, - now dead - is simply heaved back into the sea. If it is taken 'home' it's used for animal feeds, mainly as cat food in tins or increasingly as fertiliser. More and more sea fish and shell fish are being farmed as there are no substainable fish at normal fishing depths. These fish are filled with nasty chemical things and live in each other's sh*t.

			You can buy raw ingredients. 
You can also buy the migros and coop packaged Mexican food, I suggest you don't. 
They have a Mexican place in Niedel Dorf. The place has colorful chairs, and the food is really good. Although it is expensive. I think it's about 25-30CHF for a dish.

			Don't know about Zug. There was an (ir)regular Sunday Roast at Pot Belly's that JLF used to organise. They used to be (IIRC) SFr45 for all you can eat with beef, pork and I think chicken.   
The thing to do is find an expat-friendly restaurant who might be able to do it as a one-off and arrange a meetup through EF.   
Cheers,

The dark green parts I freeze for when I'm ready to make a more hearty winter soup with potatoes, etc.  They just need to be cooked a while to soften up.

			Rumensee in Küsnacht has a barbeque spot and I'm pretty sure they have toilets and a play area.   
Other places without toilets and playground but also good are   
at the top of the number 6 tram route, walk past FIFA building, there is a green spot at the corner of Tobelhofstrasse and Driewiesenszrasse that is popular for barbeques.      
If you want to go out a bit further then on the Pfäffikersee northwest corner (get bus 830 to Ruetschbergstrasse) there is a nice barbeque area with a permanent grill.   
Buon appetito!

			Here in Zurich, almost all the Asian shops carry that exact product, I've bought it many times. (Only the Korean and Japanese shops don't have it.)    
That said, I rarely use it any more. I've switched mostly to using ""raw"" black beans. I buy them in the yellow cardboard tube, this is what it looks like:      
They are much, much cheaper than the prepared sauce -- a 500g tube cost Fr. 3.50 at the Chinese shop!      
To use them, I soak them in about double the volume of dry sherry for 10-30 minutes while I prep the other ingredients, then mash them a bit. And I use fresh garlic and ginger, of course.

			Should, but doesn't. Migros food coloring is absolute crap. It's so watered down as to be useless. I got some at Halloween to make stage blood, and the entire bottle of red couldn't color 2dl of liquid a decent red, just pale pink. I'm accustomed to American food coloring where a bottle would be enough for a liter or two.   
(We ended up going out and buying cassis syrup and adding cocoa powder to it, which produced a lovely dark color reminiscent of dried blood.)

1137	Food and drink	Where to buy Colombian coffee beans (other than Strabucks)?	West Coast	620	0	Location: Bassersdorf	21.02.2014, 23:17	" 
			
			Random question, but someone may be able to help.    
I'm trying to find Colombian coffee beans for our consuming pleasure. Noticed that most of the beans in the Coops and Migros are African and Asian decent and surprisingly they are very lacking in the South American varieties.    
I went to Starbucks and saw they sell one for 8.90 CHF per 250g, but I wouldn't pay that kind of scratch even if Juan Valdez and his donkey delivered it to my window himself. (plus Starbucks coffees tend to taste burnt to me anyhow)   
Anyone know of a place that sells Colombian coffee at a reasonable price?   
Thanks.   "	Posts: 56	Join Date: Aug 2011	Junior Member	Groaned at 2 Times in 2 Posts	Thanked 62 Times in 31 Posts	considered knowledgeable

That recipe looks reasonable, seriously though, try the ready-made stuff at least once so you know if you like it or not. You can find it in a Mexican shop (which you'd have to go to anyway to get the ingredients for that recipe.)

			Every year, a few weeks before Christmas, Coop start selling 'extra roasted' peanuts. (Brown/gold pack instead of red)   
I love 'em ! Crunchy and smokey   
I noticed some today and, as a treat, went mad and bought two packs.   
They're rubbish. Tasteless and soggy.    
The sell by date is March 31st 2014.. I'd wager they're from the same pre-Chrimbo batch.   
And.. they're from Egypt...    
Coincidence ? I think not.

			Have you guys seen ""Food Inc"" really good documentary.   
My rule of thumb is to stay on the outside of the supermarkets walls. You have fresh food on the outsides, veg usually on entrance down the left, meat and bread across the back and alcohol down the right hand side....   
This is because they bring out more fresh during the days, in the middle of the supermarket is where you find all the processed / dry food and thatch the real killer in our lives.   
Stick to fresh!

			I know we can get very good bread here in Switzerland but I find there is no better smell than bread baking in the oven. The apartment smells wonderful for hours after and you save money at the same time, bliss.    
You will need:   
2 cups warm water. 
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast. 
1 tablespoon light brown sugar. 
5 - 5 3/4 cups bread flour 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
2 1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 egg white lightly beaten     
In a measuring jug, pour in 1/2 cup of the warm water. Stir in the yeast and sugar. Let it stand for 30 minutes until frothy. 
I find a lot of recipes say to leave the yeast and water mixture for a few minutes but in my experience I got better results when I left it longer and I found 30 minutes to be best.   
Combine 5 cups of the flour and the salt. Add the yeast mixture along with the remaining water and olive oil. Mix dough until it comes together.    
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand until dough is smooth and firm. The dough should not be loose.   
Lightly spray a bowl with olive oil and lightly spray the dough also. Place dough in the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Leave in a warm draft free place for 2 hours until doubled in size.   
Preheat oven to 220 degrees c.   
Remove the risen dough from the bowl and punch down. Flatten the dough with the heel of your hand into a large rectangle. Roll the dough up tightly, sealing the seam well after each roll. The dough should be oval with a round end. Be sure the ends are well sealed also.   
Place dough on a floured board and baking sheet. Cover again with a tea towel  
And let rise for 1 hour.   
Brush dough with egg white and slash the bread down the middle.   
Bake for 40-45 minutes.

For every Romanian and Hungarian recipe I use I usually try to find local substitutes.

1167	Food and drink	steak with whiskey and mustard sauce	lavelle	759	0	Location: zug	08.02.2014, 16:37	" 
			
			This perfect for valentines. I cooked this a few weeks ago and served it with home made garlic potato wedges and my husband raved about it. Enjoy x   
2 Sirlon steaks 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot 
1\2 cup whiskey 
1cup chicken stock 
2 tablespoons whole grain mustard 
3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
1\2 teaspoon cider vinegar   
Pat dry steak and sprinkle with sat and pepper. 
Heat the oil in a pan over medium high heat until shimmering. Sear the steak turning once about 8 minutes for medium rare. Let steak stand uncovered for 10 minutes while you make the sauce.   
Add the shallots to the pan. Stir and cook until soft about 2 minutes. 
Add the whiskey and ignite using a long match. Be careful here I found the flames shoot right up. The flames will die down within a few seconds.  
When the flames die down add in the mustard, and stock. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook until reduced by half. About 6 minutes. Wisk in the meat juices, butter and vinegar and it is ready to serve.

1168	Food and drink	recipe for lemon drizzle scones	lavelle	1091	0	Location: zug	08.02.2014, 15:51	" 
			
			I baked these yesterday and my husband loved them. I hope you will like them too.   
1 pound/16 oz  plain flour 
4 oz butter softened 
One and a half tablespoons of sugar  
One and a half teaspoons of baking soda 
One teaspoon of salt 
Zest of one lemon 
Candied lemon pieces 
1 egg 
1 cup butter milk   
For the lemon drizzle 
1 cup powered sugar 
Juice of one lemon   
Preheat oven to 200 degrees C. 
Sift the butter, baking soda, salt and sugar I to a bowl. Rub in the butter using your first her tips until it is like sand.  
Stir in the candied lemon pieces. 
In another bowl whisk together the butter milk, egg and lemon peel. 
Make a well in the centre of the flour mix. Pour in the buttermilk mixture and using our hand bring everything together. It should be slightly sticky.  
Turn out the dough on a floured surface and form it in to a round shape. Don't over do the flour as this will change the recipe. The less handling the better it the more the dough is handled the less light and airy it will be. Using the plan of your hand flatten until it is one inch in height. 
Cut out the scones using a round cookie cutter or cut the flattened dough into 8ths. 
Place scones onto a prepared baking tray. I find it best to cover the tray with a sheet of baking parchment dusted with flour. 
Place the baking tray in the centre of the oven and bake for 17 mins if the scones are small or 20 mins using larger cookie cutters.   
For the icing mix one cup powered sugar and the juice of one lemon until it slightly runny   
When the scones are cooled drizzle the lemon icing over them. Perfect with a cup of tea!

			I absolutely love these vegetables especially KARELA... You wont find any restaurant here who could make KARELA vegetable dish for you. But a very nice lady at PARTHO STORES near ETH did make it many a times on my personal request. She is a very good cook.       Btw, you might find some (i know 3 places in Kloten) Italian/turkey shops who also sells Indian groceries and other Asian food items

And because of that, you are giving me the angry confused look? A mother is mold that grows on the surface of vinegar after a duration of time. You can take a piece of it, and add it to wine, to turn that as well into a quality vinegar, and grow/make another mother. It is faster to do if someone already has one, or you can buy it. But anyone can make one...you and Timow, really.

While I am all in favor of reducing trash (the pods are awfully expensive and wasteful, but they do make sense for very low-volume coffee drinkers; I've considered buying one just for guests, since I don't drink coffee), this just seems to combine the worst of both worlds, no?

			Question of scones - a great tip is when they come out of the oven, wrap them in a clean linen or muslin cloth.  This keeps them warm and quite moist, but a friend of mine who runs a coffee shop in Kent, always puts them in the microwave just for about 20 seconds to warm them through before serving. I am British (I bought your food processor from you last year) and we regularly have home-baked scones and they are always much nicer served warm! good luck

1211	Food and drink	Ready made samosa pastries!!!!anyone???	appelles60	2109	8	Location: zurich	28.12.2013, 17:08	"    This is a place I frequent often. As it's a little hole in the wall, I normally get a takeaway. The daily special of a beef/lamb/chicken curry, veg curry, daal and rice for 10CHF. Very cheap and very good.   
I must stress though, although the place is called India Street Food, the food they serve is Sri Lankan, not Indian. You get all sorts of Sri Lankan curries, rice dishes (biryani) and pastries (samosas) as well as delicious kottu roti. The food might read as it's Indian, but it's Sri Lankan. The address is Langstrasse 213, 8005 Zurich. I will try the masala chai next time round.   
The other place I eat Sri Lankan food at is Friend's Corner, a short 5 minute walk from this place. They have a simple café with tables and chairs to dine in.    
Between the 2, I prefer the food at India Street Food.

1214	Food and drink	Filtered water in Zurich	mugdhadeo	703	2	Location: wallisellen	08.01.2014, 14:21	"    There are some other makes of water filter, and I'm sure you can find them if you look, but your comment about making it ""safe"" is a little off the mark.   
These sorts of filters are intended to remove various minerals and trace amounts of heavy metals from the water. Tapwater is perfectly safe to begin with.    
Also worth noting that not all of them reduce water hardness, which for many people is the main reason to use them.   
And lastly, if you think that getting your post count up to ten with more dumb questions like this will allow you access to the marketplace to advertise there, you're sadly mistaken    
Edit: Actually, now I see that you're posting from several different addresses, all in India, I think it's time to say goodbye already.    
Goodbye.

			I would give Fontal cheese a try.  It is not cheddar cheese but it is milder than many Swiss cheeses.  We use it to replace cheddar in our Mexican dishes.  Migros and COOP have it in their Budget and Prix Garantie lines which are low-cost so it is a lot cheaper than what they charge for cheddar cheese here.

                  Caramelise and put them in your cups   
50 g sugar 
5 dl milk 
Vanille.        Let it boil to 40*C and pur in to cups   
Bake cups in waterbath in hested oven on 160*C for 25 Min.

For anyone owning one: remove the drawers, go inside with you hand and on the top you will first feel a flap. Remove the coffee that is stuck on it. Then go in a little bit more to the back of the machine and remove the coffee there too. This did the trick for me.

			Make your own - it's dead easy. Must say the butcher thought I was mad when I asked for a chunk of beef fat to grate - explained it is a quaint British thing - and he laughed. I put it in the freezer for 1 hour before grating into the fruit mixture and bake in a low oven (à la Delia).

			Try asking for the cote de boeuf. Although it is a French term and cut, it is better recognized, and usually entails the finest (most tender and flavorful) ribs of the whole steer.  My favorite butcher in Zurich sells a 2-rib aged cote de boeuf roast that is absolutely sublime-Metzgerei Reif on Zurichbergstrasse.

1238	Food and drink	How 'clean' is Swiss food?	TaraLorai	1522	12	Location: Wausau, WI	17.12.2013, 02:40	"     Yes it did. Almost all the Hippies I know are from there. The quality of life is awesome. The food products they have to choose from are superior to almost all of it's neighbors. I had initially interpreted this person as saying that from where they were from there was a lot of good grown food, cooking at home, etc. I thought that was funny for America as a whole, but compared to the vast majority of people I know from there, it would be a fair statement.   
Hence the ""I see you are from Wisconsin"" comment. Please try to read all of what I read first before looking thru and looking for something you think you can take out of context. It is one of my favorite states, and not a slam at all.

If you get the Heineken pass on your smart phone then every 7th beer (of specific types) is free. The place shows sports, has happy hour, and picks up around 7pm.

In 20 minutes vegetables are cooked/steamed and a piece of meat/fish/chicken is done too. Anything needing more time is planned accordingly. And, since I've stopped buying   and   sorts of processed/factory food I'm much lighter and my wallet is much heavier.

Prices I am talking about - 10 chf (Coop) / 8 euro (France). Quite a good wines can be bought in this range, but sulfite-free are by far best tasting to me (and my GF).

And, we always add a cube or two when making stock.   
I also buy veal or beef bones (with meat) for making stock.   
Even the trimmings from whatever meat your cooking, added to some bouillon, makes a better stock.

Any of the Betti Bossi recipe books in German I have found to be very good and will definitely be a help in getting familiar with the ingredients you don't know so well. 
They are straight forward and use ingredients you can generally  find easily in the supermarkets here, I have picked up most of mine from second hand shops, or rather, Brockenhaus, in German.

I hear the British fry their chips in lard ...... which is animal fat. 
So, how different is the use of a fat from a vegetable? (just interested in the difference, not that I fry anything in deep fat!) 
The container does state 100% coconut was used in the process of obtaining the fat, nothing else is added.

1323	Food and drink	Slow Food Market?	silverfern	920	1	Location: Zürich	27.10.2013, 00:49	" 
			
			Hey silverfern,   
I believe this is the one in Oerlikon. I went a couple of years back, or was it last year?? Can't remember!   
Anyhow, all I can remember is that there are around 40-50 small stands/stalls offering predominantly Swiss wines, spirits, cheeses, salumi, etc... for sale. And yes there are a few free bites/slurps to be had.    
I believe there are also talks and demonstrations but they are held in other rooms and cost more to attend. I think the standard ticket costs 20CHF per person.   
To be honest, I didn't think much of it. I've been to far bigger and better ones in my life, but at least it was an hour or so of being surrounded by F&B. (Same applies to the car show in Zürich, it's nothing compared to Geneva's Auto Salon IMO).

			I'm sorry to say but you missed the season. I made all of my dills at the end of August into early September. I've never ever seen the pickling cukes at the regular grocery stores, only the Oerlikon market and only a few vendors have them. And the pickling dill is even harder to find.    
Start asking at the market next early August to make sure you don't miss out on when everything will arrive.

1331	Food and drink	Wine Making	bobma	659	1	Location: Schwarzenberg LU	27.10.2013, 11:52	"    Google is failing me, but I happened to notice a shop in, I think, Wolfeschiessen, or at least the road from Stans towards there, which had something in its window to the effect of ""all you need for your home wine making"".    
Actually, I think it might have been the Ironmongery shop here   . Website doesn't mention wine-making, but it's a new sign, so is probably only a recent thing. They claim to speak English and French as well as German, so probably worth giving them a call to check- if it's not them then they probably know who it is.

Extrapolating from this observation to reach: ""Eating more bacon is good for humans"" looks pretty unreliable  . Or a load of rubbish if you prefer the DB version of my conclusion.

			It's a small community; I think a small group of Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese own and/or run and/or work in most of the Asian supermarkets and restaruants in Basel.   
Once one decides it's not worth working on Sunday then their families all stop wanting to work and the other venues lose their staff.   Pretty quickly, you end up where we are now; with them all shut.  Luckily Saigon Moon is still open (most) Sundays.

1354	Food and drink	Veggie burger recipe thread	Noth	912	0	Location: Lausanne	05.10.2013, 20:40	" 
			
			So I had some left over chickpeas & green lentils and wanted something different from curry or middle eastern food. Veggie burgers can be made very tasty if you add plenty of spice to the mix. Here's my recipe, feel free to add yours:   
For 5ish 120g burgers:    
- 100g dry green lentils 
- 200g of canned (wet) chickpeas or dried 
- 1-2 eggs 
- 1 onion medium size 
- 4 cloves of garlic 
- 3 dried large red chilies, to taste (I imagine any other chili works) 
- 2 tbsp madras curry powder 
- salt to taste 
- oil   
cook lentils & chickpeas together in a saucepan, the way you usually would, till tender. Pour away the liquid in sieve (reserve some liquid) and set aside.   
Chop the onion in half then widthwise so you get thin strands, chop up garlic and red chilies. Heat the oil in a frying pan, and when hot put in the onion and chili. Fry and stir every minute or so till the onion goes golden brown and add the garlic, fry for another minute then add the curry powder, mix for 30s and remove from heat.   
Next step can be done in batches if you want. Put the spice mix in the mixer, then add the lentils + chickpeas and the eggs. Add a little liquid then whizz till it becomes a fairly uniform paste. Next form the burgers with your hands, and put each one in clingfilm so they keep their shape, and refrigerate the lot for 1-2 hours. They keep for 2-3 days, and freeze very easily.   
To cook them, flour each side then fry at high heat till brown on one side, then flip. I don't recommend flipping them multiple times as they may fall apart. Serve with ketchup or anything that takes your fancy! Also, it's ideal hangover food if you need to go out drinking again soon afterwards.

Speaking of affordable, if anybody knows of a good place just across the border in Germany around Jestetten, Waldshut etc., that's close enough to Zurich for me.

I have also ordered from a GetrankeMarkt - they will often do ""sale and return"", glass hire and the full range of drinks - water to whisky and everything in between. Google for your nearest one.

			Adrain, I LOVE Match. It is not Lidl. And the fish people are excellent. There are certainly less glamorous groceries in the area, and it could use some sprucing in some ways. But Lidl? No. Give it another chance.

Not more expensive than other meat, but for sure more expensive than in France. Not least as Halal restaurants have to get the meat from the Alsace as Halal slaughtering still is prohibited in Switzerland. Most Halal meat etc has the same stamp as the Kosher food, which means ""controlé par le haut-rabbinat de Paris"". It is small and hidden in a way but usually clearly readable. The supreme rabbi in Paris closely co-operates with the Muslim dignitaries !

PB2 is much lower in calories than peanut butter and if made up with water and some added salt tastes very good especially if you like your peanut butter not too sweet as in the UK. Its also great for making satay sauce and bang bang chicken.

1388	Food and drink	WTB flammkuchen wood boards	amsbas	1134	5	Location: Basel Stadt	01.09.2013, 21:47	"    This is what a local SchreinerMeister (Master Cabinet Maker?) told me.  His lore is that wood work surfaces must be washed with lots of hot water and soap/disinfectant.  The water penetrates the wood, the wood swells, and destroys whatever is alien in it.   
Plastic has layers that harbor microbes, does not swell, and provides a good breeding ground for futher growth of unwanteds.   
The old fashioned way was to thoroughly scrub, with a scrubbing brush, lots of hot water and soap, all wooden work surfaces.   
I also still prefer natural wood to plastics.    
After using a board to cut anything meaty on -  board gets immersed in steaming water and Javel and then scrubbed with soap and left in sun to dry.

			We purchased one of those super-automatic coffee machines for several well thought out reasons to replace our pod machine.  The machine was on super sale at inter-discount and had wondered why the discount.   
Flash ahead to now...the machine has malfunctioned in many ways: it will only grind coffee for 1 second despite what mode its on and something mechanical inside has broken ( a spring and some plastic bits ).  Despite the fact that the machine has a warranty...I can not find the original receipt.  I guess the machine must go to an independent repair facility.     
Has anyone used a machine repair shop?  Was it expensive?  On sale the machine was 299.00 (originally 899.00).  Its proven to be a failure within 6 months although it made consistent coffee.  If an non-warrantied repair is needed what are the chances that it would be more expensive than the machine was originally?

Coop salt has iodine or fluoride plus anticoagulants in it.    
Migros sea salt says 99.5% salt but doesn't say what the other 0.05% is but does say anticoagulants are included.    
My Landi didn't have salt at all.    
I ended up using 100% Himalayan salt and so far my brine is still clear, I don't think it will go cloudy. I made dill pickles last night - can't wait for 6 weeks to pass so I can open them up!!

			Since i try to limit my carbohydrate intake, i cut the zucchini very thin - julienne at least, quick saute or steam and use instead of pasta. I also put zucchini in meatballs, meatloaf, etc. I usually eat the flowers so there aren't any squash. 
Oh, and i just remembered this....but you can stuff a zucchini with sausage/ground meat rice, tomatoes, onions, spices and some cheese on top. My mom used to do this. Good for the baseball bat ones.      
I don't know if my pup is healthy, but she eats human food  - ever since chemo,  i can't stand the smell of dog food.

Unfortunately corner-cutting (if not outright fraud) appears to be still an issue. 
Especially with the ongoing crisis - and people's want to source less expensive food - I'm afraid that our commercial food supplies are much less safe than what we've being led to believe. 
My mother never fails to get upset when she reads  the country of origin on her packs of frozen chicken breasts ""Brasil or China"" (OR...! mind you).   
OTOH I do appreciate some of the responses above to the price of the meat. I looked around and found another herder in Malcantone who sells at much more interesting prices - but the products must be picked up on site or in shops in the vicinity or ordered through the

I am hoping to integrate into the Community and was wondering what kind of events or groups are in the area. I have a dog and want to go dog walking if anyone can give me advice on dog etiquette I'd appreciate it. Thanking you all in anticipation!

I am not afraid of salt...I eat salt  . Not too much though but still I eat. 
I was just thinking about kids.  
I eat home made bread a lot as my lovely husband makes it  . 
We try to make whatever is possible from scratch:  ravioli, torteloni, pasta, special icecreams, sauces, etc etc all by himself. Better to do at least some things in your own kitchen.

			Have you been to Küsnacht? It's a charming town and easily walkable with a stroller. It's possible to walk up the hill for a great view as well.  You could drive there but we took the boat from Zurich. Anyway, you can have lunch or dinner right along the lake at one of the restaurants there. I think the Hotel Sonne has a great reputation. We've had drinks there (not a meal) but it was a lovely place with great service. Might be a bit spendy for a family dinner though.

There is actually a place called Freshii that just opened up on right by the Sihlpost stop that does healthier burritos/wraps/salads, etc.  I'm not sure if they do takeaway, but El Luchador is actually a solid mexican restaurant by the train station.  Unfortunately most of the takeaway places that I frequent are lunch only...like that Chang Mai Thai which is really good (also close to HB).

			As said above, too late for rhubarb season. Remaining rhubarb on the plant will be as tough as old boots now.   
BTW to cook rhubarb without it going to mush, make a sugar syrup and then poach the rhubarb in it. The defrost setting on a microwave is perfect for that. Soft and tender, but pieces keep their shape. I usually cook the rhubarb to all dente and cool, before making a crumble.

			With butchers its mostly about quality, often at a price higher than supermarkets but still often worth it. For example I find the ground meat from supermarkets almost unbearable and more expensive pieces not worth the try.    
Schrofen on the other hand is both very good quality and cheaper than supermarket prices.

Turn left as you come out of the main SBB exit and it is about 300 m. You cant miss it and it is fairly large with a wide selection.

As unsweetened coconut is not as moist, soak unsweetened coconut in milk for 30 minutes to add moisture to it.   
Drain the coconut and pat dry on paper towels.

Increase the amount of sugar added to the recipe by 2 tsp sugar per cup of unsweetened coconut used.

For cooking I use the Coconut oil for the reformhaus but it is round 20-30chf a jar! But  I have now found Jemoli has it cheaper in the 'rest of the world' section.   
Hope you find everything!

			Hello!   
My name is Ariana, and I LOVE to bake, just recently someone from work asked me if I can do their daughters birthday cake, I used to do this in California, people would order anything they wanted from me, and I would make it. I make homemade breads, cakes, cookies, sweet breads, I mean you name it. I try to use as much Bio products as I can. If anyone is interested in anything by the fribourg area just send me a PM

1474	Food and drink	Vinos Helvetica	CharneRochford	859	5	Location: Zurich	26.06.2013, 12:13	"    There are some excellent Swiss wines. It's dangerous to generalize, but I will.., Swiss wines are pretty old-world in style. They are usually best paired with food but some are enjoyable in their own depending on your own tastes and expectations. Reds are mostly Pinot noir and the other reds are also quite light in body relative to the same grapes in new world or further south. Zurich more a white wine territory but Switzerland is so small that there are no excuses for not visiting vineyards all over. Lots of less mainstream and/or local grapes being grown too.    
What sort of thing are you after?

 there are not many restaurants that deliver but this are two take away restaurant I can recommend:    
It's an Indian place that has good take away deals.  
The other one is an Italian restaurant that has very good and cheap pizzas.    
Unfortunately Schaffhausen doesn't have a lot of choices.  
Hope that helps

			For everyday shopping, the store suggested mollycuddy would probably then suit better.  However just so you know you can actually walk from the end of the number 8 tram across the border to the Rhinecenter.  I'm guessing it's about a 10/15 minute walk or if you take your bike you'll be there in no time.  I do also buy from my local health food shop as I like to shop local but yes it is definitely more expensive.  My main motivation for cross border shopping isn't even so much the cost saving but more the much wider variety of products that you can get across the border.  Didn't know about Biodome in France, might check that out myself this week       "	Posts: 19	Join Date: Jun 2013	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Thanks everyone for your tips and links. On the advice of a colleague we ended up going to ...   
Restaurant: Dornach Sclosshof ( ) 
Location: 10km outside Basel 
Description: In the country side with great views over Basel from the Terrace. 
Food: 6/10 (we both had tomato soup, followed by veal breast with spätzli). 
Total:chf 83.50 (this included 1 beer & 1 apple juice) 
Staff: friendly and attentive   
Summary: was ok and with the weather we had, it was a great location to be.   
Negatives: apart from price ... desert menu was again the typical commercial/mass-produced ice cream card .. very disappointing. To compensate for this, we drove to the restaurant at the top of Gempen and had a house made desert from there.

- Hungarian restaurants were successful here for many decades, so that the negative development of recent years rather is a matter of fashion   
- ""neighbouring countries"" ?  In case you mean Germany and Austria, it is zero. If you mean France, you forget that most of Swiss cuisine has been modelled along the lines of French cuisine for centuries. The one neighbour which however has conquered Switzerland clearly is Italy   
-  USA ?   The USA did have some influence, but you exaggerate this aspect as this influence has its limits. Starbucks for example is a USA company, but based on the experiences of a US-American of German origin in Italy.    
- to say that the successful Italian, Turkish, Arab, Indian, Thai, Chinese and Mexican restaurants serve Cervelat and Röschti simply is WRONG   
- Vodka is available everywhere

			Thanks Gooner...I'll have a chat with a few butchers and see what they think...I suspect everyone will tell me that fat from beef is not possible, but from pork it would be (the German part of CH is very much Pork-centric).  I've never cooked with beef fat, but I have used (extensively) other types of animal fat - pork, goose, duck, chicken, etc... What would be the main difference in the UK recipes if one were to substitute another type of animal fat (except of course the flavor)?

			It is best to establish the rules before you eat. For instance if an attractive person is sitting to your left, introduce the left hand rule: if you loose your bread in the pot you have to kiss the person on your left. Obviously if she/he is on your right you need the right hand rule.    
You can use any cheese that melts well, and tastes nice, mature cheddar for instance if you're in UK.

I had the sushi lunch plate which included miso soup, 4 pieces of nigiri, 5 pieces of 2 different rolls, 3 pieces of sashimi, and some kind of small side-dish of toast, for 26 CHF.  The sushi was commensurate with the price and it was good enough that I'll return (this meal would be $15-20 at home).   
My only negative comment is that they charged me 4.50 CHF (4.50 CHF!!!!!) for green tea, which should be free.

Any other suggestions if any of you have done it?

1544	Food and drink	gluten/dairy free life in Switzerland?	bikingfamily	5083	34	Location: San Jose CA	26.04.2013, 00:17	" 
			
			Please do read the long threads that we have already on the forum about choosing gluten free foods....   
DB will insist (and I somewhat agree) that it's not hard to get gluten free food.    
We have a child who is gluten free and also diabetic, and on insulin injections, which means he has to eat to a food plan and eat a correctly measured amount of carbohydrate at the right time.   
Fruit and veg, no problem. Print of the words for 'gluten free' in French, Italian, German so you have them at restaurants. We get salads served with no sauce (no dressing), and same with meats. That's easier.   
In our experience it's actually unusual to have sauces, sausages, fries, thickened or dusted with wheat in Switzerland - it's more commonly maizena (maize flour) or potato flour used as the thickener. No problem finding potato crisps that contain only carb, oil and salt. Since you said gluten/corn/soy free, that pretty much leaves the common ones - potatoes and rice - as your staples I guess.    
We've had no problem with the 'paprika' flavoured crisps either. Unlike where we come from they don't add milk or gluten to the flavouring in the most common brand.   
I think perhaps powdered coconut or almond milk might be the way to go if you really need your milk substitute and need something very light and easy (powder sachets are easily obtained) - but the regular supermarkets will have coconut milk in UHT packaging for 'on the go', and possibly the corn flour. You can also get 'instant' mashed potato in sachets which, despite the packaging label, does not require boiling (we make it up using boiled water).    
You will find a good supply of fresh fruit and veg to keep you going, and certainly meat is not a problem (just ask for it cooked with salt and pepper and nothing else!) - and even the sausages and processed meat products are generally gluten-free. Fish will be a problem because it tends to be crumbed or fried...   
We have had absolutely no problem with potato chips (pommes frites) here - as they are normally just potato and oil, and no hidden flour or flavourings, just double check that the cook doesn't add any extra 'flavour' onto them, and you should be fine.

Right now it is flowering and they have such pretty clumps of white flowers.  Here's a photo.       
I like to throw it in with a salad or make a pesto and eat it on bread with cheese.

			I don't have the paperwork to hand, but I seem to remember that the duty-free allowance was much higher for people who were moving than for normal visitors.  We brought in over a hundred bottles of wine and ten bottles of spirits with no problem and no duty to pay.   
(Found it:  Up to 200 litres of alcohol below 25º can be imported duty and tax free and a maximum of 12 litres of alcohol over 25º.)    
We had to pack them all separately and inventory them individually, but the movers had all the appropriate forms.  Our movers insisted that we couldn't bring any bottles that had already been opened (due to the risk of spillage rather than any legal requirement) but otherwise we had no problems.

			I make my own flour mix. 
Chickpea flour (Kichererbsenmehl) can be found in Indian stores (cheaper than the Reformhaus), it has good ""sticky"" properties and helps to keep baked goods moist. 
Ground almonds or hazelnuts give a nice flavour to the mix and add protein.   
If you can tolerate rice flour it helps with making the baked goods fluffier. I usually mix in some potato starch or tapioca starch, arrow root flour, or whatever else I can find, because hubby can't tolerate rice.   
You really have to play around with it a bit, until you find the best mix for whatever you are trying to make. I have had good luck with soda breads and muffins.

Unfortunately, I think the type I used are now consigned to history.

1567	Food and drink	Restaurant Vulcan	sam ali	2249	22	Location: Zurich	20.04.2013, 16:39	" 
			
			Off all the ""Indian"" restaurants in Zurich, Khans has been consistently good ( in Niederdorf), though it is on the higher end  
The others have their off and on days.  
I would also strongly recommend to avoid buffets and go for al la carte in most of these place.   
e.g. the best Indian meal as well as the worst meal (ok not worst but pretty bad) I experienced was with the same place Vulcan.   
There is this relatively new place thats come up in Oerlikon call Krishna's which is also pretty good for some of the south indian dishes like dosa, and vadai .. not so fond of the idlis or the sambhar.. I cook better than that           Acutally I have found Tandoori to be better than Masala. but fully agree with you on the seating arrangement. 
Kings Kurry used to be one of my favorites but has run into a bit of turbulence lately. again must be a temporary effect.

			Forgive the braindump format of this....   
The Marmaris on Spalenring (tram stop Brausebad - 1/14 & 6) is a Turkish restaurant that also has a nice range of vegetarian options - and it is reasonably priced.    
Lily's on Claraplatz (trams 6, 8, 14, 15, 17)  is worth a look. Chateau Lapin / Hasenburg (Schneidergasse of Marktplatz) has a range of Swiss options which will please a vegetarian - e.g. some of the röstis plus a vegetarian crepe that they do. There is the Kelim (also Turkish) on the back of cinema street. Also I think Zum Isaak on Münsterplatz is worth a look.   
The Parterre restaurant at the Kaserne (Tram 8)has a fairly eclectic range of dishes and I think some vegetarian given the kind of clientele. If you want cheap daytime eats, the restaurant at the top Manor is alright. Also the Thai takeaway place on Claraplatz. Also the Kornhuus (near bus 34 stop Universität) and the Ono are worth a look - oh, and the Mandir that does Indian food - including an Ayurvedic menu is not far away.    
I have also heard good things about the vegetarian options at Jays.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Yes, please check with your Regie as barbeques are often banned on balconies due to the nuisance caused to neighbours.   
If you   allowed to have one then the Migros Home Center in Carouge  certainly has them and some models are on action (offer) this week. No idea why they've chosen to use the american spelling for Centre. 
I'm sure the Coop gardening shops, Interdiscount, Conforama, atc. will have them too.   
Otherwise, you'll find plenty in the larger supermarkets and the DIY stores across the border in France.

As I see, you're living in Lausanne. There is a Greek guy near Yverdon who imports various things directly from Greece. As you can imagine, his prices are VERY high, but you can find almost everything (including olive oil).   
I don't have his details in hand, but I guess I can ask on him, if you're interested. 
Also I have seen some olive oil in Coop advertised as ""Olive Oil from Kalamata"", but I don't know how much ... ""Kalamatian"" is it actually.

			Thanks for all the suggestions everybody. The ethnic store suggestion produced the goods. I found it in a shop on the rue des Alpes in Montreux which does Asian foodstuffs. Can't remember the name but if you live in my neck of the woods and need some, all you have to do is walk from the post office, away from the railway station and the shop is a 100 metres on the RHS.   
The nice woman who sold it to me looked blank when I asked for marante. She said  said it's ""l'arrow root"".  "	null	null	null	null	null	null

			if i were you i'd set myself up near offices. there's not that many good sushi restaurants in switzerland so if you could stand out i'm sure you'd do great.    
every new restaurant always starts with decent prices. you can always jack it up a notch once you have regular flow coming in.    
you can also always try catering? i'm sure a lot of offices would want to have sushi once in a while for their friday night drinks.   
i agree with the others though, i think you're undercharging. don't forget that you're in switzerland.

I have just seen your post.  I have recently moved to Winterthur and enjoy cooking.  I would be interested in cooking together, especially cooking very nutritious food that I could serve to my family.  I tend to cook vegeterian, some chicken and fish dishes.  I enjoy cooking indian and uncomplicated recipes. If you are interested we could share  a few recipes together.

As far as water content goes, that's due to lack of aging.  Again, buy a chunk and let it dry out for a few days.  I also do this with slabs of bacon (though then it's weeks and not days)

1635	Food and drink	Treats from the U.S.?	swolman	3658	48	Location: U.S.	08.03.2013, 19:37	"    Swolman, I don't know where exactly you are writing from but you should find something distinctly unique to your town or area.   
Your Swiss hosts will appreciate something that is made locally in your region that has a story that you can relate to them.  For instance, if you are from New Jersey, bring Salt Water Taffy.  If you are from Wisconsin, bring some cheddar cheese.  If you are from the Pacific Northwest, bring some smoked salmon, etc.   
Find some distinctive liqueur or some local specialty and explain it to them and they will love it.  The more ""local"" the better.     
For example, my landlords, who are very, very Swiss but who are also very fun and open-minded LOVED the peppermint bark candy that I brought them one year for Christmas.  They had never heard of it before and they enjoyed handing it around to their other Swiss friends at one of their parties.  It became a cocktail/conversation item.

I am trying to find a recipe for cookies that Coop had in winter. The company making the cookies was Hug and the name of the cookies Noix au miel, but they are some kind of pain d'epices. I wanted to make a photo of them or see the ingredients, but our Coop is out of them since last week. It is supposed to be an authentic Swiss recipe, although I've tasted similar things in Eastern Europe and Russia (pryaniki).

My own feeling is that so long as one has a job to come to, then living here for a while is a great expereince for anyone, any family. Generally, it's a clean, healthy, comparitively safe country to live in, with a wide range of easily accessable activites - especially if one is nterested in outdoor activities or music.  All other things will fall into place, including finding whatever food specialities are desired.  School ing variations can be interesting....

			Hi all, I just wanted to inform you about a new restaurant which has opened few months ago near Buhnstrasse called 'Tandoor House'. The food is truly delicious and it doesn't give much burden on your pocket.    
The place is very close to Oerlikon, you need to take bus no.75 from there to reach Buhnstrasse.   
Dont forget to try Sheekh Kabab there its really luscious.

As for raw cheese, depends what you mean. cheese as is is fine. i.e. despite this being the land of melted cheese, you don't have to melt it to eat it.  
If you mean raw milk cheese ( unpasturised ) ... there is a very slight chance of bacterial infection.... but I wouldn't worry about that unless your child has low immunity. Like I say, I knew a kid that lived on Brie.

1690	Food and drink	what kind of bread is egg free ?	mhk	2397	23	Location: Zurich	19.02.2013, 14:16	"    There's a couple of common failings (that I've made) to do with the yeast. Mostly in a bread machine, but the same applies to hand-mixed.   
1. If you're using dried yeast be warned about its lifespan. The danger is to think that as it's dried it will last forever, but in practice stuff that's a year or two old just doesn't work as well.  
2. Salt. Be careful that you don't put the yeast and salt in immediate proximity when you're adding the water. 
3. Use lukewarm water, not cold, to help get the yeast working. Conversely, very hot water will kill the yeast before it's started.   
Also be careful about the flour. I buy ours in France, so the naming conventions are different from the UK and CH, but most 'ordinary' flours are not strong enough (i.e. not a high enough gluten content). Look for flour specifically labelled for use in bread, and even then be sure that it's not referring to germanic bread, AKA brick.

1693	Food and drink	Prk Chops frying how?	MacGregor's Daughter	1649	31	Location: Zug	16.02.2013, 19:55	" 
			
			Just a heads up, it is no longer necessary to cook pork to well done, which will almost always dry out a lean pork chop. The spirochetes that infected pork and caused Trichinosis has been eradicated from farmed pigs.   
When I fry them I always put them in foil for a few minutes afterwards, before serving. They continue to cook a very little bit, but the meat relaxes and gets more tender, and the juice gets redistributed through the whole peice of meat, also helping juiciness.   
Same principal as resting a roast for 10-20 minutes, but in smaller cuts the time is reduced.   
Also contrary to received wisdom, recent food science experiments have revealed it is best to turn frying or grilling meats a few times, the first time after they have lightly browned. Pressing gently on the meat with a spatula helps with even cooking and does not squeeze the juice out either, as once supposed. 'Sealing' doesn't seal juices in either, it's an old myth. But it does brown the surface nicely, which created new flavours, and leaves residues in the pan that will make a fabulous 'jus' or thin gravy when de-glazed with some water, stock, or wine. This is why roasts are often browned off slightly before being put in the oven.

			I just borrowed my Mother-in-Law's copy of the covent garden soup cookbook - plan to work my way through most of them!!   
Anyway here is their recipe: (I haven't tried it so can't review but I would think it would benefit from celery and stock instead of water)   
50g butter 
450g leeks, finely sliced 
225g potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced 
570ml water 
275ml milk 
75ml single cream 
salt and ground white pepper   
To Garnish:  150ml natural yogurt   
Method: 
melt the butter and cook the leeks and potatoes gently for 10 minutes in a covered saucepan, without colouring.  Add the water, cover, bring to the boil and simmer for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender.  Cool a little, then puree in a liquidiser.  Stir in the milk and cream and taste for seasoning.  Served garnished with a swirl of yogurt.

Comté is made in the Jura mountains in France, in Department 25 Franche-Comté, and Gruyères either in the Fribourg mountains, or the Jura mountains in Switzerland. The mountains and the grass on both sides of the border are just the same- when I walk around here in the meadows (I live right on the border) I can assure you you can't see the difference - I often have no idea which side of the border I am on.   
Yes, Comté and Gruyères are very similar, and yet quite different. And like Cheddar, range from the sublime artisan made trad matured cheese, and the ridiculous factory young tasteless cheese.

I sampled it in the restaurant of the Renaissance hotel in Zurich-West. While the LUMA-steak comes at a premium of some 95 CHF per order the uplift for a LUMA- burger compared to a 'normal' burger is just 6 or 8 CHF. 
It tastes a bit mouldy indeed, like beef with a Roquefort/Gorgonzola twang, quite interesting.

			Hi   
I am British who moved to Switzerland last year; hopefully my opinion therefore warrants some credibility. I would be careful with this concept. As mentioned before, your potential customer base in the UK is limited, but quite simply what about the prices ? I look at English products in the English book store for example and you pay crazy prices for English ""mint sauce"" or English mustard or English biscuits. I adore some of those products and occasionally we treat ourselves, but seldom is it part of the regular ""shop"".   
Now reverse this and you have a larger issue. The strength of the Swiss Franc. Food prices in the UK by CH standards are exceptionally competitive. If I will not pay 5 CHF for a pack of English biscuits, I will certainly not pay 8 GBP for some Swiss biscuits?    
Finally, the Economist comes out. The Franc will increase in value against the British Pound. The Swiss Bank, will stop artificially controlling the Franc and furthermore the British Pound will continue to devalue for the next 24-36 months.    
Sorry, but I think the odds are stacked against you    
Rich

First I think I have to excuse me to overtake your forum. I'm Swiss and well familiar with the local ""Suura Most"". My absolutely favourite is   from Möhl. But I enjoy as well the ciders from abroad.   
Because I had once Henney's Cider and I'm not able to find it any more in Switzerland, I thought to ask the English guys here  .   
Regards 
Cludi

			Why should eating horses, cats or dogs be any different to cattle, sheep or lamb. Humans like eating meat so other then pre conceived perceptions they are all meat, there are even places that eat people in the jungles of this earth.

			As an Italian, I should consider not eating your Lardo di Colonnata (raw, in thin slices over toasted bread or bruschetta) such a waste  
Definitely don't melt it. The pasta recipes sound interesting though!   
Definitely not your healthy daily meal starter, but you can indulge with something flavory a couple of times a year, can you?   
As for the kids, they already get their daily portions of unhealthy fats with their snacks... so they won't even touch the Lardo!

Try the Schoggihüsli in Wallisellen or Pfister Chocolatier in Illnau!

			What Sbrinz said works.   
Since fish cooks quickly, there's no need to stir it. I'd simply  place the pieces of fish into the (already cooked) simmering curry sauce  and spoon it over the fish. Keep the pot on a low heat, cover the pot  to allow the fish to steam. Occasionally, jiggle the pot gently to keep the sauce  moving and spoon more sauce over the fish if needed. Simmer for 5 to 10  minutes and dish up carefully.   
You could also try leaving the skin on the pieces of fish.

Thanks for this thread!    
I have a question to 'raise' or to 'throw into the mix'.    
I have bought both Coop Weissmehl and Coop Zopfmehl in an attempt to try and get self raising flour (this was before i thought to check the forum and found this thread). So now i have both in my cupboards and want to make some scones, banana bread and dumplings to go in a stew.    
Could anyone advise me as to which of the two flours i should use if i'm going to try and make my own self-raising flour concoction by adding bicarb and salt etc?    
Ta, Laurie x

			Anything where the ingredients aren't given in cups! Sorry folks but I really don't have time to put anything in cups.   
But if you class a good book by how well it is used (and how grubby it is) then:   
Nigel Slater (especially the 30 minute cook) and a couple of Jamie Oliver's for consistently good and fast food. 
Mr. Oliver's Italian book is great for risottos   
Daphne's Modern Italian Food by Mogens Tholstrup is probably my favourite and is well used.

			You can use it like sugar, but you can't completely replace the sugar with stevia in many recipes. There's a new ""bakers blend"" that contains sugar and stevia that you bake as normal with.  Go to trivia.com for a look at the recipes they have and try again. I've used it once or twice and, while I'm not in love with it yet, I'm certainly warming up to it.

			I have asked Naturkraftwerke by email, their dried natto contains 210μg Vitamin K2 per 100g, which is quite low compared to fresh natto. Supplement capsules mostly contain 75μg (Mercola's 150μg). Other fermented products also contain K2, like sauerkraut and kefir, because it is the bacteria that make the K2. Concentration is less, but at least I like the taste. According to the descriptions, natto is quite pungent and an acquired taste, so I am not sure if I would like it! Organ meat is reported to be a good source too. I just found this article that gives a very detailed description of all forms of vitamin K and in which foods contain it, I can really recommend looking at this:   "	Posts: 581	Join Date: Aug 2011	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 9 Times in 7 Posts	Thanked 390 Times in 244 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

1804	Food and drink	Does anybody want some Alcohol free beer for free?	nikki_shannon	2669	43	Location: Zurich	10.12.2012, 12:15	"     I'll take it all from you. But I will tell you what I will do with it. I'll make beer cheese soup, bread, sauce for rabbit and game, and also it is great to braise meat in. It's like cooking with a nutty wine. You of course can even use it to make batter for deep frying fish or chicken. Ice cream maker on hand?   
I'm just saying that just cause you can't get buzzed on it, you can still do something with it. And if you still want to toss it, send me a pm, and I will get it in the next day or so...of which I will trade you a few real beers for it.

			Interesting, I think pressure cookers are going to be 2013's 'fad' as Cook's Illustrated not only just did a product rating on them (Fissler came out on top as the only one to reach 250F on the stovetop, Fagor second, Kuhn Rikon didn't fare very well at all) but they're also publishing a new collection of pressure cooker recipes in March entitled ""Pressure Cooker Perfection"" (   ). And a ""Miss Vickie"" seems to be a popular place for recipes -    
I may have to try one as my crazy german mother had one and it nearly exploded once while we were canning tomatoes so, I've always been a bit shy of them.

Anyway, it's really great!  We use it almost every day either for smoothies, or sauces or slicing and dicing.  I like the option of having the smaller bowl too.

			Hello Forum,   
I've been living here for a few years and I like to travel around and meet people from the local wine industry.  I keep a   of my encounters and try to add an English subtitle to the videos as I go along.  So far I have profiled a number of producers and their wine.  Other examples include a story on  , a two part series on matching  , the   in the Valais and   in the Kongresshaus in Zurich this summer.   
My question is - what do people want to see?  I have a number of ideas up my sleave, but it would be great to hear from the community what really interests you?   
Regards, Hoss

my favorite- red wine and cranberries with candied ginger and a bit of orange squeezed in there. let them simmer until the cranberries pop and then lower heat and allow to mush slightly. so good!

1826	Food and drink	Bread making machine	Odile	1896	12	Location: Neuchatel	05.12.2012, 13:14	"    It suddenly occurs to me that I have far too many kitchen machines, I really need to rid myself of some, I don't use them enough to justify the space they take up.    
The point I wish make here though, is regarding the paddle/s, I really dislike them being in there as well and just made an extra effort after the second kneading, the beeps told me when to remove them before it started baking, so that was one less battle, as getting them out was sometimes a real chore as I like mine nice and crusty.   
Odile, I have an older Sigg model, which last time I used ( in this last year) it was working fine.   
The only thing is, it makes a round loaf, rather like a pannetone, which I kind of don't like for some reason.   
If you want it, it is yours on collection.  
I would of course make sure it is still working. It does have minor scratches in the non-stick baking pan, so that may influence your decision, either way, I don't mind, it is at least spurring me to do something about it.   
Do send me a P.M if you are interested.

			My survey is now closed, and I would like to thank all of those that participated.    
To quickly clarify a few of the points raised in the forum:   
1. The survey was about food allergies and food intolerances. This was explained in the introductory text, but perhaps it was too long and people didn't bother reading it.   
2. As correctly spotted, a focus of the survey was to see whether a mobile phone could be used to help people correctly identify suitable food products for allergy sufferers. The results indicate that the majority of people would be happy with a mobile phone solution, if available.   
Anyway, thanks again.

1838	Food and drink	acorn squash - recipes?	Alien	1526	14	Location: Zürich	29.10.2012, 16:19	"    Thanks for the suggestion but this (or similar) is the recipe I found all over in the internet. I like them that way, too. (btw: I cook them 10min in the microwave before adding butter/sugar and putting them in the oven, it's faster that way!) 
But I think there are very few main dishes I want to serve them made so sweet tasting as a side. Maybe I'm just not used to combine dessert with salty stuff. Besides, it started to taste boring to me.   
Anyway. My favorite so far is the recipe MissChievous gave. I changed it a bit, though. I cut the top and bottom off, so the squash stands firmly on my working plate. Then I peel them by cutting off the green peel. Only after that I cut it in half and spoon out the seeds. That way it's a lot easier to peel them than I thought it would be. 
Next, I cut them in in bite size chunks, and mix the lot with some oil and what I would call ""indian"" spices: turmeric, cumin, mango powder, cinnamon, chili, salt and pepper. I guess, you could simply add curry powder if you want. Spread it on a baking tray and bake them in he oven for about... maybe half an hour or so? When they start looking crispy on the top they're usually done. The first batch got yumm-yummed away right from the tray before they even had a chance to spot the main course. 
What I like in this recipe: the variations are endless. Try other spices and every time they turn out a bit different than the ones before. Never boring.  "	Posts: 56	Join Date: Apr 2011	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 30 Times in 22 Posts	earned some respect

1844	Food and drink	Tom Turkey in the Steam Oven	sedalbj	7582	8	Location: Zug	11.11.2012, 08:50	" 
			
			Did it last night, the turkey was extremely moist.  2 hrs 15 mins from start to table.   
We have a Miele but any oven should have these settings.  Ours is larger than some (the water container is in the top) so our turkey fit in, after minor surgery.   
Our turkey was from Coop, 104chf, 7.5 kg (16+ lb)   
1. Put a full size non-perforated pan at the lowest setting in the oven.  Pour maybe 2 cups chicken broth in it.   
2. Cut the backbone out of the turkey so you can lay it flat.  The butcher can do it or you can use a heavy duty pair of kitchen scissors with the notch for cutting through bone.  I ended up taking the thigh/legs off too (to break the joint, crush it on the counter and bend it backwards).  I put the turkey and his parts in the full size perforated pan that came with the oven.  I put the meat thermometer in the breast, although the leg joint would have worked too.  I put some salt on the skin and tucked some thyme around him.   
3. Set your oven like this: 
400F (200C), 30% humidity, 25 mins 
350F (176C), 60% humidity, core temp 170F (77C) 
It takes about 1.5 hours to reach temp.   
4. The skin was browned nicely, but we decided to make it a little browner so I set the oven to conventional heat at @375F and roasted it for about 15 mins.  It pushed the temp up but was worth it for the skin lovers.  Next time I will set the core temp to be 160, to make up for the 15 mins of skin roasting.   
4. Take the turkey out, cover with foil, and let it rest for 30 mins, the temp will get to 180F (82C)   
5. I am a simple gravy maker. I poured the roasting liquid in a large fry pan and reduced it by @ 1/2 (@10 mins) whisked together some cold water and arrowroot flour in a bowl, and slowly whisked that into the gravy and let it cook for a few mins.  Some butter and salt and it was done.

What do you need 80 lbs of powertools for? What exactly are you going to use them for? Just curious....   
Also, are you a girl by any chance? Which would make the powertools even more impressive

			Veggie fish sauce is used in Vietnam, and hence it's sold in Vietnamese supermarkets (which, for eg, most of the Asian stores in Paris are).  I know the Asian shops in Basel have Vietnamese products but I've never checked their non-fish fish sauce selection.

You add it just before or while whipping the cream. 
I usually add if I use the cream for a cake filling that has to be in shape for some time. When I just put it on fruit salad and eat it right away, I never use it...

			As a child, I used to hate sweet potato casserole, the texture was just... eew. Even with the marshmallows on top (actually, they made it worse).   
Mom then switched to canned, I think it's some kind of brown sugar and butter sauce that they're in?    
My favorite though is to cut them into rough chunks then mix in some pineapple pieces and juice, then bake that way. The sweet and tart is much more to my liking. (Maybe it's better to try it that way sometime before committing to it for a big holiday do though)

I discovered another pitfall: Australian and NZ recipes use tablespoon measurements, BUT their tablespoons are 4 teaspoons, 20 ml (and not 3 teaspoons 15 ml!)    
As some recipes are very critical, you might want to remember that useless fact when using Australian Women's Weekly recipes, which in my view are excellent, but they never mention salt and pepper which is strange,      
I would recommend you to buy a set of metric measuring spoons, it is very tricky to remember which spoon you used when it states ""a desert spoon"".

1872	Food and drink	Blutwurst/leberwurst	fredchroy	2223	7	Location: Sachseln	14.11.2012, 13:47	" 
			
			If there is still some interest in this Swiss dish..here's an old article i wrote for the NST about it    
E Guete!   
TS November 08   
Metzgete,Schlachtplatte,Cochonaille etc   
Slaughter Season specialities   
Some like it Hot  Some not at all. When autumn begins to turn to winter, the 
traditional specialities of slaughter season are more prominent to see. In 
Switzerland, this season is called the Metzgete (roughly translated to Butchers 
Delight, but it sounds nicer than Slaughter Season). Metzgete occurs between 
autumn and winter for two reasons; (1) it tends to fall within the natural order 
of an animal life cycle and (2) it is the time when fresh and smoked meats are 
prepared for the cold months.   
Tradition throughout Switzerland (and most of Europe), the Metzgete is a 
favourite season of many. Usually, the freshly prepared meats are served on a 
large platter (slaughter plate) where the customer can select and dine to his 
hearts content. The most popular types of meats available during the Metzgete 
are the blood wurst and liverwurst. Experienced butchers who possess a deep 
understanding of the tradition prepare these sausages"". In addition, a 
slaughter plate may also contain Bratwurst, cutlets and ribs. Tradition states 
that side dishes such as sauerkraut, potatoes, elbow macaroni and cooked apples 
are served along with a slaughter plate.     
Fresh from the Liver   
Liverwurst is prepared from the liver of slaughtered swine on the same day as it 
is served. Contrary to it's name, however, there is only a small amount of 
liver in liverwurst. Two thirds of the sausage base is made up of pork and 
beef. The other main ingredients are onions, cabbage, bouillon and pork grease. 
To prepare liverwurst, the meat and the cabbage are cooked while the liver is 
cooked in boiling water (blanched) for a short period of time. These 
ingredients are then ground into a smooth creamy substance. Spices and Herbs 
are then added to the creamy mixture along with sautéed onions and the bouillon. 
Now the complete mixture can be piped into the tubing. The raw sausage is 
boiled for 20 minutes at 75degrees Celsius and then immediately cooled in water. 
Voila  the Liverwurst is ready!!!     
Delicacies made of Red Gold   
Where liverwurst only contains a small amount of liver, the main ingredient in 
blood wurst is just as the name describes. Pork grease and onions are also part 
of this Metzgete speciality. To prepare blood wurst, the butcher mixes the 
blood with warm milk and adds onions which have been prepared with the pork 
grease and cooked for a few hours. Spices and herbs are added. The filled 
sausages are then boiled for 40 minutes at 80 degrees Celsius and then 
immediately cooled in cold water. Now the blood wurst will have the proper 
consistency.   
Blut und Leberwurst 
1st Method   
Add 250ml (1 cup) water and 1 tbsp. oil in a large frying pan, place sausages 
in pan.Bring to a boil on medium heat until the water has evaporated. Fry 
sausages for about 20 minutes.   
2nd Method   
Place sausages in a pan, cover with water, bring slowly to a boil, then omit 
heat, cover with a lid. Then roast some sliced, floured onions until they are 
brown, douse with a ¼ cup of water, season to taste, cook sauce for five minutes 
and then pour the sauce over the sausages, which you transferred before on a 
large plate. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
In the Jurassic region of Switzerland the COCHONAILLE is very well known and 
traditionally consists of nine courses, here explained on the way it is done in 
AJOIE.   
Totché 
A salty cream pie `Nidlechueche' 
Gelée de ménage 
A kind of terrine made with gelatine (Sulzli),this is eaten with bread and 
mustard 
Bouillon 
A really good soup, but very greasy, eaten with toasted bread 
Boudin à la crème 
Special blood wurst, from the Ajoie region, it is a bit creamier than the one in 
the German part of CH 
Bouilli 
Braised PORK (From the neck), served with beetroot and lukewarm carrot salad 
Grillade 
In Ajoie, the Atriaux, replace the liver sausage and are accompanied by a smoked 
pork bratwurst as well as in pork suet fried Roesti 
Choucroute garnie 
Sauerkraut with boiled potatoes, cooked bacon, cooked sausages and Schüfeli( a 
salted pork speciality) 
Rôti 
Tender pork roast with mashed potoatoes 
Striflate 
This are best described as a kind of Crepes, the dough is slowly put through a 
funnel into hot oil and then deep fried, in the Seeland and Emmental this is 
also known as `Strübli'. As the Striflate needs a lot of time to be prepared to 
perfection they are now often replaced with a crème brulée.     
Of course a menu like this asks for a good digestive after having eaten it, the 
Jura specialty DAMASSINE is just THE right schnapps for this purpose, its made 
of a tiny species of plum that only grow locally and has a distinctive flavour. 
Of course a Wiliamine or Abricotine will do the trick as well:-)

1879	Food and drink	Mayple syrup.	sam ali	2703	20	Location: Zurich	09.11.2012, 14:43	"    I only mentioned it because they both happen to be bio, I wouldn't ever specifically look for a bio brand. Bio tends to be a big racket for the most part, unfortunately- a label that can hide many sins.   
I agree local syrups can have different flavours and can be excellent, but top grade commercial stuff is pure and tastes great- not much is really done except for boiling down the sap and removing the sediment.   
Dark is great for cooking, especially as a substitute for molasses.  I find it too heavy for pancakes and French toast, though.   
Basically any real maple syrup is delicious and one of the more interesting ways to sweeten things while adding flavour. I prefer it to a honey glaze for most recipes that call for one.   
There is a mountain restaurant here, Namasté, that makes an exquisite pie with maple syrup and cream, heavenly with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream.   
Try drizzling some into natural yogurt, without mixing it in completely.    
I remember sugar shacks boiling down the syrup even more, and then ladling the thick hot syrup into snow-filled troughs, where we'd twist it around pop-sickle sticks and it eat it still slightly warm. Amazing!

What happened was, with a few better search terms I found first of all   and their store in Zurich which I occasionally walk past without noticing (Bland shop front). The nice fellow there showed us a sensible Quickmill setup that made tasty espresso and had us thinking.   
Then I found a couple of german websites, mobacoffee.de cleverly have a section for informing Schweiz customers and say they are able to drop the 19% german vat, more than negating the swiss import fees and vat.   
I had never really looked and indeed Riccardo.ch has some good second hand products up. But nothing that hits the right price range for used goods really.    
We also for the first time spotted a expensive (not counting super-automatic etc) machine at Fust in Letzipark zurich, about 1700 chf for the machine alone. Funnily its hidden on the bottom shelf while cheaper delonghis sit on top. Not really what we wanted, although in my mind you get what you pay for and should be paying as much for a grinder as for the machine (which is why a 20 or 100 chf grinder is not of much interest)   
So in the end we've purchased from mobacoffee.de, hoping we dont get bitten if we need to send it away for repairs or anything, and we spent more than planned.... but the cappuccinos are going to taste amazing   "	Posts: 29	Join Date: Apr 2011	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 5 Times in 3 Posts	no particular reputation at present

And, they also know how to buy missing ingredients at the store.

Instead, a maximum price got ""suggested"" to the baker's union in order to guarantee that poorer people are able to buy bread. So I guess if you buy another bread you sort of ""finance"" the cheap ones? 
On the other hand: agriculture in Switzerland is subsidized.

Right. I'll correct the Italians next time I'm over then, shall I?      So, your argument is based on the type of establishment where you get your coffee from?   
When I go for my coffee, I tend to try and pick somewhere I think they know what they are doing (easily done by checking what kind of machine they have to make the coffee).   
Although I take your point - have you ever ordered a capuccino in France?

			I don't know this special bread or rolls. But judging from your description it could be Zopf dough with dried fruits and nuts added.  
At least, that's what I would try to make. 
Zopf dough doesn't contain any eggs, though. The bread tends to get ""drier"" if it contains eggs. But needs butter and milk. 
Do you have a recipe for Zopf?   
A friend of mine made ""Vollkorn"" bread and added dried fruits, like  apricots and plums and all that stuff that you usually by as ""dried  fruit mix"". It was so yummy you wouldn't have thought it was just a  plain whole wheat bread as a ""base""!

			Another example of lesser-known traditional fondue, just found it in one of my old brockihaus cookbooks.  Haven't tried this one yet but I think I will have to.    Cheese fondue with a twist...      (serves 4) (and I'm not kidding, this is its name in the cookbook) 
5dl cider 
600g cheese   
Bring the cider to a boil and put it into a fondue pot to keep warm.  Slice the cheese really thin ('like Hobelkäse', it says) and use fondue forks to dip it in the hot cider.  This is said to make a good supper ('Zabig').   
It doesn't say what kind of cheese to use - Tilsiter most likely given it's a Thurgauer recipe.  I bet it would be really good with Red Leicester though.   "	Posts: 1	Join Date: Feb 2011	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

1914	Food and drink	German bakery	NatashaC	2831	20	Location: Lausanne	25.10.2012, 20:36	"    Perhaps it's a matter of taste and exposure as I found most of the 'zopf' varieties to be inedible due to being dry and lacking any flavor. I didn't make an exhaustive search of local bakeries but, many of the rustic varietals were tough and had nuts/seeds often to make up for a lack of flavor as well. The exception was many of the silser/pretzel sorts of bread, e.g. pretzel king, which had a good combination of crust, taste and texture. All bets were off, of course, for any of the breads from the local COOP/Migros since they were usually either commercial or stale.    
I'm picky about my bread, which is why I often bake my own though I can usually find something I can manage to eat bread-wise that I've not baked myself....but other than the silser rolls, I really didn't find anything palatable in Switzerland. Germany, though, I didn't have such a challenge. And I still dream of the baguettes in France on holiday.

1917	Food and drink	Differences between Swiss & US flour	elainemay	1039	0	Location: zurich	22.10.2012, 18:00	" 
			
			I always hear that flour is one of those ingredients that varies a lot from country to country and that the variations can have a marked effect on the baking outcome- hard wheat versus soft wheat, higher or lower protein content, more or less gluten, inclusion of small amounts of cornstarch, etc.   
Does anyone know what the specific differences are between US white/all purpose flour, and the standard Swiss Weissmehl from the supermarket?  Beyond that, if one is using a recipe that assumes the use of American flour, are there any adjustments you'd recommend making in any circumstances?  (Most of my baking has come out fine with just a straightforward substitution so far, but there's always room for improvement!)

1918	Food and drink	organic spices	peebix	1448	9	Location: Zürich	20.10.2012, 23:12	"    Thanks. That's interesting info. However (and this is general ignorance here, as I am pretty new to the country), can produce labeled organic be sold in-country without retesting to the local certification? The FAQ was a little unclear on the issue.    
Specifically - speaking of spices - lack of contaminants doesn't actually mean 'organic production' - it just means contaminant free. The retesting doesn't insure that the production is actually organic - and if the spices are sourced from overseas, who's checking?   
That said, contaminant free is a good place to start.

I've seen it at Egli sometimes.       
There are hopefully other organic shops in closer proximity to your place.

1932	Food and drink	Instant Oats	Stacey1979	1706	8	Location: Zurich	13.09.2012, 10:13	" 
			
			Another solution would be to just get whatever normal oats (I've gotten different kinds here, depending on what I plan to make) and put them in the fridge overnight with some fruit juice or milk and honey, or whatever liquidy stuff you like, then nuke them for a minute in the morning. The overnight soak will soften the oats, the nuke in the morning for good rib-sticking hot yummy breakfast.     
Anything you want to stay crunchy, just add after you microwave it, or if you like it soft, add it to soak.    "	Posts: 21	Join Date: Feb 2012	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

""Swiss"" but not kitsch.  I highly recommend it though the menu is swiss german and it took us a little while to negotiate.  The server let us struggle with our german (which was appreciated-- it is sometime so difficult to practice german when everyone switches so automatically to english-- but this is off topic) and she helped an english couple near us in english.  And it was so full that reservations were necessary.   
But thanks for all the tips.  I am really looking forward to trying all the other suggestions over the next year!

1938	Food and drink	Lower Classed Corks	Confloozed	981	9	Location: Zurich	06.10.2012, 15:55	"    If they'd been snooty about this, I'd explain to them that it's not exposure to cork that causes a wine to taste corky -- otherwise, every wine would taste of cork.  Why should the bottom of the cork, in contact with the wine for 20 years, not cause any change in flavour, but contact with the top of the same cork for 60 seconds suddenly make the whole bottle taste corky?   
'Corked' wine comes from the reaction of naturally-occuring fungi in the cork to chlorides used in the wine production process.     
Then I'd switch them onto cheap plonk and enjoy the Pomerol myself.    "	Posts: 4,708	Join Date: Dec 2007	Forum Legend	Groaned at 135 Times in 119 Posts	Thanked 4,833 Times in 2,300 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Another wine recepticle question...Is it bottle to bottle your wine from the barrel directly to a Demi John, and then cork it, and siphon it out to serve it by the glass? Or will it go off within a few days? I know Demi's can be used direct, but glass by glass? Not sure. Like an old school bag in box.

			Hi --   
While living down close to Chatel-St-Denis, we used to go and pick up double cream (double-creme) all the time from a nice place (   ) -- now that we are living in Adliswil, it's not the easiest thing to find.     
Yes, we could go to Coop/Migros and pick it up, but it's not the same as going to a small shop, them going in the back and scooping it out of a big bucket into a container with a big warning -- EAT ALL OF THIS IN 3 days    
So, with the cold weather moving in ... where near Adliswil ?    doesn't have it ... however, the nice fresh milk is delicious!      "	Posts: 29	Join Date: Oct 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 9 Times in 8 Posts	no particular reputation at present

1947	Food and drink	Home grown chillies	guest	785	5	null	null	" 
			
			I've had a surprisingly good harvest this year - surprising, because all previous attempts have been disastrous.   
This year I grew the chilis (habaneros, jalapenos, and some unidentified long green and red finger chilis that are hotter 'n Hades) in large planters, set out on our stone patio against the stone wall rather than in the garden. Heat retention was the key to this year's success, I think.   
After pigging out on some seriously tasty dishes, here's what I've done with the remainder:   
Jalapenos - canned in a simple brine.   
Finger peppers - canned with garlic cloves, pearl onions and carrots in an pickling brine.   
Habaneros - dried, to be used ground.   
Habaneros - roasted, then put in olive oil. (These need refrigerated.)   
Made a variety of salsas and chili-accented jams. (Canned in a water bath canner.)      
Five plants - and I think I'm set for chilis for the rest of the year.

			I JUST had it beautifully done at a friend's, and he does it very simply:   
Lightly coat the filets (which should be as dry as possible) in flour (it keeps the juices in apparently), melt some butter in a frying pan over medium heat, and fry each side for 3-5 minutes. If they are the filets at coop or micros, they shouldn't be very big, and won't need more time than that.   
Afterwards you can season with salt and pepper. You can deglaze the pan with a bit of red wine too for a nice sauce.   
In coop now they have caramelized chestnuts, rot kohl (red cabbage) and pumpkin spätzle that go amazingly with, and the whole meal takes about 15 minutes to do. Easiest dinner possible!   
Bon appétit.

It has not been available though for the past few months due to the Avian flu so that is my craving now.

The one I have from Coop (or maybe Migros) says ""Panniermehl hell"" and ""Chapelure blonde"" on one side, the opposite side has the same German and ""Pane grattugiato chiaro"" on it.   
Looking at Coop@home and LeShop.ch, they each carry a few options, Coop@home even has a kosher option, for those who may be interested. Of course, they don't always have everything they have online in all the shops (regional differences as well as store-size limitation), but checking online helps see what they have in general.

1967	Food and drink	Milchreis in Bern	sk83_za	1166	13	Location: Bern	17.09.2012, 21:08	"    ""Milchreis"" is known here as ""Reisbrei"". Recipes are as simple as THIS one here below         1/2 cup converted rice
1 quart milk
1 pinch salt
4 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup raisins, optional        
Cook  rice in milk with salt and butter, very slowly until kernels are tender  but have not lost their shape. If you have patience, do this in the top  of a double broiler. It will take 1 1/2 to 2 hours but will be worth  it.     
 The mixture should be very thick and can be stirred  several times during cooking. When done, flavor with sugar, cinnamon and  add raisins--if you are using them. This may be served hot or cold.       
-------------------------------------------------------------          
The reputation of it however is rather bad as it was very important for cooking teacheresses in the first half of the 20th Century.  Mum for example detested rice, exactly for this reason !  She had grown up as being the daughter of a gent who always was in favour of well spiced food, and so was used to detesting flavourless food     
To be fair and just to people of the past, the thing contained ingredients around already in the 19th Century like milk, rice, salt, butter, sugar. cinnamon, raisins.

1971	Food and drink	Should vodka freeze?	onei	21488	44	Location: Near vevey	31.08.2012, 22:24	" 
			
			I think that's incorrect. Freezing-cold alcohol will melt frozen water (car windshield wiper fluid is mostly water with some alcohol in it), so high-proof liquor shouldn't be able to freeze in a home freezer.   
Anyhow, I have a much simpler theory: could the placement in the freezer make a difference? About.com says that 84 proof (42%) liquor freezes at −34C. While that's much colder than the −20C of a normal home freezer, it's entirely possible for part of the freezer to have gotten that cold while the rest cools down. So if the two bottles that didn't freeze were on a rack in the freezer, for example, while the bottle that froze was directly on a cooling element, that might explain the situation.

			this is a type of active dry yeast to look for in the baking section of migros or coop, but there are others:    
the yeast here comes in such packets as another poster described. anytime i find a recipe i want to try and feel confused about finding ingredients here i check google to see if there will be an issue for me. believe me, someone else has already been through it! i put in search terms such as ""active dry yeast"" in ""germany"" or in ""german"". there are many nice forums online to help unfamiliar cooks get used to swiss/german ways.    
you can also freeze this dough i believe so you will have it on hand for convenience.    
enjoy!

			Dear A   
When i married my Russian wife I was blessed with a 15 year old boy who reminds me so much of you, after lying in bed playing computer games for 6 months i dragged him down to the local college, this year he got his degree in business studies from Oxford, he now has his own company importing high end Russian art and religious icons, it is a massive market, he goes over there buys at what he calls 'places where they sell site' and pulls out a few pieces that were obtained during the revolution' and does very well selling him in Switzerland and all over the world.   
Never let anyone put you down, you know that the Russians are rising once more, follow the trends, 'kupusta' restaurants could soon be as popular as McDonalds..   
Who would ever have thought  that coffee or beef-burgers would ever get so big?

2 tsp. cinnamon 
3 eggs 
2 tablesps oil (optional, can leave out)

Beat the eggs, with oil, and add to mixture.   
Pour into large greased baking pan/pyrex dish,  approx. 29cm x 20cm. 
Bake @ 350F/180c for 1 1/4 hr.   
When baked, while still hot, pour over a thin glacé icing. 
This will soak in, and give a shiny surface.

			My Mother would make the Elderberries go further by stewing them together with apples, a nice Autumny type dessert, kids particularly like it as it can make your tongue go purple, clothes as well, so be warned.  
If I remember correctly, she often served it with lemon sago and homemade vanilla ice-cream. 
Not everyone likes it because of the pips, but I always enjoyed the ""texture"".    
They also   well once they have been taken off the stem.   
This recipe looks really nice as well.     
With a reminder that parts of the plant are poisonous and it's best not to eat the berries raw, although I did and suffered no ill effects, still, some people may be sensitve to the sambunigrin acid, which cooking renders away.

2008	Food and drink	Local, Farm fresh meats??	purplesharks	971	2	Location: Bern	21.08.2012, 01:14	" 
			
			Well, aside from the fact that I can't link bio with high quality in my mind, it depends what kind of meat you want.   
I think personally that the quality of veal, lamb and pork in high street butchers here tends to be good, chicken is pretty run of the mill in all butchers and supermarkets and comes from the same places anyway, but beef (which I assume is what you want) can be pretty variable.   
If you want something really special and are prepared to pay for it,   is imported Argentinian meat which is of fantastic quality in my experience. For something more run of the mill, again, I suggest finding a good butcher and learning to trust him and yourself.   
(As an aside, I'm not sure if the OP is American - but I find that Americans tend to treat beef as a brand, throwing around terms like ""grass fed"" or ""direct from the farm"" as if that makes the steak better per se. We are buying an individual animal and the quality of the breeding, the husbandry, the slaughtering and the butchery all make a huge difference. I think personally that finding either a butcher that you trust or learning to look at a piece of meat and assess the texture, the colour of the meat, the colour and quality of the fat is more effective that looking at the label)

			As a Londoner, we have a vast range of different foods.     
If you choose to eat in a place where they buy from caterers & sell at low prices, about the only thing consider safe /  is a steak.   
OP is correct re the amount of fat children & adults now in UK, due to lack of understanding of food content.  UK is following on from USA where they have that problem with all the use of corn and it side residues, that started believe the time of Nixon era.   
Switzerland produces excellent Bread. 
We in UK have so many rubbish bakers - there is a name for the way they make the bread that I cannot remember. 
Usually try and look for Italian, Jewish, Greek or individual baker with reputation

Glad you found them - I was going to suggest that in case the cereal section of your local Coop was large enough to actually occupy a whole lane, look for where they have other small grains such as flax seeds. (Although I'm pretty sure I got mine at my local Asian market, they are a bit cheaper there.)

It's on the right handside just before you get to coop. (if you are coming from Zug)   
Edit: if you're coming by public transport, stop in Alpenblick, cross to the other side of the street from the Shell garage and walk left towards Cham, the Turkish shop is about 5-10 minutes walk.

			If it's a white wine sub, I'd mix a little vinegar or lemon juice into the apple juice to cut the sweetness. And you might possibly dilute the mix with water. It's actually worth it to taste it and see if the tartness is the same as the wine. There's also white grape juice - is it available here?

They are only open a few hours on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays though, so I wouldn't necessarily blindly take the trip just to head to that shop.

			Well, they had a really good laugh. And confirmed they can stop anywhere on suspicion, and if the meat is unlabelled and you do not have receipt, they will follow you to wherever you say you bought the meat, and ask for confirmation and receipts.   
You could of course get away with it. Or not. You choose your options.

2054	Food and drink	Where can I find liquid glucose?	guest	8041	29	null	null	" 
			
			Hi, 
Got the corn syrup and it worked a dream. I'm now ready to decorate the cake. 
So here's the recipe for fondant icing, for those that are interested: 
400g(14oz) icing sugar 
1 egg white 
50g(2oz) glucose syrup 
makes about 450g(1lb) of fondant icing. 
1. Sift the icing sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the egg white and glucose. Beat these ingredients with a clean wooden spoon, gradually pulling in the icing sugar.  
2. When the mixture becomes stiff, turn onto a surface sprinkled with icing sugar. Knead thoroughly to a smooth paste. 
3. If necessary, store tightly wrapped in cling film in a cool place.    
I found in the end that I needed quite a bit more icing sugar to make something that didn't stick when I rolled it out..  I guess its easier to add the icing sugar afterwards once it's become a lump of dough.   
Have fun!

			And here is the recipe, straight from Mauritius. Could do the same with bolognese filling, or rice and peppers for vegetarians, etc.   
Pâtissons Farcis  (Stuffed Squash) Preparation:  Method:  Wash the squash well then cut off the top to form a lid. Remove the  seeds and discard then scoop out the pulp with a spoon. Chop this finely  and mix with the onion, garlic and parsley.  Heat the butter and oil in a non-stick pan. When foaming add the  vegetable and parsley mix with the prawns and minced fish. Cook for  about 10 minutes, stirring constantly, then season to taste with salt  and freshly-ground black pepper.  Use this mixture to stuff the squashes then sit the lids on top. Place  in a large oven-proof casserole and pour around 300ml water then cover  with a lid and transfer to an oven pre-heated to 180°C. Cook for 20  minutes and serve hot.

I guess Migros has a similar product called Heidi Bergmilch (kitschy, I know). Either one might be worth a try.

			Thank you for the replies..... I did get a basic user manual and was cooking with the fan but the air didn't appear to be circulating properly to ensure all the pizza was cooked, It was on the wire tray so shouldn't normally be a problem. I am just doing the list of things wrong/comparing it to the list we got at the handover and hubby is going to request a new oven and we will see what happens. If he says no then I will maybe buy a combo thingy to sit on the counter tops..... I can't spend the next 2/3 years using this.

			Kodokan, you are right, except your item (1) is a bit more complicated than you wrote. Anyway, chemists don't like the term ""natron"" because of its ambiguity. That's why I mentioned the chemically correct terms for baking soda. And baking soda (NaHCO3) is what the OP was asking for.    
As I wrote, those terms are a bit complicated, but it shouldn't be too difficult for the OP to write one of those terms on a slip of paper to show at the drugstore.

grumpygit, after reading your recommendation of the wafer roll filled with chocolate stuffing, i finally stepped into a Lackerli Huss (after 10 months in Switzerland!) and got to sample some of them. They are really good. My husband had tried the ones with dried fruit but they have run out of it as it is a limited special for summer. No chance to go to a Sprungli store yet though.   
Will be trying the chocolates recommended. Been eating only Callier chocolates after being to their factory a few months ago. The only problem is chocolates are heavy so can't bring much home, so will have to prioritise.

2086	Food and drink	Schloss Wulfingen Winterthur charges outrageous 36chf just to cut a cake	makeabigwish	2393	28	Location: Zurich	05.07.2012, 15:14	"    What have the overheads got to do with it in particular?   
Staff: they may not be and they may bring in staff when needed.   
Water: used on as needs basis - it'll be metered, as with most businesses, so not paid for if not used.   
Detergent: accounted for? how so? You can't account for something that hasn't been used (well you can, but you know what I mean).   
Covers: this, for me is critical, if they have a group of 36, not eating desert, that's a loss of ~84 CHF (I checked, most of them are in the 14-16 CHF range), so the guy wasn't even charging 50% of what he might have lost.   
Now, I'm not a great defender of customer service in the country, on that point I agree, but really 6 CHF is hardly breaking the bank, is it now...

`n Reuse groot  dankie to everyone who attended the worsbraai at our open day on the 23rd!     
I do not have words in Afrikaans, let alone English or French to express our gratitude and happiness - it was absolutely fantastic to meet and make so many new friends!  The only regret is that I did not have enough time to sit down and kuier properly with everyone, but more than 200 portions of boerewors served, all stock and 800 bottles of wine sold says it was a little hectic at times   
But I listened to the dreams around the fire of lambs on the spit, biltong potjies, a serious Durban curry and even n lekker skaapkop and tripe evening - so true to my first post,  this boer is already making a plan to fulfil your culinary fantasies  keep an eye out for dates here and on our website  .   
PS.  Working full steam to fill orders (and a bit extra)  50kg of boerewors, 25kg of biltong/dry wors and 10kgs of chilli bites coming up  pm or email me to add yours.   
PPS.  I have no photographs of Saturday  if anyone has then post it here.

I've used Squires before and they're usually pretty rapid with deliveries. Small parcel sent surface would take 7-10 days in theory, but they're usually faster than that. Postage is charged based on weight so one piping nozzle shouldn't be much.   
I have a spare plastic star nozzle if that's any use (all my metal ones are in a tin 'somewhere' in the cellar). I could just pop it into an envelope if you pm me your address.

			Yeah the canned Coop Finest are great. But if you can get to an Asian store, get wasabi peas, not peanuts. I've been eating those for years (I only came across the peanuts when I moved here) - the pea variety tend to be a little crunchier, and the Asian store variety tend to be cheaper.   
Not so sure about the MSG causing the addiction in this case. I'd say it's more the isothiocyanates   With wasabi peas I have a milder reaction than that which I get when I have the mustard at Vorder Sternen (i.e. my face boils off, but I just cannot stop)

			Hi there...also a fellow New Englander, myself I grew up in Providence. Grandparents lived in Stowe so it's my second home.   
I'm a big fan of frozen yogurt, especially frozen kefir. I used to make it every week in the States using a Kitchenaid with the frozen bowl attachment. Very healthy and delicious. Basically my recipe was 3/4 cup of kefir, 1 egg yolk, a few drops of vanilla extract.   
Here, it would be nice to make it again, so if anyone has recommendations for an ice cream maker that would be great. I'm not sure if my freezer is big enough to take a bowl...and the Kitchenaid is back in the States.

			Welcome to the Forum   
Usually, answering the questions of new members who write several one-line posts in quick succession, especially those who don't get around to writing an introduction, is a dead waste of time as all they are really looking for is the magic ten to enable them to post adverts.    
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and suggest you search on here for 'gluten' which brings up, among other threads, this one   It might not quite answer your question as to the 'best stores' but as 'best' is a nice vague term, you can check out the places recommended there and see which you prefer  If you find any other shops or restaurants which fit the bill but are not mentioned, please add them to the thread.      By the way, you are quite fortunate that I am no longer a Moderator as I would probably have deleted your thread as being too  'minimalistic'.

The sugar/flour/butter mix will keep for ages in a fridge - never done it for more than a day or so, but it should last for months, I'd have thought.

I've switched to some non-organic but healthy looking tomatoes for this evening's dinner!

As a side issue, Migro Budget Hartkäse comes pretty close to what I would call a tasty cheddar at home, bonus is price and it does not stink.

I mean, yeah, it clearly wouldn't have burnt through the skin, but it's a genuine irritant, which can cause other 'burn'-like symptoms including redness and swelling (from histamine reaction). Oil-based lotions are actually very effective at relieving chilli burn, even if the mechanism isn't quite the same as a real heat or chemical burn.    Heh. Milk's even better, albeit perhaps not quite so much fun.

64g Glucose (in German this is “Traubenzucker” available in a health food store or chemist (Reformhaus, Drogerie, the brand name is Morga, 250g for CHF 2.50) 
36ml Water   
Bring the glucose and water to the boil and fill the liquid into a measuring jug. Then add some more boiling water to the jug up to the 100ml mark.   
Pour the syrup into a jar with a screw-lid and leave to cool. Keeps for at least 6 months.       
The white sugarpaste in 500g and 1kg packets is from the same supplier as the coloured. The best sugarpaste IMO is the  , which we currently have in 6kg tubs.

2164	Food and drink	Coop loose tea - any recommendations?	glowjupiter	625	0	Location: here	07.05.2012, 00:47	" 
			
			Hi guys,   
A while back, I noticed that Coop (I think it was Coop City) sells loose tea (in these huge plastic boxes where one can get the amount of tea leaves they want out with a spoon, put it in a baggie and pay by weight).    
Have any of you tried these teas and would you recommend them?    
Thank you!

			I've made something similar before and no, you wouldn't add cream and butter, etc to the mashed potatoes. You are already adding butter, milk, etc to the actual cake recipe. The potatoes are mainly there for texture and consistency.    
For the recipe I made, I made real mashed potatoes and let them cool before adding them to the mixture when the recipe directed to. Not sure how boxed mashed would work, but you could always give it a try.

There is another Coop City in   (close to the MacDonalds and across from the second Starbucks). The Coop city has two entrances. There is one across from Starbucks and a second one that is up the small street beside the MacDonalds. Up that street is a small Asian store. Not sure what it is worth since it is very small.   
There are   just below the train station. Get on the street below the station and walk direction Geneva. It is at the end of the street. There is a second one if you walk in the direction of Vevey.

2170	Food and drink	Columbian Food Ingredients	Confloozed	2612	11	Location: Zurich	26.04.2012, 20:42	" 
			
			Few suggestions:   
For the ""masa"" you can get ""areparina"" in Zurich, there's a Mexican store just a couple of minutes (walk) from HB. 
I use to buy it also in Luzern, at another Mexican store located in Baselstrasse.   
I'm susprised that your professor prefers not to use the mexican masa, that in my opinion gives a very international touch to the Colombian style of arepa.   
What you will be really missing, and please let me know if you find a solution, is that very unique salty and fresh cheese we call ""quesito"". I think for that you will have to really travel there.   
And by the way, is Colombian not Columbian   unless i'm completely in the wrong thread. (is a bit late)

2180	Food and drink	Meat Translations in French Speaking Switzerland	stewarta15	641	0	Location: Lausanne	19.04.2012, 15:22	" 
			
			Here are some tips on meat translations when buying at the grocery store from English to French:   
Pork:  
 Bacon is EASY to buy in Switzerland - no need to import water-pumped rubbish! As in the UK, it is simply thinly sliced poitrine, or belly, preserved with salt. The French tend to slice their poitrine fairly thickly, in order to make lardons, so you need to ask for the slices to be fine (pronounced feen). Bacon is rarely injected with water in Switzerland, so you get more for your money, it tastes better and crisps-up easily. Do not be fooled by the packets called bacon - these are just brined, trimmed pork, and not the same at all. 
 Echine - meaning shoulder, encompasses the blade bone and spare ribs. 
 Plat de côtes - is from where the hand and belly meet, whereas... 
 Côtes - are where the carré comes from, and is made up of loin chops. Basically, rack of pork. 
 Filet - in Switzerland, is from the hind loin area of the pig. The English fillet is from the part which the French call jambon, or ham. 
 If you want your joint with crackling, this should be no problem for your local butcher, but you may need to order it in advance. Ask for the joint avec la couenne (pronounced la quwen). 
 joues - cheeks.   
Chicken, duck and goose etc:  
Its pretty easy to see which bit is which on a small bird, but here is some useful vocab. 
 Poulet - chicken (probably ex-layer, and the normal age to buy one). 
 Poulette - young chicken. 
 Coq - cockerel. 
 Pintade - guinea fowl. 
 Dinde - turkey. 
 Volaille - fowl/ poultry. 
 Cuisses - thighs. 
 Magret - breast.  
 Carcasse - carcasse, the same in english, these are the empty remains of a butchered bird, which are sold in Switzerland for making stocks and soups.   
Lamb:  
 Gigot dagneau - leg of lamb. 
 Echine - shoulder. 
 Côtes - chump. 
 Collet - scrag (end). 
 Poitrine/ poitrail - breast 
 Côtelette - chop. usually from the rack of lamb, where the British cutlet comes from. 
 Jarret - can mean shank or shin. 
 Selle dagneau - saddle.   
Steaks:  
 Bifteck/ steak - steak. 
 Bavette - undercut -it is cheap and comes from the skirt, which is why it is textured with long muscle fibres. Can be very good, and less tough than one imagines! 
 Filet - fillet. 
 Faux filet - the same in English. 
 Steak à hacher - steak which is lean but not that tender. It is used for steak tartare and steak haché. Steak haché looks like a burger, but is simply this high quality steak minced up and pressed together. it is usually freshly don, which is why people are happy to eat them rare. You cannot compare a steak haché to a beef/ hamburger. 
 Romsteak/ rumsteak - rump steak. 
 Aloyau - sirloin. 
 Entrecôte - ribeye. 
 Tournedos/ filet mignon - tenderloin steak usually cut almost as high as it is wide. basically a chunk of tender steak, usually served quite rare unless otherwise requested (see Steak Doneness) You can get tournedos of lamb, too.   
Other beef:  
 Tête de veau - rolled veal head, including the tongue. 
 Langue de buf beef tongue. 
 Gîte (à la noix) topside.  
 Tranche grasse - silverside 
popes eye   
Other body parts (!):  
 Cul - tail. 
 Cou - neck. 
 Tranche - meaning slice, implies a steak of any meat other than beef. 
 Filet/ longue/ aloyau - all words for loin. Loin chop is côte première.

			There is a service online for fresh produce, and other items from the region called  .  Mostly local, all seasons. Here's a   from their website of items available from Jan 2012.  Basically you pay a yearly fee (I think its about 35 francs a year), order everything online, and they deliver it once a week to a group which has already formed a delivery point.  My husband has a point directly at his work, but there seem to be a bunch of other points all over Lausanne.   
I've never used it, but my husbands coworkers have gotten some nice produce from it.

			""Souris"" is a general term for shank, so it's also used for pork, beef and veal shanks.   
In Italian, the word is ""stinco"" if it's whole, ""osso bucco"" if crosscut.

Many of the recipes use less fat and substitute vegetables like squash, sweet potato and carrots to provide structure to the cakes.

			If you want to get your fresh produce at markets, you can stock up on dry goods by buying in bulk at Aligro in Chavannes, near Renens train station.   
You don't have to be in the restaurant business, they will give you a card that allows you to shop, but at slightly higher than the 'Pro' prices.    
They have a very good selection of brands, and quantities are large but not necessarily huge, fine for families.   
Their meats are good, and they have an okay selection of Asian products as well. Fruit and veg aren't great, but large bags of herbs are a good value.   
It's especially useful for shopping for parties and entertaining.

You might find it under Leinsamen,' Flachssamen. Leinsamenmehl. It will either be in the cereal aisle or next to flour, outmeal etc. On this blog  
 they write that you buy it at a health food store or commisary. 
The other thing that I think is very healthy are slimy vegetables like Okra, but I can't find any research to back it up. Every couple of months I have a craving and have to binge on it! This might be why-it helps heal and cleanse the gut -good for ulcers   Flax seed has mucilage plus it may be good for breast cancer 
Above all it is so cheap. 
The thing to watch with any fiber is not to take masses at the same time as vitamins  (they will pass right through) and to drink a lot, or you are in for a major blockage.

BUT...it is a damn good chocolate... By the way...I am also a fan of some of the French chocolates, and in my humble opinion, it is really impossible to say for sure who makes the best chocolate.  That would clearly depend on how 'best' is defined...      It might also be interesting to point out that the finest early Belgium chocolate houses were established by the Swiss...and...all roads leading to great chocolate began in Turin during the 18th century...

As mentioned you don't need to be in the trade, but be aware there are two price bands for 'Pros' and consumers, both marked on the shelves.   
I buy most of my dry goods there every few weeks, and make a visit for fresh goods for large parties and big cuts of meat. Alcohol is not particularly cheap, I usually just go to Denner for common stuff.

2236	Food and drink	Waitrose / Whole Foods in CH ?	oreneta	2988	22	Location: Zurich/Zug	13.03.2012, 14:46	"    First, I would agree with you that Cheerios are not a delicacy. A really good salsa would be (as almost everywhere sells Old El Paso...need I say more?). So for specialty items, Globus has been great. Even a can of italian cannellini beans in their own liquid (and not the usual white beans in brine) is a delicacy to me. It never was in the US at Whole Foods, but we're talking relativity.   
In terms of the food options, I actually find too much selection a negative. I don't need every possible option every day of the year. So what I look for is produce that's in season (the best time to eat it right?) and use it to focus my cooking. I'm surprised to hear you don't have good butchers nearby. Perhaps I've been lucky to find two excellent butchers within a two block radius of my apartment. Nothing lacking there! In fact, I could never find rabbit at Whole Foods...here it's around the corner.   
Yes...Whole Foods is a mecca in many ways (especially aesthetically as you reference)...call me old fashioned but I like to go to the cheese monger and the boulanger and the butcher and take my time finding the right items. I like to shop local and get to know the people behind the counters. Whole Foods, like Starbucks has created a homey feel for a very corporate experience...that's just not my kind of nirvana.

			Zuckerhut - also known as Fleischkraut and Herbstchicorée (autumn chicory) - has a latin plant name of   var.  and is a member of the chicory genus.   
The name zuckerhut does in fact translate and mean sugar loaf, but this is in relation to the shape, and not the taste - as in Sugar Loaf Mountain, R.d.J., Br.   
Cross-referencing different sources of reference and languages, it is difficult to get a definitive English equivalent, but it appears it can be an autumn or winter chicory/endive, or a romaine lettuce (cos) - as previously suggested.   
It is slightly bitter when eaten raw, or can be quickly blanched.      "	Posts: 163	Join Date: Jan 2011	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 33 Times in 19 Posts	made some interesting contributions

There's a non-stick baking spray (Backspray or Backtrennspray) that you can get if you don't want to fiddle around with butter and flour. You can get it in Migros, next to vegetable oils, fats etc., called Spraycook if I remember correctly.   
I usually spray a little into a springform, cut out the baking paper into shape and it holds the paper in place well.

2240	Food and drink	Wisdom tooth out - how to beat the pain non chemically?	guest	4571	40	null	null	"    Even without smell and/or taste, the radiating pain originating right from the socket suggests an infection of the socket. Sometimes there is no smell because the core of the infection is too deep inside the socket.    
Forget teas, arnica, any other kind of natural remedies. They all are nice in certain situations, but in your case, the infection must be manually removed. It's not exactly major surgery, and the sooner it is done the better.    
The brain risk mentioned by Textoch is minimal; I recall one case in Switzerland in the last 60 years, and that was a big topic at an annual congress of the Swiss Association for Maxillary Surgery because it was so unusual. However, the risk does exist, and even without that, the infection is a strain on the immune system.    
Don't tinker around, get help. Please.

They have not been around long but they have some fantastic beer. Handcrafted out of nothing but the best ingredients. You can get it at the ""viadukt"" in the markthalle (worth going anyway for many reasons) in Kreis 5

A metric rig will not fit Imperial and vice versa... unless you like the idea of gas escape. Even metric to metric can be an issue with difference in gauge, so doing homework on connections/diameter would save a heep of angst

Basically it's a ready made soup that has been condensed down into a thick paste (for the cream soups) and then put into a shelf stable can. The idea is you plop this out of the can (it litterally goes ""plop"" and makes a sucking sound coming out of the can). Using the can for measuring add milk (cream base) or water, mix heat and serve.

2264	Food and drink	What is royal icing and other cupcake info	ljm	12998	31	Location: Geneva	28.04.2008, 15:49	" 
			
			Speedy icing for cupcakes:   
- tip some icing sugar in a bowl. 
- add a little water and mix.   
Ta da! Some extra hints and tips:   
- use MUCH less water than you think at first, as it's far easier to add more water than more icing sugar. 
- warm water mixes more easily. 
- using lemon juice instead of water is nice. 
- if adding food colouring, use less water. 
- haven't got any icing sugar? Just put normal sugar in the blender for a minute or two, then you will have!   
A plate of cakes covered in plain white icing, but with half a dozen different toppings - sweets, sprinkles, fresh raspberries, etc, depending on your audience - gives the impression of having gone to huge amounts of trouble, and it's much easier than colouring several small batches of icing. Oh, and ideally but not essentially, cakes should be iced several hours before serving to allow the icing to set a little.

Regarding your concerns voiced above over what you perceive to be the manipulative tactics and immoral practices Migros and  other retailers engage in.  In case you have not done so already, it might be an idea to give them direct feedback on your views.     
It is to be hoped they would appreciate this because all   feedback, especially from those retailers   value most (we the customers) - positive or negative - is beneficial to all parties in the longer term.

2266	Food and drink	Picking out meat (steak)	kitten23kate	1529	9	Location: Entlebuch	23.02.2012, 08:49	" 
			
			I agree with going to a butcher rather than the supermarket. Apart from the social aspect - which I'm big on - of supporting your local tradesmen instead of the big Bell factories from where all supermarket meat comes from, you'll also tend to get much better quality as it has been kept better and won't have been vacuum packed (which draws the blood back inside the meat) or flushed with nitrogen gas for freshness. Not that there is much wrong with either technique, it just won't taste or eat quite as nicely. The local butcher will also be happy you tried your bad German in his shop and will remember you!   
In terms of cuts here....I don't personally think that the Swiss beef is great eg Simmenthal, so I tend to get Angus when they have it, although pricey as imported.   
Veal (kalb) tends to be good - although ununsual for some of us ex-pats who don't eat it at home. Escalope can be fried quickly and will be pretty low risk.   
Lamb (lamm) I also think is good here - try rack for tasty ""lollipops"" which you grill or griddle. For slower cooking, try lamm gigot which will be tied and ready to pop in the oven on a low temperature, or something like a pot roast.   
Most butchers here do good sausages too - Kalbswurst is veal sausage which is quite a fine texture usually, Schweinswurst will be something meatier. The other treat from the butcher if you are offally inclined as I am is liver - veal liver (Kalbsleber) here is excellent and will only be sold if very fresh and usually comes pre-sliced. Slow cooked onion until brown and sweet, then very fast fried liver.......spoon of mustard, splash of red wine vinegar, sprinkle of fresh parsley....heaven   "	Posts: 150	Join Date: May 2009	Member	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Thanked 128 Times in 50 Posts	considered knowledgeable
2267	Food and drink	Sugar Free Hot Chocolate?	ZurichSwissMiss	2958	21	Location: Zurich	22.02.2012, 16:51	"    I know, I know she asked for sugar free, but I wasn't sure if it was because, as you pointed out, she needs/wants to avoid sugar or if it's more a matter of convenience (e.g., wanting to keep a few packets in her desk for a quick hot chocolate fix). Of course cocoa powder would fit the bill, but you know what a mess it can be and that it doesn't dissolve so easily, even in hot liquid, without a lot of stirring   The offices I've worked in here all have milk, along with coffee and tea and oftentimes a microwave. If the OP has access to a microwave, she could easily heat up some milk in a bowl.   
Anyway, it was just a suggestion, particularly as I have not seen packets of hot chocolate here and I personally am not a big fan of instant drinks because of the taste. Unless one is a diabetic, I know a number of diet plans and nutritionists allow (even recommend) dark chocolate, despite the trace amounts of sugar, for its health benefits -- all in moderation, of course   "	Posts: 96	Join Date: Dec 2010	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 16 Times in 11 Posts	no particular reputation at present

2292	Food and drink	Bio Sweet Corn - is it non GMO?	Uno'sGarden	2085	18	Location: Somewhere over the Alps	02.11.2007, 12:29	"    Intellectual property is one reason. It means that it may be illegal for a farmer to grow his own seed, even if his field wasn't GM but there was an accidental cross-pollination from another farmer's field. This makes the most evil things the music industry has done so far seem like harmless child's play in comparison.   
Side effects may be another reason. Fine if the soy plant creates a posion to kill off the insects that are eating it, but how do I know that posion isn't harming me? Actually, no plant wants to be eaten and hence they are nearly all poisonous to some degree. It has taken 5000 years of plant husbandry to breed the poisons out of our foods. And then the GM folks put them back in for profit.

			For those who are looking for Chinese supermarket in Basel... 
There is a Chinese supermarket near Basel SBB main station.  If take Tram 1/8, get off the tram at Markthalle station (the stop right next to SBB) 
It's named Asian Brothers'.  Pretty big with some decent choices.

			ALDI is not only cheap, but their products compete with the major brands, quality wise. They are streets ahead of Coop's ""Prix Garanti"" or Migros' ""M Budget"" range.   
Re VAT: 
Germany: Aldi, sign up to their refund scheme, get the money into your bank account. Most other places: Get export documents at the till, have them stamped by customs upon leaving Germany, get the money back next time you visit the shop.   
France: Run up a really really large bill, otherwise places aren't interested. Then same as Germany.

2295	Food and drink	Lemon Meringue Pie	sarel	3683	37	Location: Zürich	28.01.2012, 18:06	" 
			
			Hi, 
It's my favorite dessert and I've tried many times to do it myself. My tips, after tens of tries are: 
- Do the crust yourself, even if the result might look less professional, it's always tastier and not that difficult to do. 
- Put just a little thickening agent in the lemon curd, like Maizena but not too much. Never stop stirring after you've added the eggs in the lemon curd. 
- Do an italian Meringue for the top. It's egg whites + liquid sugar (boiled with a little water).  
Good luck!

What I'm referring to is more ethical or moral issues which can be a bit more subjective. I never read an ""Overfishing the Oceans is Good"" article

			You could make some kind of ""Voressen"" with it. Heat some olive oil with 4 leafs of sage. Remove the sage and brown the meat in the oil. Salt and pepper. (you can also add a small amount of Tomato concentrate. Deglaze with Vermouth. Reduce liquid to a third. Add vegetables (carrots, cabbage, celery, onions with cloves, whatever you like). Add fresh herbs (Thym, Rosemary etc.) Cover with cold water and let the whole thing simmer for an hour to an hour and a half. You can add Champignons for the last 20 Minutes. Season with salt and pepper (Paprika, stock). Serve with mashed potatoes or spätzli.

			Assuming you want it for your dog, landi is selling that in the pet food section in 1 and 2 kg bags. Pig ears as well. I personally don`t understand why you want to eat pig skin. Do you nibble on the lether couch too? You also could chew on a piece lether, i think that could be a good idea to loose weigth. A frazzle lether must last for weeks to chew on.

As for the wide range of yoghurt products you may remember from the USA -- most of that would not be allowed to be called yoghurt here because it does not contain live bacteria cultures.    
Even after several years in Switzerland, my American OH keeps annoying salesclerks by asking them if ""this"" or ""that"" product contains live cultures. If it says ""Yoghurt"" it MUST have them. Period.

2339	Food and drink	dry rub chicken recipes?	RunningHermit84	3735	25	Location: Thalwil	05.01.2012, 21:55	"    Not wanting to contradict the other steak-related reply, but personally I always (and frequently) pan-fry my steaks. Get a good solid frying pan, add a little butter and heat on the highest setting until it's nearly, but not quite smoking. Let it sear on one side for a minute or so, then flip it to the other, then turn down to perhaps 60% or so. Cooking time will vary with the cut of meat, its thickness and the initial temperature. For a medium-rare fillet steak (I eat no other) about another two minutes per side should suffice, but if you're not sure spike it with something to see if it's still bloody in the middle and cook till it's how you like it.

At the least the pricing was reasonable with CHF 9.50/100 g for the standard flavor, the organic one was about twice the price.

it's difficult to explain if you haven't tried it... un-conched chocolate has an almost gritty texture as there are plenty of crystals still in it, compared to the smooth finished of a normal (conched) chocolate bar.

			Odd... I got mine at Migros Löwenplatz last year. Also measuring cups which look more like little pots (they all have a handle). They're made from metal and the handle is covered with some red rubber-plastic stuff. 
Maybe they are out of stock at the moment since it's so close to Christmas and either people needed them now for baking or got them as a Christmas present? 
Like jacek said, you probably should ask someone from the store if and where they have it. 
Another option might be Blattner AG at Seefeldstr. 17. (Take Tram No. 2 or 4 to Opernhaus or Kreuzstrasse, shop is between those two stops)  Shop is closed on Mondays!! 
I found my little nutmeg grater there after hunting for it in Migros, Coop etc. 
Enter the shop and ask the guys at the counter right away what you're looking for. The shop is a maze and without help almost impossible to find what you want.

			Classic French & Italian salad dressings are very simply to make. Each restaurant starts off with the basic recipe and then adds little personal touches like a different oil or vinegar and a variety of herbs. Follow this recipe as a guide:       
For Italian, substitute the white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar. You could use Balsamic but in restaurants/hotels the classic recipe is with red wine vinegar.

			Be careful when mailing chocolates.  I was ""Switzerlanded"" two days ago at the post office.  I had a package going to the US which contained:   
1 bottle of Swiss Vodka (made with glacier water, bien sur) 
1 box of chocolates from Geneve 
1 monogrammed Swiss Army knife 
1 Sacher torte from Vienne   
Total weight, 3.3 kg, cost to mail to US (economy, not priority) 58 CHF.   
20 minutes after leaving post office and filling out 2 pages of forms, the post office calls me and tells me that there is ""a little problem"" with my package and that I need to return to the post office.   
Of course, I was thinking that the ""problem"" was going to be either with the vodka or the knife and that the US had a ""problem"" with accepting one of these two things.     
No, sir.  The ""problem"" was with the little box (400g) of Swiss chocolates.  It had to be sent separately from the other items.  My French is pretty good and I still to this moment do not really understand what the reason was for this insane rule, but, nonetheless, the woman at the poste opened my package with scissors ON THE SPOT, dug out the box of chocolates, re-packed and re-closed the box and sent it on its' merry way.   
I repacked the chocolates all by themselves and sent them in a separate box the next day.  The cost of the chocolates?  30 CHF.  The cost of the shipping of just the chocolates?  35 CHF.  My sister in the US had better enjoy the heck out of those bleepin' chocolates!

Does that mean 'working week' or does this include weekend?     
Personally, I would struggle if it was a working week with three public holidays.       
I'm stoked if I can feed two people for under 20chf.

2391	Food and drink	Wine storage	bagpuss	3761	15	Location: Zurich	28.07.2009, 13:15	"    The corks won't rot if the wine is stored properly.The very obvious reason that people store good quality wine is that it tends to improve with age. Of course, there are many wines that should be drunk young: most dry whites and light reds like Beaujolais for instance.    
I bought a lot of mid-range Bordeaux 2005s in 2006, when they were cheap. In 5 years time, the wine will not only be far more drinkable, but the value will have soared. In other words, if you want to drink top quality wine, you either buy it when it's at its peak, when it will be very expensive, or you buy it when it's young and cheap, and store it, or have it cellared for you in the right, temperature-controlled environment.   
In fact even pretty modest reds will improve with a year or two in the cellar.    
As for sparkling, most Champagnes will definitely improve with bottle age, and become much richer and deeper in flavour. But it's a matter of personal taste. I love older Champagne.

			A good friend of mine has become lactose intolerant, ie an unhappy vegan. She can eat cheese as the process changes the lactose, but any ""vegetarian"" meals in restaurants often contain chicken stock, and then she is ill afterwards.    
If your daughter cannot, or will not, eat any animal or soy products she definitely needs to see a dietary specialist, as at 16 she has not yet finished growing.

Be careful of buying meats - do check properly what the limits are as preserved meats (like salami etc) do add towards the limit.

			As any fule kno, Seville oranges are expensive because they're all snapped up by the marmalade industry. They only appear in the markets for a short time after Christmas - sometimes only for a few weeks - as they need a touch of frost before they're good. You're not likely to find good ones beforehand as they'd be out of season.   
Stockpile on site, make marmalade, thump chest in victory.

			Here are some tips for Zimtstern 
- buy a fresh bottle of ground Cinnamon 
- do not over mix! fold in almonds 
- when rolling the dough out, use either a silicone baking sheet or clingwrap 
they stick like crazy 
- dip the cookie cutter in powdered sugar, and wash it, every now and then.   
when you put the biscuits in the oven with the frosting, watch consistently, otherwise the frosting will turn brown.   
Good Luck!

			Thinking about being creative with sweet potatoes and such...      is the cornbread recipe I use here, most often I make it to go with chili or some other tex-mex type dish.   
I made this   (or one like it, I lost my bookmarks  ) last year, it came out really nicely. We were expecting a vegetarian guest though so I left out the sausage and used vegetable stock. (In case you want it though,   is the sausage recipe I use)   
Back in the day, when I'd been nervous about baking a turkey, I made a ham instead (man, what I'd do for a good honey glazed spiral ham these days!) and instead of the candied yams my mother used to do, I rough chopped some sweet potatoes and baked them with pineapple chunks. This was more well received than I'd expected, by a long shot.      
This year I'm undecided what to do for Thanksgiving, most of my American friends here in Basel have moved away over the last couple months.    Maybe I'll (finally) introduce my in-laws to the holiday - I've got my eye on some pheasant I've seen at the butcher in Manor.

			Hi All,  
Last Saturday I took the effort to check out all of the four Asian stores that were listed in this thread. Mind you that I am biased towards cooking Japanese!    
1) Tan Tan: Rue du Simplon 47 
Size-wise the largest store of the four, besides pottery mainly dry ingredients geared towards the Thai/Indian cuisine. some fresh vegetables.    
2a) Alimentation Asiatique Thao: Ave des Jordils 4 
2b) Asia Kim Dung: Rue Chaucrau 6 
I group these two stores together; the smallest of the four, good fresh produce, small selection of ingredients.   
3) Uchitomi: Ruelle Grand-Saint-Jean 5  
I have to say i was quite impressed with this store. In Amsterdam I was spoilt by an abundance of great Japanese stores and this one is up there. Very large selection of ingredients, spices, sake, pottery, etc. The place to be if you like cooking Japanese!

			Vanilla flavour - use vanillla pods.   
Chocolate flavour - use cocoa powder (but not too much).   
Lemon flavour - (you're going to love this one ) use lemon. 12 calories per lemon!   
The lemon flavouring you want contains: Sunflower oil, flavouring preparations, natural antioxidant.   
Yum, yum.   
I'm trying not to be condescending here but you lot make me laugh.   
If you're worried about the calories then what the hell are you flavouring? Cardboard?

			OK. I once saw a program on TV which said you can make your own Yoghurt from... yoghurt.   
Basically, the guy (on the TV) put yogurt in a large bowl and filled it up with milk. he left it overnight and the yoghurt quad-double-ruppled in size overnight.    
Now, I don't know if the milk was warm or not? And I can't find a reference anywhere.   
Looking on the Internet, I did find:             
I must say. A very cultured thread.

I was familiar with most of that Wiki stuff already when I wrote my post. The essential thing is, even if modern attempts to make some kind of ""real"" Damascus steel are successful, the process is so complicated and unsuitable for mass production that it is way too expensive to  be used for the production of kitchen knives and the like. What is sold in stores as Damascus steel just isn't. And, as stated in the german Wikipedia article, Damasteel is a totally different process altogether, which I had not known before. Thanks for making me aware of that.

			As I have never been to this US store I might not be able to help you but if you want organic products you should be looking for a ""Reformhaus"". The biggest chain in Switzerland is Müller. They have many stores in the German part of Switzerland and also some in the Italian part but based on their homepage do not operate in the French part.  
They also sell things like soap etc.  
Check    
Please do not confuse the Reformhaus Müller with ""Müller"" which is a German chain and not organic.    
Hope that helps!

It is called ""paprika"" on the packaging, so it must contain some paprika and sweet paprika powder really doesn't have much taste.    
Some of the places I've lived, BBQ sauces are something of an art form, competitions about who has the best BBQ are a big deal. The ""marinade"" on the ""BBQ"" items here really is not very flavorful in comparison.    
All the same, if you enjoyed it while here, I can understand you wanting to be able to duplicate the flavor when you move on. After all, I get cravings for some things now that I didn't even particularly like before, all because I can't have it (or it is very different) here.

			Last weekend I stopped by the turkish shop nearest to my home. It was in the Winterthur old town, and their prices there was even higher than in Migros or Coop! I was quite surprised, but I guess it makes some sense since they probably have to pay so much for rent in a relatively prime location. But still... I have no idea why people would go there when a small Migros branch is located just two doors down.

			One thing you'll notice is bananas are much cheaper here than Australia ... got a bunch for CHF 1.20 a kilo the other day ...    
Overall, though, I'd say grocery prices are very similar, except for meat (much higher) and some fruit/veg (generally a little cheaper). 
Take-away and eating out are much more expensive. Generally the comparison is a week's groceries, or one meal at a restaurant ... and prepare to be shocked at the high price of asian food over here, especially sushi rolls!

Son number 2, breastfed here up in the Jura hills, told also not needed but that if we had been in the Mittelland (beneath the winter fogs ..) or even just down the hill from our little mountain, then certainly would be required.   
But in both cases I was told that if he was even just receiving occasional formula top ups, no drops would be required, as formula has it in. This is what I did.   
OP: you can get detailed formula ingredient lists from the respective country sites for Aptamil.  You can check these ingredient lists if you are worried.

Do you know what particular properties these pears have which make them particularly suitable for this recipe? Is it because they are considered very sweet? If there are any other redish skinned pear varities on sale, I think they would substitute well.  I would suggest Forelle .. these may be a little less sweet but not so noticeably that it would affect your recipe (which incidently sounds rather lovely and very intriguing).

			Hi everyone,   
I can recommend a woman who teaches how to cook Indian food. Her name is Shivani and she comes to your house to teach an assortment of dishes. I invited her to give my husband a cooking lesson on his birthday. It lasted 3 hours and she taught him how to make garlic chicken, chana  masala, dal, gobhi Manchurean, navratan korma, mango lassi, and  naan. She brings the spices. The lessons are 35fr per hour and it's well worth it, in my opinion. We had enough food for two meals for 4 people and my husband will definitely make them again. I'd be happy to provide her email address by PM to those who are interested.

			Hi! I am organizing an event this Sunday (Oct. 23) in order to bring together some people from around here and watch the Rugby final on big screen at 10am. There will be English Breakfast, bacon sarnie, tea and beer from 9am. The place is called Sale Bar and the address is Stockerstrasse 4 (only 100m from the train station in Horgen).   
Hope to see you there!

2484	Food and drink	Opus One	Caviarchips	890	4	Location: Basel Stadt	23.09.2011, 18:16	" 
			
			oops... my apologies, as I was confusing Rubicon/Niebaum-Coppola with the other big-ticket partnership of Opus One (Mondavi/Rothschild). They are just down the road from one another.   
Opus one does make some beautiful wines. I went to a tasting a few years back and received a long instruction about their wines. But its ""cult status"" in Asia has driven prices through the roof.   
There are so many great wines coming out of this region, that are not so well known. My favorite is Far Niente ( ).   
And for Caviarchips, as I grew up in the area my knowledge of wineries is adequate but sometimes the ""circuitry"" goes awry...

2487	Food and drink	Rocky Road Ice Cream?	bananafisch	978	8	Location: Zurich	13.10.2011, 22:28	"    At the end resulted to have the home made version:   
- 900ml tub of Mövenpick Swiss Chocolate ice cream - it also got chunks of dark chocolate pieces   (Coop) 
- half a bag almonds, semi crushed, some big chunks too (Coop) 
- quarter bag of coconut shavings (Coop) 
- quarter bag of mini marshmallows (Jelmoli)   
Thaw ice cream until really soft, but not completely liquid. Pour into tupperware, 1 litre or larger to make room for other ingredients. Of course, you can just spoon some ice cream into your mouth to make room in the original tub   . Mix in almonds, marshmallows and coconut. Make sure they are evenly distributed, and also taste to ensure right amounts of ingredients    
If you have any left, back into the freezer. After a few hours you got first class rocky road ice cream. The missus will surely be impressed   "	Posts: 158	Join Date: Sep 2009	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 78 Times in 56 Posts	made some interesting contributions

			I understand you wish to bake a cake for your baby, I thought I'd just throw and idea out there...  How about a layered veggie/fruit cake?  I don't know what veggies and fruits you have already introduced into your baby's diet but you could do something like this:   
1. Boil a bunch of veggies and/fruit separately.   
2. Puree them and layer each fruit and/or vegetable on top of each other.   
It would look really cool with different colours and you could make little shapes by cutting up some of the boiled food prior to pureeing them and place them on top as decor.

			@ Panel   
I think I went into most of your queries in the first post.    
Just to clarify: the white sugarpaste we stock   a Massa Ticino (is also called Massa Bianca) - Carma is just one brand. 500g à CHF 7.50, 1kg à CHF 15.00. Always fresh - always in stock.   
I don't stock a ""Tropical"" massa ticino (yet). Actually, might think about that...   
Isomalt: you can melt the Isomalt we have in the microwave too. In fact, it's the best way IMO.   
Colours: Sugarflair will remain my main brand. Perhaps I can find other brands types of colours in the future, but I doubt I'll be getting colours from the USA (because of the forbidden Es and also the occasional use of genetically manipulated ingredients - it's just a hassle to find out what's exactly in these products - as well as the transport costs).   
As for creating demand... I would try to accept that it's a different culture. The Swiss have their own tradition of nutty, fruity, veggie, chocolate cakes. Try something simple first, before going garishly over the top with a full-blown fondant masterpiece. The first thing the Swiss (generalisation, of course) generally say is how sweet and tacky these type of cakes look. They prefer ""taste"" to ""design"".

			I've been out all day, but if you're still stuck for a frosting that's easier than the buttercream, but that has a similar texture I'm a fan of old fashioned boiled icing. Sounds kooky but it's easy and you should have everything you need on hand. Good luck with it and don't worry how it looks too much as those kids eat it up so fast that they don't even see it half the time. If it tastes good, it's a win.    
=============== 
Old Fashioned Boiled Milk Chocolate Frosting   
INGREDIENTS:   
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt 
- 1/4 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder 
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk (see note) 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
- 24 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened (3 sticks), cut into 24 pieces 
- 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled     
METHOD:   
1. COOK MILK BASE Combine sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, and cocoa powder in medium bowl. Slowly whisk in milk until smooth. Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer into medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture boils and is very thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer milk mixture to clean bowl and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.    
2. MAKE FROSTING With stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat cooled milk mixture and vanilla on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and beat until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until frosting is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Mix in chocolate. Let sit at room temperature until stiff, about 1 hour.    
3. MAKE AHEAD Frosting can be refrigerated in airtight container for 1 week. When ready to use, let stand at room temperature until softened, about 2 hours. Beat with stand mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.

			Hi,   
I know this response is late to your original question, but in case you are ever looking again, take a look at    
You can have pretty much any image you want printed onto icing sheets (using edible ink). You peel the sheets off and simply place on top of your own cake.   
Hope that helps.

I have also found another called ""Gourmet Bratbutter"" found in the butter section of Coop and the cooking oil section of Migros. It looks like clarified butter (Ghee)?

			When you cannot find 'specialist' vegetables, go to a city street market, usually in all Swiss cities on a weekday and on Saturdays. Ask at a food stall selling vegetables, and you can usually order them when they are in season. Pick them up and pay for them the following Saturday.

They are based in Geneva and are the other large American products source similar to American Market.

What I was getting at is that she complained about the difficulty of getting ""baking products"". If you look at old american recipes, they always used sugar (cane or sugar beet). But then, as the agricultural policies in the US made corn syrup cheaper, corn syrup gradually replaced ""normal"" sugar in the recipes.        Actually, that is more about ""loading"" pre-processed food and fast food with HFCS than about using corn syrup for baking at home.

2555	Food and drink	Circassian Chicken	Caviarchips	1001	5	Location: Basel Stadt	11.09.2011, 20:51	" 
			
			I found this recipe on Internet,      
This is a classic Turkish dish found on buffet tables for special occasions. It is served cold as an appetizer. The chicken first is poached and then tossed with a sauce made from crushed walnuts and the poaching liquid.   
Ingredients 
4 tablespoons walnut oil 
4 teaspoons plus 2 tablespoons paprika 
4 whole chicken breasts on the bone with the skin, about 3 pounds 
1 carrot, cut into pieces 
1 rib celery, cut into pieces 
1 onion, halved 
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed 
2 Turkish bay leaves 
Parsley stems 
1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns 
2 slices firm white bread, crusts removed 
2 tablespoons olive oil 
2 teaspoons minced garlic 
1/2 teaspoon cayenne 
8 ounces lightly toasted walnuts (about 2 cups) 
Chopped parsley leaves, garnish 
Sliced Turkish bread, or pita bread, accompaniment 
Directions 
In a small saucepan, gently heat the walnut oil with 4 teaspoons of the paprika. Remove from the heat and let infuse.   
In a medium pot, place the chicken, carrots, celery, half of the onion, the garlic clove, bay leaves, parsley stems and peppercorns. Cover with water by 1 to 2 inches (about 1 quart) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and remove the chicken to a plate to cool. Strain the stock into a clean container and let cool.   
When the meat is cool enough to handle, shred or chop into pieces.   
In a small bowl, soak the bread with enough stock to soften. Let sit for 2 minutes then squeeze dry and tear into pieces.   
Chop the remaining onion half.   
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, garlic, remaining 2 tablespoons paprika, and the cayenne and gently cook, stirring, until aromatic and soft but not colored, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.   
In a food processor, grind the walnuts. Add the onion mixture, bread pieces and enough of the reserved stock to blend, about 1 cup. Process to make a smooth paste, adding additional stock 1 tablespoon at a time as needed. Adjust the seasoning, to taste, with salt and pepper.   
In a bowl, toss the chicken pieces with half of the sauce to coat. Place on a decorative platter and spread the rest of the sauce over the top.   
Drizzle with the paprika-infused walnut oil and garnish with parsley. Serve at room temperature with bread.

2556	Food and drink	Celery salt	Lakeside	885	1	Location: Kanton Zürich	11.09.2011, 19:27	"    Now that you mention it, I think you're right. It may be yet another endangered species on the Swiss market, just like dried lovage leaves. Those had been easily available at every decent grocery store for many decades but seem to have completely vanished. And, although I have not been looking for celery salt in the last few years, I think I would have noticed it while doing my regular spices & herbs shelve scanning in various stores.    
Celery salt is still available in the USA, but even Oryana in Traverse City, MI, a store that calls itself the oldest Certified Organic Retailer in the USA, with a spice department half as large as a medium sized Migros store, doesn't carry lovage any more. I had to grow my own.

Since canning is becoming quite a hobby for me, I'm keen do something with the fruit this year. So - do any of you have a tried-and-true recipe for Kornelkirsche?

2567	Food and drink	The Best Swiss Wines	guest	13072	20	null	null	"    Hard to come by outside Switzerland because there isn't enough of it for distribution outside Switzerland.   
I used to be a fan of red wine and I have become one again, after trying a few Swiss red wines on sale at my large Coop on Martplatz, Basel. You are, of course, wasting your time with the cheaper red wines (even for cooking). I liked the ""Dôle des Monts"" and that seems to be the starting price for a quality red. The slightly cheaper Hurlevent fell below my expectations. The more expensive and unimpressively named ""Rouge de Terre"" was far better than the ""Dôle des Monts"". I am looking forward to trying more.   
It sort of explains why the beer is so poor in Switzerland. I have found so far that good beer and good wine from a region are mutually exclusive.

And I also really miss it because, for one thing, after I started drinking spring water for a few weeks, I felt my energy level dramatically increase. I have no idea why, but it did.

2577	Food and drink	Concord grapes spotted in Migros!	guest	2705	27	null	null	" 
			
			Veering ever so slightly off topic... but may I ask those of you who are experienced hands at making grape jelly (US jelly   ):   
Do you add pectin to your jelly? And if so, how much?   
So far I've stuck to jams - no pectin, but I use higher pectin fruits - and have been happy with the results. But my jams are more the consistency of a spoon fruit.   
My first-ever batch of grape jelly ended up as syrup. I added pectin to the second batch, 1 envelope per kg fruit as directed, and ended up with something very stiff, about the consistency of fruit leather - tasty, but not a jelly.     
What to you jelly professionals   do?     
And returning to the topic at hand: No Concord grapes at the Seedamm Migros   but a vague promise that they might be getting some in. I'll be haunting the store daily, waiting, just in case... gosh I'd love a bunch of Concords, a little taste of home...

			It would help to know where you're located. In Zürich, there are   which mostly have seasonal, organic produce. Same goes for most other cities, you just have to do a bit of search on days and places. 
If you have a café, it might be useful to go and check them out, maybe you can get direct contacts to the farmers and get a nice deal. There are also a couple of producers doing gemüseboxes, but in that case you're really bound to the season - and it's a long nüsslisalat winter indeed   "	Posts: 13	Join Date: May 2011	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 6 Times in 1 Post	earned some respect

			Hi Hazel,  Have been thinking about you lately in this ridiculous heat.  Hope you're coping...   
As for the raspberry leaf tea, I can't help you with the German/Swiss version but I certainly would recommend it.  Have yu taken it before?  I didn't take it for bringing on labour but for making the uterus more effective during the birth.  I took it at the end of all three of my pregnancies and it did the trick in that respect every time!  In fact my last midwive even commented on what an effective uterus I had when it was contracting back to size so quickly after the birth!     Obviously I've got no idea whether my labours would have been equally as quick if I hadn't taken it but I wouldn't risk it!!   
I took it in tablet form rather than as tea (mostly because I don't like tea!) so maybe you can find it like that.  My inlaws are coming over on Saturday so if you don't manage to track any down I can always ask them to bring you some over.  Good luck in your search (and the birth!) xx

			You EFers should make some Ginger Beer, so we can talk about it.   
I'll attach my favourite recipe.   
It takes about 2 weeks, 1 week in a cup, and then 1 week bottled.  Although this time of year I sit mine next to the radiator to keep it warm; maybe a few days more quiet time in the bottle is necessary.   
Once it's bottled keep it inside a plastic tub, and with a towel on top in case your bottles explode.  My brother uses 2L coke bottles - he squeezes them every day to see if they're hard.  When hard they go into the fridge to slow (stop?) the fermentation.  I've been using those resealable beer bottles (0.5L) none of them has broken yet, but a 0.75L ""Pelforth Brune"" bottle blew out it's bottom (very cleanly actually, looked like it was sliced off).     
Since it's a fermentation process, there is at least some alcohol in the final drink.  I've only just received my hydrometer, so am yet to determine the amount.  Although we always made this stuff as kids, so I wouldn't expect it to be much ... *shrug*   
Maybe someone with elite brewing skills can enlighten me.   
So ... get those ""plants"" going.  The whole process will take you about one hour over 2 weeks - and 45 minutes of that is putting it in the bottles.   
Looking forward to some brewing chatter!   
cheers, 
(Mr)Wibble

Glatt was great. Mrs Siberian was a little stressed about bringing 3 kids on the flight herself, then we found out the flight was delayed by an hour, therefore making her estimated arrival time at home around 1am (reminding you again, this is with 3 young kids!!)   
So we parked @ Glatt, dropped the two older ones at the play centre, and went for a relaxing glass of wine and chilled out. It took lot of the stress away.   
Afterwards we ate some dinner at the Migros, just being a bit easier for the kids. The other restaurants looks really good.   
English forum got a bit of praising from us that evening!   
All worked out great, they went off happy, I went home to an empty house and have been bored ever since.

2602	Food and drink	Hand pulled chinese noodles (la mian)	maurizio	4724	26	Location: Zurich/Lugano	20.11.2010, 20:03	"    Correct. Kansui is particularly alcaline water. In some countries (definitely not in Switzerland, I assume), you can buy kansui powder to add to your normal, non-alcaline, tap water, about 1 gr per deciliter (i.e. 1%). As far as I know, it consists of 55% sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), 35% potassium carbonate (K2CO3), and 10% sodium biphosphate dodecahydrate (NaHPO3.12H2O). This is so simple, I guess you could have it mixed at any drugstore or pharmacy without it costing more than, say, an arm.    
By the way, I recently got an e-mail from some murky guy in Hongkong who wanted to send me a few million dollars for helping him get some more million bucks out of Hongkong -- the usual Nigeria style scam we all know and love. I wrote back, telling him that I had earned so many millions recently by smuggling money out of Nigeria, Burkino Faso, Romania etc. that I had to stop doing that kind of business in order not to get taxed to death. However, I told him that I would gladly send him a million or two if he in turn could send me a few hints on how to make hand-pulled noodles, since it indeed is very difficult to find useful info on the Internet. Haven't heard back from him yet....

			Nah, that's fine.   
However, green parts of any part of a nightshade plant (solanaceae) are toxic because of the solanine. This family of plants includes tomatoes, eggplants, potatoes, tomatillos, physalis, chilies/peppers, tobacco, etc. That's why you shouldn't leave potatoes in the sun: they turn green and develop solanine. (Green tomatoes also have small amounts of solanine, which is why you should eat fried green tomatoes only rarely.)

Serve with rice (1 volume rice, 2 volumes water, a little salt, cover, bring to boil, switch off electric hob / turn gas hob to minimum, let stand with lid on until all the water has been absorbed, add tumeric and cardamon pods at the start to make imitation pilau), and any pan-fried meat that you like.

2622	Food and drink	Bringing wine with you over the border	Heidi_Toronto	3544	2	Location: St. Legier, Switzerland	13.07.2011, 14:47	"    In theory, the answer is yes; in practice, it's tougher than it should be.  Most French shops won't go through the hassle of filling out the required paperwork unless you've spent more than EUR100-, and even then they often take a commission for processing the paperwork.  You don't get the refund at the border in any case -- you need to send the paperwork back to the shop and they'll eventually send you a cheque or refund your credit card.   
There are a few wine merchants near the border (like   in Hegenheim) that have special arrangements with the customs office and can sell you wine ex-VAT for export, but these are few and far between.   
The advice given by the previous poster is correct -- you're allowed two litres of wine duty-free   (also worth noting that in practice, they allow 3 x 70cl bottles per person duty free rather than strictly enforcing the 2L limit), then CHF 0.60- per litre up to 20L, then CHF3- per litre afterwards.  Plus the Swiss VAT, of course.   
As tariffs go, the taxes on importing wine are pretty generous.  Even with the extra tax and duty, it's still far cheaper to buy wine in France than to buy its equivalent in Switzerland.   
Santé!

Just because Switzerland is a good source for chocolate doesn't mean other places aren't! Cadbury's chocolate is really good IMO, and much much cheaper. The grotty stuff is American. Hershey's is bland and synthetic.   
But as for food to bring over, and presuming you're driving, I'd agree with much of what's been said -- baked beans, Branston Pickle, HP sauce, soy sauce, your favourite brand of muesli/breakfast cereal, chilli, crisps etc. But I also agree with @adrianlondon that yes, there are things I miss but there are plenty of compensations for most things.

2650	Food and drink	decaf coffee beans?	TeleMama	3742	6	Location: Zug	10.07.2011, 23:30	" 
			
			My take is invest in something of quality if you enjoy it often. A thing of beauty, etc.   
The coffee in Switzerland is generally of very good quality, even dare I say it supermarket own brands. There are many places where they roast  coffee; try asking in a Cafe or even bakery where you like to drink as they often sell what they serve. I don't know about your neck of the woods but in Zurich we're spoilt for choice. Freshly roasted is the important bit.   
Forgive me for mentioning it but there's a world of taste difference between freshly roasted and ground, good quality coffee and the stuff in a capsule / pod. Nespresso and their ilk have excellent quality control and make coffee 'easy' for those not too bothered about the taste but it's rather  . It's the pinacle of Monoculture and lacks soul. If you take sensual pleasure in the things you eat / taste...   
If this isn't of interest and the financial element doesn't matter, take the easy route and buy the aluminum capsule / pod device. As with printers and their cartridges, they'll give you a cheap machine and screw you with the price of supply.  If you're undecided and are considering a 'real' machine, a decent place will allow sampling of their machines; 45 minutes well spent    
Below is where I get my   supply, where they also do decaf ( ):          "	Posts: 15	Join Date: Jul 2011	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

I haven't seen inside a Chef's Choice to see how the diamond wheels are arranged, but they seem to give a good quality edge from what I've heard and read. Perhaps over the long term the edge could get uneven, not sure. Some of the more basic ""sharpeners"" out there definitely will mangle a blade, but the current crop of electrics apparently don't.

			Sorry for the delay   I had to find my hand writen recepy book, which decided to disappear...   
  So here goes the  recepy:         Cut the toast bread into small cubes and leave it to dry during one night, on an open bowl.   
  On the following day, cut the onion into small pieces and let it get a golden colour on olive oil (low temperature).   
  Add the onion, 2 tea spoons of salt, pepper and the parsley to the bread and mix the whole thing. Add half a cup of milk and the spinach, and smash it. Add 2 spoons of flour and 2 eggs and smash the mix till you have a homogeneous dough (its kinda sticky. If too dry add milk, if too liquid, just add a bit of flour).   
  Wash your hands. Get a bowl of warm water.   
  Wet your hands on the warm water and shape pieces of dough into balls about 5 cm diameter. Place a cube of cheese in the middle, and try to get the ball to keep a decent shape. The warm water will help to get the dough not to stick to your hands.   
  Place the 10-12 balls inside cooking salted water for 15-20 min and serve with tons of parmesan on top         
  A variant to it is instead of using 150g of spinach, using 100g of bacon (the one cut into tiny pieces).   
  It takes maybe a little more time than the regular pizza in the oven, but its a lot of fun to prepare, and it is really tasty

2678	Food and drink	Tomato Plant food	MurrayIreland	1678	12	Location: Zurich	20.06.2011, 10:38	"    .... you actually couldn't be more wrong with that one. The list of pest and diseases is extensive..... however, good soil hygiene is the key to success. ""Prevention is better than the cure""     
Singularly Tomatoes are easy to grow as the growth process is extremely fast (average a set of flowers and new growth per week).   
In a 'monoculture' pest dynamics swing very quickly, so you have to be on your toes.     . 
(usually under the leaves for powdery mildew etc. ..... or hold a suspicious leaflet upto the light to examine for a 'ring' of pale tissue around a spot (indicating a bacterial or fungal infection))      (and especially the little hairs), flowers   for signs of insect egglay. 
N.B. many moths are 'noctuids' and are active on nights with high light intensity (full moons or clear skies). Pay close attention after these periods for signs of activity. 
Egg lay generally takes about 3 days to hatch  (5 days in cold weather) into a grub. Clear or green eggs are fresh, any other colour is older (less time to hatch).

			I don't see anything wrong with toast for brekkies; white bread is easy to digest, and toasting it add to the digeribiliy. SO perfect... Maybe in a little while, you can vary a bit the type of bread, or add a bit of mashed banana as a ""jam"" on top.   
YOu can also make simple instant fruit jams with just one or two spoonfuls of sugar to use for her, they cook in minutes and you store them in a baby-food jar in the fridge, that will add variety.   
I like the idea to give her bread crusts for teething.   
I think the rule is - keep it simple! do whatever works for you and your family.

At the moment they only sell Godminster cheddar (it has a burgundy wax round it) and Cropwell Bishop Stilton from my selection. For a bigger selection of my cheese you need to visit Zurich I'm afraid.

			Fair enough, if I've bought something, don't want it and the store made clear, or even just assumed I knew, that buying is forever, that's my problem. 
If I ask if something can be returned, and I specifically ask if I can return it to another shop, and the answer is yes, I expect it to remain yes. If I shop in an online store that advertises easy returns, I expect at least a fairly easy return.  
It's when I have a salesperson who suddenly pulls a completely different story out, that I will stand my ground. Every country and shop has their way of doing things. I can accept that, but I'm not going to accept someone keeping my money because it makes their day easier.

Then we cooked them in a little olive oil, with garlic and soy and hot pepper - you can add sesame seeds or a splash of sesame oil. Yum.

			The whole myrtillus familly has regional names, I say   for the one every body recognises out of the three fruits named wineberry in English (the one I also find under Bilberry) But the american ones are not the same as the european montain ones.

			In terms of Belgian beers, some that I'd recommend are   
- La Chouffe 
- Chimay 
- Kwak   
In terms of places to drink them, I recommend Old Gregory's on Langstrasse. They have more than a hundred beers in stock. The manager is a guy from Ticino and he is extremely knowledgeable on beers and more than happy to advise so if you tell him what you like he's pretty good at advising other stuff you might like. He has beers from all over the world and is a walking beer encyclopedia.   
Best thing is to come in on a weekday when there aren't many people around so he has time to talk to you about his beers.

Pop it back in for another 25 sec (or until you can see it rinse to the top of the rim). Then it is done. stir in whatever you like to acompany it.    
The trick is to use a big enough container and the porridge must have reached a certain temperature for at least 10 sec.

			Try the 'reformhaus' (health food store) - it will be quite expensive, though. 
We use this one a lot:       
Otherwise, you'll probably get really good at baking your own!   
I'm quite sure you can get 'egg replacer' at the health food store too. The problem I have with reading the labels (In German) is that they use the word 'Eiweiss' interchangeably for Protein - you will also see the word 'Protein' - Eiweiss also means 'egg white'. You might also see it written in German as Eiweiß.

2743	Food and drink	Sausage & Egg McMuffin	guest	2423	7	null	null	" 
			
			Ahh... it was soooo close, not quite perfect though so will require a bit of ""fiddling"" with the recipe.   
As mentioned recently, Coop ""now"" (perhaps for some while) has ""Toast Brötchen"" which many of us have known previously to be named ""English Muffins.""   
Edamer cheese is a decent substitute for ""American cheese"" (deli style, not singles) and has a similar flavor to the cheese used by MickyD's.   
I tried a recipe today for sausage which comes passably close to how I like my breakfast sausage. I forgot an ingredient (brown sugar) and neglected to add two others (red pepper flakes and marjoram) as I didn't have them. I used mixed ""hackfleisch"" of beef and pork and the result was a tad dry BUT over all, it was a good start.    
Recipe   (I think I've linked it before on the forum):     Ingredients: 
2 lbs of ground pork   
1 tablespoon of sage 
2 teaspoons of marjoram 
2 teaspoons of thyme 
2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes 
1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper 
1 teaspoon of brown sugar 
1/2 teaspoon of salt 
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper   
Method: 
1. Mix all ingredients together. 
2. Form into patties and fry six minutes on each side. 
Keeps in the refrigerator for a week. 
Note:  The spice measurements are not an exact science, and what I tend to do  while mixing is pinch off a little bit and fry it up to see if I like  the flavor. This is what I start with, but feel free to experiment.       
I think next time I will make sure to have some marjoram but I'm not keen on breakfast sausage with obvious red pepper so will leave it out again. Also, I think the dryness had something to do with how lean the meat was, perhaps asking at the butcher counter for some freshly ground pork (maybe with a bit of extra fat?) rather than using the prepackaged beef / pork off the shelf will be better.   
I know it is healthier as is BUT really, it is intended to be a ""sometime"" thing so am not too concerned about making it worse for me, I simply don't care to hand mix sausage often enough for it to ever become a problem.       
Meanwhile, the sausage, some hard fried eggs, edamer cheese and buttered and lightly toasted ""toast brötchen"" stacked up into a pretty good semblance of a Sausage & Egg McMuffin.      
Happy Monday all!

I've seen cream cheese in the stores... but very limited flavors and it only comes in one size.

			The vast majority of Swiss cheeses, among them every hard cheese, is produced with the aid of lab from calves. The few exceptions I know of are:    As far as I know it has to be produced without genetically modified organisms. And these are involved in the production of one lab replacement substance.

2751	Food and drink	Using a Rotisserie on the BBQ/Grill	Neil600	1117	0	Location: Winterthur	11.05.2011, 14:20	   Dear EFers,     I just bought a Rotisserie accessory for my BBQ and would like to try it out. I know how to set up the meat and cook it but I am not sure about how I can safely use my Gas BBQ to do it. (By the way, the Rotisserie accessory I purchased is manufactured by the same manufacturer as my BBQ. However, they gave no suggestions on how to use it)     I searched around and it seems that the way to cook it safely (without dripping lots of fat onto the flames and ending up with an inferno) is:     1) to remove the grills and place a tin tray over the lava rocks/heat spreaders.   2) Fill the tin tray half way up to the top with water and add any seasoning/herbs/flavours that you wish to use.    3) Make sure the tray is under the chicken/pork/beef or whatever your meat is so that it will catch the dripping fat during cooking.   4) Close the lid and cook the meat to your preference.      Is this the correct way? Has anyone used a Rotisserie on a BBQ before? I want to know as: a) I don't want to set fire to my new BBQ, b) I don't want to waste a perfectly good chicken and c) I don't want to splatter exploding chicken all over my patio.     Any tips would be appreciated as I want to try it out tonight. If you hear fire trucks heading towards Elgg tonight, it's probably to assist me with the aforementioned exploding chicken inferno.

2755	Food and drink	"Science Diet ""Advanced Protection"" high antioxidant food?"	WorldFoodie	4766	18	Location: Vaud	01.08.2008, 17:48	"     
When we brought our three dogs home with us from Japan, we brought a small supply of their dog food with us so that we could mix it with the new food we were anticipating having to buy here. Our eldest dog was on a fish based food and we found her a good alternative from Fressnapf where if you buy a small bag of any food on a trial basis for your dog, they will refund the price if the food does not agree with your dog.   
The middle dog was on a Nutro food and we found the same food here but now Nutro is almost impossible to obtain so we have switched her food.    
The youngest dog was on Hills i/d which we had delivered to our door in Japan from a dog food supplier for a fraction of the price for what we pay here for a 15 kg bag which is only available at the vet`s. The dog food prices continue to climb.   
A friend of mine is selling a food by this company.  
It is not sold in pet stores and I have not had a chance to check it out. Perhaps someone here has some experience with it?   
So, while dog food is more expensive here, I look on the bright side which is that our dogs are much healthier here than they were in Japan. While food and medical costs were considerably lower there, I was always at the vet`s with one problem or another.    
For a short while in Japan, before we could figure out what food our dog that now eats i/d could tolerate, I cooked for her. The vet told me that if I did that here it would be double the cost of the i/d, so that is really not an option though I have to say our dog loved home cooked food .    
The only thing I do ""cook"" for them is chicken soup as in case one gets some type of stomach upset, when it is best to keep them off food until their stomach settles down. Most prepared chicken soup contains onion which is no good for a dog, but if you make it yourself you can omit this. I also add rice and salt and they usually make a very speedy recovery. You can freeze the soup (without the rice) if necessary but it never lasts that long at our house as even the ones who aren`t sick want some.

Brown sugar is an acquired taste I guess...   
It's just that when I visited the Wiedikon are in lower west Zurich City, I was told there was a large Jewish orthodox community in the area.   
This lead me to think about those tasty beef sarnies.   
Somebody must have an idea?

			I ended up making a recipe sent to me from a friend. Bobby Flay's duck breasts with a Ginger Chilli Glaze, only beacuse I had all the ingredients at home. Turned out excellent. Really Really Nice.

2770	Food and drink	Duck fat	fredch	1904	8	Location: Obwalden	30.04.2011, 19:30	"    Duck fat and more so goose fat is good for roast potatoes to give them a good finish with the right crispiness and colour. It is best not to use them for smaller-piece vegetables as it is very high in calories and cholesterol. Next time you roast duck or goose then save some of the fat because there will be plenty spare.

2773	Food and drink	Hormone/Antibiotic/Pesticide-free food please?	MissZula	1666	9	Location: Ochlenberg, BE	17.04.2011, 12:32	"      Trichinosis is very rare, but does exist. That said, it was   necessary to cook to well done (old recipes called for 180F!!!): trichinosis is killed at 137 degrees F, which is about medium-rare,  at which point it becomes as safe to eat as beef cooked to that temp. When I cook pork, I usually shoot for an internal temp of about 145-150F, which carryover heat then takes up another 5 degrees to a perfect medium.   
In Germany, they make Mett, which is chopped lean pork eaten raw on toast. (It's delicious, by the way.) Only specially trained butchers can sell raw Mett, and it's made from specially-inspected pork that is confirmed free of trichinosis.

			The best one is in Thalwil, just down from the main strip of stores. It is called Cafeteria Gelateria. I tried tons of places in Zurich and this place is by far the best. It puts Dieci to shame. It is home made (althoug it is not clear if it is done in the shop or brought in) so they do occasinally sell out of some flavours.  A small cup with 2 flavours is 4sfr and well worth the trip if you are anywhere close by.

			Alex, you can see from here that different people have different lifestyles and tastes. Some are contented not to eat out, whereas some of us occasionally indulge in the Globus food section from time to time.    
The best is to go onto leshop.ch, do an imaginary shopping trip of the necessities that you would buy a week/month (for example: eggs, bread, washing powder, toilet rolls etc) based on YOUR diet, preference etc - add about 20% from there (for the occasional exotic stuff/treats) - that should give you a rough idea of what to budget for your household's food bill monthly. I did that initially when we first arrived, and have hardly deviated from that amount.

You can also buy the sweetened condensed milk from Migros - in smaller tins or tubes.

That takes me back to my schooldays in the UK when I was in the OTC (Officer Training Corps). I pretty much hated it, so the deal to escape was that I went on the Easter ""Arduous Training"" ventures, which involved camping in the snow and then starting out early in the morning to climb a mountain.   
Breakfast was very important, as without it you won't get up that mountain. Here comes my hatred of porridge, and also cans of sausages in baked beans.   
But if I see a can of baked beans with sausage in it, I will always buy it, especially if I am setting off to climb some hill.   "	Posts: 3,378	Join Date: Jul 2007	Forum Legend	Groaned at 15 Times in 14 Posts	Thanked 2,550 Times in 1,236 Posts	a reputation beyond repute
2788	Food and drink	Dandelion Honey - fake but delicious	Captain Greybeard	1378	0	Location: Sarganserland / NW Lower Peninsula of NE US Midwest	12.04.2011, 11:03	"     
As mentioned elsewhere, this is not real honey but a honey-like bread spread. By definition, honey is a nectar product made by bees. This, however, is a honey-like man-made product.    
WARNING: It contains a lot of sugar and may cause addiction, overweight, tooth decay, diabetes, you name it. It may contain traces of liquid manure or body parts of little insects. Don't say you weren't warned.    
A lot of scientific research went into the development of this recipe, after I had to find out the hard way that the figures given in a Betty Bossy book on Swiss cuisine were pretty wrong. Yes, Betty Bossi, the fictional Popess of Swiss cooking, got it wrong.    
I know that the whole procedure sounds complicated. It's something that cannot be done based on gut feelings, unless you want to end up either with dandelion syrup or hot-melt adhesive. However, it is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.   
Ok, here we go:    
Pick about 230 dandelion blossoms; that makes about 200 gr (7 ounces). Pluck the petals and discard the green parts. Add one liter (roughly 1 quart) of cold water and the grated peel of one lemon. Bring to a nice boil and keep boiling for about seven minutes. Let it sit for several hours, preferably over night.    
Sieve it and discard the solids. Pour the infusion in a big pot (I said big for a reason!). Add the juice of the lemon and 500 gr. sugar (that's 17.636684 ounces -- oh never mind, take a good US pound then). Measure the level using a ruler or the like. Bring the liquid to a boil. Brace for several hours of boiling, stirring frequently. Make absolutely sure it does not boil over, otherwise you'll turn your stove top into a desaster area.    
During the first hour, the risk of boiling over is not big, but then you'll notice a strange phenomenon: Whenever you stir the liquid, it will start foaming and rising, quite the opposite of what you would expect. Find a good balance of heat and frequency of stirring. If you boil a bigger quantity, for instance by doubling or tripling the figures mentioned above, expect the times mentioned to increase quite significantly.    
Between stirring, prepare glass jars the way you would for canning jam, with boiling water and such, then putting them upside down. Prepare enough jars for about 0.8 ltr (27 fluid ounces).    
When the liquid is down to about 40 % of the initial level (yes, some math is involved), start making saucer tests at 10 minute intervals or so. This means, you put one drop of the syrupy liquid on a saucer (which has to have room temperature). Hold the saucer vertically, immediately dip a finger tip in the drop and pull it away horizontally. When the thin thread breaks at a length of about 17 - 18 mm (about 22/32"" or 0.68897"", if you like), it's time to shut the heat down. That may be at roughly 35 % of the initial level, but the length of the breakage of the thread is more important than the level.    
Now you will think the stuff is still way too liquid, but don't worry. It will thicken while cooling down. Pour the syrup into the jars. You may use a soup ladle or the like, sterilized in boiling water beforehand. Put the lids on the jars, tighten them and let everything cool down to room temperature.  
If stored in a dark place, the fake honey can be kept for a year or even much longer. I have a few jars from 2008 that still are fine. I think it is way too sugary to ever grow mould.    
The spread can used on buttered bread (or toast), a simple Sunday brunch treat. I also use it for certain marinades and for my world-renowned dandelion ice cream, which is delicious together with fresh blueberries or the wild blackberries we harvest in the hills of the Leelanau Peninsula on Lake Michigan. For that purpose, we have taken quite a lot of the sticky stuff to the USA. It always raises the eyebrows of customs officials, because real honey is on their terrorist list. When I tell them that it is not made by real bees, it's okay.    
Of course, said dandelion ice cream might go nicely with billberries from our Swiss mountains too, but I must admit that I never tried that, although the forests around here are full of them in early August. But that's when I'm in the USA anyway, sailing the Great Lakes and picking wild blackberries.

			I remember reading (or hearing) that during WWII (and before), whale meat was very heavily consumed in UK, due to price and limited availability of other meats. 
In fact it become so much the staple protein of the working classes, that they ended up actually becoming so fed up of it, in the end, that it inspired   to record her classic wartime hit:     (Ah no)  ""Whale Meat Again??!!""      Whenever possible, I will always endeavour to buy home (Swiss) produced meat and poultry, and pay a premium as I think the animal husbandry it considerably better than of some of the alternative sources of origin.   
We don't eat meat every day, so I prefer to go for (perceived) quality over quantity.

Who makes the best ones are a subject of regular and intense debate at  our work. There were some cool stories about taste-tests when Laduree  entered the Swiss market awhile ago in   and  .

2799	Food and drink	Key Limes - Where to find?	Küsnacht	1596	2	Location: Zurich/Küsnacht	02.04.2011, 11:13	" 
			
			I actually have made ""Key Lime"" Pies recently and was able to use the ones I picked up at Coop.       is the recipe I used:     
 GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST 
1 wax paper-wrapped package graham crackers (1/3 of a 16 ounce box) 
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
1/3 cup granulated sugar 
 FILLING 
3 egg yolks 
1-1/2 teaspoons lime zest (about 2 Persian limes) 
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 
2/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 
 WHIPPED CREAM 
1 cup     heavy or whipping cream, chilled 
1 tablespoon confectioners sugar   
 1. CRUST: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the graham crackers  into the bowl of the food processor and pulse until you have fine  crumbs. Add the sugar and melted butter and pulse until the mixture the  crumbs are all wet. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the  prepared pie pan, pressing up the sides and forming a rounded or squared  off top edge. Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 8 minutes. Set  aside on a wire rack and leave the oven on. 
 2. FILLING: In the bowl of the stand mixer, whip the egg yolks and  lime zest at high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Slowly add the  condensed milk and continue to whip until thick, about 3 or 4 minutes.  Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly add the lime juice, mixing just  until combined. The mixture will start to thicken as soon as you add  the lime juice. Pour the mixture into the crust. 
 3. BAKE: Bake for 10 minutes or until the filling has just set. Cool  on a wire rack, then refrigerate. Freeze for 15 to 20 minutes before  serving. 
 4. WHIPPED CREAM: Chill the mixing bowl. Using the wire whisk  attachment, whip the cream and confectioners sugar until you have stiff  peaks. Pipe the whipped cream around the edges and in the middle of the  pie, or put a dollop on each slice.           
I did modify it slightly when I made it, instead of using graham crackers, I crushed some plain ""petit beurre"" cookies (also from Coop) which I mixed with some shaved coconut as well as the butter and sugar to form the crust.    
I also made some tarts, picking up the small pre-made tart shells at Coop (I think they're HUG brand, something like that) which I brought to a BBQ a few weekends ago. I *think* everyone liked them, I didn't have to bring any home with me.      The recipe above made 24 tarts and I still had a bit of filling left over which I poured over some crushed cookies + coconut in some ramekins (sort of an upside-down crumble). The tarts and the extras I baked for about 7min.

			Yes!  I saw this in Spar the other day, and thought about buying it, just for the sake of having a can of Duff Beer.  Good to know I didn't make the wrong decision and buy it! 
Also interesting to know it's illegal in the States!  I thought they would've had it years ago.

			You should try the products from Mineralquelle Gontenbad, the most popular one is Flauder:     
Its a soda with elderflower taste (had to google that one). Very refreshing, with only 8 cal for 100ml.   
They just released a Coke sweetened with stevia. I have seen the Flauder in Migros and Coop, the other flavours are a bit hard to find.

2 tbsp dark rum
3½ gelatine sheets
500ml/17½fl oz double cream
4 tbsp caster sugar
¼ tsp ground ginger
¼ tsp ground allspice
ground nutmeg, to taste
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
1 small handful berries, such as redcurrants, to serve     1. Place the raisins into a small bowl and cover with the rum. Set aside to soak for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Meanwhile, soak the gelatine sheets in a bowl of cold water until softened. Drain and squeeze out any excess liquid using your hands.
3. In a heavy-based pan, heat the double cream, sugar and ground spices. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering and simmer for 2-3 minutes, whisking until the sugar has dissolved.
4. Remove the cream mixture from the heat and whisk in the drained gelatine until dissolved. Drain the raisins and stir into the cream mixture (discard the soaking liquid). 
5. Spoon the mixture into six moulds or ramekins. Set aside to cool completely, then cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for at least two hours, or until set. 
6. To serve, dip the ramekins briefly into hot water to loosen each panna cotta and turn out onto serving plates.  Scatter over some redcurrants to garnish.  "	Posts: 40	Join Date: May 2010	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 17 Times in 12 Posts	no particular reputation at present

2819	Food and drink	Electric/Gas/Induction - availabiliy in Switzerland	guest	3892	20	null	null	" 
			
			There's an amusing article by Matthew Fort in today's Guardian about his new induction range cooker.   
In it there's one paragraph about normal electric cookers:      I wonder if this explains much of the cooking in Zürich    
Certainly my heart sank when I moved here and realised I had to use an electric cooker.   
What's the distribution and availability of gas in Switzerland?   
And lastly, does anyone here use induction?  I have a single ring induction bad that I usually use for stock cooking (i.e. where I have to leave it cooking for many hours) or when I need rather more control than a normal electric ring would offer.  Induction is responsive and safe.   
What's the adoption of induction in Switzerland like?  Anyone else using it?  In particular has anyone bought a fully induction hob or range in Switzerland?

			The best doner kebap I had in Geneva is in Istanbul 2, that is the one in rue de mont blanc. you should try the lamb. chicken and the mixed beef etc are derivatives for the european palate.   
in general, none of these are custom prepared as far as i know. ideally, take the next flight to istanbul

			Here's my favourite recipe for T-Bone steaks     Take 2, baby T-bone steaks (about 16oz each)   Apply a little salt and pepper on both sides   Using a sharp knife, make a few thin cuts alongside the steaks, following natural muscle shape   Place in a tupper-ware container, where there is a little space available (not too large)     On a different container, make a mix of:   2 ½ double shots of JD (or more, depending on taste)   3 double shots of Balsamic vinegar   ¼ cup of virgin olive oil   Juice of 1 ½ oranges, or 1 small cup of tropicana orange juice   Juice of 1 lemon, or 1/3 small cup of cooking lemon juice   3 large tablespoons of honey (flat quantity)   1 ½ teaspoons of cinammon   1 teaspoon of allspice   2 teaspoons of paprika   A little more salt and pepper     Mix thoroughly, until the sauce is properly blended     Pour onto the steaks, into the plastic container, making sure that all parts of the meat are fully covered (if necessary make more of the sauce, doubling amounts).     Leave into the fridge for at least 12 hours.     Total cooking time is 12-16 minutes:   Make a frying pan relatively hot (medium heat), and add a little butter   As the butter starts to burn (about 10-15 seconds) place the steaks (with as much sauce as they picked up, and let cook for 4 minutes, turning once.   Turn steaks a second time (both sides about the same), and pour all of the mix over them. As soon as it starts boiling, lower temperature, and let the whole thing simmer on medium-low fire for a further 10  12 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken.     If the sauce begins to disappear before the steaks are ready, add a little orange juce or water.     Check steaks are cooked, and serve on warm plates, adding about half the sauce onto the steaks, and the other half over the rice, or potatoes served with it.     Recommended with fresh, lightly boiled vegetables (Sugar snaps, carrots, mange tout, and broccoli), made just with salt and a drizzle of olive oil.   
Hope you enjoy!

2860	Food and drink	Your best chocolat Cupcake recipe	Nil	3928	34	Location: Basel	17.09.2010, 12:28	"     
A few tips to get softer, more moist cupcakes:   
1. Use the Denner Kuchenmehl (cakeflour). It produces a softer cake than the usual Weissmehl or Haushaltmehl.   
2. Don't overmix right after you add the floor. Fold it in gently till just combined. Overmixing makes the cake tougher, hence drier, because mixing develops the gluten in the flour.    
3. Add  two or three tablespoons of yoghurt or milk if the batter appears too thick.   
4. Separation of the eggs makes cakes fluffier as it adds more air. Whisk the whites separately and fold it into the batter gently.   
5. Check that you have enough baking powder (but not too much baking soda as it adds a 'funny' taste). Rough guide is: one teaspoon of baking powder for each cup of flour.

Good old booze free Migros do two pieces of 'American style' brownie (in the chilled dept) for around 4CHF and they are really good. And they've got nuts in them! And I'm converted!!  
Heated and served with some vanilla ice cream they are very close to what, imo, a brownie should be like.

2886	Food and drink	Apple pie advice	sunflower76	1967	36	Location: Zug	07.02.2011, 17:23	"    Okay, I'm not going to die in a ditch over 20g of the excess butter in my recipe.   20g is a little bit more, volume-wise than a Tablespoon, but we are in a world recesssion so go for 190g and make toast the next morning.   Eggwash make the sugar stick just in case a pie needs to be momentarily held over someone's head...for example...and at the same time 'goldens' the pie crust so that there is no need for Photoshop.

			Whether you make them yourself or use some premixed rubbish, some orange zest grated into the batter is awesome for both sweet and savoury pancakes/crepes.   
I know for sure because I ate them for the past two nights with everything from spinach to ham to chicken curry to chocolate to amaretto (on fire   ) to lemon to avocado to etc, etc.   
Hmm. Didn't realise until I typed it just how many crepes I ate in 48hrs.

Because a small amount of egg white and milk ingredients are used in making Quorn products, they are not appropriate for a vegan diet.

			I've read quite a few posts here and this is what I do. I always use screw top glass jars that 'spin' a couple times round and have a rubbery-ish seal on the underside of the lid--you can buy them for the express purpose of preserving and they are really quite inexpensive. Reusing a commercial pesto or pickle jar is okay-ish but I find they don't have enough screw/thread on them to reseal as tight as the jars mentioned above.   
1) Make the chutney, kim-shi pickle, dill pickles, jams, sloe gin etc 
2) Sterilise jars in a cool oven  130°c for 15-20mins 
3) Ladle hot contents into hot jars 
4) Immediately use a thick damp tea towel to screw lids on tightly when contents are still piping hot 
5) Allow the jars to cool and relax for 15mins or and then tighten until blue in the face 
6) Squirrel away hoard and open them up when matured with a satisfying *pop* of suction   
Preserves are my absolute favourite thing to do on a rainy day, all year round. My Mum used to do a fiddly, convoluted process which resembled nuclear fusion and disks of melted wax etc so it's a miracle I survived this 'era' and ditched it in favour of simplity, hygiene, full proof fun.

			I lived in Northern Thailand for a short while and most people there just bought the curry paste from the local market by weight.  I usually buy it here in those large plastic pots.  It keeps very well.   
I did a few days' cooking clases while there and one trick was to take a tin of coconut milk and leave it still overnight.  The thick creamy stuff floats to the top.  Then spoon this (about a third to half a tin) in your wok on as high a heat as possible, which separates out the coconut oil.   
No other oil needed.  Add the curry paste (not spread over the meat as above) and fry it until your eyes are running and the entire kitchen smells of spices and coconut.  Then add the rest of the stuff, using palm sugar to take the edge off if it's too hot.

			If you are planning on growing your own mint, don't plant too much.  It's quite voracious, almost like a weed.  Some people will keep it in pots in the ground rather than let it run free in a plot.

			Yes indeed; it's going to be an expensive move. I've already considered changing the guts of our two machines but, even that will result in some very expensive mods. So, I was thinking about a straight replacement. I'm seriously considering a second-hand espresso machine and grinder. Is there anything like Craigs List over there?

			Your translation is correct GG.  
In French it's called: Confiture Couille du Pape (for the jelly) and Confit (for the figs in sirop, stuffed with almond paste, walnuts, orange peel and rhum) 
Due to this legend, figs have had this ""alternative"" name since the late Middle Ages around Lyon. 
I believe it's served with goat's cheese ?

OK, so they don't accept credit-cards. But if you know somebody else in Zurich, he or she can order there in-person. 
Or talk to them. Maybe somebody there has a paypal account.

For those who have not yet tasted it, rabbit tends to have a slightly ""gamey"" taste. Any good cassarole recipe will work well  with things like onion, garlic, carrots and potatoes added) and the addition of a dollap of red wine is a nice touch.   Add a pastry crust and you have a nice bunny pie.  
The stock is also good as a soup base, adding lots of fresh herbs. Mmmmmmm, nom, nom, memories of rabbit soup at a forest restaurant near Karlstejn..

If France, I always recommend the Côte de Ventoux, which is excellent and not expensive at all. The problem with Bordeaux wines generally is that they need a certain storage and a certain age.    
Excellent Swiss wines to be mentioned are the ""Schiterberger Himmelsleiterli"" available at Landolt at Brandschenkestrasse (Enge) or the Aigle Rouge or the Epesses Rouge. If the lady has some favour for Latin America, I might recommend the Malbec wines from Argentina.    
And then, there are heaps of Portuguese, Spanish and Italian wines

Peppermint Extract   
1/2 cup fresh chopped peppermint leaves  
1/2 cup vodka    
   Directions:   
To make an extract, combine the ingredients in a 1/2-pint Mason jar  and set aside to steep. Each recipe can be stored anywhere and should keep for up to a year.    
Fill container 1/2 full with vodka, add 1/2 cup fresh chopped  peppermint. Fill rest of way with water and let stand for 3 weeks.  Pour through strainer, cheesecloth, or coffee filter to remove solids.

Bagel dough is decent enough (I guess it's what they use to make their own bagels) but making the right size/thickness is tough.

			I have tried lots of recipes from the cooking websites you all gave me. 
I would like to try more. Any more ideas/websites?  
I found some other websites than the ones you all gave me but I would like more as I have a very demanding and gurmand family (the family I work for) and they always want new things! .  
They liked what I cooked until now! I'm happy about this and I don't want to let them down   so I have to keep trying new dishes  .  
Thank you!

			For the Americans out there, here's what's in our version of ""mixed spice"":   
Apple Pie Spice: Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cardamom 
Pumpkin Pie Spice:  Ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice   
(I'm reading the sides of the spice jars as I pack them along with the allspice and the ground cumin.)  I have been unable to find ground cumin in CH.  Everybody keeps pointing me to the ground coriander, which is not the same thing.

Because of the rich, melted cheese coating your tastebuds in fat, you need a sharp white to cut through this. Whatever you do, don't have something Californian....or heavily oaked....yuk!!! 
Having said all that, French Chablis with it's flinty taste, goes rather well with melted cheesey stuff.      "	Posts: 1,915	Join Date: Jan 2010	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 57 Times in 38 Posts	Thanked 1,619 Times in 685 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

Realised too that there was nothing like that around here when I arrived, my big idea was to start up a pie business and base myself somewhere around ZHB. Feel like becoming business partners?? I mean think of it, for chf5-7 what can you really buy as a quick snack ? Kepab, some crape from a bakery, baby pizza - just doesn't cut it! I reckon they'd go off over here.

Kentucky Fried Chicken Spice 
1 tablespoon thyme

Fish and seafood are   sensitive to cooking time; the best you can do to ensure a great dish is to be   attentive to whether the fish / seafood in question is ready to be taken out of the oven / pan.   
Regarding scallops, I usually give them a quick pass with a little olive oil, white wine, garlic, salt and pepper. You can add a little heavy cream at the end, but it is totally optional. Yummy!

			I've got an Atlas, same as this in the picture. It's more than adequate for any type of pasta you would like to make. You can even make spring roll wrappers with it. It comes with a couple of accessories, circle cutter and can't remember what elses. It also has the screw clamp, I think all hand rolling ones will.       
The Imperia seems to be considered the classic machine, but for all intents and purposes, I can't see any major difference, the price maybe ?           
They have electric ones as well.       
I don't remember what I paid for mine here, but it was minimal I felt,,, consider it an investment anyway, they are fun to use, esp with children ( well, that may be subjective of course).

			The Montgomery family started making Cheddar 70 years ago.   
Lynher Dairies, who produce Yarg, only acquired the recipe in 1984.   
Ticklemore, who make Beenleigh Blue, started in the 1970s.   
Perl Las is, I think, even younger.   
So, as Grumpy indicated, there simply hasn't been much time for news of the British cheese renaissance to spread and for a reputation to be built.

			You can get proper almond essence at the expat shop online:     
They also do good quality vanilla essence, and lemon extract. I've not seen coconut though.   
For vanilla though you can buy in the coop sachets of ""bourbon vanilla"" - it's a kind of sticky liquid essence - much better than the little vials anyway and gives a proper vanilla taste. They also do vanilla pods in our coop if you want the real thing.

And their high cocoa stuff of course is top stuff for general consumption.    
B) What I said about chocolate also is valid in case of cheese. And the producers of the Emmentaler cheese send their grade-A produce to Britain at cross-subisdized prices, in order to meet the competition of the sort of cheddar which is very similar to the Emmentaler and far cheaper   
C)  you can find such practices also elsewhere in the world.

Also, the first weekend of Sept is the annual British cheese festival in Cardiff, plenty of workshops and some of the most famous names in cheese-making are on hand to ply with questions.

Today, Branston Pickle is still made to the same secret recipe and by the same traditional methods, blended to perfection for that unmistakable kick. The essence of Branston is its 'tang' which brings food to life through a unique combination of tanginess, sweetness, crunchiness and spiciness. It's this tang that gives the brand a host of famous fans including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Naomi Campbell.""

			So far so good. Not only have I made it through the night without stomach pains or needing to run to the loo, but there is a box of Scottish Tablet in the Kitchen which looks and tastes great.  I also have a box of golden crumbs which I can use to sprinkle on ice cream for that caramelita effect.   
It was Nestle Sweetened Condensed Milk, but I think it's being laid down to mature for some (ahem) years in a warm cupboard has turned it into something more like the cooked variety.   
After all your encouragement I figured as it it was canned it would be OK, especially as it was going to be boiled at about 115 degrees C for some time.   
Next time I'm in Migros I'll look for some of the local stuff rather than having to live off the old UK rations..

3076	Food and drink	Looking for beetroot soup recipe	Bobby.Buchi	2084	8	Location: Menzingen	31.10.2010, 16:25	" 
			
			well, traditional Borscht is not creamed and it contains shredded cabbage and is made with cubes of beef. Creamed (wizzed in a blender) is somewhat westernised version of this wonderful Ukrainian soup. I cook various versions of beetroot soup, depending on my mood and what is in a fridge. The easiest way is to use already cooked and vacuum packed ready to eat beetroot. If you are using fresh raw beetroot you will get better colour and flavour. Also, added bonus if you use green leafy portion of beetroot.   
To cook soup with ready to eat beetroot start by sautéing onion, garlic, grated carrots (on a bigger size grater), some celery and bay leaves in olive oil. Once it soft add couple of tables spoon of tomato paste, stir it well let it sweat for a few minutes. Pour over beef/veggie stock, bring it to boil add cubed raw potatoes and cook for 10-15 min. until potatoes soft. Add grated (on a bigger size grater) beetroot, stir well. add more stock if needed. Add chopped parsley and garlic. Serve with sour cream or fraiche cream. Serious borscht lovers like to eat their borscht with rye bread spread with very strong mustard. And a touch of tabasco as well.   
hope this helps.

3077	Food and drink	Looking for mince pie trays and turkey baster	Dan of the dead	1319	3	Location: Adlikon ZH	31.10.2010, 15:50	"    Yes, the mini muffin pan is 2cm deep, the regular-sized one is 3.3cm deep.    
I have a shallow pan in my private collection, but prefer to use these deeper ones as you can get more mince into the pies. Perhaps have a look in the Manor kitchen department, or swing by my place at Kreuzplatz  (after placing an order and upon appointment, please).

			Right, 150g butter, 250g sugar, Slammer uses, wait for it:   
Brown sugar, from sugar cane!   
Heat the butter and brown sugar in a pot, add anything schoggilatty you can find, in this case Nesquick chocolate drink,  a half eaten bar of black chocolate and a half glass of Nutella. 
Two spoonfuls of Treacle as the secret Slammer ingredient. 
Bring slowly to the bubble while cackling inanely. (very important!) 
When the brown sugar has bubbled itself into oblivion, off the stove with the pot and let it cool. 
Meanwhile the mixer has been bashing the crap out of four eggs and into this we add five heaped spoonfuls of flower, two sachets of Backpulver a sachet of vanilla extract and a beaker of yoghurt. 
Now slowly pour the Schoggi-gloop into the mixer and let it boogie for a while. 
Pre-heat the oven to 180-200 degrees and grease up your baking tin. 
When in the tin sprinkle a few nutty things on top and pop in the oven for 40 minutes until a knitting needle comes out clean.   
Serve to your worst enemies and watch them slowly die by chocolate.   
The sauce is a PhotoShop flavored cream.  "	null	null	null	null	null	null
3086	Food and drink	Rhubarb	PTKate	5132	61	Location: St Cergue, canton Vaud, CH	19.05.2008, 15:56	" 
			
			I'm a huge fan of simple, easy but good recipes, here are two tried and true favorites of mine for rhubarb.   
Nancy's rhubarb and yoghurt fool.     
Serves 8:   
Refreshing, simple and yet, a glamorous dessert.   
500g prepared rhubarb   
30g butter   
120g castor sugar (normal sugar is fine)   
1 carton (200g) of plain yoghurt   
         -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o   
300ml cream  
30g castor sugar   
dark chocolate flakes or crystallised ginger to garnish   
Cut the rhubarb into small pieces. Put into an oven proof dish, cover and cook at 150°C for 45 minutes.  Stir in the butter and 120g castor sugar. Purèe in a blender or put through a fine sieve.   
Beat the yoghurt and cream with 30g of castor sugar until slightly thicker than the rhubarb purèe. Mix all together gently.  Pour into dessert glasses (if you have them) and chill. Decorate with grated chocolate or finely-chopped crystallised (candied) ginger.       
Got this recipe many many moons ago from my Aussie buddy Suzanne (cheers Suz).   
Rhubarb Champagne   
1 kilo rhubarb - roughly chopped   
3 lemons - sliced   
3 cups sugar   
4 1/2 litres water (mustn't be hot but helps to dissolve the sugar to mix)   
1 Tblsp white vinegar (cider vinegar is ideal)   
Mix together and let stand somewhere out of the way, (not in the fridge) for 2 days, I always like to cover it with a muslin cloth, in case of those creatures...   
Strain, bottle and seal. Plastic mineral bottles are perfect for this.   
Ready in two weeks.....   
This is not a syrup, but a wonderfully refreshing bubbly drink (non-alcoholic), lovely chilled, in summer.   
Ros   
P.S. It also freezes perfectly when cut up into the desired piece size, put in a bag (suck out all the air if you don't have a vacuum packer) and pop it into the freezer till you want it. It's often advocated to add 1 part sugar to 4-5 parts   rhubarb, but I've found packing without equally successful.   
P.P.S Look after your rhubarb plant, pulling the stalks away from the crown at ground level as opposed to   the stalks off (can lead to rotting of the crown) will mean you can have many years of delight from this great plant.

It's annoying that someone like Clarkson, who would never appreciate it, gets to try food like that.   
There's a great introduction to Jeffrey Steingarten's first collection where he writes about getting the job as food correspondent for Vogue.  He was a keen diner and cook but thought it was his duty to eliminate his food dislikes.  He decided to find the best possible versions of those foods and see if he liked those and work from there.  Lo . . . he learned to like tofu and a few other things, but was still working on insects.   
I'm still working on licorice.

			Hi,   
I just used the last of the tipo 00 flour we brought back from Italy to make focaccia - which came out pretty well. I also had pleasing results with making pizza dough.   
Has anyone found a supply in Zürich perchance? I had a Google around already and came up with this place in Schlieren -   - that apparently has it.   
Has anyone found something in town? Our local Coop does not have it; and Jelmoli and Globus don't like to publicise their product line online it seems.    
I will report back if I find something else first.   
OK, found it:   - thanks Gastro Gnome.

			@Richdog: What exactly did you expect from an Ethiopian restaurant? Did you do any research prior to your dinner?   
'Abyssinia' is not perfect but very authentic including the sour Injera made from Teff flour (if available, unfortunately not always), the bony stews and, well, the slow service.

3128	Food and drink	Whisky tasting in Zurich - 4 November 2010	ali_the_nomad	1427	0	Location: Zurich	07.10.2010, 23:02	" 
			
			Just to let all whisky fans out there know that if you can't wait until December for your annual single malt whisky ship splurge, there is one being organised by the shop at Neumarkt 27 (the Gottfried Keller Haus).        
This is filling up (14 from 40 places gone as of yesterday, and it's not yet been advertised) so sign up quick if you want to go. CHF80 for I think 6 good size samples. (I am in no way affiliated with this shop besides a desire to keep it in forever in business.)    
I've just created a post rather than putting this in the calendar, as I'm not organising it, I'm unlikely to go (busy busy busy) and by the time anyone sees the entry the places will all be gone.   
Also, the shop is a great place to go if you want to try several excellent whiskies before buying.   
Cheers, Ali

3129	Food and drink	Zurich - looking for fancy crystal whisky glasses	ali_the_nomad	3500	10	Location: Zurich	04.10.2010, 14:21	" 
			
			Thanks everyone for your suggestions.  In case anyone else is looking for whisky glasses in the future, here's what I found out.   
Riedel was the only place I found which has the proper heavy good looking crystal  glasses - quite pricey though.  They had some other whisky tumblers which are okay, not quite so pretty and not quite so pricey. 
If you're ever thinking of going there, go well in advance of the date you need them for - they had only one each of my first two choices in the shop and it takes 4 weeks to order more.   
The Meister on Augustinerstrasse has whisky tumblers too, but none that are that great, except some VERY expensive ones.   
Jelmoli no longer sell any glasses/crockery at all, shame as that box set looks like just what I was after.   
Globus and Manor have a very limited selection and nothing you would call a good whisky tumbler.   
Villeroy and Boch (thank you Treverus) have some simple but pretty ones.   
I couldn't work out which was the whisky shop located somewhere between Fraumünster and the Rudolf Brun Brücke, but I did spend a very pleasant 45 minutes getting my own private whisky tasting at the shop at Neumarkt 27 (the Gottfried Keller Haus).  They have about 20 open bottles that you can taste and the very nice lady let me try quite a few of them including an excellent bottle which is now sitting on my shelf.  If you are interested, there is a whisky tasting on 4 Nov which is filling up (14 from 40 places gone as of yesterday, and it's not yet been advertised) so sign up quick if you want to go.  CHF80 for I think 6 good size samples.  (I am in no way affiliated with this shop besides a desire to keep it forever in business.)  They don't sell whisky tumblers though.         
Other important findings are that the Barokoko on Pelikanstrasse has some delightful antique beer/schnaps/etc (but not whisky) glasses that are not toooo pricey, was rather taken by some lovely beer mugs from a pub in Nidwalden from around 1900.  The Echo artdeco shop on Talacker has some old glasses too, unfortunately did not have time to see them all as they're kept in another building.   
And finally, I discovered that proper whisky buffs do not do tumblers.  They do nosing glasses of some description, a la les whisky-ships.  You live and learn.     
Cheers everyone, and happy drinking.    
Hic.

3158	Food and drink	Spaghetti Squash	Ingrid.B	5192	28	Location: Gland	13.09.2010, 21:00	" 
			
			Spaghetti squash is very easy to find in Swiss romande if you know your way around the farm markets, etc.    
In this area of la cote, these places have them:   
Farm in Eysins, woman is from Canada (Quebec) and has the most variety of pumpkins I have ever found in Switzerland--spaghetti, butternut, acorn, jack-o-lanterns, and some other varieties that I didn't even know existed as well.   
Farm market in Nyon on Saturday, there are a number of stands that have it.   
The Signy Centre Coop has it from time to time.   
Some other local farms with farm stands I have also seen it.   
And there is something called 'Fete de la Courge', or something similar, ie. Pumpkin Festival, just outside of St. Prex in autumn, and it is pumpkin heaven. Every pumpkin you want, you will find. You can also make contact with the farmers and growers directly, to ensure your supply for the season.   
Edited to add--I also assume someone must sell it at the Sunday Divonne market, just over the border in France, as they have everything there, although I have not personally purchased it there.

			I use Ruch Mehl, or Halbweiss Mehl. 
and Boiling water   
Be careful when you add your water, NOT too much, and the dough should be quite elastic, and smooth.  The trick is when you add the water, and the final dough consistency.   
Adding a bit of butter, and a 1/2 tsp of baking powder, can help to get a better chapati.   
Good luck!

			Tom;   
You are quite correct, technically. My sincere apologies.   
FRATELLI LONGOBARDI, location Scafati, Italia, technically uses sucrose as an acidity prevention or balance additive in all Pomodoro Pulpa (Diced) and Pelati (Peeled) products.    
This is a sweetener, if you will, and not actually sugar. My wife and I learned this in a cooking class in Lago Di Como, Lombardia. Think about it: The canned tomato product would become very acid ( as experienced in some very unspeakable American restaurants ) if they did not add sucrose, as does Lombardi, and Barrilla.   
Ergo the sweetness.

The flour will help thicken the sauce and of course cook for ages on gentle heat.

You can try  @ Wiedikon. I've seen xo sauce, char siew sauce and some other 'lee jing ji' sauce etc.. but can't remember if they have laksa sauce.    
If you r craving badly for laksa, just pop by  (malaysian restaurant). It's run by a malaysian couple. The lady boss is very nice and food are pretty authentic. If you can't find what you crave on their menu, just ask the lady boss, she can do some magic!    
Hope u can ease your craving soon!

			Hi every one! 
If you are still looking for yuzu trees, please have a look at the following websites: 
-  
-  
-  
-    
I have ordered from them and already planted a small yuzu in my garden at the lake side near Geneva this spring! 
At Baches, the citrus are grafted on poncirus trifoliata which enhance further the hardiness and allows to get fruits earlier (from seeds, you can wait until 15 years for the 1st fruit...). Citrusbali has grafted my second yuzu tree on fyling dragon, which shall keep the tree smaller 
There are many other frost hardy citrus that can be eaten; I have also in the ground the Ichang Lemon, soon the Segentrange hybrid US 119 (sweet like a mediterranean orange), Satsuma Owari (Japanese mandarin seedless) and Changsha Mandarin (old Chinese cultivar), that's a fiew of them and hope to have fruits next year! All those citrus are said to be frost hardy until -10C. Would love to compare my experiences with other frost hardy citrus grower in Switzerland! 
Greeting from Geneva 
Gerd

It seems pretty popular as the line is quite long if I lose track of time and wind up at the shop at lunch time.

It can be boiled or steamed just like broccoli or cauliflower...you can cook the entire head in boiling, well-salted water for about 15 minutes, let it cool, then detach the little florets, and sauté them in some butter... Migros and Coop will carry this vegetable (probably a bit later in the year), but they are better when purchased fresh at the market...

3213	Food and drink	Coffee roaster near Nyon, Morges?	LearningAlways	1068	0	Location: near Lausanne	26.08.2010, 09:33	" 
			
			So we all bring our coffee tastes and preferences with us, and my husband will bring me some Peet's when he comes back from the States in a few weeks, but in the meantime, I am desperate.   
I've searched this forum and googled ""torrefaction"", which I think is the right term when looking for fresh roasted coffee beans. Nothing shows up between Geneva and Lausanne. Thanks to this list, I've driven to a place on Avenue de Chailly on the east side of Lausanne and bought ""Pappy John's"" coffee there - it's fine, not great, but a long schlep. I've ordered online but have not been very happy with the results.   
Is there really no place in Nyon or Gland or Morges, for example, that sells freshly roasted coffee beans? I want to buy the beans and have them ground there, then brew at home.   
Thanks for any ideas!

3219	Food and drink	paella help	grynch	3367	48	Location: Geneva/Vaud	17.08.2010, 15:07	   Get some good over the counter chorizo and paprika, rip up the chorizo in to the pan, (big paella pan, or wok like thing) plenty of GOOD olive oil on a medium to low heat, (you don't want to fry it). Spanish onion diced as finely as possible, in it goes, garlic, pressed then diced, in it goes, Thyme, plenty of it and also some paprika, and mix it all up.     Boil water with chicken stock, (not to much remember this will make it really salty if you put too much stock in) The 'marigold' veg or chicken stock is the best. About a litre of water+ stock add it to the wok then pour in your paella rice, (the Spanish do it in the shape of a cross). Add plenty of paprika now, to get that red colour.     Now I usually put chicken and king prawns in mine, prepare the chicken at the same time as the above method, breast meat is easier to dice and chuck in but I have found chicken thighs with bones chucked in can give the richer flavour. Leave the addition of the prawns till later, you don't want tough overly cooked meat. You can (and probably should) add muscles (they must be prepared carefully and added close to the end of cooking.)     Peas can be added and I think it is nice to serve with crusty bread and a sliced Spanish orange.

3233	Food and drink	Calories counting	Nil	10435	190	Location: Basel	12.07.2010, 10:51	"    Agree - I hate doing exercise for the sake of exercise. I would rather do a sport where you also have support from team members. It doesn't have to be at an elite level.       I would add that you should try to eat soon after exercise.    
In the example of blood sugar regulation Economisto mentions, exercise really increases your insulin sensitivity. So if you are going to eat carbs, do it then as you'll get more sugar being stored as glycogen (quick release energy). This has two immediate benefits: 1) less excess carb being transfered to fat; and, 2) you'll feel more energetic as a result (remember that old saying that doing exercise gives you energy?).   
This meal needs to be within 15-60 minutes post exercise (ideally within 45 minutes), so you should have it ready in advance.    
However, don't overburden your meal with carbs, you should include a good load of protein to help build/repair muscle.

			You get Black Pasta; so why not rice?     Black Pasta  Add to the  , besides normal ingredients, one cuttlefish' ink for each 3 oz. of flour and some water. 
Ink, commonly called sepia, is taken from little bladders that are in mollusk internal sacs. 
We'll obtain a grayish pasta and not a very black one, because eggs weaken much the sepia coloring power. 
Black pasta is mainly used to prepare fettuccine or pappardelle to be served with sea sauces (cuttlefish, squids, calamaries and mollusks)

Here we accept accidents can and do, happen, we also take a sense of responsibility. Providing the accident was not due to blatent negligence, it's treated as an accident and compèensation is limited to a reasonable amount. By getting a minor burn from hot coffee, doesn't give you an automatic right to sip pina coladas for the rest of your life doing nothing. As for ""physcological damage"", this is pure fantasy, but difficult to prove otherwise.   
To take the well known example, we can all sue MacDonnalds as we're too stupid to work out that the coffee maybe hot. It's the consumer who keeps MacDonnalds in business and it's MacDonnalds who pays out to individuals, so each article purchased from Macdonnalds, a certain percentage goes to paying out spurrious law suits.    
Bottom line is, your hamburger costs more than it should as some idiot judge rules in favour of a claimant who so say, is too stupid to realise coffee maybe hot but not stupid enough to find an lawyer and sue !

Works best with fresh fruit, yogurt and real cream.

The marmalade version may actually work if you use a chilli chutney.  
(I wouldn't use any olive oil though with the chutney.)   "	Posts: 625	Join Date: Dec 2005	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 734 Times in 257 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

6 dl dark Balsamic vinegar, 600 g elderberries, 300g sugar, 1 cinnamon stick, all spice, cloves   
Heat the sugar and the vinegar, add cinnamon, all spice an cloves (my mother puts the spices into a tea egg), let it simmer for five minutes, let it cool, remove the tea egg, and strain the vinegar

			Ok this is what I found and is the recipe for a basic (vanilla) muffin 
It makes 10-11 standard size muffins:     Ingredients:   10 oz (280 gr) plain flour *   2 teaspoons (10 ml) baking powder   ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) bicarbonate of soda   ¼ teaspoon (1.2 ml) salt   1 egg   3-5 oz (85-140 g) fine white granulated sugar or light brown soft sugar   4 fl oz (120 ml) plain yogurt   5 fl oz (150 ml) milk (adjust if necessary to give a good dropping consistency-not too thick, not too thin)   3 fl oz (90 ml) vegetable oil   1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla essence   Methods:   1 Prepare muffin tins with liners or grease. Preheat oven to 375-400 F (190-200 C) for a conventional oven, Gas Mark 5-6   2 In a large bowl sift together flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt   3 In a separate bowl, beat egg with fork. Stir in sugar, yogurt, milk, oil and vanilla   4 Scrape all liquid mixture into dry. Using a metal spoon, stir lightly until evenly combined, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as you stir. This mixture should take only about 30 seconds. Batter should have good dropping consistency. (do not mind lumps)   5 Fill muffin cups three quarters full and bake for about 20 minutes     (Taken out of Muffins by Susan Reimer)  "	Posts: 780	Join Date: Oct 2009	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 21 Times in 13 Posts	Thanked 901 Times in 322 Posts	a reputation beyond repute
3297	Food and drink	Zucchini flowers	edot	1466	10	Location: Winterthur	05.07.2010, 10:15	"    Mostly dumb luck, I think, a lot of sun and some nicely drained pots. I had some seeds - some were black forest variety, others were a mini type from the coop, I think. I started a few of them in a small pot with basic soil from the Landi. When they got to be about 4"" tall, I put them all into a 50 cm wide pot - I had about 8 plants. They were in a very sunny location. I think 4 -6 survived, and I have these massive plants with big leaves and flowers. I have both male and female flowers. The male flowers grow on the vine, the female ones  have a little zucchini attached. We're not letting them grow to be full zucchini since we only want the flowers. Last week, because there was a lot of crowding, I cut back some of the plants, and I still have a bunch of flowers popping up.    
The flowers are beautiful, very delicate. My absolute favorite way to make them is to saute them in a little butter, add a beaten egg, and maybe some ham or mild cheese. My husband was getting tired of the egg thing, however, hence my need for new recipes.

B)  What you however have to look for are the ""light"" versions. Which are either without or just with minimal amounts of sugar.    
C)  I personally however feel that many ""light"" drinks have the flavour of cat-piss      ..... I like to have wines and beers to be fairly strong and softdrinks tasty !

3302	Food and drink	Fast Food - what's your favourite? What would you like to see in CH?	guest	17724	235	null	null	" 
			
			Very easy: Döner Kebab! I know there is a shop at pretty much any corner of Zurich pretending to sell it... but I have seen a funny program on the German TV lately: The control of the ""Ordnungsamt"" was checking restaurants in Berlin for cleanliness, alcohol licenses and other rules and there I learned: the **** they serve here would be illegal in Germany!  
In order to call it Döner Kebab in my home, it has to be meat, stacked in layers on a grill. Minced meat is only acceptable if it is a minor ingredient, less than 20%. Here it is 100% and comes usually not directly from the grill, but some box where the cut minced meat is kept luke-warm. This does not only taste ******, it must be the best breeding ground for bacteria ever invented... and do not get me started that they want 10 CHFs for that.   
So: A Kebab made out of proper meat which is grilled on a flaming gas grill and comes directly from the stick... with fresh salad, onions and spices topped with a good yogurt sauce.   
P.S: If you really believe you have found that place in ZH, please share!

3308	Food and drink	Pass the PORK	RanjitMusic	2711	25	Location: Zurich	28.05.2010, 14:41	"    Yes, these are lovely, they sell them here in Vaud in every shop.    
The only little problem is, as you said, be careful boiling them, especially those fillled with cabagge. Once they exploded in my pot, their guts all inside out, they looked like fleece socks. They can be over smoked at times, too.

I have tried traditional Swiss restaurants 3 times and I tried to order kind of creative dishes. It was good, I think, but just that they killed it with salt.   
Swiss need to learn how to cook, among other things       They are meant for eating?!

			I've never seen Zweifel products in the US (or actually, outside of CH/DE). 
Same goes for Movenpick and Orelmann's.   
Lindt DOES have stores in the US, but of varying stocks.  The one in Chicago is pretty good, but that's a trip from Arizona.   
My sister was excited to see Emmi products at her local supermarket.  She hasn't been to visit yet, but thinks Bircher Muesli is the best thing since sliced bread.  You might be able to get it around you - I'm pretty sure Safeway has some sort of local branch in Arizona (in Chicago it's Dominick's.).   
For substitution, I'd try Pringles in place of Zweifel.  There are a few other 'potato powder' pressed chips out there, Pringles just being the most prevalent.  They're not as good, but could do in a pinch.   
I'd also hit up your local dairy or ice cream shop - not something like Coldstone, but a local, homemade ice cream.  In Chicago, we have Oberweiss and a few others - and I think they're right on par with Movenpick.   
Good luck!

			Are there people in Lausanne and around who like to cook --- everything, meaning from good French to good Thai and beyond -- and then to eat it together --  on relatively high amateurish level? I like to cook, and I enjoy learning how to cook better. I peruse internet and tons of my cookbooks, but to cook together or just potluck and try each other favorites is fun.    
Anyone around thinks along the same lines? Would love to hear from you!

Of course, the cost depends on how many coffees you drink in a day - but if you drink lots, you may need a big machine anyway, running in the 1000.- chf and more.

For CHF 75 you get an apero (nice gingery thing), a salad, all you can eat main and then a dessert and digestif.   
The main deal here is the meat, in particular the excellent Argentinian beef.  I enjoyed a sausage and some well done ribs (full of flavour, falling off the bone), but enjoyed the rare sirloin most.  This is the first time I've had properly rare beef in Zürich.  The only slight niggle was that they ran out of chimichurri and we had to concoct our own hot sauce using tabasco and the innocuous red paste on the table.  The digestif involved Fernet Branca, which I understand cures all.

3362	Food and drink	Metal Water Bottles	esto	3462	22	Location: Bern, baby, Bern	21.05.2010, 15:14	" 
			
			I second the use of metal bottles, I wouldn't use extra acidic drinks in them if they are aluminum, though. SIGG was not ahead of the game at all, the bottles were great, trendy and all, but as said, did contain  lining inside. It was the Canadian gov that banned import and sale of these bottles first, that made SIGG rid of the lining, and only a year or so ago, which was quite late. Other govs put pressure later on, too.    
The plastic bottles leak, especially if washed or ""sterilized"" as somebody put it by hot water. Same goes for plastic BPA baby bottles, they are especially dangerous if the milk in it is hot or people wash them in the dishwasher on hot cycle. The hard plastic sport blueish bottles, that are meant for re-using, unless they clearly say they are BPA free, always contain plastic softener agents. Same goes for unsafe plastic containers that get shoved in microwave ovens.    
We replaced all our tupper wear and plastic tubs and kid plastic things with BPA free stuff, glass or metals. It only makes sense, it is cheaper, too. I grew up mostly without disposable crap, cotton, linen, glass and metal, so it is nice to somewhat go back in time, plus it's more esthetic. Plastic is cheap and ugly.

			Didn't know about that one Gastro Gnome! Very similar menu to Lao Chengdu near where I live, but with more choices. Not sure why, but I'm addicted to the ""shui zhu rou/yu"" dishes - probably because I just feel it's cool to eat something so weird. Your restaurant recommedation has a few different ones whereas mine only has beef.   
There's no real limit on bringing cooked food back into Switzerland is there? I brought crispy pork and roast duck back last time;this time I might bring from one of the above places.

			I stand by what I orginally said. I should have got a Thanks rather than a groan for mz MacDonalds recommendation as a substitute:   
Here's the breakdown:          Calories total 
Fat 3g 
Sugar 35g 
Protein 10g 
Salt 220mg          Calories total 
Fat 6g 
Sugar 34g 
Protein 5g 
Salt 300g   
So, if the OP, who let's face it, did say she was desperate, had a MacDonalds shake and a multi-vitamin pill, she'd effectively be having the same as a Slim fast shake but at probably quarter the price.

			I moved to Switzerland  , and am now studying German at level A1. I hope to be able to work full time next year if I have some reasonable level of fluency.   
During the times I'm not studying, I'm mostly cycling or running as well as being the   as my wife is working full time. Cooking has never been a strong point of mine, mainly due to laziness: I could rarely be arsed to cook just for myself, so I ate lots of (mostly healthy) takeaway or prepared foods (bottled M&S pasta sauces with pasta).   
Anyway, things have changed now, so I'm trying to build a collection of recipes, most of them simple. I thought it would be a good exercise for me to translate recipes from German to English, and whilst I'm at it, post any good ones here. Maybe others will also enjoy them.   
So here's one I cooked tonight, a great Spring dish with asparagus being in season right now.     
Für 4 Personen 
Zubereitung: ca. 35 Minuten   
300-400g  Rigatoni 
500g grüne Spargeln, gerüstet, schräg in 3-4cm  lange Stücke geschitten 
250g Cherrytomaten 
1 EL gehackter Oregano 
2 EL Butter 
1 Handvoll Rucola 
2 Kugeln Mozzarella, von  Hand halbiert 
schwarzer Pfeffer aus der Mühle 
Sbrinz AOC (or Parmesan),  gerieben, nach Belieben   
1) Rigatoni in  siedendem Salzwasser al dente kochen. Spargeln in den letzten 4-5  Minuten mitgaren. Alles sorgfältig abgiessen, abtropfen lassen. 
2) Tomaten, Oregano und Butter erhitzen, mit dem Rucola zu  den Rigatoni mischen. 
3) Rigatoni in einer vorgewärmten  Schlüssel oder vorgewärmten tiefen Tellern anrichten. Pro Person 1  Mozzarella-Hälfte drauflegen, grosszügig mit Pfeffer würzen. Nach  Belieben mit Sbrinz bestreuen.     Serves 4 
Cooking time: approximately 35 minutes   
300-400g rigatoni 
 500g green asparagus, prepared (spears removed), cut diagonally into  3-4cm pieces 
250g cherry tomatoes 
1 TBSP  chopped oregano 
 2 TBSP butter 
 1 handfull of rocket 
2 balls of mozzarella, halved by  hand 
freshly ground black pepper 
grated  Sbrinz (or parmesan) to your taste   
1)  Cook rigatoni in salted boiling water. Add the asparagus in the last 4-5  minutes. Carefully drain. 
 2) Heat up the tomato, oregano and butter. Mix with the rocket and then  the rigatoni. 
3) Serve the rigatoni in a warm bowl or  warm deep plate. For each person lay out half a ball of mozzarela,  generously seasoned with pepper. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese to your  taste.   
Bon app!

3396	Food and drink	White chocolate cake	sunflower76	1656	5	Location: Zug	02.05.2010, 13:54	" 
			
			Hello sunflower76, 
Like your husband, I am also a fan of white chocolate and have lots of recipes. If you go on to bbc.co.uk/goodfood, you will have access to thousands of fantastic recipes, just put into the search the recipe you would like to find. I also use google, once again put in the recipe you want to find and it will be there. 
 My family like 'white chocolate creme brulee', white chocolate cheesecake and if you want a quick fix that is a bit healthier, put some double cream into a pan, heat it up gently ( don't let it boil) when it's hot remove it from the heat, drop in some white chocolate and stir until it melts and then pour it over some summer fruits. You can make it a bit more of a dessert by crumbling some shortbread bicuits over it. 
PM me if you would like any more help with your recipes, I am a recipe junkie!

They don't pick up dust and fine grit and just push it around with their little stick. You need to make sure you have enough clearance through your dining table chair legs too. They unfortunately don't replace your regular vacuum cleaner that you still need to use weekly and on corners and stairs.

Sublime. Simple sublime.

3400	Food and drink	Vintage wine	TDM999	1369	17	Location: Bern	27.04.2010, 22:43	"    Not totally true as quality will determine the aging ability of a wine not the region.  As you said Merlot is the predominant variety in this regions which is not so long lived as Cabernet Sauvignon. Some St Emilion will age 40 years others will be over the hill at 5.        
He said it was Chassagne Montrachet not Chateau. Also the appellation laws do not allow red wine to be a blend of Chardonnay!! The only place that white wine is being blending with Chardonnay is in Champagne.    
There are red Chassagne-Montrachets but you are right the majority are white from Chardonnay.       Quite right but don't expect too much...

3407	Food and drink	Where to get burek in Geneva	Kaja	2228	10	Location: Geneva	22.12.2009, 18:53	" 
			
			Where I come from 'burek' is made with meat only, if it is filled with cheese (closest you can find here is cottage cheese) or vegetables (diced potatoes, courgettes or spinach) then it is not burek. But that is a moot point. I do not know of any place in Geneva that makes this kind of pastry and Turkish restaurants have something with a similar name that is not at all the same thing.    
What you can do is make it at home, larger Coops now stock the pastry made by Klas in their Balkan section. What I find more difficult is meat -- somehow the beef mince you can get here does not produce the desired effect. I think it is too lean.

			In the US, I had a pizza peel that I made the pizza on, and then shoved it into the hot oven and it slid onto the stone... most of the time. As I made the pizza, I kept shaking it to make sure it was loose.    
So here, I have two problems....   
1. Must buy new peel 
2. Old pizza stone is too large for Swiss oven. Sigh.    
One of my favorite toppings is based on something my Italian aunt used to make...   
caramelize onions, and then saute some swiss chard and mushrooms with garlic. Put lightly on the pizza (with a very light tomato base), add asiago cheese and bake. My aunt used to make a version with fairly thick crust, and lots of garlic and swiss chard.

			I assume any asian shop will sell it; it's usually in smallish tubes, helpfully stamped ""WASABI"" in big letters as it's almost some kind of universal word, and isn't too expensive.   
Check the sell-by dates on the box as, although I doubt it would ever go off, it loses its flavour.   
Keep it in the fridge.   
To back up rrs's point ...     
I assume the tubes of stuff I buy (and what is usually given on the side when you order sushi to mix with soy sauce) is the fake stuff.      That's actually great to know.  Can I place an order for some cocaine?

			I read  yesterday about an organization in Italy called   that features local Italian families who make traditional meals and open their homes to guests. The ""chefs"" take a training course and then host dinner parties. Non-Italians have to pay a membership fee of 3.50 euros and the dinners usually cost from 35-38 euros.    
As I usually find myself drooling over the pictures of the delicious looking food posted in the ""Food and Drink"" section of EF, I think that we need to open a branch of Home Food (international style) in Switzerland! We could call it ""Eat with an Expat"".     
I wasn't sure if I should post the info about Home Food in the Travel Section, but I thought that it would be more useful here since this is where the foodies hang out. It's time for a trip to Italy!

3436	Food and drink	Marked interest in food.	guest	689	0	null	null	" 
			
			The thread about the Master Chef series triggered a curiosity...    
For the ""foodies"" among us, was there a particular trigger that inspired a marked interest in food for you beyond simple consumption of fuel?     
When I was growing up, my sis was the one who helped mom in the kitchen the most often. My kitchen activities were almost exclusively devoted to the avoidance of doing dishes   and baking for special occasions.    
Meanwhile, once I began cooking for myself, I noticed that cooking things a certain way or substituting one ingredient for another tended to change how I felt after eating. The main one for me was that my mother always used red kidney beans for her chili and for some reason, I always had an intense pressure in my chest after eating Mom's chili. I remember crying to her about how I felt and her not believing me.   I use pinto beans for my chili and never have a problem. I wonder what the difference is?     
The other trigger for me was based actually on selfishness combined with a desire to eat ""healthier""... My friend and roommate allowed the younger sister of another friend to come stay with us when she was having some hard times. Neither the friend nor the sister could be bothered to buy anything but the most generic of groceries BUT always happily made use of the more expensive things I would buy.   
So, as I was already overweight anyhow, I decided it was a good time to go on a diet.   I started buying ""fat free"" items including organic cookies using carob instead of chocolate chips, skim milk, skinless chicken, rice instead of pasta, etc etc. I started cooking with the intent of having as little fat as possible... miraculously, people stopped eating my food.    
That time spent though, trying to find recipes that tasted good AND had low fat content was what inspired my curiosity for cooking. Of course now my food goes both ways... some (relatively) healthy food for daily cooking but some very rich dishes and desserts for special occasions.

While my cheesecake recipes do generally use Philly, I'd say to go with the ingredient list you give, you'd have to do a lot of switching in and out of ingredients if you use it for that recipe.   
I'd also agree that Ricotta sounds closest, I do know there are some cheesecake recipes calling for that - ricotta seems to be better here than the cottage cheese I've found, and the cottage cheese would need to be drained and smooshed.   
The gelatine is probably in there to help with the binding, particularly if using whites only instead of a whole egg along with the yogurt (very soft / soupy compared to cream cheese) and the curd cheese.    
I'd say from the ingredient list, it sounds like a low-cholesterol cheesecake?

It's in German - so if you're not interested in a book in this language, read no further ....    
It's a fabulous, independent book from the ""makers"" of   - a German language food blog - and includes ""authentic"" recipes from all over Switzerland. ""Authentic"" meaning, what one actually eats today in these areas. An example from Basle is, for instance, is from the St. Johann neighbourhood and is a receipe involving tabbouleh, hummus and malawah.    
There are recipes for Korean aubergine salad, lemon risotto, lamb with chestnut and fig sauce, trout with radish sauce, lentil salad with avacado and rucola - in short, very creative dishes and desserts.   
The book also includes portraits of the users who submitted the recipes, so you'll get a glimpse of real people living in Switzerland today.

			The reason for the ""no homefreezing"" warning is that your ""fresh"" seafood was  
almost certainly frozen at some point in its travels here.   
It's fine that your food was frozen, thawed, , and refrozen.    
If it had been frozen, thawed, incubated (i.e. ""fresh"" when bought), refrozen,  
rethawed, and eaten, that would have been a whole different kettle of pathogens.

3488	Food and drink	The Wine Bore Thread - Extended	Aquanexus	786	0	Location: Zurich	19.03.2010, 10:21	" 
			
			Hi all,   
It's nice to see such enthusiasm on the wine bore thread. Before moving to Switzerland I'd been working at the Experimental Winery and regularly assisting with an 'Introduction to Wine' course at Purdue University. If there's any interest I could collect some of my presentation materials from the course and we could meet weekly to have a course and tastings and the end of each presentation.   
There's been a lot of information from Planthead on what basic characteristics to expect from wine varietals, and while I think that's a great crib note for wine shopping there's so much more to the subtle aromas and characteristics of wine dependent on the 'terroir', production method, etc...   
I'd just like to drop a quick note, for complete wine nouveaus on the classification systems used for European wines, which might make a handy list when you go shopping for a gift, or even for an ejoyable evening at home. So here goes:   
Basically the tiered quality ranking system runs along the lines of: 
Table Wine 
Regional Wine 
Quality Tested Wines 
Highest Quality Tested, Compliance Guaranteed Wines   
Across the EU most nations conform to this tiered format with their own naming systems, here they are:    -- Wines designated AOC are of the highest  quality and have passed the tight regulations on grape growing and  controlling the alcohol content.  -- These are regulated in the same  way as the AOC wines, considered less quality and are beginning to be phased out of  the classification system.  -- These wines have 100% of  one type of grape grown from a specific region only and are strictly  regulated.  -- This ""table wine"" varies  in alcohol content and is of the lowest quality usually, for everyday  occasions.      -- Denotes the  highest quality Italian wines. DOCG measures insure that each bottle is  counted, providing an exact measure of production, and contains a  government seal that is applied by hand. It is a costly procedure,  usually reserved for expensive wines.   -- Wines that fall under the DOC category must be made in specified,  government defined zones, in accordance to particular regulations that  are intended to preserve the wine's character that is uniquely derived  from the country's individual regions.   -- Generally denotes ubiquitous tables wines grown in specific regions  throughout Italy.  --  Mainly comprised of Italian table wines, whose  criteria is only that they be made from grapes grown in Italy. These are  often made by blended grapes from separate regions.  --This status guarantees that  wines from an area have consistently performed at the highest quality  level for a number of years.  -- Wines  carrying the DO label must meet the approved government standards. It is this regulation which in part ensures the wines from each of  the regions within Spain maintain their unique local characteristics.  -- A  notch lower, but these wines must, in the same way as DO approved wines,  carry a vintage date and regional identification.  -- These wines  fall outside the DO system. They are  table wines that do not carry  vintage dates or regional identification. More often than not, they are a  blend of wines from many regions and vintages.  -- These wines   may carry a vintage date and the name of the area from which they  originate. These wines are typically made from grapes or blends of  grapes not approved by the local Consejo Regulador.  -- The  regulations are as QbA with the additions that the grapes have to be  solely from the district stated and no alcohol enrichments or  chaptalization have taken place.   -- These wines have to obey the regional appellation laws. These laws  ensure that the wine is from one  specific wine-growing region, is made of approved grape varieties and  reached sufficient ripeness for a quality wine.  -- Enhanced Tafelwein, which  has to be made with grapes from one of the 19 specific districts, which  is specified on the label. The wine has to be marked as ""Trocken"" (dry)  or ""Halbtrocken"" (medium-dry).  -- Denotes the lowest quality German wines, not many  are exported.   -- The wines must conform to the legal definition of  “Qualitätswein” (quality wine) and are selected by a process of rigorous  blind tasting to ensure a high wine quality.  -- “Certified” wine.  Prädikatswein wines are the highest quality Austrian wines and are  produced from specific grapes grown in a selected region.  -- Wine of quality.  These wines are light and simple, derived from less-ripened grapes grown  in a specific wine region.  -- Table wine. There are  two types of tafelwein wines: landwein and tafelwein.  wines are table wines that  are made from officially designated grape varieties.  wines are simply table wines.      --   The only classification of Portuguese wines. Each of the 39 DO wine  denominations require thorough testing and are given a certified test  number, which must be displayed on the bottle. DO Porto and Madeira each  have separate governing bodies and regulations.   
It's plenty of info I know, but I often tell people who have no knowledge of wines to start off by determining what taste/smell characteristics they like from their wines and then buy according to this ranking. Keep in mind that there are many poorer wine producers (esp. across Europe) who can't afford to get certified, but produce amazing wines themselves. This is just a starting point for the layman at the wine store. This is a little background on old world wines (French wines have their own Bible sized booklet), which are a good place  to start tasting. Many newcomers & prissy connosieurs find it  difficult/refuse to palate the New World wines with their bold earthy  tones (see, Malbec, Pinotage, etc...).   
As my boss always said (and he's dined with Kind Carlos & Jacques Chirac), he'd almost never spend more than $20 or 30€ on a bottle of wine. I've had a glass on Romanee Conti Premier Cru which was valued at about $1300 a bottle, I can tell you that the taste of the wine does not necessarily improve linearly (or exponentially as wine merchants would have you believe) with the price. Leave the winos to blow their own money, and be smart with yours.   
If you have any questions about wine I'd love to help, just feel free to ask here or shoot me a message. Please remember I've not worked long in the industry, so while I know how to make different wines, and how they are produced, I'm nowhere close to being even an amateur (au contraire, my wines often tasted like jet fuel/moonshine).   
P.S. Mods can feel free to combine this with the original thread, I just thought I'd put out an offer for a course, and that this was too long a post.

If the fish was already stale when they froze it, it would be the same once it's thawed...or maybe even worse. =.=

Nigel Slater, just being passionate about food is not enough for me to make me look at his recipes with anything more than passing interest. He's not doing anything that hasn't been done before or combine ingredients that used to be alien to each other. Let's agree to disagree on Nigel, shall we? he's still a very entertaining read...

			I'd also say it depends upon the dish...   
I prefer dark meat (drumstick + thigh) if I am having it in some way where the chicken flavor itself ""matters"". If we're talking a bucket from KFC, I'll have the thighs please!   
Just made some baked legs for din the other night and then the leftovers went into a pot this morning - lunch was quite delicious chicken and dumplings.      
On the other hand, if the chicken is merely the prop for some other fantastic flavor (peach salsa for example) AND is being prepared in a way to virtually guarantee that they won't dry out (   ), I like breast meat just fine.

Full of fruit and great with spicy food.  I had it with a meal of scallops, chopped bacon and leeks sauteed with ground ginger and cayenne. Not for scallop purists who go for minimal cooking and flavoring, but they are great as a spicy meal too.

3527	Food and drink	Ristorante da Gianni, 8045 Zurich [Italian]	Richdog	1459	0	Location: Zurich	25.02.2010, 11:00	" 
			
			Well, after going to a new Italian restaurant last night that opened just a stones throw away from me I felt compelled to give it a big shoutout. THe restaurant is:             
The place opened around a month or two ago but I never got around to going, as Mezzo is basically at the end of my road and my friend always goes there out of habit. Anyway, a colleague was buying dinner and liked Italian, so I remembered the new place and thought i'd give it a try.   
The layout is not the usual restaurant layout... it's essentially a thin strip of tables running parallel to a loooong bar, but is nicely decked out and tastefully modern. I think there's also a back-room eating area, but didn't really have a nose around.   
Anyway decor schmecor, onto the food. I opened the menu and immediately thought ""prices look decent"". 17-20 CHF for a ""regular"" topped pizza, ranging to a maximum of 26CHF for the ""fancy"" topped pizzas. I settled on a Calzone, while my friend settled on a Thonno.   
The Calzone arrived and I almost called the police, momentarily thinking it was the corpse of a small child, such was the size of the beast (it literally almost hung off the plate), drizzled in tomato sauce. Anyway to cut a short story shorter, the Calzone was possibly the best I have ever had... and certainly better than any pizza i've had in Mezzo. It was packed full of delicious topping (inning?), and the taste was simply sublime. I actually finished the beast, despite it being half my bodyweight.   
 My colleagues Thonno was also of a good size, and looked perfectly cooked. He also said it tasted amazing.   
In short, two amazing pizzas and two large cokes for 49 CHF. Awesome value for money in my opinion given the size and quality of the food we had.   
Five stars, highly reccommended.   "	Posts: 9,274	Join Date: Mar 2009	Forum Legend	Groaned at 529 Times in 401 Posts	Thanked 12,065 Times in 4,728 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Thanks about the tip tiny_tim, next time I'm in Montruex I will try Mata Kalimera (which sounds as stupid a name as they can get but anyway).    
To add some wisdom in this forum, there's one place that makes almost very good Greek souvlaki in Geneva, Souvlaki Fan (I was impressed by the originality of the name), close to Planpalais. It's next to Emilios Restaurant (they are both owned by the same person I think), which is not a bad place either but not of my taste. 
I can recommend Souvlaki Fan if you prefer the Greek version to kebab, but Emilios is the kind of a place I would never go to in Greece and a little bit overpriced.   
It's funny I discovered this thread today, as last night I made tzatziki, tuna-salad (my mom's personal recipe) and Greek salad, to accompany my Italian flatmate's moussaka.

			Actually we never use basil in the rolls (ie summer rolls- don't know who invented the names for our dishes  )  
I love the fresh rolls - you'll never feel full with that. And of course it's fun to make it yourself, very easy rather than pay for very expensive restaurant here

			The first thing to remember is the things that are inexpensive in your home country won't necessarily be cheap here.  This sounds obvious, but I've met quite a few people who are surprised when, e.g., their budget Mexican dish turns out to be expensive and difficult to source here.   
The second thing is to look for seasonal produce.  Both markets and supermarkets may have a glut and lower prices.   
Cut down on meat here, as it's very expensive compared to veg.

Ripasso - A brilliant concept for increasing the amount of flavor and interest in basic Valpolicella. The Valpolicella wine is passed over unpressed but drained must of an Amarone. The bittersweet intensity of the Amarone is imparted, in a small way, to the basic Valpolicella, possibly with the help of a minor secondary refermentation

3566	Food and drink	Zürich Tap Water with Chlorine until End of March 2010	carcharhinus	3882	12	Location: Greater Zürich Area	12.01.2010, 15:38	"    This has been discussed before on EF, but I'm curious -- what concern about fluoridation can you understand?  ? The insidious plot to impose a communist regime (up there with those other evils, childhood immunisation and mental health programs)? Ku Klux Klan loony  's assertion that fluoridation is a Jewish plot to weaken the white race?   
The main objection to fluoride is that fluorine is a poisonous gas. Indeed. And so is chlorine; it killed well over 1,000 soldiers in WWI when deployed by German (and Allied) forces. Salts of fluorine and chlorine present no such worries, though. Is anyone concerned about sodium chloride -- apart from the fear of hypertension? Why this concern over minute concentrations of fluorosilicilic acid in drinking water?   
The OP mentions that larger amounts of ground water than usual are currently present in Zurich's tap water. Some ground water in mountainous areas naturally contains fluoride ion concentrations of up to 50 mg/L ( ); the recommended rate of fluoridation of municipal drinking water is around 1 mg/L. Better stop drinking Zuri water, then, and turn to the bottle ... of expensive mineral water, that is. Oh ... except that bottled mineral water can contain naturally-occurring levels of fluoride well in excess of 1 mg/L.   
Apparently people in Switzerland eschew fluoridated water for the ""preferred"" solution of adding fluoride to their chloride intake -- via common table salt. Stronger teeth in exchange for increased rate of cerebral stroke and cardiovascular problems.

			Zyxel has provided an excellent list.  If you're vegetarian, it's all about combining foods carefully to provide ALL the essential amino acids, and to ensure absorption.  Even if you were a carnivore, eating nothing but steak every day would not provide the correct balance of protein.   
The best advice I can give you is to consult a nutritionist.  Eating correctly while adhering to a vegetarian lifestyle is not easy and requires a lot of knowledge, best sourced from someone who has a lot of it in the first place!

Olive Oil Source: Cooking with Olive Oil     
""Trans Fatty acids: Olive oil has no trans fatty acids.  When an oil 
is partially hydrogenated it can be in the cis or trans conformation 
which refers to which side of the fatty acid double bond the hydrogen 
is on. Olive oil is not a trans fatty acid because it has not been 
partially hydrogenated in a factory to make it solid at room 
temperature like margarine has.  Trans fat is created by bubbling 
hydrogen through 250 to 400 degree hot vegetable oil in the presence 
of a metal catalyst, usually nickel or platinum. The process can take 
several hours. You cannot accidentally make trans or saturated fatty 
acids at home on your range when heating olive oil or other oils.""

I got a big bottle of truffle oil as an xmas prezzie so any other suggestions as to how to use it would be great.

			Interesting. I've found two harissas here, the standard ""Cap bon"" brand at Globus Bellevue, and I tried my luck with another one I found there, a Moroccan one (Bleh, that one was spicy ketchup). I would recommend making your own but I have never seen the right peppers needed to make a good harissa (air dried, large, spicy!) 
But if I may point you to an article I wrote recently on another kind of ""harissa"", it may inspire you to get your cuisinart out! Good luck!      "	Posts: 553	Join Date: Sep 2008	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 16 Times in 12 Posts	Thanked 311 Times in 181 Posts	a reputation beyond repute
3588	Food and drink	how fast meat smell in your fridge	tititita	2374	20	Location: Basel	19.01.2010, 16:40	" 
			
			"" i keep the meat in my tote bag,but when i go to cook the meat 
all the time i notice the meat is little black on top and there is a light smell, 
i did buy some Carpaccio once at Migros,but then had it with me for over two hours with me in the tote and the same things happen. 
So i wonder is it the ridge or the Butcher, 
I guess i should put a thermometer in the fridge to see if it is coold enough 
the agency said they would replace when it break. 
Someone told me once in Switzerland a Kitchen have to last 40 years!  "" 
Meat is far different from poultry or fish when it comes to holding it. Most beef in the states, except in supermarkets with Fresh being in thier mottoe such as Meijers in Michigan, is aged atleast 16 days, and Chop Houses in Chicago and Montreal will age the beef for as long as 64 days. Coloration in beef is only a sign of the aging, well, of course it it looks like an oil spill on the highway this is something different. True, expensive quality cuts of beef are aged, and will have green coloration in them. Dark coloration is a sign of freshly cut meat coming in contact with oxygen, which is perfectly normal. Look at any beef jerky or the like, they are all dark in coloration. Smell unless held outside the danger zone, comes with age or oxygen contact. When you buy at the butcher, you should always inspect the product before you buy it. It won't ever magically turn on you from 1 hour to the next with out outside intervention; you perhaps. However, the way you described your transport, this shouldn't be causing it.  
Putting a thermomter in the fridge is a good way to make a fridge test. I don't know how often you are at home during the day, but on a day off, you plan on being at home, I suggest a little HAACP test. Every hour or so, check the inside of your fridge. Put that thermomter way in the back, away from when you opne the fridge

Speck und bratwurst?   
Give Switzerland a chance and enjoy a variety of lard, speck, ham, bacon other delicacies. As for sausages, they also have a waide variety that is nice to the palate and the purse.   
If you go to the country side, you will find even more delicacies and people will be abel to let you taste before you buy.

A lamb fillet is very expensive and has no fat. If you are just going to fry it, then it's the best. But for roasting or a curry then leg is the best.   
Look for frozen New Zealand or Australian lamb in big supermarkets or Muslim shops. It will take about 24 hours at least to thaw in the fridge. Unfrozen (fresh) lamb is very expensive!    
You might want to leave the preparation and cooking to a meat-eater, unless you really love the person it would be a grim job for you!

			The only edible salsa I've found so far is the Maria Dolores brand, sold at Globus in Basel.  Not fantastic like what you can get in California and pretty expensive, but definitely decent stuff.   
Globus Basel also has guacamole in the refrigerated section.  It's ok, especially if you add some chopped onions and a bit of lemon to freshen up the flavor.   
But beware the Globus store-brand salsas they just came out with:  while the Tortilla-Salsa Mojito is not bad (it's sweet though, so best for tex-mex dishes), what they call the regular Tortilla Salsa was inedible and tasted of pure vinegar -- I'd say it's way worse than the imported fake salsa from the US grocery stores (Old El Paso, etc.) that's pretty much ubiquitous at Swiss grocery stores.  It was more expensive than the Maria Dolores salsas and I put it straight into the trash after one taste.

			another hearty Swiss-style meal is bratwurst with onion gravy. Fry up a couple of veal or pork bratwurst, then remove from pan. In the same pan, brown several sliced onions for a few minutes, add some white wine, then water and the Bratensauce thing Ed mentioned. Simmer, add salt and pepper to taste, add bratwurst at the end. Serve with Maccaroni or Roesti and salad.

You don't really have to have top of the line expensive knives to cut things. I've been in a number of kitchens with sleek Wustofs that were so dull they would barely cut butter. No point in that! What's important is to have sharp knives.   
Get whatever knife set suits your aesthetic sense and your budget and spend a little on some sharpening equipment. I use stones, some like automatic sharpeners. Check Youtube for knife sharpening videos- it's not hard to do by hand.

			Migros in Sarnen has frozen ground chix. Any time that you want something not out, ask the meat manager to order it. Usually in 24 hours they can get it. Migros or COOP no longer have water chestnuts in small cans, as they once had. The Asian markets in Luzern do have them but in large cans (#8), not small. Maybe some Far East problem with them?? Plenty of small cans of bamboo shoots of the same brand.

Rangatiranui	4847	24	Location: Baden region	28.11.2009, 00:22	"    Thanks, it's from Louis Pasteur - I have it to counteract in my mind all the people who say 'Gosh, isn't it lucky that your husband got a job in Switzerland and you can all live out there!' Like it has nothing to do with years of study for his degree/Masters degree, his hard work for a decade afterwards and our willingness as a family to relocate hundreds of miles every 2-3 years to progress his career on and on to the point where he can pretty much pick a country.   
But yeah, sure, lucky, that's it.    
It's in my collection of interesting quotes that I plan to start Blu-tacking up around the house once the kids get old enough to start thinking and debating in interesting ways, along with ones like:     ""Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper.""         ""That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of our time""       And a special one for when they're teenagers:

This doesn't answer your question, as to be honest I've never thought about it as I speak French and have good enough ""tourist German"", but have a look at  .   
It gives you quite a good overview of the restaurants in Basel so you can sample the different ones.   
Ones where we've heard English being used a lot: Needless to say for quick food, staff at McDs, BK and Starbucks all speak English, and, as NotAllThere pointed out, have the somewhat frustrating/helpful habit (depending on your perspective) of switching to English as soon as they pick up your foreign twang...

I went back to Globus today, bought another chunk of Cheshire, a small peice of Shropshire, and some of the Lincolnshire Poacher.    
I also bought a peice of Montgomery's Cheddar, and it is very nice.

For Main course or starters you can consider :

or there are many many curries that can be served with rotis and rice, you can search here     
Dessert

You can try some Indian sweets (well you can't consider them in the Dessert category) such as Besan ke Ladoo

			The recent frigid weather in Switzerland created perfect conditions to produce ice winesa situation which does not occur every year. Swiss wine-makers produce some of the most remarkable ice wines when given the chancebut only with extraordinary dedication to their craft. This year's wines will begin to show up in late 2010 or 2011...just in case you want to remember this cold spell - and taste some excellent wine!   
We've posted a small bit about ice wine in our blog if you would like to read more:

3643	Food and drink	Sel or Demi-Sel?	LearningAlways	1479	5	Location: near Lausanne	17.12.2009, 23:33	"    I've shared this recipe with people in the past, and have no objection to sharing, but I've always let people watch me make a batch or two. The issue is that you cook the butter and sugar until it reaches a certain color, and I've never been successful trying to adapt it to using a candy thermometer. The color was described as a ""warm tan"" in the recipe I got from my aunt, but I like to think of it as ""golden oak."" It you cook it too long, it cracks your teeth. Not long enough and it isn't properly crunchy.   
The other caveat: measurements are in cups and pounds/ounces.   
But PM me if you want to experiment with it.

			Here's a recommendation for a delicious white wine that I had at Kreis 6 restaurant - it's called Basa.  It has a fresh grapefruit taste, and a non-drinker at our table could even smell the aroma of grapefruit.  That might sound excessive or non-appealing, but it has enjoyable clean flavor and hit the spot.   
Kreis 6 also serves delicious food.  Note to fellow non-smokers - it's a completely smoking restaurant, although well-ventilated on the evening that I was there anyway, so no complaints.

and also hit this page from the present-day Duttweiler Institute     
which includes statements like - 
""According to Carbonaro, the last act in the odyssey of consumption has begun: the return of Ulysses to Ithaca. Just like Ulysses after his endless wanderings, today's consumers have a profound longing for authenticity, which, after many deceptions, disappointments and fleeting seductions, means ""home"" to them. This longing, Carbonaro claims, is not a short-term trend, but an expression of socio-cultural change.""   
So now you know, when you shop in Migros, you are like Ulysses returning to Ithaca and you are full of profound longings. Speaking of profound longings, where is the bacon?

They are relatively new and in my humble opinion make the best chocolates in Switzerland (they're chocolate covered caramels give chocolatiers in Paris a run for their money).  And trust me, I've been eating my way through this country one chocolate at a time.  They aren't cheap, but I would rather spend the same amount to get less chocolates and really enjoy it, then have a heap of chocolates that are just okay.

Espresso geeks are a bit like audio geeks, which is why there's a market for machines costing thousands of francs. Golden ear, golden palette, a lot of it is subjective at best but preground coffee is a good way to get poor espresso from a good machine.

3674	Food and drink	Birchermuesli recipe please.	corrieorrie	3612	5	Location: Immensee	04.12.2009, 11:19	" 
			
			With Birchermüesli, it's the same as with cheese Fondue: Everbody thinks his own recipe is the best. I therefore only add one that I found on the Web.   
   Ingredients for four people:   
      * 4 tablespoons oat flakes 
      * 8 tablespoons water 
      * 4 tablespoons sweet evaporated milk or cream 
      * Honey or sugar according to taste (use as little sugar as possible) 
      * Juice of 2 lemons 
      * 8 apples    
  Method:   
     1. Put oat flakes, water, sweet evaporated milk and juice of lemon in a bowl. 
     2. Wash apples, cut in pieces, remove core (do not remove skin!) 
     3. Grind apples into the bowl and mix well. 
     4. Add sugar and honey according to your own taste and mix well again.   
  Variations:   
      * Use plain yogurt instead of water and evaporated milk. 
      * Add cream, half and half or milk according to taste. 
      * Include any kind of berry, oranges or other fruit instead of, or in addition to, the apples.   
  Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of ground almonds and/or hazelnuts     
Source: Look  , you'll also get some additional information about Birchermüesli.

I recall that once on TSR they actually tested samples of chocolates from Swiss shops for traces of nuts and other allergens, and the only one that did not have any traces was Migros Selection 100% Cacao. Another one, on which presence of traces was declared but were not found in the test was Lindt Excellence 70%.

Again depending on where you live, baked fish is common. Where these isn't war, people from poorer countries tend to eat pretty well.

			Probably a wise choice. The pizza guy would probably have to park up by taxis and short term parking, and then take the escalator down about 3 floors to the ground level and then go to your platform. It's a bit of a trek, and 5-10 minutes might not be a big enough window. It's a cool idea though.... but you're defintely better off to get them in Zurich.

			ahh, Blutwurst and Leberwurst with Sauerkraut and potato salad...a true Swiss delicacy, I refer to it as the equivalent of ""Swiss Sushi"". Dijon mustard and a glass of Sauser completes this dish.   
Preparation is very easy: boil a pot of salted water, SWITCH OFF the burner, drop the sausages into the hot water, unpricked, straight from the package. Leave for 5-8 minutes in the hot water with burner off, depending on how congealed you want the blood sausage.   
Perfect, minimum effort.

			La Croix Federale, in Saint Prex (west of Morges) does this to some degree with its meals.  If you order the fish you will get extra fish and potatoes.  If you order the Entrecote du Boeuf you will be offered extra pommes frites.  It is not a cheap restaurant but neither is it actually expensive.   
The service is done off of a rolling waiter's cart with chafing dishes and gas burners and the like.

That stuff is good on crackers while watching NFL games but that's about it - the beer helps break up the grease or something and the salt / beer combo is what makes it good.     
Anyhow, the very best cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches is Land O Lakes brand American Deli Cheese... I like the white better than the yellow, it has a slightly sharper taste.   
Kraft Deli American also is pretty good... above all, stay away from the singles!       
I've found that ""Butter Käse"" that can be found at MarktKauf is a really decent substitute as is Edamer if American Cheese can't be had.

First, at a relative reasonable price... the VollenWeider  
It at the Opernhaus tram stop near Stadelhofen   
and the newer, more expensive (like 2.50/macaroon--it's insane)... La Duree. I think they are even more expensive than in Paris.  
It's across from the St. Annahof Coop ---17 Kuttelgasse.  These are so close to heaven... Especially Caramel with Fleur du Sel and Citrone! But the price makes me really appreciate Sprungli even more!

It does have a bad rep but it's no worse than young Swiss reds folks here drink quite happily. Reading the reviews, 2009 is an outstanding year because of the weather  so I'll probably give it a go. If you can, opt for the Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau rather than the straight Beaujolais Nouveau. It's a bit better quality.

3708	Food and drink	Custard Ice Cream?	sygirl101	1304	2	Location: Zurich	18.11.2009, 11:53	" 
			
			Just sub bittersweet choc with white chocolate, and halve the recipe for a start. Enjoy!     
Chocolate Pastry Cream  
Recipe from Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Hermé   
 2 cups (500g) whole milk 
 4 large egg yolks 
 6 tbsp (75g) sugar 
 3 tablespoons cornstarch, sifted 
 7 oz (200g) bittersweet chocolate, preferably Velrhona Guanaja, melted 
 2½ tbsp (1¼ oz: 40g) unsalted butter, at room temperature   
1) In a small saucepan, bring the milk to a boil.  In the meantime, combine the yolks, sugar and cornstarch together and whisk in a heavy‐bottomed saucepan.   
2) Once the milk has reached a boil, temper the yolks by whisking a couple spoonfuls of the hot milk into the yolk mixture.Continue whisking and slowly pour the rest of the milk into the tempered yolk mixture.   
3) Strain the mixture back into the saucepan to remove any egg that may have scrambled.  Place the pan over medium heat and whisk vigorously (without stop) until the mixture returns to a boil. Keep whisking vigorously for 1 to 2 more minutes (still over medium heat).Stir in the melted chocolate and then remove the pan from the heat.   
4) Scrape the pastry cream into a small bowl and set it in an ice‐water bath to stop the cooking process. Make sure to continue stirring the mixture at this point so that it  remains smooth.   
5) Once the cream has reached a temperature of 140 F remove from the ice‐water bath and stir in the butter in three or four installments. Return the cream to the ice‐water bath to continue cooling, stirring occasionally, until it has completely cooled. The cream is now ready to use or store in the fridge.   
Notes: 
1) The pastry cream can be made 2‐3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.   
2) In order to avoid a skin forming on the pastry cream, cover with plastic wrap pressed onto the cream.   
3) Tempering the eggs raises the temperature of the eggs slowly so that they do not scramble.

			We used to buy egg whites from migros le-shop (the online delivery service), so you might check there as well if your local stores don't stick the item. I'd check the price though... you might be better off just buying a 10 eggs or whatever and chucking the yolks.    
As for turkey sausage, probably the best thing is to get the ground turkey, or grind it yourself. It would be more lean that way, if that's an issue.   Turkey sausage can have a lot of fat in it in the US. For spices, if you want an American-type sausage, you can always order sausage spices from the US, for example Penzey's has both an italian or  breakfast sausage spice mixture.

3717	Food and drink	Thanksgiving turkey - brining bags	baselgirl	2948	7	Location: Basel	10.11.2009, 21:46	" 
			
			Brining a turkey makes it incredibly moist, and if you use a little sugar in the brine, the skin gets nicely caramelized. We used buckets and plastic wrap/aluminum foil over the bucket. I've aslo brined a capon... that was excellent.    
I'm going to use the steam oven... I've had good results with chickens.

3719	Food and drink	Why is Raclette so expensive?	chardie18	3021	13	Location: Luzern (This is where we will live!)	09.11.2009, 16:47	"    Ok, I stand corrected. However, that's a pretty new development in that ""Le Raclette"" was introduced in 2003, and I assume it's the only French word with an ending ""-ette"" that's masculin. Not quite sure though. Anyway, ""  Raclette"" is a linguistic atrocity, something only marketing geeks can come up with. I would never use that term. Somehow it reminds me of Migros renaming their Do It Yourself department to Do It (!).

3722	Food and drink	Looking for new soup recipes?	Pather	3162	21	Location: Bern	04.11.2009, 13:56	"    We do, most often fish stock. It is actually easy and quick (with some planning) and cheap as you can get fish carcasses for free from a fishmonger. We use it to make this fish stew from River Café's cookbook which is much simpler to do than bouillabaisse or other mediterranean soups. You can also freeze it and use later for seafood risotto.    
I also make this very simple and quick vegetable soup, especially in the evening:    
Peel and cut one onion and cook in little olive oil until soft 
Add a splash of white wine and boil for a few seconds 
Add 1-2 peeleed potatoes cut in chunks and some boiled water from a kettle 
At this stage you can also add some spices: dried dill and a bit of mild curry work well; you can also add a crushed clove of garlic 
When potatoes are half-cooked (this will be in about 10 minutes), add a few handfulls of frozen garden peas 
Cook for another 5 minutes or so to make sure that potatoes are soft and peas remain bright green 
Blitz in a blender until smooth 
Adjust seasoning 
Thin with some milk or cream if it is too thick, although it works well on its own 
Add some finely chopped fresh dill to add more fragrance   
And that's it. Everybody in my family loves it.

The enamelled ones can only be used on low to medium heat which limits their usefulness as you always have to be a bit careful - especially when you consider how expensive they are.

I was forgetting something ""special"" my dad used to do for chili. His chili is self-described as ""tasty"" (which you can take to mean that you probably need a towel because it is   hot).   
My dad used to buy a ""small"" chuck roast, cut it into small cubes and marinate over night in hot salsa. The next day he'd sear the meet in a heavy pot and then add in the onions and whatever fresh peppers he wanted to use. I think he added another jar of hot salsa instead of crushed or diced tomatoes (or maybe in addition to) along with a few cans of pinto beans.     
There was a restaurant we'd go to in Orlando (chain though, called Sweet Tomatoes) that had 6 - 10 (I forget exactly  ) different kinds of chili, including some made with venison, chicken, turkey, or buffalo rather than beef... some was really good.

3770	Food and drink	Lamb for Curries ... Where to Buy?	Me Myself &amp; I	2156	14	Location: Züri	05.10.2009, 15:49	" 
			
			Thank you all for all your help. I bought some excellent stewing lamb today.   
I went to   this afternoon and was well impressed. Not only did I get the Lamb for my curries, I also got so many other spices and ingredients. The new store is not on Langstrasse 62 as they have changed that into a takeaway which I hope to try next time round. The new store is 2 minutes away on Kernstrasse 27.   
They also have lots of Asian and African cuisine ingredients.    
I'll be cooking a fantastic Rogan Josh this weekend! By the way, Lamb is sold in 1 kilo packets costing 13 francs per kilo. It's available both on the bone (my preference) and off the bone. This is a one stop shop, you can get almost everything Indian here.

			I'm curious, why all these questions about takeaway food in Zürich?     
Are you writing a guidebook or something?  (Nothing wrong if you are - just wondering.)   
Takeaway and casual restaurants are usually of local interest only: if you really care whether Chopsticks & co. are still open, and how late they're open, then you most likely live near them - in which case why ask t'internet?

Christmas lunch in restaurants however is not a Swiss tradition. Swiss tradition is that people have Christmas Eve at home with the Tree established, and that the children but also grown-ups get those presents the ChristmasChild has brought round. Santa Claus is ""working"" on 6th December. And 25th December usually is ""family day"" .

			Technically you're still going to need to ferment the grapes into wine first and then distill.     
Given that someone has an abundance of grapes and that they do not know where to ferment them leads to the question, how bad is any wine really going to be even with the right equipment!!   
My dog likes grapes but will extradite them quite quickly if you get stuck for some low level processing...

For re-sale, I think we would have to use the local butcher/slaughterhouse, at least that is what our neighbours do with their goats and lambs - the cuts of meat come back vacuum packed ready for the freezer.

Use it anyway, just use less than half the sugar in the recipe.   
If you like mildly sweet milky tea, sweetened condensed milk works great with Ceylon tea or English Breakfast.   
Or make  :   
Stir over medium-low heat a non-stick saucepan filled with 150g dessicated coconut milk, 2/3 can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 tsp cardamom powder and half a cup of sugar. Cook until it's a very sticky lump. Turn out into a pan lined with baking paper. Press down the coconut mixture with another piece of the paper (it's hot!). Cut into squares when cool.  Very yummy, but addictive!

The beer isnt' worse than Feldschlösschen or any other watery lager.

			For some reason, my overheated eyes read the title as 'canning bath water'.      
I've done grapefruit marmalade jam but dared not keep it outside the fridge for months:   
(scroll down for the jam recipe )     
Last summer I pickled some kumquats and limes by placing the closed jars in the sun for a few weeks. You can make them sweet or salty (salty limes are great stirred in a warm drink when you have a sore throat; or use them as a chutney). Just add salt or sugar, or both and perhaps a red chilli or some other whole spices if you're adventurous. You know the limes are ready when they turn almost translucent. (To be on the safe side, I kept them in the fridge once they were done. Yes, chicken hearted!)

3818	Food and drink	cooking class.....	subh_04	2323	4	Location: zurich	27.08.2009, 10:37	"    Hi Subh,   
My advice would be to buy a Swiss cookery book and try out the recipes yourself. If you want to know if the recipes are 'authentic', dine at Swiss restaurants or invite Swiss friends over to verify, compare and comment.    
My father in law, who is a 100% Zürcher, cooks exactly according to recipes by Betty Bossi and he swears by her.   
Also look for the following books:     Switzerland - A Culinary Tour (2006) Peter Widmer   Swiss Cooking (2003) Michael Klein, Yvonne Tempelmann   Swiss Roestis (2003) by Stefan Stich   Valais Cooking (2008) Irma Dütsch, Roland Puippe   Zermatt for Gourmets (2006) Annette Weber, Marcus Gyger   Lake Lucerne Cooking (2006) Erica Bänziger, Claudio Zemp   St. Gallen Cooking (2006) Kurt Hanselmann   Zurich Cooking (2006) Robert Haupt   Graubünden Cooking (2007) Jacky Donatz, Chasper Pult   Berner Oberland Cooking (2007) Urs Wandeler, Elsbeth Hobmeier   
I use a book called 'Cooking in Switzerland' by Marianne Kaltenbach and it is excellent.   
Happy Cooking !

			Good question.   
Let's be highly unscientific and estimate based on water's density (assuming grapes are mostly water).   
That'd lead us to believe roughly 1kg per liter of juice/wine would suffice.   
(Thinking about stomping grapes on my balcony - let's say already smashed grapes would be preferable..)

 I liked a brand I could get at home that was 100% peanuts. I have had relatives bring jars over here and still have a little left. I think when I run out, I will attempt to make my own.   
I am not American and have not tried peanut butter and jam, my Dad loves it with honey, but I like mine, straight.

			I discovered that Beerplanet Lowe sells the Doggy Style Classic APA, from the Flying Dog Brewery.   
And IMHO it is great.   
When opening the bottle you are welcomed by an explosion of hop flavours (mostly C-hops), smells like Grapefruit/Orange/Lemon, beautiful!   
The colour is orange/copper and the malty, slightly sweet aftertaste is the perfect balance for the strong hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is also very nice.   
I was lucky to have a rather young bottle, probably the hop aromas will reduce over time.   
Anyway, if you like the American style (craft) brews, I absolutely recommend it.

			I am a huge fan of salted butter, being English.  
It would be interesting to find out where the line across Europe would go separating the salties from the salt-frees. I know that in the UK, unsalted butter is really only used in baking. NW France, Normandy and Brittany are famous for their salted butter, restaurants in SE France will only serve unsalted. Do Germans generally put salted butter on their bread?   
Cheers

3846	Food and drink	do you buy duty-free wine?	peebix	2889	16	Location: Zürich	24.07.2009, 20:10	"     
That French waiter is most simply wrong, completely wrong. Most of intercontinental wine freighting is done by airfreight. I have brought wines home from many holidays by air, and kept quite many bottles in the cellar for long times, and they did not suffer. However, what people often forget is that the many wines from ""holidays"" countries are excellent but not supposed to be stored for months or even years. Wines from Egypt for example ought to be consumed within some four months. You can store wines from Lebanon and Israel for years, but not wines from Tunisia or Algeria. Wines from Morocco can be stored for one year and two but not more. Much in fact does not depend on the wines but on the caps (corks etc). If you take any wine home by air or car or train, you have to put it into the cellar for at least three days or rather a week or two. And not store the bottle(s) upright but neither fully even but with the upper side slightly higher up.    
Many Australian wines are cultivated in Australia by French emigrants, and are very similar to French wines. But the names differ, they may sound the same but the meaning of the terms does not correspond. You also have to consider the ""terroir"" which means the ground which in Australia is rather different from the one in most of France. I think that the wine you brought round to France was of a sort not to the liking of French people.        The prices of Duty Free Shops have to be higher than those of wine stores due to the expensive infrastructure and the fact that the airport companies get a fixed percentage not of the profit but of the total price. And the choice of duty free shops usually is not exactly impressive.

In my case, I could buy another refurbished (dual-boiler -- the Krups is only a single boiler) machine for EUR 200, so I decided not to repair the original.

			Could you not try goats or sheep milk, both are sold in coop, so I would assume the other supermarkets also sell them.  Our son drinks either of them (he's 9, so not a toddler) as cows milk can cause him to have quite nasty migraines.

1.2lt (2 pints) Water 
4 Lemons 
2 tsp Citric Acid 
2 tsp Tartaric Acid    Finely peel the lemons, removing only the outer waxy layer and squeeze the juice. 
Place the water into a saucepan with the lemon rind and boil for 2 - 3 minutes. 
Place the sugar, lemon juice, citric acid and tartaric acid into a bowl. 
Strain the boiling water over the juice mixture. 
Stir in the sugar to dissolve. 
Pour the liquid into clean, dry bottles sealing securely. 
Will keep for up to 6 weeks if stored in a cool dark place.   Can be diluted before serving.

I think the Chinese grocery store at Zurich HB has it.   
Another alternative is potato starch, depending on your application.

			I make rolled tacos, taquitos with those yellow, orangish, tacos from coop with bunch of guacamole sauce and hot sauce on top. I have my own cheating recipe too. What I do is I make filling with corn beef and cream cheese. I wash corn beef under warm water till salty taste of corn beef fades and roll that mixed with some Philadelphia cream cheese inside of the yellow corn tortilla. keep this in rolled shape with tooth picks and deep fry it this nice and crispy. And top it with super creamy guacamole and hot sauce. Off course what I really like is the fish taco made with those soft white corn tortilla with lots of sliced cabbage and fried fish. Whole family of mine love fish tacos. I ate few times in SD at Rubios by SDSU campus. I mostly ate my Mexican food in Point Loma or down TJ...

Make your salad as you like it.   
Fry the fillets with smoked bacon cubes and mushrooms add garlic and freshly chopped flat leaf parsley. slice fillets and scatter all hot ingredients over the salad. Serve with crusty bread.   
An alternative:   
Clean and chop chicken livers into small pieces.   
Season and dust with flour.   
Fry fast and furiously on a high heat until the outside is brown and crispy. 
Add to fave salad.   
Croutons can be added to both dishes if desired.  "	Posts: 1,738	Join Date: Jun 2005	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 7 Times in 7 Posts	Thanked 1,869 Times in 947 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

A nice big mug of hot tea (Tetleys only) and two or three slices of toast smeared with Marmite. Yum Yum. Hubby leaves the marmite out though, and goes for the Nutella instead.

I visited Globus today..though I found quite a few things, I feel like central market/whole foods offered many more choices (in the fresh produce section)..but overall I really liked the store :-) so thanks to everyone for your suggestions.

			On the island of Okinawa Japan, the local bars serve an interesting drink called Habu Saki. It is basically a jar of rice wine with a couple of large highly venomous snakes floating in it. The idea is that the venom of the snake infused in the saki produces a hallucinogenic effect.   
When I saw the jar, the snakes had apparently been in there for quite some time as it was cloudy and there were scales floating in it. After quite a bit of liquid courage, My friends and I each ordered up a shot. I don't remember hallucinating. Come to think of it, I don't remember much of anything after drinking it. But the hangover the next day was epic in its brilliance.   
Dougal's eating a scorpion is where I draw the line. No way, never , it's not going to happen! Scorpions are my achilles heel, along with live octopus of course. These are the two creatures in this world that make me want to run, or swim, in the opposite direction as fast as I can!

Otherwise, I've downgraded to using sliced XXL bread from Migros slightly warmed. It does the same job (until you put it down, which a real hotdog eater doesn't do anyway) and easier to find.

			Oh, and another tip for practicing your icing is on a blank cake usually made out of polystyrene which you can usually buy in cake decorating shops, or even a plain cardboard box for the flat work to get used to your icing nozzles.  I'm sure your family will enjoy all the samples you provide after the practice baking sessions!

3937	Food and drink	Chocolate Fondue	Charlyb	2774	12	Location: Ruschlikon	17.04.2009, 18:02	" 
			
			I'm also a fan of the Toblerone fondue, regardless of the tiny bits that might not melt with the chocolate. Don't let that put you off!   
However, I normally go for a dark chocolate with cream, and perhaps a little Cointreau added (not always)   
Favourite fruits for me include kiwi fruit (surprisingly good!) and pineapple. Banana is always a winner (perhaps something to do with the presence of banana leaves during the early fermenting stages of cocoa beans?), and strawberries are great, but overrated in my opinion.   
For something with a major zing, try cranberries!

			Hello there, so sorry everyone for not replying sooner, I think I put the answer on the Glocals forum and not this one....oops sorry. It is an amazing shop, rather big actually, like a small co op.  
Ok ....it is on Via Alla Valetta . I only know the way from Montagnola as if you are going to Lugano. You turn right and go down the windy road down, a bit like the Monte Carlo road ...on a smaller scale, towards Lugano. When you hit the traffic lights you see a big pale yellow building on your right that is a Franklin College residence, now literally just before the entrance to this building is a small right turning , that is a one way street, you turn right down there and viola it is there at the bottom.  
Hey...Check out videojug.com as it shows you how to make Naan and Chappitis and what ingrediants to buy ....great site...all sorts.  
I am moving house so unlikely to be around for about 2 weeks, hope this helps and please let me know how you get on

In Marktkauf just across the border from Basel is an Indian shop that has good packets of curry for reasonable price.  Tip: peal off the label and you get the English instructions.     
Anyway, here's something to go with your curry;   
Boil some brocolli ( cut into about 1"" size ).  Chop some red peppers, and some onions. ( I'm talking about enough for four people ).   
Fry the onions, adding in 1-2 tsp cumin and 0.5-1 tsp turmeric.  When the onions soften, crush about 2 tsps of cardamom pods, add them in, with the peppers and brocolli.   
Cook for about 10-15 mins, according to whether you like crunchy veg or a soggy mass.

3955	Food and drink	Best oil for chips (fries)	richardm	4127	2	Location: #murica	05.04.2009, 01:33	" 
			
			I second that for peanut oil - high smoke point (   ). As for potatoes, I seek out for   whenever possible or alternatively the Spunta.      
Suggested Recipe   
Russet burbank ( ), with its floury texture and low moisture content, makes the perfect chip, but you can also use bintje or spunta.   
INGREDIENTS   
1kg russet burbank potatoes, peeled 
peanut oil, for deep-frying       
METHOD   
Cut potatoes lengthways into 1cm slices; cut each slice lengthways into 1cm-wide pieces. Stand potato pieces in large bowl of cold water for 30 minutes to avoid discolouration. Drain; pat dry with absorbent paper.    
Heat oil in deep-fryer, wok or large saucepan; cook chips, in 3 batches, about 4 minutes each or until just tender but not browned. Drain on absorbent paper; stand 10 minutes.   
Reheat oil; cook chips, in 3 batches, separating any that stick together by shaking deep-fryer basket or with a slotted spoon, until crisp and golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper.    
TIPS  After the first cooking, the chips can stand for several hours before the final deep-frying.

3958	Food and drink	difference between weissmehl and kochmehl	s-hobi	3910	6	Location: Pfaeffikon, SZ	29.03.2009, 23:35	" 
			
			thanks everyone for your advice....esp Jack with your links.   
Actually I realised later that it is called küchemehl not kochmehl.   
Anyway I used the rest of it for an almond and peach cake last night...and the end result is YUM. So far I can not find the 20rappen difference between weiss and küchemehl.   
What I have noticed with the butter is that for baking and spreading on bread it doesnt make a difference. But in cooking it does. The cheaper butter has a much higher water content - ie when making clarified butter there is a lot more ""water"" and if frying with butter it ""splatters"" a lot more.   
cremebrulee - i would say zopfmehl would do the job nicely. if I am doing things like pizza base or savory scrolls ( in other words not a pure loaf of bread) then I use the cheap weissmehl.

I managed to make an excellent soup last night.  
I basically combined the recipe ideas yol gave me here.   
I simmered   in water with a  , and   for 2 - 2 1/2 hours.   
Then I removed the chicken, separated it from the bone and cut into bite size pieces. I discarded the vegetables as their goodness was now in the stock.   
I then added to the remaining stock:  . I simmered this for half an hour until the flavours came together perfectly.   
In the last 5 minutes, I threw in some  .   
I served the soup topped with lots of  .   
If I may say so, it was absolutely delicious. Please give it a go.  
It might sound like too much work, but it's quite the opposite. Turn on the heat and let the chicken & water do their job!

3978	Food and drink	Under 18's in restaurants and bars? What are the rules?	laus_anne	2713	13	Location: London	12.03.2009, 13:18	" 
			
			There's no federal and little cantonal regulation about going out. I've found some information about Lausanne (which is the biggest city of Vaud):   
I doubt that all rules are regularly enforced, but teenagers aged 12-15 and younger need written permission from their guardian to frequent restaurants and bars without him. With permission they're allowed to stay in these venues until 20:00. Some bars and the night clubs don't allow guests under 18.   
After 22:00, teenagers under 18 are only allowed outside to walk home.   
Sources:             
Alcohol on the other hand is regulated mostly at the federal level. Beer and wine are sold to 16 years old and older. Liquor and alcopops to 18+ years old. This applies to both restaurants and shops. Ticino is stricter and sells all alcohol only to 18+.      You got around in your early years!

3979	Food and drink	Do you buy 'Bio'?	chardie18	3403	44	Location: Luzern (This is where we will live!)	11.03.2009, 12:23	" 
			
			I detect cynicism and distrust in many of these posts. Surely anyone looking at the cost comparisons are only fooling themselves: there's a   why the non-organic food is cheaper.   
My 98 year old Grandmother - raised on a farm, never been ill in her life - wonders why non-Bio food isn't labelled as such. Surely she's right.   
""This food is   Bio, but hey, it's 12% cheaper""       
Food   be expensive. Most of us are spoilt on excessive consumption, especially concerning food. We even manage to throw 30% of it away, yet we say Bio is expensive! Weird.   
We blindly follow the price of things and rarely the value. It is possible to live happily on a Bio / Organic diet, even on a low budget. One learns to economise. Millions of generations before us managed.   
I doubt there's much mileage in taste, though. Fresher, unpolluted produce is certainly going to make a difference, but not to the average Joe.   
Once again, the public gets what the public wants, which is low prices - oh and I'll have a free carrier bag while I'm at it.   
Every purchase one makes is a political decision. Shame we're not educated more on these themes, but it ain't as sexy as a free child's toy and bigger, juicier burgers...   
Political movements are never top-down. It takes grass-roots support - as in,   doing something about it - which causes momentum and eventual political shift.

			You can buy cherries sort of vacuum packed in the Migros. About 500g pack I think. They keep a long time in the fridge or you can just freeze the pack. They are in a thick plastic package (beutel) and are located by the chilled veg and salad in my local Migros (just trying to give you a hint where to look for them in your Migros). The have already been destoned and taste really nice. I have never heard of frozen bananas - but you can get dried ones.

3992	Food and drink	Help - How do you use those manual coffee makers	ftangftang	1060	3	Location: Basel	27.02.2009, 16:11	" 
			
			You have a mocha coffee pot.   
Turn on the hob, if it's electric. You want it hot.   
Add water to the level marked on the inside of the lower section. Ideally use freshly milled coffee beans and add enough to reasonably fill the filter (which you've now placed in the lower section).    
Don't dampen the grounds, it's not necessary. Screw on the upper section, good 'n' tight. (Have a supply of spare rubber rings as these seals wear - widely available, about CHF3.-).   
Heat cups.   
Allow water and heat to do their business until you hear it pop-pop-pop-popping. Take off the heat and allow the magic to settle.    
Don't let it sit on the heat once it's started pop-pop-pop-popping, or you'll get a burnt taste and that ain't allowed.   
Your valve on the side is only necessary if there's a block in the filter. It'll trip if necessary and release any pressure. Best to stick around for the first few times you do it    
Don't clean with detergent, just rinse. That sweet oilyness coats the metal and keeps the flavour just so. First times you use the pot, pour the coffee out and 'wear it in' so to say.   
Mmm, coffee.

Both Aldi and Migros sell good bacon, I must say. Try adding it to fried rice and panfried noodles -- a good sub for waxed Chinese sausage.

			If you get through a lot of yogurt (we do), then it is actually worth making your own. 
We use a yogurt maker from  , but I am sure there are loads of online places to buy them.   
I love that we can use organic milk and add whatever flavorings we like, and it works out much cheaper (and easier) than buying from the supermarket. It also tastes much nicer, although it will totally spoil you and prevent you from ever eating shop bought stuff again!

4005	Food and drink	Recommendation for Chip Machine	swiss bill	997	4	Location: vaud	06.02.2009, 17:05	"    No need for the greaseproof paper - just brush the bottom of the tray with oil first. Don't pre-heat the try because I found that the chips then stick. Place chips flat on the try and not touching. Use two trays if necessary.   
Cook with the upper grill on your oven with the tray up high at 190°C for around 20 mins or until the chips start to brown. Thin chips will be quicker. Turn with an egg flipper and cook again until brown. Yes, it is much slower than with a fryer. You can also do wedges in their skins - no need for peeling potatoes! Great with sweet chilli sauce and sour cream. Yum. I usually use Victoria potatoes for roasting here too. Migros had 5kg for CHF 5 this week.

4007	Food and drink	Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese	Cheeky monkey	2437	15	Location: Zurich	24.01.2009, 20:16	"    You often see these guys around, there is often one on Thawil high street. They sometimes even make the cheese themselves, or at least know the family that does and the prices are always much cheaper than supermarkets for equivalent cheese. Like a proper cheese shop or market stall, they will always let you try first, and you don't need much local language to do that!   
It's difficult to recommend mild (or non smelly Swiss cheeses in general), even some young ones can sometimes have quite a whiff. Generally, I would go for paler fleshed cheeses or Gruyer.  Of course, you should always keep your cheese in an air tight food container in the fridge to stop it drying out anyway.   
One Swiss cheese I can recommend though is San Carlo BIO from Graubunden, a lot of good cheese shops will stock it. It's pale, creamy, mild and very morish.

4011	Food and drink	Good Restaurant for Family with Kids	vincentcoa	965	0	Location: Geneva	22.01.2009, 11:32	" 
			
			Hi everyone,   
I don't know if there is anyone like me who always looks for a good restaurant for family with kids to really enjoy the meals. If you are also interested in, I'd like to recommend you the restaurant of   since I had a wonderful experience for lunch there yesterday.   
Not only the environment, but the meal for kid is also really good. It surprisingly costs only CHF12 to have delicious chicken legs cooked in mushroom sauce, together with french fries which are also very good. They even gave my kids some books after meal for providing my wife and me a quiet and relaxing environment to enjoy the food, dessert, and coffee.    
Althugh it took us 50 minutes from Geneva to get there, it's really enjoyable for the whole family. Do you also have any recommendation?

			Well at home and with a glass of wine next to the computer  , I did a few calculations on the energy efficiency of the human body. 
  It is generally accepted that, of the 2300 calories we need in a day, we use 60% of the energy for the basic metabolism (heart beat, respiration, keeping the body temperature), 30% for activities (moving, working, thinking) and 10% for digestion of the foodstuff. The excess above 2300 is stored as fat. This opens for a few interesting observations: 
  Increased physical activity will work only on the 30% of the daily expenditure. One hour at the gym will do very little for you on the overall daily energy expenditure (as it works only on the 30% of the total). Just as well to park oneself in front of the TV…honest, I'm not kidding!   
  Why not look for a strategy that addresses the 60% of the basic metabolism? Now, much of the basic metabolism aims at keeping us warm (I know, I’m just trying to keep it simple!). The metabolic reactions that help regulate body temperature will increase if we are in a cold environment, jut to keep us warm, or decrease if the environment is warm. On the other hand, we will also radiate heat if absolutely still, this is heat generated by chemical reactions in the body that aim at keeping us alive. Laboratory experiments have shown that in a warm environment (hot room or hot bath etc, no physical activity) we loose around 20 calories/hour as heat in order to avoid overheating. In a somewhat colder environment we will loose about 80 calories/hour (no physical activity). 
Now, think of the situation hot bedroom and thick, Swiss style duvet.     In the one case (hot bedroom and duvet), the body uses up 20 Calories per hour for the 8 hours of sleep, or a total of around 160 Calories during the night. In the other case (thin covers, cool room) the body uses up the more natural 80 Calories per hour of sleep for those 8 hours or 640 Calories during the night. The difference of these two situations appears to be 480 Calories per night.    A pound of fat contains 3500 calories. Simple maths will tell you that you can loose a pound of fat every week if you put that duvet away, open the bedroom window and go to sleep!

4023	Food and drink	Quick Oriental Beef & Ginger - For all those hard working mums out there	guest	2354	23	null	null	" 
			
			ok here goes       
1 tsp cumin seeds 
1 tsp coriander seeds 
5 black peppercorns, left whole  
2 green cardamom pods, seeds only 
2 cloves 
1cm/½in piece cinnamon 
1cm/½in piece ginger, peeled and chopped 
7 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole 
2 - 4 large fresh red chillies (depending on preference, i used 2 large chillies and it was still a bit too hot) 
3 tbsp white wine vinegar  
pinch salt 
about 400g of pork cubed, pork with some fat on works best to allow the curry to cook in its natural juices 
3tbsp oz vegetable oil 
1 medium onion, finely sliced       
1. Using a spice grinder or pestle and mortar, grind the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cloves and cinnamon to a fine powder. 
2. In a food processor, blend the ginger, garlic, chillies and white wine vinegar to a paste.  
3. Mix the ground spice mixture with the paste until well combined and season with a pinch of salt. Rub the mixture all over the pork using your fingers, then set the pork aside, covered, to marinate for 1½-2 hours. (recommend using some plastic gloves to rub the marinade in) 
4. Heat the oil in a non-stick pan. When the oil is hot, add the onion and fry for 5-7 minutes, or until golden-brown and soft.  
5. Add the marinated pork pieces and fry for 6-7 minutes, turning once, until golden-brown on all sides. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid and cook for 35-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the pork is tender. Add small splashes of boiling water to the pan as necessary if the juices in the pan dry out. (if your pork has enough fat you will not need to add any water) Add as little water as possible as the resulting sauce should be quite thick.   
This recipe is copied and pasted from BBC food but I have edited it slightly   
Enjoy, it was very tasty if not a little hot with 2 large chillies used, next time i'll use just the one!

In the supermarkets you will find only meat that's nice to look at and doesn't look like a piece of a dead animal  . (e.g., you typically don't see entire chickens, pig feet or heads, tongues, livers, brain, and stuff like that). Don't know Lausanne, but around Zurich you could go directly to a farmer and buy your meat there. They have everything, but might require you to buy larger quantities (ok if you've got a big freezer).

4030	Food and drink	yeast conversion	msmaddymax	2796	2	Location: other side of the pond	29.12.2008, 21:21	"    To convert recipes to use dry yeast, use 40% of the weight of fresh yeast - in other words, use 20 gr. dry yeast in place of 50 gr. fresh yeast (.4 X 50 gr.).   
To convert recipes to use fresh yeast, divide the weight of dry yeast by 40% - so, use 100 gr. fresh yeast in place of 40 gr. dry yeast (.4/40 gr.).  One other important factor is the liquid.  Dry yeast must be dissolved in 4 times its weight of water.  That means, if you are replacing 40 gr. of dry yeast, then reduce the water in the recipe by 160 gr.   
Hope this helps...

I make fries and wedges this way too, but without the salt. You can also brush on a chilli, paprika and cumin mix with the olive oil.

So failing any luck with the above try a health nutters   food shop.

			Hi all,   
Tomorrow morning (Nov, 29th), in Lausanne, a friend of mine and colleague (Italian), will start a survey to discover the Lausanne people tastes regarding pasta.   
This is because is going to open a gastronomy shop mainly oriented to sell fresh pasta in Lausanne ( ), and he needs data to meet better the people interests.   
If you will be around don't hesitate to ketch some of the interviewer who will goes around in the Lausanne center.   
If you want more details I wrote a brief   about him, trust me he is the Leonardo of the kitchen.   
Thanks a lot!

The other week we were stopped at the border and asked where we were going , I replied that we were going out for a meal and were returning later in the evening. ""Why are you not eating in Switzerland""? I was asked. He then proceeded to delay us as much as he could looking around the car, checking passports etc before letting us go.

			Though I can understand your principles for normal days, surely it won't hurt to give your daughter a bit of ""rubbish"" in exceptional circumstances like after the operation ?  
When my son had his adenoids removed (many years ago, don't know if this still happens), the doctor actually said he should eat as much ice-cream as he wanted, as it would calm the irritation. The ice-cream was provided at the hospital and there was certainly no question of being ""picky"" on what sort it was !

Let it sit for about two minutes, then gently fold it together... Very easy and nice!

Stirfry to combine flavours, add a pinch of salt, and a squeeze of lime, and its one hell of a yummy snack.

			This has been the subject of a long discussion between my husband and me since we have been here.  I know that the formal translation for a ribeye steak is Hohrippen, but I have never seen that around here.  Instead, I often see Hohrucken, and the structure of that appears to be the same as a ribeye.  My husband insists, however, that it is a different cut.     
Can anyone clarify this one? It is particularly relevant at the moment, since Migros has Hohrucken on sale in Zurich....

			You can find sour cream in coop and Migros, it's called séré à la crème, in coop it comes in a small container that is white and orange, near the quark section normally. It really is sour cream and not the runny stuff.    
You can buy shredded cheddar in the Aligro in Ecublens, over by the shredded mozzarella and grana padano. Seems to me for chili it would do the trick. I use it for enchiladas.

			I have a special jug that lets you separate the fat from the meat juices. After the roast is out of the oven I pour the juices into the jug and pour off the juice into a saucepan.   
To that, I add the water I used to parboil my roast potatoes in and add a beef stock cube. This I thicken up to gravy using cornflour. To prevent lumps, put a tablespoon of cornflour in a bowl, and mix it to a thin paste with water. Then whisk that gradually into your gravy mixture as you heat it gently to just below boiling point.   
I am sure this will have Escoffier turning in his...(well)...gravy.

On the front packing, you see it written in bold in a vertical band on the left hand side, if this is the Zucker frei variety. Try the Zucker frei Giandor, it is almost as good as the real one, they say.

4096	Food and drink	Siedwürste	RolandRB	748	2	Location: ex Basel	24.09.2008, 19:26	" 
			
			I think it depends on what type of ""Siedwurst"" it is. Some of them are pre-cooked/smoked and only require heating up, others aren't and require proper cooking (e.g. 20 up to 60 mins, depending on size) - below boiling point, as you don't want the sausage to explode/split open. Regarding taste and texture, it again depends on the type of sausage. The ones I've had so far (usually Waadtländer Saucisson) are quite coarse and greasy, and they go well with Sauerkraut and potatoes.   
Here's a website I stumbled across when I googled it, sadly it's in German:    
If the sausage isn't not too expensive, I would buy one and try it out. You might be in for a nice (or not so nice) surprise.      
... hm, I'm hungry now.

4098	Food and drink	Coop English Scones	pat	2454	19	Location: Basel-ish	15.09.2008, 21:52	" 
			
			Feeling nostalgic for the afternoon scones we had in Wales last month, a couple of days ago I decided to try a buttery, flaky scones recipe in a Hastings House book. Well, it turned out to be very, very delicious. Adding currants or dried cranberries or not is entirely up to you (NO icing topping or choc chips, thanks!).   
NO-EGG Flaky Scones   
2 cups all-purpose flour 
1 tablespoon baking powder 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
2 tbs sugar 
5 tbs unsalted butter, cold, cut in chunks 
1 cup whipping cream 
1 cup currants or dried cranberries 
whipping cream for brushing the scones and to serve   
Method: 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (195-200 degrees C). 
Mix with a whisk in a big bowl the flour, bpowder, salt, sugar. 
Cut in butter with a butter knife in each hand until  mix looks like coarse crumbs. 
Pour in cream and fold in everything until just incorporated. Do NOT overmix. 
If mixture seems a little dry, add a little more cream. 
Fold currants or cranberries into batter. 
Press the dough in 3 or 4 batches on lightly floured board 1 1/4-inch (3cm) thick. Cut into triangles. All in all about 8-16 scones, depending on size (enough for 4 hungry mouths). 
Place scones on ungreased cookie sheet. Brush tops with a bit of cream. 
Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.     
(I don't have to say how to serve them. They even taste wonderful on their own. If you want a great orange-grapefruit marmalade recipe from the same book, send me a PM.)

			My mom's traditional Taiwanese pickled Kohlrabi -   
Peel. Slice into thin (approx. 1cm thick) stripes. Put the stripes into a bowl and sprinkle salt.  Thoroughly mix the salt and Kohlrabi with your hand and let it stand for 15-20 minutes.   
The salt will draw the liquid from the veggie - drain the liquid and taste the slices, if too salty rinse quickly with cold water; drain.   
Put a dash or sugar, a teaspoon (or more if you like it spicy) of Chinese garlic chile paste, and a dash of sesame oil; toss to coat. Chill in the fridge for 20-30 minutes then serve   
Optional - garnish with chopped cilantro (coriander).   
This tastes awesome as an appetizer or accompaniment with any Asian dish. As a kid I used to eat just this with white rice...

""Making cheese in your own kitchen   
Starting making cheese is identical with making cottage cheese. Here too milk is mixed with a fermenting culture and présure. Of course our healthy ProBiDa-culture is perfectly fit for it. Therefore add to the cottage cheese or yoghurt machine following: 
- 1 measuring spoon ProBiDa 
- 1/2 présure tab (dissolved in a bit of water) 
- 1 liter 3.5% pasteurized or frischmilch 
- wait for 14-16 hours   
In this time the milk sours and sets up. To get the whey out of the solids (casein), the cheesecurd needs to be cut up. You don't necessarily need a cheeseharp, a bread knife will do to cut 1cm x 1cm squares.""   
With the fermenting culture is meant a fresh yogurt with live lactobacilli.   
Another interesting fact: Rohmilch is cooled down immediately to 6°C after milking to slow bacterial growth to keep the milk from turning sour. In fact, the milk is unlikely to be heated by the farmer, but by the cooperative laitière or Emmi.   Might be a good idea to ask the farmer if he pasteurises himself.

			I agree that best way to be sure what are you buying is to see for your self.  
What is surprising for me sometimes is that people expect that everything in Switzerland (especially food or meat) is top quality just because it is expensive. Unfortunatelly, many things here are not top quality (lets say more exactly, not better than in other countries) despite the price. In the beginning I expect the same, you pay higher price and you get something special. No way today.    
High price does not mean always best quality. Probably you can find same quality (not always) somewhere else cheaper (if you have time to look for it).

			Despite being one of the constituents of pesto, pine nuts became all the rage at about the same time as pesto. All of a sudden everything had pine nuts scattered everywhere. As food became the new porn, and chefs the new porn stars, so pine nuts became the new viagra.   
You don't have to think pine nuts are so exotic that one has to go to an asian store to buy them.   
Go to any shop selling nuts and there you will find pine nuts. Toast them lightly and don't take your eyes off them.   
10 years ago it was said that £1,000,000 worth of pine nuts were burned in London kitchens a year.

			For anyone who has a garden, growing your own garlic is a great option. It is not difficult, but you need to plant them in autumn, not in spring. They will come above ground in January and should be ready in May/June.   
They are difficult to grow in pots though, you would need deep containers with well drained soil. Anyway, if you are really after the freshest garlic, it might be the best option.   and it is fun too, they grow fast!

			What you really want to do is crush the garlic your preferred way (myself I put a fork on top then pounce on it with a the wooden knife of a handle) in a saucer with a generous dose of salt. Add little water and stir (not beat...) for a while until it gets all salty (yeah I see the chuckling at the back...) and garlicky. Pour generously over fries, meat etc. It works best with fries as their spongy texture will absorb the stuff really well. This will positively ensure that even your sweat will reek of garlic for at least two days.

			Thanks Jack, will go hunting for this broccoli rabe and some Kale and the Morros and the citrons (never knew they are different from lemons!).      Also avoid bell peppers from Holland; they are quite common in Swiss supermarkets but Dutch bell peppers were sprayed by far the most in an EU study I read.    
I noticed the bio tomatoes at Coop are quite awful now. No taste and very hard. Guess I will wait for those Sicilian tomatoes     
A tip about potatoes. Coop still has the special species from Pro Species Rara; the BIO blue potatoes. They are purple on the outside and inside and turn blue when you cook them. Generally, colour in fruit/veggies indicates antioxidants so I imagine these potatoes must offer quite a health benefit compared to bland potatoes  . I have used them in a vegetable quiche and in a curry, quite nice. Taste is different but still potato-like!

			You can generally get the diet tonic in the French hypermarkets but I don't think that you can get them in the Swiss or German shops.   
I think one problem is that the Schweppes drinks are made by Feldschlossen under licence and they don't see the demand for it. In France I believe it is actually a subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes that make the drinks so you find a better range.   
I think I've seen people on here running the Schweppes diet drinks past the folks that run Britshop, maybe that's another way to go.

			Yeah, I know this is a pretty blatant ad, but I think I spent enough time in bars with the people on this forum to get away with it    
Anyway, we (Google) just launched Google Maps for Switzerland! (at last!)   
What does that mean? After all, you could see maps of Zurich before right? And we've had hi-res aerial imagery for a while now.   
Well, it means: There are a bunch of other features that existed before today, but you might not have been aware of. For example, do you like classical music? Try searching for ""flute recital lucerne"" - at the bottom you'll find a placemark added to the map by somebody else (ie, it's not from a directory) marking the location of a James Galway recital.    
Anybody can add their own marks to the map like that - check out ""trout in lake konstanz"" for another example.   
One last thing - you can access the Swiss-localized version of the site by using    
Have fun!

			Hi,   
Crumpets are relatively easy to make at home. Here is the recipe I use:   
8 oz (225 g) strong plain flour (CH: Halbweiss or Hellesurdinkel work) 
1 level teaspoon salt 
1 level tablespoon dried yeast 
1 level teaspoon caster sugar 
½ pint (275 ml) milk   
Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Mix in the salt, sugar and dried yeast.   
Heat the milk gently until it is lukewarm.   
Make a well in the flour mix and whisk in the milk a bit at a time, make sure you get rid of any lumps. An electric whisk might be an idea.   
Cover the bowl with a teatowel and leave in a warm place for about 45 minutes for the batter to rise - it will double in size.   
For cooking, -I have some ""rösti rings"" I bought ages ago, otherwise round cookie cutters or egg rings will work. Make sure you grease them on the inside with plenty of butter.   
Place the rings in a heavy frying pan on a medium heat. When they are hot, spoon in about a tablespoon of batter to each ring. Let cook for 4-5 mins until bubbles appear on the top surface of the batter. Then remove the rings and flip the crumpets over to cook the topside.   
Place the cooked crumpets in a warm oven to stop them cooling.   
Each time you cook a batch, make sure you grease the rings and they and the pan are hot enough.   
Cheers, 
Nick

			Just work out from time to time and all the trans fats and saturated fats and sugar won't hurt you. By the way the fat that is used to replace trans fat is just as bad for you as if you ate trans fat. So just eat what ever you like and work out a few times a week   works for me...at least...

Another alternative source is Lidl. They sell (or at least sold, in Ireland) their own brand by the name ""Choco Softies"" - box of 12 for about 3 euro. Worth checking that out too, if there's a Lidl nearby.

Fresh ground peanut butter has the oil ""naturally"" extracted by pulverizing the nut, so there's no need to add more oil. Granted, I might be setting my sights a bit high, but as Vollkorn breads are so popular here I thought there would be a place to mill grains and nuts.

bits you need: 
200g unsalted butter
100g dark choc -min 60% cocoa solids-broken up
350g dark soft brown sugar
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (DONT USE FLAVOURING!!) 
200g self raising flour (or make from 200g plain flour + 1 tsp baking powder)
pinch of salt
280g box of celebrations - or Malteasers or mint choc thins
baking tin 11x7inch/ 28x18cm  
preheat oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 
brush tin with melted butter &amp; line with greaseproof paper 
melt butter &amp; choc in ""heatproof"" bowl suspended over saucepan of barely simmering water (Dont over heat chocolate - take your time &amp; take it off the heat!) remove from heat &amp; add sugar  
beat eggs &amp; vanilla essence &amp; add to choc mix (make sure its cooled down else choc omelette!) sift the flour into the with the salt 
unwrap chocs and pour half of mix into tin &amp; position chocs so that at least one per portion once cut (just fit in as many as you can!) pour in remaining mix and ensure chocs are covered.  
bake for approx 25-20 mins until top is crispy &amp; inside soft (let it finish baking in the tin once you have that fab broken top! Dont be tempted to cook more!)  
leave to cool in tin before cutting

			I believe you're asking about the alcoholic tendancies of the regions of Switzerland?   
Romandie - more French-influenced therefore enjoying fine wines 
Ticino - again, Italian-influenced and thus enjoy fine wines with a distinct tendancy towards red 
Germanic region - could be considered 50/50 in my opinion.   
If that's not your question then you need to clarify it.

I've had one bottle of it since 1988. It takes pride of place on my drinks shelf.

			Hmm, very interesting that it's a whey based drink, does any have any info on how much whey (protein content) there is per serving...?   I'm currently using powdered whey mixed with water or milk to increase my daily protein intake but still, these might prove a convenient option if thats difficult to get hold of in Zug.

			You should be able to find what you are looking for at a   (bio store). Müller in the ZH HB has an OK selection, but I prefer Terra in Männedorf (the store is at the train station) - they have a nice fresh bakery, and are happy to advise you (at length!   ) on healthy options.   
Also, check out your local bakery, even if it isn't bio/Reform; you can find wonderful full grain breads at most bakeries.

			Hi,      Perhaps try your local market. The market in Basel had some quite nice looking white asparagus from Markgräferland last Friday.    
Jack from Laughing Lemon wrote a nice article on  .   
The usual accompaniments for white asparagus are Hollandaise sauce, mayonnaise or simply melted butter.   
If you make it to Basel, have your friend take you to this place just over the French border:       
It is in Village Neuf and a nice way to arrive there is with the   - a boat along the Rhine.   
We had a big spargel (asparagus) splurge there with an aperitif, all the usual charcuterie, hollandaise sauce, mayo, too much wine, plus dessert. My bill for the evening was just under SFr60.   
Bon appetit!

			Ooh a non-cracked, gooey-inside macaroon. They're hard to find at the best of times. Luxemburgeli are to my mind meringes. Which are also nice, but not a patch on a good macaroon. Anyone able to find these in Zurich?

			Hi,   
Like evilshell posted, the market in St. Louis is worth a visit. Also, there is a nice produce market at Freiburg in Breisgau.   
Cheers,

4243	Food and drink	online wine sales in ch	snowflake	3724	4	Location: UK	11.01.2007, 01:51	" 
			
			As a newbie to Switzerland, I've not had anything large (like a carton of wine) delivered -   I'm pretty certain I couldn't fit more than a few bottles in the box under my letterbox.   
So what's the situation with deliveries to people who are at work all day?   
Back in the UK it would mean a card through the letter box, then a 15 mile trip via public transport to the depot that served my half of london for that particular courier firm (plus the 1.5 mile walk from the trainstation to the depot)   
Is the situation for deliveries of this kind likely to be any better here in Zürich?  Should I just stick to getting my 2 bottles at a time from Co-Op every few days?

4244	Food and drink	Bread flour?	AngeK	5063	2	Location: St Gallen	21.12.2006, 19:07	"    Hi Angela, 
Oh yes they definitely do make their own. Note though that the ready-mix you can buy from Coop and Migros is so expensive that it kills any reason and flour generally in Switzerland is for some strange reason incredibly expensive but you can follow Jack's great advice or alternatively drive 20 minutes (from SG) down the road cross into Germany and fill your boots (!) with flour or ready mix for a quarter the price from Aldi or Lidl and then Bread making for less than a Frank per loaf is great fun...

4245	Food and drink	Where can I buy Goose Fat?.	kirschner27	2741	2	Location: Founex	28.11.2006, 15:57	"    If you are in Zürich, Globus and Jelmoli have it, but it is expensive.  If you can go to Helvetiaplatz on Friday or Oerlikon on Saturday, there is a meat vendor at the market (called Fiechter) in a red and white truck.  They will have goose fat there for less... If you want to make your own, they also sell fresh whole goose and duck...excellent products really!

4247	Food and drink	dandelion coffee	Carrie	3161	18	Location: Lausanne area	13.03.2006, 21:18	"    Well, you can find dandelion tea here, but it tastes awful.  I think the one from NZ is made from roasted roots, not leaves.  And it's scrum-diddly-umptious!   I had some dandelion tea here at a friend's house that was pretty bitter - not tasty at all.    
I finally broke down and ordered my favorite NZ Golden Fields dandelion coffee substitute.   Should be arriving soon, it's already been a week and a half!
