0	Insurance	Are you eligible for a health insurance subsidy?	guest	27034	73	null	null	   Thanks for this Porsch1909!    I actually spoke to the cantonal health insurance office and it was they who told me that if was staying in c. Neuchatel to study, my demand for subsidy would be refused. The focus is on the purpose of you stay in the canton. I suppose that if your initial purpose would be, say, employment and you do you studies in parallel, they could grant you a subsidy.   What is your situation?   Anyway, good luck with your application and please let me know if there is any news.   Thanks  	null	null	null	null	null	null
1	Insurance	Guide: foreign student health insurance Switzerland, interns, au pairs	EF Advertising	11580	0	Location: Switzerland	29.09.2014, 16:50	"           
You might already know that, it is mandatory for each single person living in Switzerland (more than 3 months) to have a basic health insurance according to the Health Insurance Act, which is based on the principle of solidarity. The name of this insurance is KVG-LAMal.   
A Swiss basic insurance could cost between CHF 250 up to CHF 400 per month, depending the annual deductible you choose.   
Foreign students, interns and au pairs who living temporarily in Switzerland for a duration of 3 months up to 6 years, can be exempted (waiver) from the basic health insurance KVG-LAMal. The exemption is only accepted if they can proof that they have an equivalent health insurance.   
Such valid insurance in Switzerland costs average CHF 100 per month.       
The majority of foreign students, interns and au pairs choose the private insurance due to financial reasons. The cover is the same as the basic insurance however the price is much more affordable.       
You can :   
●	Use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) 
●	Choose the Swiss national health insurance scheme KVG-LAMal 
●	Choose a private insurance which approved by the responsible authority from your resident canton in Switzerland       
You can :   
●	Choose the Swiss national health insurance scheme KVG-LAMal 
●	Choose a private insurance which approved by the responsible authority from your resident canton in Switzerland       
You can save time and money by applying online a private health insurance plan from Switzerland directly from your home country. You will receive the insurance certificate instantly by e-mail which you may use for obtaining the entry visa in Switzerland. An additional travel insurance is not necessary.       
If you are already in Switzerland and do not have health insurance yet, you can also apply for a private insurance plan directly online.         
As foreign student, intern or an au pairs, you have the right to request an exemption from the Swiss basic health insurance KVG-LAMal and benefits from a private insurance. However, an exemption is not granted automatically and will never propose a free solution for the applicants. An exemption application must be handed to the responsible authorities in the resident canton. The decision of the exemption falls under the responsibility of the canton - the regulations and procedures practice may vary from different cantons.   
●	An exemption is only granted if the private or international insurance company provides equivalent coverage according to the Swiss Health Insurance Act.       
Upon your visa application, you might have to provide a copy of your health insurance proof. And after moving into Switzerland, you have three months to take out a health insurance with an authorized health insurance company of your choice. As due to it takes weeks/months for the exemption application and procedures, it is wise to inquire beforehand.         
When choosing private insurance coverage in Switzerland, it is important to ensure that the company is registered and recognized by the Swiss authorities. Otherwise you may find yourself with an insurance that is not equivalent and will not cover your costs. So here we recommend you to check the following criteria :   
●	Is it a Swiss insurance company?  
●	Does it provide information concerning the address of the insurance company? 
●	Does it have a company registration number? 
●	Does the product have any limitations or exclusions? 
●	Does it cover all the insurance benefits according to the Health Insurance Act? 
●	Is the insurance that provides the guarantees registered under the FINMA? 
●	Are the claims being handled in Switzerland? 
●	Does a hospital bill the insurance directly - or do you have to pay a deposit? 
●	Do your canton authorities recognize the insurance?       
You could face following problems :   
●	Your claims will be partially refunded 
●	Your claims will be rejected 
●	Your contract can be terminated due to claims issues 
●	You could face important financial problems

6	Insurance	Does submitting a renter's insurance claim increase your premiums?	felixd	252	3	Location: Lausanne	05.01.2017, 22:56	" 
			
			They shouldn't, private liability insurances usually don't work on bonus/malus system like car insurance.   
But insurers do have a right in general to cancel your policy after a claim if they think you've become too much of a risk. Finding a new insurer will be more difficult and/or costly then. You have to disclose on the application whether previous insurer cancelled your policy.

7	Insurance	Humira	ficozver	257	4	Location: Geneva	04.01.2017, 05:18	" 
			
			I would advise when arranging your Swiss health insurance to go for a lower franchise and accept higher premiums.  The franchises range from CHF300 up to CHF2,500 and this is the amount you have to pay first before the insurance kicks in.  With a pre-existing condition such as this I'd advise either the 300 or 500 option.  That would be all you have to pay before the insurance starts to cover the medical bills. After that you pay 10% of the next 7,000 costs, the insurance covers the rest and if it goes beyond that you pay nothing, the insurance covers it all.  These are annual figures so each January would start a new cycle of payments.   
Also make sure the insurance company is one where all invoices are sent directly to them - doctors, hospitals, etc - and then they will bill you for what you owe them.  Otherwise you could still end up having to pay the invoice first and then sending it to the insurance company to claim back.

11	Insurance	Insurance with Crohn's Disease	StHilaire	333	3	Location: Geneva	02.01.2017, 04:59	" 
			
			""basic"" insurance in Switzerland is not really basic.  All medically required treatments are covered, it's just extras like private room, right to see a senior doctor even for minor illness, complementary therapies that are not covered.   
You'll be fine with basic.  We moved to Switzerland when Mr HH had active cancer...so could only get basic.  It's paaid for all of his treatments, new and expensive drugs, major surgery, 3 weeks residential rehab after surgery, etc etc.  He's seen senior doctors when appropriate (complex or unusual situations) and well supervised junior doctors for simpler things.     
Not sure where you are moving from, but the system compares very favourably with our experiences of either the UK or US systems.

			Just to be clear - if you receive a bill, it's up to you to pay it, not Assura (or any other insurance company). The insurance company will reimburse the part of the cost due (that's what tiers-garant means, third-party guarantee).

22	Insurance	Insurance: who's liable?	Phil_MCR	956	28	Location: Basel	07.12.2016, 19:02	" 
			
			Whether anybody's insured or not has zero effect on them being liable or not.   
Since the burst pipe is inside the building it's clearly the landlord's  problem, he (or by extension his insurance) is liable. The non-mandatory  insurance called ""Gebäudewasser-Versicherung"" covers this, it also  covers consequential(word? follow-on) damages caused by a burst pipe  that's outside your building if the pipe feeds the building. Since it's  non-mandatory some don't have one, hence the reaction described by jjake  in #7 - depending on what he reported it may have been insurance fraud  but few people actually care (including yours truly).   
If the pipes for ""Meteorwasser"" (rain, snow, hail, etc) are blocked or   break, for instance those draining the roof, it's probably (my opinion)  not covered  by the mandatory Gebäudeversicherung because the reason for  the damage  isn't the rain itself but the malfuntioning of a part of  the house. In  these cases it looks like the Gebäudewasserversicherung  covers the  damages also.   
Conditions, coverage and the smallprint for the  Gebäudewasserversicherung probably differ from insurer to insurer so do  compare offers.

I would no longer agree that the cheapest policies offer the worst customer experience. Ours has gone from being one of the cheapest to one of the most expensive in the last 2 years but nothing has changed in the way they work. We must still do all the paperwork ourselves and pay in advance.

In my country, Spain, I was not covered by the free Public Health System because I was getting jobseeker from another country for 3 months and they advised that I must get insurance in Switzerland. Its what I did.   
I also considered the option of getting a private health insurance in Spain (30 or 50 euros a month vs around 250 euros in Switzerland) however coverages were not great as you are not covered in case of urgency for the first few weeks (periodo de carencia).

			Always send all medical bills to the insurer, even if the threshold ""franchise"" is not exceeded. Reason: the insurer scrutinizes and may spot inaccuracies, over-charging etc. Also helps the insurers to identify doctors who are over-invoicing.    
Depending on your income, non-reimbursed medical expenses may be tax deductible. For that you must have proof that you were not reimbursed.

I read the bill one more time carefully and realised that it could be correct bill. Yes, there is a name of chief doctor listed on the bill. Plus list of services. Among them the most expensive one (50% of the bill) is ""Care level 6, Gynaecology"" (original is ""Betreuungstufe 6 Gynakologie""). So, I guess as long as level 6 corresponds to Assistant doctor - all is correct. Google does not help here. So I let it the insurance to figure out.

28	Insurance	Sanitas compact	josquius	630	8	Location: the middle of lake geneva	28.11.2016, 17:51	"    I agree. I've got no complaints about treatment here for either myself or any if my family.   
There are good and bad doctors everywhere and the UK is no exception. My mother in law was treated terribly by doctors in the UK but my mother had excellent care.      The level of English spoken by doctors really depends on where you live. I think generally speaking the chances of finding a good English speaking doctor is higher in Zurich, Basel, Bern etc. ( and probably most other German speaking cantons I imagine) than it is is Romandie. 
Nurses and health care assistants are much less likely to have a good level of English.

			Pushing this up.    
When we lived in Bern, we had viva care, and kept it when we moved to Winterthur.  Viva care was probably a product created when Innova sold their basic insurance to Visana in 2011, and it's mostly located in Bern.    
Now, visana  called and  wants us to consider switching to regular visana .... i don't think there are enough customers in this area. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow and see what the story is - i know it will be a little less expensive, but i have to be comfortable with the service.   
Anyone have any experience? Horror stories with Visana since this thread was last updated?

33	Insurance	Car accident pain and suffering compensation	Lenie	4059	138	Location: Aargau	25.11.2016, 08:24	"    From the article you linked:   
""Nein, das ist korrekt. In der Krankenversicherung müssen sich die Versicherten an den Behandlungskosten mittels Franchise und Selbstbehalt beteiligen. Das gilt sowohl bei Krankheit als auch bei Unfall.""   
So, if your accident insurance is through your health insurance, you pay the deductable.   
But children have no deductable, nor do accidents paid by work insurance, which is what FMF correctly stated.

The Tel Med model is similar to this, so I felt comfortable selecting this. I'm not clinical, but I've had a lot of work/patient/caregiver experience. Our bills can be slow to come as well.

41	Insurance	Accident, fell on the side walk because the home owner left wood on the floor	lotusflower80	3193	50	Location: World	07.11.2016, 00:51	"    Sorry,   I realize this is probably going to come across as insensitive, but are you serious???   
When I was a small child my mother broke her ankle. She worked full-time as a waitress. She also had to care for two small children and her car was a manual transmission. No public transport where I'm from so she had to keep driving everywhere, broken ankle or not. We had stairs in our house. She also had to look after my dad, who was disabled. She survived.    
I'm also currently nursing a sprained ankle, so I truly understand your pain. I will also be recovering for several weeks to months. I continue to take the trains,  trams and buses and walk. I'm slower with crutches so I allow more time. I normally walk home from the train station but until I'm a bit stronger and steadier my spouse picks me up at the station so I don't have to walk the whole way.    
Yes, I'm in pain. Yes, I'm exhausted. No I don't have a child but I do have a husband.   I continue to clean house, cook and do laundry, only at a slower pace.    
You just get on with it. It's a screwed up ankle. As long as you're careful and take time you'll be fine.   
If you haven't already got one, ask your doctor about some sort of brace to wear in the house so that you don't need to clomp about with crutches. Wishing you a speedy recovery as well.

			OP,   
I agree with 3Wishes and think we really need info regarding the following:    
1. How much was the bill your thread is about? is CHF 1050 correct? How much of this is deductible, how much is retention fee, is there any mention of those terms on the bill?   
2. Has the entire treatment covered in the bill your thread is about taken place in 2016?    
3. How much have your insurance covered before this bill?   
4. Has the entire treatment generating the cost your insurance covered before this bill (meaning, the treatment generating the cost I'm talking about in question 3) happened in 2016?   
5. What's your insurance model (Standard, HMO, Telmed, GP...)?   
6. Was all your treatment received this year gyno treatment? If not, this might complicate the coverage issue even more.

			Parking damage is for when somebody damages your car when it is parked and you don't know who did it. You are limited to a certain number of claims and there is no excess/deductible. (At least with our insurers)   
If you claim damage by a third party under the full casco or you damage the car yourself there is an excess/deductible to pay.

49	Insurance	Car Insurance: Bonusschutz	maypril	847	21	Location: Uster	03.11.2016, 21:51	"    Dunno.    
Upon changing insurance company you used to take your bonus with you, that points to it being a personal thing. But that may no longer apply. And it may be subject to company policy anyway these days so I guess you should ask your insurance.    With 30% bonus your premium would be 70% of base premium. Conversely if your premium is 30% of base your bonus is 70%, which is more likely in light of a 2% annual premium reduction. However, this contradicts the 35% minimum percentage (65% maximum bonus) in your calculation.   
Based on your detailed calculation (which I cut out in my quote), your conclusion that the two bring roughly the same cost is correct. However, in such a case (and even if paying by yourself is slightly more expensive) I think you should clearly favor paying by yourself because, as you seem to hint: Having the insurance pay the 1st claim would increase the damage threshold that would make it profitable for you to have the insurance pay for a potential 2nd damage while you're still laddering down. While that risk may be low, I'd tend to not take it.

			Just reviving this thread to let others in a similar situation know. I have had an incredibly hard time finding a one way insurance that allows for a change in country of residence.    
So if you are planning to leave Switzerland permanently to settle somewhere else, be sure to read the small print and make sure that your travel insurance is really valid for one way travel.   
Seems easier to find if you are doing the same in reverse, at least for some countries, say move from Australia or UK to Switzerland.   
Please share if you have found an insurance that covers one way trips with change of permanent address.

			We are in the process of importing our car from the US (it arrives tomorrow) and we were able to get a policy through Zurich.  The policy will cover our car while it still has our New Jersey plates on it.  They offered us third party liability, as well as more comprehensive coverage.  The policy will be good for a year while we get the car inspected, registered, etc., and we can change the policy to reflect our new license plates once we get them.  Our premium will be a little less than CHF 500 annually for third party liability only.  It feels a little pricey, but the convenience factor is nice.  Hope this helps!

66	Insurance	HSA for Swiss health insurance	kiwiguy08	1577	6	Location: Horgen	02.09.2013, 11:25	"    I've done this for a couple years with no problem. If you are on the hook for US taxes, it's a no-brainer. Let me explain why...     
According to the specs, most Swiss health plans automatically qualify as a HDHP. In my case (with children), I simply have to have a deductible (franchise) above $2500 and out-of-pocket max below a certain threshold. The eligibility requirements are very simple.         
I don't really use mine as a health savings plan. Rather, more like an additional IRA.     
Benefits:         
These things are great. In some ways (tax free withdrawals), they are even better than IRAs.        
Hope this helps someone.

70	Insurance	Swisscare insurance - is there a catch?	bridgetw	18754	27	Location: Zürich	05.03.2012, 12:09	" 
			
			Hello all, I just wanted to add a small update - I think that Swisscare is a great option for expatriates, students etc - I tried to switch our cover to them but we cannot as we have already insured under the ""PUBLIC"" Swiss National Healthcare system by having an insurance policy with one of the swiss companies which provide such services.    
Swisscare is provides ""PRIVATE"" insurance EQUIVALENT to the national scheme and is therefore an allowable alternative option. To use this option you have to opt out of the National Healthcare system which can be done for 3 years (and then a further 3 - don't know what happens after that?). HOWEVER, if you live in canton Zurich or Bern then you cannot opt out after you have already opted in.  You have a three month period from when you start a Swiss insurance policy in which you can change your mind, opt out and then take a Swisscare policy - but if you have had one longer than 3 months then it is no longer an option. I think it may be different if you live in other cantons - but this is the case in Zurich and Bern.   
I was told this by Swisscare and thought I would pass on the information as it may be of use to someone.   
If you know of anyone coming to, or recently arrived in, Switzerland (Zurich & Bern especially) and they would qualify and be interested in Swisscare then they should sort things out before taking any other insurance.

71	Insurance	Health insurance in UK for Swiss student	Babenas	1127	14	Location: Aargau	04.09.2016, 22:10	" 
			
			Hi,   
I've been looking into this for my son as well. As far as I can gather, during his time in the UK, he  be covered for all the basic things, including hospitalisation, by the NHS -- provided he has an EHIC card.  A normal Swiss Krankenkasse will provide you with a Versichrungskarte and that card is also an EHIC, so you would need to show it in the UK in order to be covered by the NHS.   
However, most Swiss health insurers will not cover you if you de-register from Switzerland or put your permit ""on hold"". If you leave the country for more than 6 months in the year, then (from what we've been  told) you   de-register -- it's not optional and you will be checked at the airport when you arrive back. And practically every student will be out of the country for more than 6 months per year unless they're coming home weekends and every other possible opportunity.   
As it happens my son is also a Swiss citizen and he had to de-register in order to not run afoul of the authorities regarding his Swiss military service. But even if that weren't the case, he would still have needed to de-register because he'll be away for more than 6 months.   
This seems to me to be a catch-22 situation: to be covered in the UK you need an EHIC card and Swiss insurance; to get Swiss insurance and an EHIC card you need to be registered as living in Switzerland!   
If anyone has evidence proving me wrong I would love to hear it, as this is what we've been told by the Swiss federal authorities so far.

 Possibly because at the time I had semi-private cover, but my insurance covered everything (so no franchise was applied) once I'd been admitted as a in-patient rather than an out-patient.   
OP, check with your insurance company, it's quite possible this varies slightly depending on the company/level of cover.

80	Insurance	Insurance to provide pension if invalid	MarKanLu	410	1	Location: Luzern	17.09.2016, 00:39	"    In addition to AHV, there's UVG (usually through health insurer if self employed) which should also pay some pension in case of an accident, but not illness.      Many insurances sell this as a standalone product - Erwerbsunfähigkeitsversicherung, or in combination with life insurance.   
But yeah, you need to pay very close attention to the terms, especially for life insurances. Especially cancellation is often heavily penalized, and who knows whether you'll still need this insurance in a few years: you could be employed by then, or decide that premiums are too expensive, or move out of Switzerland.

You can easily lower or raise your deductible with effect from the end of the year: 
Lowering the deductible: 
The health insurer must be notified in writing of the desired lower deductible by 30 November or by the last working day in November (the day the insurance company receives the letter is relevant). 
Raising the deductible: 
The health insurer must be notified of the desired higher deductible by 31 December or by the last working day in December.""

I am diabetic and have a good insurance with Helsana. They are great as I have the tele-doc method but at the start of the year I ring up and explain and I can now get all my medication thought out the year without having to phone and then the doctor sends me a nice bill.

			You are welcome.   
Where abouts in Colorado- I've skied with double support many times in Winterpark and also Steamboat- but normally we ski near you. Always went to Nendaz from the UK for past 40+ years- so perhaps meet on the slopes one day. Surgeon has told me I can try to ski- on very gentle blues at first- plenty around here in the NE and French Jura, and see how it goes. Been skiing for about 63 years and got good equipment, so sort of know what I am doing.   
It was a very difficult op as the surgeon had to shave a lot of extra bone, and I had to work very hard on re-extending atrophied tendons and muscles (very old severe injury 46 years ago)- I am still young/ish (65) and want to fully recover before doing half-knee rep. - that one should be much easier as there is no extra bone, no atrophication and have full extension now. So Spring 2018 it will be- then still 30 years + to have fun (according to family history). Thanks.

I have trained my young son in all three disciplines, or at least to look at me with grave consternation on his face as we round the corner 100 metres from the driveway and say, ""Daddy!

			Just a question to all -   
Has your health insurance gone up for 2006? I chose the cheapest company for 2005, but they are one of the last to post their premiums for 2006, so I'm not sure if they will be good value next year.   
Have any of you checked and switched for 2006, or did you stay with the same company?   
Oh and gee - I still haven't made a claim for 2005, just like I haven't made a claim in the 5 years since I've been here, but I'm still forced to pay health insurance every month....

So ask about the risks, ask the doc how frequently he or she does the surgery and the success rate, and ask what happens in case of a failed surgery.

			Hello, I live in Zurich and I am thinking of moving out to a different place within Zurich as my children are growing up.     
I heard that it is very expensive to move your household goods from one place to another but also cleaning and painting your current apartment are extremely costly. It's my first time moving after three years in Switzerland.     
One of my friends told me that there is a property insurance which can cover some of those expenses almost by half. Is this true? and not really hoping for it but does this apply immediately after getting the insurance?      
If any of you have a recent experience, could you recommend a cleaning/painting company with good price and quality please? Thanks a lot

			Unless you say where you are going and what you are planning to do there is it pretty hard to answer. Weekend shopping trip to France? You are good. Climbing Mount Everest? Probably something to think about...     
I for example: 
- use my credit card for hotel and flight bookings. It comes with a travel insurance for anything that I paid with the card... 
- only have a special insurance for the sport I do, scuba diving, as accidents there typically require expensive special treatments and I do not want to have that discussion with my healt insurance when I can get everything covered for something around 1-200 CHF per year.

102	Insurance	Largest deductible for compulsary health insurance	ghasemi	1090	12	Location: Lausanne	05.08.2016, 15:44	" 
			
			Thanks, Belgianmum. 
I had another thought, though:  how does the franchise work for someone who has accident and illness insured in two different places?  So I went a-looking, and found this very nice explanation on comparis.    (in German).   
Google translate is not bad, except that it translates the German UVG (Unfall-Versicherungs-Gesetz) at times with UVG and at other times with LAA (the French equivalent: Loi fédérale sur l'assurance-accidents), which can be a bit confusing in a first read of the text.  UVG = LAA.   
Here's google translate, fixed a bit:   
The federal law on accident insurance (UVG in German, LAA in French) applies to accident insurance with private insurance companies and with SUVA.   
The premiums for occupational accidents and diseases must be covered by the employer. Premiums for non-occupational accidents are borne by the workers. The employer pays the entire premium amount and deducts the proportion from employee's pay.   
The UVG / LAA insurance covers treatment costs in both professional as well as non-occupational accidents, i.e. in case of accidents at leisure.  
Whoever is employed by a single employer for at least 8 hours per week, is by this automatically insured against accidents (= is UVG-insured, in German or LAA-insured in French) and can safely conclude his/her own medical insurance without accident coverage. Depending on health insurance, this can results in a premium reduction of up to 10%.   
Once someone is not or no longer insured by an employer against accidents, he/she must inform his/her medical insurance company. The accident coverage pursuant to the KVG (Kranken-Versicherungs-Gesetz, in French LAMal Loi fédérale sur l'assurance-maladie) then once again comes into force, and the monthly medical insurance premium increases [to cover both medical expenses from both illness and accident].   
A person receiving unemployment benefit is automatically insured by SUVA against accidents.   
Incidentally, the accident insurance under UVG / LAA provides a much better protection than the accident insurance pursuant to the KVG / LAMal.  
The UVG / LAA insured person does not have to pay a franchise, nor has a deductible on the medical expenses [related to accidents].  
In addition, the UVG / LAA provides additional services such as daily allowances, pensions or compensation in cases of serious accidents.

			SUVA accident coverage in this case stops on the last day of the month from the end of the Frist runs out, from then on you are to pay for your own accident insurance. From experience and this should be in the booklet / on the website. There is an opportunity to take over SUVA accident insurance on the same conditions for 6 months and 6 months only (they cover more/better). After that see above.

108	Insurance	Insurance / Frontalier / backpayments and the like	CluelessPhD	577	0	Location: Bern	19.07.2016, 01:58	" 
			
			So, I am asking this question because I cannot really sort this out on my own and I have not found an answer here.    
I am a EU national doing a doctorate in the UK, but my funding comes through a Swiss scheme whereby I have to work as a researcher in a Swiss institution.    
Accordingly, I have a contract and I am a frontalier. When I started, however, I was officially resident in a CH-bordering country, and I registered as such with the government, thus benefiting from the exemption from health insurance payments.   
Now, I completely forgot about it until today, when my boss told me that my yearly contract is going to be renewed again. Which means that I am still registered as living in the bordering country allowing for an exemption. However, I moved my residence to the UK some time back, and I am not sure whether I can (officially) resort to the exemption anymore, though I am not sure they would be able to verify that.    
(It is also true that the health insurance of the country concerned would cover me for emergency periods when I go back, and that I am covered by the UK NHS, though Switzerland is largely unconcerned with this, as there is no agreement of the kind with the UK.)   
Technically, they still have that documentation and have not asked me for anything new, but I don't feel comfortable with that.    
To be completely honest, I do not think I could have done that last year either (there is some sort of a grace period when you move your residence), but I totally forgot because my renewal was fairly automatic and I was not asked to fill anything.    
So, the breakdown is the following:       
I have spoken to some friends who told me not to worry about it, but I really am not comfortable about this. My guess is that I involuntarily put myself in a legally-dubious situation which I might want to sort out as soon as possible.    
I will notify the government of my new address as soon as possible, by my guess would be that it would be best to wait until my next contract begins.    
Do you have any suggestions?   
Thanks a million.

			I am Type 1 and so far have been very impressed. I have been told that the basic insurance covers most diabetic treatment, including eye tests (not dental). I have seen my doctor 3 times now and received all the supplies I need. I use insulin pens. (Still haven't had a bill to claim yet)   
He does blood tests inc. HBAlc from a finger not a whole blood sample from the arm. The results are there in 30 mins, not 2 weeks like in the UK. I am not knocking the UK because I thought the treatment there was superb too compared to Asia where I have lived for many years.   
So in Switzerland I don't think you need to worry!   
Good luck.

There are only a couple of companies who offer this cover but not an individual basis - just for largish companies.  Unlike USA where you can buy such cover everywhere.     
 Do you really need such cover & what for?  Most Swiss people have personal liability insurance which covers most of what is usually needed. 
You may also be able to negotiate a fixed penalty with your customer rather than an open unlimited insurance liability, say 10% of contract value.

So you can visit the same one throughout the pregnancy. However it is unlikely they will be there at the birth as they practice at private hospitals. At public hospitals you will see the doctor on call. Births here tend to be managed by midwives and the doctor will only come at the last moment or if there are problems.

			Get your health insurance broker (or read the fine print) to understand what the 'additional' insurance is actually for...    
You may be quite surprised at how comprehensive the 'basic' insurance is, and what sort of 'optional extras' are offered and whether they are really important...

			For me the principle advantage of supplementary is choice of doctor.  If you expect at some point to need some kind of surgery in life then doctor choice can be important because only chain doctors will do certain operations for example new emerging treatment types etc.  it is worth the extra to know then if or when you do need to go under the knife you can pick from Switzerland the person who will do it and ensure y out are getting someone with years of experience in your particular procedure.

I paid about 600 year.

			Car registration has nothing to do with ownership. Sorry, I do not see the connection you try to make.   
But I see once in a while a car with German export plates on Swiss roads. If insurance is o.k. it is perfectly legal. Specially when the car was declaerd as prescribed by law. And why lie with the address? Just truethfully state where you live. 
You can even get Swiss export plates if you like. Non suprisingly, no need for a Swiss address either as most people exporting a car do not live in Switzerland:    
(Catch: The car needs a Swiss Stamm-Nr.)

			Getting back to the OP, if you need a medical certificate for an ongoing condition, once the doctor has recognised that you have this problem, you will not necessarily have to go back to the doctor and have a full examination each time your certificate needs renewing.   
I had medical certificates issued for depression for the best part of five years. My psychiatrist saw me regularly, but as far as the medical certificate was concerned she was quite happy to renew it over the phone.   
Of course it may be different if you have a physical health problem... I haven't had so much experience with that!

			They can't deny basic but they can put exceptions to supplementary cover - for instance they won't cover a recurrence of the acid reflux (sorry, TMI!) I had when I was pregnant and state it as such on my policy.  Even though I've only ever had this when pregnant, and not for long, still...        
Good luck sorting it - and welcome.

			I mentioned this in your other thread, but you also need liability insurance to cover your dog, this is required in Baselstadt.   
Many if not most insurers roll this into your Privathaftpflicht insurance, but not all do, so verify that you are appropriately covered with whoever you choose.   
You may need to supply proof of liability coverage to the Gemeinde when you register your dog.

			This may be just a standard reply as nearly always when glass gets broken it's the tenants fault.   
Inform your insurer (the sooner the better, under standard contitions you have 24 hours) and have them sort things out.   
Do not place a repair order unless you have written authorisation by the regie or the landlord to that end - absent authorisation it's ""who orders, pays"".

			Keep in mind that comparis.ch is a commercial site where insurers have to pay to get listed. Especially the cost concious may be unwilling to accept that so the cheapest are perhaps not even listed.      on the other hand is the official site by the government and is guaranteed to list all insurers.   
As for what's covered:  
Basic insurance by law requires for all insurers to cover the identical issues, not just similar. However, as has been said, service may/does differ.

			I don´t know about private insurances and claims a lot, as I only claimed once (apart from health insurance).   
At work though, with amounts claimed under our credit insurance, premiums would go up if the company had too many write offs/claims in a year and there also was a bonus/malus structure that would cost money when too many clients didn´t pay.   
Maybe it is similar to a credit score? In some countries you pay more if you live in a big city (car insurance, ever wondered why so many people have AI on their cars?), a ""wrong"" neighbourhood or have too many people in the area who did not pay their bills

...simply switch to the next doctor / hospital until you are satisfied with the outcome.   
BTW, from new regulations, I was told recently that with basic cover you can choose to be treated in a 'out of K/Canton hospital' if you wish- but will have to pay the difference in cost, if greater. If however the local doctors send you out of K/Canton because they are not equipped locally to deal with the situation (the case for my neighbour who had to go to CHUV in Lausanne rather than either of the local hospitals, then this is coverd by basic insurance without extra cost.

167	Insurance	Cancelling car insurance - when can I do this?	Konuku	2113	11	Location: Outside Lugano	29.11.2015, 15:51	" 
			
			I think there are three ways to get rid of car insurance 'mid-term': sell it, re-register e.g. under dual plates or write it off (unintentionally). I had five year contract but I think it had yearly cut-off. Still one year seems a long time of notice, in most countries you can change if you get better quote from another company with short notice. So before signing new insurance is the time to negotiate what there is to negotiate...   
When sold is straight forward, have no experience on the second option and the third I would try to avoid   "	Posts: 341	Join Date: Apr 2013	Senior Member	Groaned at 9 Times in 9 Posts	Thanked 66 Times in 33 Posts	earned some respect

169	Insurance	Is Cigna Global a valid insurer in Basel/Switzerland?	rpertusa	1276	7	Location: Basel	11.02.2016, 21:23	"    I'm describing a specific situation; OH was here on expat status - that is, he remained an employee of the US office, seconded to Switzerland. As such, he was exempted from Swiss insurance - this was a deal granted by canton Zürich to OH's employer. Zürich limited this status to 5 years, one either had to leave or revert to a normal employee after that time, take up Swiss qualified insurance plan and all the rest.     
The Cigna plan we were on was the global plan all seconded employees were provided with. But after the 5 year expiration of expat status we could not continue that plan as it was deemed not acceptable under Swiss rules. (Odd, as it was far more comprehensive than basic insurance. Oh how I miss that plan!)   
This is what I was trying to ask rpertusa - if he is on a official expat status there are different options.

			In my case (changing from student insurance to normal insurance), this was done in October, with my new ""normal"" insurance starting from November. I had the letter from Office vaudois de l'assurance-maladie/OVAM and informed my student insurance provider that I had to switch. Following this, I wrote to the normal insurance provider (Supra) (who, coincidentally, are giving me headaches now   ), including giving them copies of the documents. OVAM was then informed.

172	Insurance	Car insurance - can I claim once I know the cost?	newtoswitz	1300	10	Location: Rapperswil	18.01.2016, 21:29	" 
			
			So the car was repaired and the bill is 286 CHF over my franchise (and lower than their estimate, which is nice).   
Question is - how long do I have before I have to finish the claim with the insurance?   
Once I claim I lose my no-claims protection for rest of the year, which is annoying in February for a relatively low amount. Murphy's law says there'll be some larger damage to the car on the way back from the postbox    
Can I pay the garage and sit on the insurance claim for a while (December?  ) just in case?

179	Insurance	Does my health insurance include travel to foreign countries?	alanmack	6836	37	Location: Geneva	19.03.2009, 17:23	"    Hello   
- Basic health insurance covers medical treatments (doctor, public hospital, drugs) in foreign countries ( ) in  . 
- The basis coverage (mandatory) is   for all companies. It's not important if you are affiliate to Helsana or Sanitas or Sana24 and so on. 
- Basis covers public hospitalisation cases abroad   your swiss living area cost !    
To be better covered would be good to contract an additional volunteer (""complementary"" or ""extra"") insurance. Cost is from CHF 5 to CHF 15. Depends of your age and the company. 
This sort of extra insurance covers : 
- Hospitalisation cost above the ""two times swiss cost"". It could be the case in the USA, New Zeeland, Australia.   
- Rescue cost. 
- Transportation (ambulance) cost. 
- Rapatriation (by plane from a foreign country to a swiss hospital). 
- And other.   
If you use to travelling that sort of extra insurance would be good for you.   
Regards   
Alexandre

			Officially: If your wife is unemployed in Greece, then she is classed as a nicht erwerbstätige Familieängehorige, as a non working/ no own income dependent on your wage - meaning officially she needs to have Swiss health insurance (same for the childern). You will then receive the E 109 form from your health insurance, which you use to register them for health insurance in the country they live in. Unofficially: depending on the health insurer they will accept the current cover they have in Greece and you can postpone the Registration until they arrive in Switzerland - Good luck!

			I've twice had to consult a doctor outside Switzerland and simply asked the doctor to itemise the bill. Each time they produced a bill that was satisfactory to the insurance company. The doctor doesn't need to provide a diagnosis (that's between you and the doctor and is none of the insurance company's business), but should list what he/she has done (consultation 15 minutes; blood sample taken, wound disinfected, dressing applied, or something along those lines, like the bills you get from Swiss doctors). Obviously the items won't be the same, but should be sufficient for the insurance company to evaluate the treatment you have received.

188	Insurance	Can I get Swiss insurance for a car with Spanish plates?	ablalarom	1230	5	Location: Geneva	08.11.2015, 23:47	" 
			
			Hi! 
I finally brought my car from Spain and I will register it in Geneva in the following months. 
I went to customs a couple of days after my arrival, as I came on Sunday and it was closed. I brought the form 18.44 filled only with the car info, the car registration documents, my work permit and proof that it was insured on my name since at least 6 months before my first arrival to CH.   
I paid 20CHF and they provided me with a document that has my future registration number, and now I have some time to get a Swiss insurer and then go to the authorities to get it registered, which will cost me about 400CHF in total, plates plus expertise, which is something like a general revision they make.   
Hope it helps!

The fact that you changed mandatory insurance doesn't affect supplementary and other insurances, you can have these from different insurers. 
Call centers are not very helpful imho, better to use the online services to see exactly what contracts you have activated etc.

			My understanding is that Groupe Mutuel don't do travel insurance.   
You need a provider like the ones suggested above - Allianz, Zurich Insurance, AXA-Winterthur.   
It's a good idea to have travel insurance anyway, for any trips outside Switzerland, and the cost of insuring the whole family and paying each year is usually much better than insuring only when you are actually travelling. (And far better than forgetting to get insurance and then having a problem when outside Switzerland).   
We have a policy which was added onto our home/contents insurance with Zurich Insurance. I think the cost to insure our whole family was around 120chf per year. I did need to claim once as my son and I got very ill the day we were supposed to travel with a stomach virus... the claims process was very straightforward and not a problem.   
I do not know how they will approach the pregnancy problem, but I travelled at 32 weeks to China from Australia and there was no problem getting travel insurance to cover it...I just needed a form filled out by my doctor to say that I was fit to travel...and maybe it cost a bit more, I'm not sure.   
Knowing how expensive health care can be in the USA, I would be very reluctant to travel there without good insurance to cover any possibilities...

			If you're talking about cancelling your health insurance then no, you can't do it.  a) iirc you're outside the cancellation/change insurer period which is the end of November each year and b) even if you're out of the country if you're travelling in the EU/EFTA your Swiss health insurance covers you for emergency treatment while abroad.

			Certainly the case with the Mobilière. We have a few items which are specifically covered for use away from home- but even that won't cover for loss. It would be a bit too easy to just 'lose' things, when you want a new one, or sell it abroad and then....wouldn't it?

This man was willing to let me appoint an external lawyer, but the one I choose was not to the satisfaction of Protekta, nor the second one either, so I took the lawyer that Protekta assigned and he literally said to me ""for what you pay this is what you get"" when I asked if he had read the documentation of the case and he said ""no"". Of course I complained and they cancel my policy!!   
Now I have Dextra and is good.

I really like having the option of a second opinion and being able to see a specialist without approval.   
As for CSS, I know two people with it that constantly get shortchanged on refunds.

219	Insurance	Insurance for someone works  France, lives in Switzerland	Weny	748	2	Location: Lausanne	01.12.2015, 20:23	" 
			
			According to the bilateral Agreement with the EU do you need to have your basic insurance in the country you work in. If you wish to be insured for the basic insurace (KVG) in Switzerland, you should ask for exemption in France at the CPAM (Caisse Primaire Assurance Maladie) within the first three months. Additional insurance cover can be kept in Switzerland as you will live in Switzerland.  All major insurance companies in Switzerland will be able to give you an offer for a crossborder cover. 
In this case, you will have to make a decision quick, as you only have three months to get it all sorted, and believe me, the CPAM isn't quick.  
More info can be found on   Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG in Solothurn. Depending on were you live they will be your support and can advise you fully

222	Insurance	Assura Optima	djecko	687	0	Location: Nyon, Vaud	27.11.2015, 22:21	" 
			
			Hello, 
We just got notice that Assura is increasing the cost for their Optima package, and we are now considering to cancel it. The problem is that we have never so far used it. 
What i understand is that the biggest benefit is the option of having a private room, and having a choice of going to a private hospital.    
Does anyone have any experience with the Optima package? Considering that this is Switzwrland, how big is really a difference between a private and public hospital?   
Thank you

			Yeah I think you are right. I was with other insurers before this and they showed this information upfront in their client portals.   
I believe that Assura has it too, just that it needs to be fetched via an online request. In the client space, navigate to Dienstleistungne & Kontakte, and select Anfrage um Leistungsbescheinigung. They have even shown an example of what this certificate will look like. In my opinion this should be equivalent of what you are looking for. I have just raised this request myself.

228	Insurance	Health Insurance: Should I switch from Private to Flexible?	DUTCH	598	0	Location: Wollerau	23.11.2015, 20:16	" 
			
			Hi,   
Am very tempted to switch from our current full private supplementary hospital insurance to the flexible model where we can choose at time of hospitalization which ward to go to. Ofcourse, I pay bit more (there is a cap, say 3000) but the savings in premium are pretty substantial (circa 1500).   
My reluctance is they may not accept us as private at later date if we wanted to move to private for whatever reason, while right now we have full private coverage.   
We are pretty healthy and did not have to draw on this insurance.   
Any advice or experiences, gratefully received. Thanks.

			As mentioned on this Forum many times: 
Yes, you have to arrange within 3 months or an insurance will be arranged for you and that is not the cheapest one. 
And no, in most cases it will be backdated to the first of the month you arrived so not much chance of saving the payment for 2 months.

Other companies might also offer this, I have no idea.    
I have the Visana HMO policy, it is very good value, and with supplementary insurance, there is free worldwide travel insurance.

			This is also true if you switch plates between your cars. If you have a more expensive car that you keep off the road during winter you can get a pro-rata insurance and tax refund. However, you may want to ensure that you keep fire and theft insurance for it while it is hibernating.

245	Insurance	Newborn insurance	drkarthiks	930	9	Location: Zurich	03.11.2015, 11:47	"    As said, the best option is to get prenatal insurance with a good selection of supplementary insurances. The company accept the risk of any problem the baby might born with. Never wait for the birth to insure. If something goes wrong with the baby the chances are you won't find a company willing to accept the risk of giving your child supplementary insurance.   
The other plus of a PreNatal with Groupe Mutuel (as kiwigeek said), you'll get a couple of supplements for free for a period of 3 years (not 5). WORLD and DentairePlus2 (75% until max. 3'000). After the free period, you better upgrade the DentairePlus to the 3th level (DP3 - 75% max 15'000chf).

246	Insurance	accident vs emergency abroad...buying insurance	muh	705	6	Location: Zürich	03.11.2015, 14:01	" 
			
			Accident cover for your husband is dealt with by his employer's insurance policy.  So for example, a few years ago my OH fell down our outside stairs on his way to the car to drive to work and broke his ankle.  As it was an accident his employer's insurance covered it.  A couple of years later he was taken ill in the UK - not an accident so his own insurance policy covered it.  Your husband can still have a franchise as far as I know, he'll need it for any illness, medicines, etc, that aren't covered by his employer's insurance.     
I'm with fatmanfilms on insurance for the US if you need it.  Unless you plan to go back several times a year it's cheaper to buy holiday insurance rather than add it on to you Swiss policy.  Just make sure you're covered for a good amount - minimum $3mil, preferably $5mil if you can get it.

Also, KVG only cover emergencies.    
Also, spending half a year in Australia every year will most likely not be considered ""visiting"".

252	Insurance	Opinions on Swiss Car Insurance Providers Please!	Murphy	32057	53	Location: Nyon	12.03.2007, 17:52	"    I'm not trying to defend Züritel (I have no love of insurance companies), but I do feel I should point out that your story sounds like standard operating procedure for all insurance companies, not just in Switzerland, but also in other countries I've lived in.   
If the amount of the claim is lower than your excess (and the amount it would affect your no-claim bonus), then it makes sense that you pay it out of your own pocket. If you were the driver at fault, you can't expect the insurance company to fight over it. Even for larger amounts insurance companies often have agreements with each other to settle according to certain guidelines, it saves them time and court battles (which cost money!).   
The fact that the money was never spent on a repair is also not relevant because the person may have to do this work in future (if selling the car for example) and it has effectively devalued the car. One day you might be a in a similar position and decide to keep the money.   
I know it hurt, so don't think I'm having a go at you - just wanted to point this out in the interests of fairness.

If a lower franchise is needed this can be arranged in advance for 2016.

			Contact an agent directly.  
You will have to spend some more time calling around the various insurers.  
I ended up with my original agent (Zurich) where i have other insurances too.  
He first quote was higher price but was able to make a better offer when Allianz quoted lower.

			Younger people will often be paying more for health insurance in  2016.   All the compulsory basic insurance premium levels are approved by  the   Swiss government, the Bundesrat & FINMA. You have until nearly the  27th of   November to send a registered letter and cancel the Casamed  policy for   2016.    
I am very happy with the  , but do search for your suitable policy     
Be wary of insurance companies offering very cheap policies, they    sometimes save money by employing fewer staff, which result in very long    waiting for refunds etc.    
My compulsory insurance (KVG) has increased from Fr 318.20 to Fr 329.20    (increase is Fr 11.00 or )    
My supplementary insurance (VVG) decreases from   Fr    61.70 to   Fr    52.20    (decrease is  Fr  9.50 or  )

This is not automatically included in household insurance coverages, so check your policy and inform your insurance provider. You need to inform the insurance provider immediately or they might refuse to pay. 
Note that you'll probably have to pay a retention fee (Selbstbehalt) of about CHF 200.-, depending on your insurance policy, at any rate.

The new insurer picked her up and put her at a lower risk after having two accidents than the first one did when she had a clean record.   
It's definitely worth it to shop around and take other offers.

			Hi guys, I have to sign out of Switzerland, I'll do it by the end of the month.  
Unfortunately I'm 300km away, so I'm back with few other questions since I'd like to know what to expect when I get there.    
The point is: as you warned me I haven't received my healt insurance yet, despite the fact that I ordered it online on the 1st september.   
I guess I'll go and bring my permit back, pay whatever I have to pay in order to un-register, and.. what else?  
Will they ask me to pay directly there the necessary 3 months of insurance (july-september), with a provider choosed by them? And then I should cancel the contract with my insurance provider? 
Apart from the insurance, is there something else that I should know?   
Thanks in advance as usual, you've all been really helpful.

This is incorrect. I've had Telmed for 8 years. I call to announce appointments I've made with my existing physicians. I can also call for medical advice, if needed. That's the only time I've talked to physicians at the call center. There is a variant of Telmed where the advice is binding - it's a far less expensive option. There you might get different doctors.....but everything is recorded in the system. An HMO can also have you see different doctors.    
Can't help with pregnancy. I was treated for breast cancer a few years ago and the telmed option was quite easy to deal with.

""You would need suplementary insurance in case you want to be treated out of the Canton you live in. To be more precise, it will depend if the treatment you need is available or not in an   of your canton...""   
I should have said ""(...)in case you want/need to be treated in an hospital ou of the Canton you live in.""   
The basic insurance will cover the costs according to the tarif in the orignal canton. If it his more expensive and you don't have a complementary insurance, you'll need to pay the difference.

I gave birth in Norway 6 years ago, and the ""normal"" follow-up there was 1 ultrasound at approx. 20 weeks and a few visits (not even every month) to either a midwife or a GP. You may not see a gynaecologist at all (before, during or after birth). What kind of room you get is totally dependant on the hospital you give birth in, some have private rooms and some don't. No extra cost, just luck (or not).    
Supplemental insurance is nice to have, but you'll get more than adequate care on the basic package.    
Congrats!

I work in the Insurance industry and you asked questions.... and I provided answers.   
Prison is a very realistic consequence of insurance fraud.   
Albeit, for such a small sum of money it's not likely that you will go to prison, but to save a couple of hundred bucks, it's hardly worth the risk of a criminal record that will follow you around for the rest of your life.      So.... let me get this straight.   
You have asked what will happen and if it will work.   
Not one person has suggested that what you are going to do is a good idea, but you are going to do it anyway?   
OK, I'm out of this thread. 
You're on your own buddy.

294	Insurance	car accident -- claiming diminished value	superpippo	741	1	Location: Zurich	19.08.2015, 00:31	" 
			
			I would say your first point of call would be to talk to your own insurance. They will probably suggest that you have an appraisal done. If that lists any changes to original, or damage evident, and you can prove that this was a direct result of the accident, then you can chase the dealer for the diminished value for that.     
Just how evident is the change?          
Getting new paint to match the original _exactly_ is notoriously difficult. The colour is easy enough, getting a resprayed panel or door to match the original lustre and surface quality is almost impossible. An expert will spot and document this type of problem.     
Putting an exact number to the diminished value will be very difficult, but stick with it. 
See if you can find an AGB (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingung) from the dealer, and read it closely. Inform the dealer of your concerns, in writing (otherwise they have a legal out). 
Most garages don't use their insurance when somthing like this happens, they must have the insurance, but only actually use it if the car is a writeoff (otherwise the premiums go up more than if they pay the repairs themselves). 
If your car is proper top end of the market ask the appraisor if there are any lawyers specializing in classic car insurance, if yes, consult with one, but don't mention him to the dealer until it becomes clear that they aren't going to rectify the situation without you bringing out the big hammers.     
In short, it depends on the car and on the damage.  
A '53 250 Europa with one shiny door is a completely different story from a 400 with a new chrome bit without patina.

295	Insurance	Plans on abolishing the excess (franchise) in 2016?	JakubB	2198	31	Location: Lausanne	17.08.2015, 21:19	"    They could have a deposit account for higher franchises, in fact they could then allow even higher franchises safely at that point. I'd happily invest a chunk of money in a segregated account along the lines of a pillar 3a, with the option to switch back at the end of the year if I need the money, and pay a lower premium.   
Several of my UK family do this sort of thing rather than bother with any health insurance - they just invest the premiums instead, after a few years you have enough to cover any realistic costs above the NHS basic.

296	Insurance	Now is a perfect time to cancel your mandatory health insurance	Urs Max	847	0	Location: Ostschweiz	16.08.2015, 18:46	" 
			
			The contractual cancel threshold is september 30 to cancel per december 31. You get an additional cancel threshold (november 30) if the premium changes, but there's no need at all to wait for that to happen. And if your premium happens to not change you're unlikely to know before the end of september.    
If you cancel now you have the following options open until after Xmas 2015, you can act any time between now and then: 
a) sign a new contract with a different insurer (make sure it doesn't start too early) 
b) change deductibles 
c) resolve to not act, meaning you leave the contract unchanged thru 2016   
By cancelling now you lose nothing, but gain options a and b. So if you even remotely consider switching insurers you want to cancel now. Some insurers refuse to let you go if you have premiums outstanding, so make sure you have paid all dues by december 31, perhaps make the new contract conditional upon the old insurer letting you go. As there's ample time yet there's no need to use registered mail as long as you get some kind of written confirmation. However, in case of problems you may want to send a 2nd one around middle of september, registered at that time.   
You can download a cancel form  .   is useless if you need a complete(!) overview of the insurers available in your Gemeinde, in which case   (official federal information site, also features a cancel form, not available in english) is your go-to site.   
Some insureres give a small rebate if you pay in advance lump sums. For  instance KPT gives 0,5% rebate if you make 6-months payments, and 1% case of one 12month payment. I think similar applies to most  other insurers, ask them.   
This post is exclusively on mandatory health insurance. If you have additional health insurances, e.g. teeth insurance, make   sure you are Ok with the consequences, if any, of cancelling. If in doubt, ask your  current insurer before you send the cancellation.

297	Insurance	Accident/Health Insurance Hot Potato	tormund	1209	16	Location: Basel, CH	14.08.2015, 11:35	"    SUVA said the same when I had an arthroscopy on my knee last year. The damage reported (by the surgeon) was inconsistent with a sudden injury, and in fact they were right - I'd had a number of minor 'tweaks' which were getting progressively worse, and were caused mainly misalignment of the leg/knee.   
So I'm now sitting here in RennbahnKlinik, Muttenz, six days after having surgery to realign the leg (Opening Wedge High Tibial Osteotomy), to repair cartilage damage to the top of the tibia (Microfracture) , and to replace the ACL that was broken ~14 years ago in an accident.   
I'm waiting to see what happens with the bills - clearly the ACL was done an accident, but not the one I reported when I started this process, which was really just the latest time I'd done something to make me aware of the damage, and although I know exactly when I tore the ACL, and saw a doctor (who just told me to take it easy for a day or two, nothing major damaged ) it was around 13 years ago and not reported to SUVA.   
As I say, I'll wait and see. In any event I'll be over my 1500chf franchise for this year, so the cost difference to me should be just the 10% retention, but it's annoying to note that I could have handled it differently had I known what was actually wrong.

302	Insurance	"Switch from ""regular"" health insurance to Swisscare"	dfalanga	721	0	Location: Zurich	05.08.2015, 17:52	" 
			
			Hello, I am a PhD student at UZH and I have a question about the possibility to be insured with Swisscare. Currently, I am insured with Assura since I spent an internship in a company here in Switzerland before starting my PhD and I had to choose a ""regular"" (meaning not one that lets you get an exemption) health insurance (I was in Aargau). I would like to switch to Swisscare at the end of this year, does anybody know if this is possible since I am already insured with a regular insurance company? Can I just send Assura a letter where I ask to terminate my insurance at the end of the year and ask Swisscare to be insured by them, or is there some more complicated procedure to follow?   
Thank a lot! 
Cheers 
Davide

From    
Translation: You are only insured with the new insurance company after the new insurance company has informed your old insurance company of the change. IF the information isn't provided to the old insurer by the end of the year, you are still insured with the old insurer at the start of the new year and pay the old insurer's premiums. Now, at the latest, you should tell the new insurance to get this done. If the old premiums are higher than the new ones, you can - if the old insurance company is responsible for the delay - request damages.      converse in writing from now on. If anyone calls you, request the caller's email address and confirm what was said by email immediately after the call. 
And get in contact with the Ombudsman Krankenversicherung ASAP, bringing   correspondence you have with you to an appointment.

			Tesco will, but you have to to prove that the insurance was stopped in Switzerland, since you cannot have no claims on more than one policy, just having a letter stating your no claims is not enough. We managed to get one from Axa (in English) to say that the policy was closed and it was accepted. Before we did that we sent them a copy of the Abmeldung letter, but they wouldn't accept that.

The insurance company needs notification by 30 Nov for cancellation on 31 Dec, what you write it utter tosh !   
No insurance company has a 2,3,4 or 5 year policy, they are ALL 1 year policies as set out in LaMAL (That's the governing law for health insurance)    
Discount is what you employer may negotiate with ONE insurance company, depending on level of cover, cheaper policies with other companies, notably Assura may work out cheaper but less coverage.   
You best off not posting such inaccuracies it it very misleading

			Consider changing to a different basic model. Most health insurers offer you the SANTE/ health center model. Which means you visit their health center, various GPs and often additional support - midwife, physio, etc.    
They are often also cheaper than the other models, as they are part of the same company.    
As I have the FAVORIT SANTE, I've never struggled getting an appointment, and they often speak multiple languages, which helps most of us

			A health insurer will normally only 'drop' you when you have incorrectly completed the application. If you are part of a family insured with them, they will normally not terminate you, as the other people will 'pay' for your loss. The only challenge will be if you wish to increase your health insurance, which they probably will decline.  
Note that if you wish to change to another insurer, they will exclude any treatment you have planned, so better stick with the one you have

316	Insurance	How complicated is it to live in France and work in CH as a US citezen?	158Westwood	1592	12	Location: UK	18.07.2015, 12:59	"    I live just across the border (2 kilometres) south of the Geneva in a tiny hamlet near Saint Julien  , but my life is mostly based in Geneva. We moved into France to buy fourteen years ago not long after the living/working rules were finally relaxed for EU citizens, so even for us it's a relatively recent right. 
My sons still live in Geneva though, and have recent experience of the housing market, which is less tight if you can afford 5k or more, almost impossible if you can't. 
None of us have any personal experience of living north of the city, but have friends who've lived there quite happliy. But you need to pay attention to the flight paths from the airport, certain areas can be very pretty but spoilt by the almost constant noise.   
A five-bed with garden can easily set you back chf 10,000+ a month! 
Anyway, here's the current list of houses with 3 beds or more within 5 kilometeres of the city, cheapest is 3.4K, the most expensive 50k.       
You need to be aware that in Switzerland places are advertised as being so many rooms (pièce), so a three bed would be described as a 4-pièces.... three bedrooms plus a living-room.  , in Geneva the kitchen is also counted, so for a 3-bed you need to look for a 5-pièces or higher.   
Another point; deposits are usually three months rent, and there's an expectation that rent plus charges (water, heating) is no more than 1/3rd of your monthly income.

			When we traded in our car for a new one, the car dealership ""forgot"" to tell our insurance company in a timely manner to cancel the old car and we ended up paying to insure 2 cars for 3 months. I didn't get any sort of statement in the mail, nothing to sign, no contract correction - I only found out because I called about something and they asked me if I still had two cars.    
In the end the insurance company said they wouldn't refund our money because they were informed on such and such date and on that date the policy was changed - I had to recoup my costs from the car dealership.    
So best of luck, but I don't think that a lawyer will get you anywhere, beyond losing more money.

			Hi everyone!   
Does anyone know whether it is possible to have any benefit with getting a Swiss health insurance for my spouse if I'm a student in ETH Zurich?   
I used to be insured with CSS and now I have a student program from Advisor Swiss Insurance SA and it is relatively cheap - ~80 CHF/month.   
Is it possible to obtain something like this to my wife? Or do we have to apply for a standard separate insurance for her which starts ca. from 250 CHF/month?   
I know that this was possible before with SWISSCARE but according to    
SWISSCARE canceled this program.   
By the way - she is a student in the foreign University (not Swiss) if it helps and we both have B permit.   
Thanks a lot!

			My girlfriend and I are both clients of Assura. I get my bills through the site (as you found) but she gets them sent out every 3 months (with 3x 1 month bills) which costs (i think at least) a little more.   
Either way you can use the orange payment slip option (or your banks variant),  or if you get them by post you can bring them down to the post office to pay.   
I realise this has (i believe) been said above but am just confirming    
EDIT: Just had a quick look with regards setting up a standing order but found no information about it which I mean you'll have to contact them (or look better than I did   ). 
EDIT:2 Aha I found the form. On the french version of the client space you need to go to the ""services and contact"" tab, then select ""Factures"", then under the ""recherche"" drop down menu there will be links to bank payment form (standing order im guessing) or direct debit through post finance.

			Just an FYI:    
With many travel insurance policies you will need to pay upfront and then claim reimbursement. Even with plans that allow direct billing, because a traveler is a higher risk of defaulting on payment, many US hospitals will require non-residents to put a deposit payment down should you need treatment. So be prepared, possibly to the tune of five-figures.    
This is not unique to US healthcare - I've had to put down large deposits for relatives needing emergency treatment during a visit to Switzerland - but the cost of US health care is an order of magnitude more expensive.

			I have used both AXA Winterthur and Generali for household and liability insurance. Generali's rate is not the most competitive. I am trying to make a claim as well - they don't have an online submission form (in English) like AXA and the claim lady speaks very poor English and is not the friendliest. If you don't speak German, I recommend against Generali.

There are a few exceptions, starting a new contract, etc. but in general if you live in France they claim you need to contribute to their scheme; it is possible to take out Complimentary Frontalier Insurance though to cover treatment in Switzerland.

			The reference number is connected to your customer ID, which is what counts. So you can use any ""orange"" reference number for a standing order.   
ÖKK, Atupri, Assura, Sympany, KPT und Visana give you 1% rebate if you pay annually (in advance), perhaps others as well. Though switching based on that alone would be penny-wise, pound-foolish.

I then submitted the invoice to the insurance company who reimbursed the amount, less the franchise of CHF 200, in my case.   
The next thing I did for the new insurance contract was to include glass breakage cover of CHF 2000 per year.

340	Insurance	Suggestions for supplementary (additional) health insurance	makas	1977	12	Location: Zurich	13.05.2015, 23:39	"    Paracetamol is definitely covered by the basic insurance if prescribed by the doctor even the big standard tablets. It doesn't have to be the fancy coated variety.      I'm not sure what your issue is?  The standard tablet size given to adults is 2 x 500mg tablets to be taken as required once every 4 hours and not more than 8 tablets (4g per day). I've never seen paracetamol in less than 500mg per tablet form except for the kids version. 
They do also have 1g tablets here but you can always cut them in two or ask for the lower dose tablets if you only want to take 500mg. 
Paracetamol here is really no different from anywhere else.   
Paracetamol is toxic and can cause liver damage if taken in excess which us why it's important to follow the directions indicated re dosage.

The opposite can happen, in that they'll sometimes give you the option, but if they say it was repairable and are paying for it, what's your problem with that?   
And if you think it's lost any value then you need to take it back to the garage and get the repair re-done, as the only reason would be that it wasn't done properly. In other words, if it's not noticeable, it won't affect the value.

			Welcome to the Fourm. The basic, mandatory insurance does not cover IVF, although it will cover some of the preliminary things like blood tests. Depending on the age of the mother, it may cover IUI (artificial insemination).   
Private insurance may or may not cover testing and/or treatment. When evaluating which company to choose, double-check what they will cover.

351	Insurance	Who is liable to pay?	carrerclan	1592	12	Location: Bernese Oberland	06.05.2015, 23:54	" 
			
			The police/government will reimburse the hero, just have him make a  claim, perferably including a copy of the invoice (a copy of a payment  slip or of a bank transfer statement should do the trick as well I  guess).   
The bernese police law unconditionally says ""helpers will  be reimbursed for any damages incurred while helping the police"".  Zürich police law says the same so I'd expect this to apply all over  Switzerland.      §58: 
Haftung bei Hilfeleistung Dritter 
1 Dritte, die den Polizeibehörden bei der Erfüllung ihrer Aufgaben Hilfe leisten, haben Anspruch auf Ersatz des Schadens, den sie in Ausübung dieser Tätigkeit erlitten haben.   
Edit: 
3whishes, I don't think any insurance will pay if the owner loses something. For instance, you dropping your own glasses into the lake won't be reimbursed. But if somebody stepped on your glasses, or somebody else dropped your glasses into the lake, that person would be liable to reimburse you, and if he had one his 3rd party damage insurance (Haftpflichtversicherung) would pay (usually doesn't apply to close relatives and persons living in the same household).

			KVG (Basic insurance) benefits are set and equal with every provider. So maybe just change your basic insurance, which probably will save you money. Maybe keep your additional insurances with your current provider, especially if you have/had illnesses which could be excluded at the new insurer

			According to the Swiss health regulations do you have to have basic health insurance (KVG) sorted within the first three months. The start date is then the date of entry into Switzerland (register date). If you would have signed the contract after the first three months, that would be the start date of your contract, although they can 'fine' you with the premium of the date of entry, without you being able to claim any benefits for that period.    
The insurance card can only be printed once you have your permit and their system has received your AHV number (National Insurance number).

			You have to have the same cover as the basic LaMal Swiss health insurance so whichever insurer you choose will cover you for pregnancy. 
 Swisscare is accepted in some cantons and under certain conditions and will provide the same level of cover as Swiss basic insurance if you are eligible to use them so pregnancy will be covered although I'm not sure that they will cover all  the costs if you decide to give birth outside of your canton if residence.   
Any health insurance cover has to be approved by the canton of residence and there are not many non Swiss insurers who are deemed acceptable.

			What a nightmare.. you should not be in this position. The doc should have guided you through this... (I've been through something similar..so this isn't theory)   
The question - for the doctor - is simply..   
Does Swissmedic approve that drug/treatment regime for that disease ? If no.. then the doc went 'off label' and is responsible (highly unlikely)   
If yes then.. did the doc write to the insurance company making the case for treatment ? If yes then.. where's the written response ? If not.. why not ? ('It's usually covered by basic insurance' isn't an acceptable answer... for cases like this only the doc can make the medical argument as to why the treatment is necessary and why the relatively high costs are unavoidable. )

			I recommend you to follow the links in this sticky thread:   
And read the introduction of this thread, where you also can ask general insurance questions (that aren't already answered in the thread or elsewhere):    
""Basic insurance"" (""allgemein"", obligatorische Krankenpflegeversicherung, KVG) is compulsory and pretty expensive already. It covers (almost) all necessary medical treatment in (public) hospitals in the canton where you live. There is a big number of insurance companies. They all have to pay the same things. And they have to accept you as a customer, no matter what your health status is. 
With basic insurance, in some older public hospitals you will be in a room with 4 or even 6 beds. (Modern hospitals usually just have 1 or 2 bed rooms for anyone.) Sometimes it is possible to pay just a ""Hotellerie"" supplement in order to be in a more private room, without effect on what doctor will treat or operate you. (Ask in advance!)   
""Supplementary insurance"" for stationary hospital treatments (semi-private, private, in german: halbprivat/privat, VVG) is optional and very expensive. And the insurance companies can decide if they accept you or not, based on your health status. You have a more exhaustive choice of hospitals. With semi-private and private insurance, you have the right to be treated (e.g. operated) by head physicians or consultants (Chefarzt, Leitender Arzt). With semi-private, you usually get a 2-bed room, with private you get a private (1-bed) room.

358	Insurance	insurance specialist help!	wendylynn	954	5	Location: zurich	27.04.2015, 11:14	" 
			
			@wendylynn 
You need to get a so-called Accident Number (""Unfallnummer"").  That's the real door-opener.     
To get it, you might have to go round in circles a bit, at first.  You ask your doctor for one, and he/she might say that issueing the Accident Number is the job of the medical insurance.  Then you ask the medical insurance and they might say they need an accident report from the doctor.  Such a report does not have to be a Medical Report (""Arztbericht"") but merely a registration, by the doctor, of the accident (""Unfallmeldung"").     
Sometimes, the doctor or the medical insurance may tell you to do this yourself, and you can download a form on Helsana's website.  There, give all the dates and times, policy numbers, names and addresse, etc. buuuuut.... describe the accident in very few details, so no-one can later diminish your benefits on the basis of some phrase you innocently use.   
All that I've written here applies just as well to the rounds you might have to go through with the HR department at your place(s) of employment, if you are employed, or with SUVA, where your employer should have insured you, or with any hospitals which are/were involved in the treatment.  Hospitals are supposed to report accidents automatically, but do not always do so, largely because they lack the staff to keep phoning around.   
The thing to do is to persevere until you have an Accident Number.  It may take you a lot of phonecalls. Collect all names, direct phone numbers and email addresses along the way, and note the dates of your contact..     
If you meet with a ""no"" at every point, and every one of the above tells you that someone else is responsible, then write a polite mail to all of them at once, asking for their advice on how to get the Accident Number, since the sum of letter of DATE from Herr T and the phonecall with Frau M in department Q, etc. (list them all, names and dates) has not yet yeilded an Accident Number.   
There is a small chance that you might, in fact, not be insured for some or all (at work, on the way to and from work, or also freetime) accidents.  This could happen if you do not have an employer at all, or have one for less than 8 hours per week.     
In these cases, you should specifically have bought accident insurance from Helsana, your medical insurance (""Krankenkasse"") since the basic package is for being sick (krank)  and not for accidents.  But how any non-insurance-specialist is supposed to know this small detail, when first insuring themselves....!!??    
Having said that, some employment perks may include programms by which non-employed spouses are also covered for accidents.   
If your accident costs will be not just expensive, annoying or painful, but would really cripple you financially, you may be eligible to get help from the municipality (""Gemeinde"") within the Social Security benefits.

			Hello everyone,    
Thank you for all of the information you shared with me.    
I'd like to update my case. I received the reimbursement already, which is around 1 month after I sent them my claim and a reminding email.    
From January 1, 2013 they are obliged to withdraw an excess of 10% from every compensatory claim. This is based on the Swiss Health Care Benefits Ordinances (KLV). So I got less than the bill I paid, which is about 1000fr. less   but I'm happy with their response and the prompt procedure.   
Thank you everyone and I wish you a good coming weekend.   
Cheers.

Anyway OP, I had another thought today - if you're currently here and registered properly, you already have insurance and have provided that information to the authorities when you registered. AFAIK you can only change basic insurance once a year - in the fall - and the change takes effect on 01 January.    
All this shopping around and looking for rules   be wasting your time if A) your current plan won't cover you more than 6 months and B) you can't change plans.

			Citing  
""In non-EU / EFTA countries you can recover the costs of medical emergency treatment, but only up to a maximum of twice what the same treatment would have cost in Switzerland.""   
You can also read this in the product sheet of Arcosana AG's basic health insurance (standard model). FYI: CSS Holding AG owns Arcosana AG, INTRAS Kranken-Versicherung AG & Sanagate AG.   
""Cover for costs incurred in emergencies for outpatient or inpatient treatment in the general ward up to a maximum of twice the tariff of the canton of residence in Switzerland. Special conditions apply in EU States (incl. Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein and Norway) as determined in the Bilateral Agreements""   
However, on the contract (or product sheet?) of Assura, nothing is mentioned regarding this (or I could not find it).     
Worst case scenario, it seems that your insurance will pay up to twice what it would cost in your canton of residence in Switzerland. Which seem to only be possible in the USA, Canada, Australia & Japan.   
Here is another good resource from a governmental website: 
""Compulsory health insurance only covers reimbursable treatment and services carried out in Switzerland by licensed providers. Exceptions are made for medical treatment that is necessary during temporary stays abroad.""

364	Insurance	Which insurance model suites me with chronic situation?	aska	3383	42	Location: Zurich	10.04.2015, 18:36	" 
			
			Wow, a big thank you to all above, Joga-trn, Swissish, edot, fatmanfilms, Angela, fatmanfilms, Marsalforn, Odile, catandmouse (I hope I did not miss anyone) you shared your experience and gave me your pratical suggestions. Perhpas I am too new in the forum and could not Thank the thread you made, so I write it here.   
What you said did answer my concerns of GP and HMO model- the limited list of the specialist and may not access best ones when necessary. I have been treasted for over 3 years back in my country before I came here, and the treatment was blood test and ultrasound to make sure everything in under control or even make some better progress, and got the perscription from the specialist.  I suppose I should do the same here. So GP is not necessary for such follow ups except for the first time referral.   
But from your above disscussion, I found that both Telmed and standard seemed both have the freedom to see the specialist. What's the difference then?

			Did you sign anything regarding the complementary insurance?   
I've moved jobs a couple of times and in both cases the default was basic insurance, with some extra options that had to be specifically agreed within a time period before they lapsed.   
If you think you didn't - ask the insurance for proof you signed up for it. We had a similar issue where they swore we'd signed up for something that we hadn't, and didn't back down until we demanded a copy of the signed contract.   
Also I'd suggest you pay the basic amount - at least that way you're covered for the legal minimum.

			Hi everyone. 
I have question about importing car from US with US plates. 
Based on a search on this forum I could not really get concrete understanding about process. 
We are moving to Switzerland in the middle of this year. I am getting door to door car relocating service to bring our 2012 hybrid car with us to CH. From my understanding, I can buy Green Card insurance and will be able to drive this car  in CH until Green Card insurance expires or until I will make my car complaint with CH laws, and pass inspection. 
Am I correct, or am I missing something. 
Greatly appreciate for your replies.

			Are you PhD student or Mater/Bachelor student? Since PhD students usually have an employment contract with the University (and thus a salary) some cantonal authorities may not accept Swisscare. For other students without salary, Swisscare should be fine. The best thing to do is contact directly Swisscare, explain your situation and they can provide you with the right information. (or point out where to get it)

380	Insurance	Signed up with an insurer - too late to pull out?	Scot92	1721	13	Location: Zurich	15.03.2015, 18:46	"    Not precisely. I'll specify:   
If OP has an accident there will not be any costs charged to him/her if s/he is employed for at least 8 hours per week.    
If OP is not employed but claiming unemployment benefits, s/he's insured with SUVA which also means that no costs will be charged to him/her in case of an accident.    
If OP is neither employed nor on unemployment benefits, OP is   to take out accident insurance with his/her health insurance company, in which case costs will be charged exactly as they would in case of illness.   
So - costs will only be charged to OP if s/he  , in which case health insurance will cover whatever exceeds OP's retention fee (Selbstbehalt, 10% of bills exceeding the yearly deductible, max. CHF 700/year) and deductible (Franchise, CHF 300-2500) as well as possibly some extras which OP signed up for to save on premiums (e.g. health insurance will not pay for the first couple hundred CHF of a hospital stay, but charges OP e.g. 10% less in premium costs each month).

			Well, the way it used to work for us with CSS is that we paid the bill and then sent it to CSS who reimbursed us, less whatever our portion to pay was.  Nowadays though the bills are sent straight to CSS and we get a bill from them to pay our portion.     
Depending on your policy you may be limited to which doctors you can see so really you need to talk to your insurance company if you don't understand the contract.  If necessary make an appointment with them to discuss it, if you don't get the answers you need over the phone.

			I was told by both my dentists that dental insurances are a scam here. 90% of the time they won't pay for anything that had the slight suspicion of preexisting conditions.   
If you are 30+ chances are lots of your teeth had some slight work done to them, anything that is is excluded.   
I prefer to put the same money aside every month and do my checkups in Germany, Greece etc as they can be scheduled while on holidays/weekend etc.   
For any real emergencies like root canals etc chances are you'll end up paying the whole thing.

This however is completely separate from the deposit you have paid. This money instead is used for small damages and for non payment of rent. In other words if you have managed to put holes in the wall and forgotten to tippex them then you are left needing to pay SFr 200 for a specialist to come in and ""mend"" the damage. It is not worth activating your insurance as you need to pay the first 200 francs, and as you deliberately caused the damage the insurance is anyway not valid.  
Sign up whenever you like for such insurance policies. Note they don't cover your property at all...

For three additional insurance I pay year CHF 729.60 (completa top, praeventa and optima), but I checked for last year, and I received CHF 670 back for my gym membership (CHF 740 - aktiv fitness), CHF 100 for the dentist and CHF 120 for lenses. And if I spend more on glasses/lenses there was still some money to be had. So actually I made money by having this additional insurance. Ok, their basic favorit model Sante is the cheapest with them, but you can find cheaper. Overal I still feel I have a good deal. And my advisor is quick to respond.

			Normal basic Swiss health insurance will cover you for emergency treatment abroad, up to twice the equivalent cost in Switzerland.  
Breaking your leg would be covered by accident insurance, which is normally provided by your employer, if you are working. You would need to check with their policy to see how you are covered.

396	Insurance	death and disability insurance	marmsg	1771	10	Location: Zug	08.02.2015, 20:56	" 
			
			For IV disability - to compute the disability amount one gets, there are several issues taken into consideration:   
1. one has to prove (even if one lived outside the country) that they have contributed to the AHV without a break in their working years 
2. the salary earned each year 
3. the amount paid into AHV.   
There is a ""voluntary AHV payment"" for those living abroad, and I am not sure how ""double taxation"" plays into it. Are contributions to the foreign country's social security insurance (CPP in Canada) equivalent to AHV or transferable? I don't think so, or it doesn't look like it.   
One can apply in all countries of (significant?) tax contribution for disability. It sucks if the exchange rate works against you. Whatever benefits you get from abroad will be taken into account in Switzerland.   
Children get a benefit and I think the amount varies by canton.

Health insurance premiums are published by the federal government -   - so there is perfect transparency.   
The fact that you are not aware of the fact that health insurance premiums are tied to your place of residence by law (""premium region"" -  ) is unfortunate.   
Case in point: If I was to move 6 km, I would be paying any one of three different health insurance premiums, some higher, some lower, depending on the direction (north, west, east) I was to move. And all of that using exactly the same health insurance.

There is a difference between deliberately withholding the information which is what you said in your first post and the information not being widely circulated which is what you said in your second.   
Whether the campaigns were underhand, dishonest or whatever does not alter the fact that the premium increases were known to the voters before the vote. Whether they chose to read them and were influenced by them in the way they voted is something we will never know.

			greencelery, how are you planning to fly to Oz?  Direct from Switzerland or could you go via the UK?  If the latter then your booking might be covered under ATOL.       
You can get this cover if you book through ebookers.com for example.         
It would depend on you having at least one night in an hotel as well (flight/hotel) or maybe you could book the campervan part as well as the flight which would be covered as car hire.   
Otherwise, I think it's just a risk you have to take.  Which is why you should go for well established/well known organisations and not necessarily aim for the cheapest option.

			As she is not registered here, she is not legally obliged to have health insurance and until she does register she will not get it as no insurance company is going to touch this unless they have to, legaly.   
As she is Swiss, her commune of origin is obliged to accept her registration irrespective of the circumstances.    
The commune will then decide, based on a means test whether she can recieve a subsidy or not for health insurance. She may chose which insurance company she goes with for basic health care, they CANNOT refuse the application.   
As she has both US and Swiss citiztenship, this may change things a little, especially if she has been living so long in the US, (30 years)

			The Ehic card will conver her for emergencies only. If for instance she has an accident (and I am pretty sure accidents are covered by EHIC- will have to re-check)- but it will not cover further treatment, or repatriation, etc. Should she need further treatment after the 'emergency' part- she would have to return home, at own cost. Not too bad if you can jump on EasyJet or similar, but with a severe injury or illness, she may need a private ambulance, etc. Just does not bear thinking about.   
So really, much much better if she gets Travel insurance for the first 3 months.

			When you move, call the insurance company with your new address (they will need this anyway). We moved, but our address changed as of January so I don't know if they change you mid year or end of year.    
You have a franchise or deductable somewhere between 2500 and 300. The higher the deductable, the lower your monthly costs. Once you've satisfied this, your max out of pocket is chf 700.

411	Insurance	Which insurance do you suggest?	merog	1199	3	Location: Zurich	29.01.2015, 13:31	" 
			
			Hi Merog!   
First of all, congratulations if you are or plan on getting pregnant!    
To answer your question, there are two elements to take into account: The LAMal Health Care insurance and the Prenatal insurance.     : 
It's a mandatory and basic health care insurance which provides for the legal basic payments in case of sickness, accidents and also maternity. In case of maternity, the  basic health insurance covers the costs of the following but not only:   
- 7 Check-ups during pregnancy, post-natal care and breastfeeding advice. 
- Giving birth in hospital, at a birthing center or at home. 
- Ultrasound scans and tests for high-rish pregnancy.   
Your health insurance also fully covers the costs of your baby's stay in hospital following the birth. BUT if your baby becomes ill, this is covered by the baby's insurance. Therefore, it is better to organise the baby's own health insurance before he/she is born.    
To choose a suitable insurance, you can eihter compare your options ( )  or consult an health insurance expert ( ).     :   
You can get personalised and professional advice about prenatal insurance so that you can enjoy your pregancy without any worries. For example with CONCORDIA Baby Bonus ( )   
At the end of your message you mentionned the word franchise in brackets. I had the feeling you maybe weren't sure what it exactly meant. 
The Franchise is a contribution towards your total annual medical cost. It is calculated as a percentage of your total annual medical costs and capped at a yearly limit. By choosing to pay a higher yearly franchise, you can lower your monthly insurance premiums (for example if you are not getting ill much). 
If you have further question about the franchise, you can get some help from an health insurance specialist CF Prestaflex. I hope I helped answering your question!

			I made another call to my insurance company.    
They stated that they made a ""mistake"",  thinking those aids were for illness , not for pregnancy. Thus billed them to me, but now they will correct.   
Actually I know , they should have covered it even if the aids were for an illness not related to pregnancy    
But anyway, I am glad that this looks to be resolved quicker than I expected    
Now looking forward to see the correction on papers.   
So, thanks a lot to everyone for commenting & responding   "	Posts: 38	Join Date: Mar 2012	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 8 Times in 6 Posts	earned some respect

			Something to be aware of:   
Even with travel medical insurance, you might find that your folks (or you) are required to put down a deposit before being treated here. Or that you, the Swiss resident, might be required to sign a guarantee of payment.   
In a life-or-death emergency your folks would be treated right away - but something needing timely attention but less than that level of urgency may require some kind of payment upfront.   
I would assume that each hospital or doctor would have their own policies for dealing with non-residents, so you might not run into this - but be prepared. You might even call your local hospital and ask how they would handle non-resident patients, with or without recognized/accepted travel medical insurance.   
Hope you find a solution.

			Once it's been used for a while the big value isn't in the hardware, but the software, data, and maybe all the bookmarks, settings, passwords, etc.    
None of these is covered by any insurance.   
Your best insurance is to make backups regularly on a separater medium (CD/DVD for example) and keep your license keys and passwords somewhere safe. Best of all: this is virtually free.

unfortunatly not in English as yet.   
Unfortunately, it is not up to you how fancy you get with your insurance, if you have pre-existing conditions. Basic insurance has to accept you with pre-exisiting condtions- but most insurances will exclude those, or even turn you down flatly, for the more 'fancy' supplementary bits, like private, choice of consultant or hospital. The only people I know who have been accpeted for such were very very lucky that it was due to them being part of massive contracts via the large businesses they work for.

			I discovered this week that my legal guardian changed my health insurance from Assura to Galenos... and 'forgot' to tell me, send me my new health insurance card, my policy documents etc...   
I've been on their website and it's rubbish. I can't find out how it works (e.g. do I pay bills and send to them for reimbursement, ditto for prescriptions)... Does anyone have any experience with them?   
I have a lot of healthcare costs so it's important I understand the system...   
And (most inconveniently) I found out today I have to go to hospital tomorrow for an urgent scan and, depending on the results, possible surgery. My general doctor thinks it should be OK if I explain what has happened and that I don't have my policy number yet... does anyone have experience of doing this?   
Help... (my legal guardian is going to get an earful the next time I see him).

			In case it helps anyone later, I found this insurance which broadly allows you to package up ski and travel cover. Switzerland is counted as Europe from their perspective and you are therefore covered worldwide.       
The best mountain based cover I found was with the   though this doesn't have the travel elements I wanted, it does come with a huge range of benefits around outdoors activity and a club membership, which depending on the club can open the doors to a lot of (French spoken) activity. I'll be joining for sure once my French is better.

			I'm always confused by these threads. When you say ""doesn't pay"" do you mean no coverage at all or do you mean subject to franchise/deductible.    
I've seen a gyn yearly since arriving in 2007 and my yearly gyn exam is covered subject to my franchise. Of course I'm way too old to have a child.    
I do understand that pregnancy comes out of a different pot.

Here, it's not uncommon for the doctors to send a patient to rehabilitation post surgery / hospital stay.  This can be on a day-patient or residential basis, and means easy and intensive access to physio, massages, psych if one wishes / needs it, dressing changes and minor medical needs attended to (e.g. fluids per IV, drainage of healing wounds).   
When the docs recommended it for Mr. Heckenhocker post-surgery, I took a big gulp...thinking OK, maybe I can auction off an arm and a leg.  Nope...the basic insurance paid for the whole thing.   
And his return to fitness after three weeks re-hab post hospital was far better /quicker than the first time round of the same extent of surgery (in the UK, without rehab).     
Just something else to consider before you decide which route is right for you.  Oh, isn't complex medical need decision making fun!!   "	Posts: 23	Join Date: Jan 2015	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 2 Times in 1 Post	Thanked 5 Times in 4 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Going through the similar situation myself. 
I am on basic insurance with 2500chf deductible. 
I had my 1st ob-gyn visit at 8w5d. Doctor found out that the baby  stopped growing at 6/7 wks and that there is no heartbeat. She asked me  to come back a few days later to re-check in case my days were off.. No  change at 2nd checkup so she proposed a pill or d&c. I have opted  out for a pill ( she ruled out waiting as it could take weeks and cause  complications). Unfortunately the pill didnt work for me so i am now  scheduled for d&c. I have already received bills for my 3 visits (  they dont waste here with bills do they?) and they are all issued under  maladie. This is somewhat bizarre to me as i thought that all pre-natal  checks are ""free of charge/ free of franchise= automatically covered by insurance"".. Well guess, not if  there are complications.. I suspect i will have to cover d&c as well  even if its not by my choice.. Has someone been in similar situation? What was your billing outcome? Did you managed to get first ob-gyn visits and d&c covered by insurer directly  and not pay out of your pocket/franchise? TIA

			Here is something in English which says what is covered under a basic insurance.       
Depending on how much the eye examination cost, what other medical costs you have had in the year, and how large your 'franchise' (own contribution: usually 300 to 2'500 francs) is, you might not get anything, even if the examination is, in principle, covered by the insurance.

449	Insurance	UVG - recommendations?	Olivita	1148	1	Location: Basel	09.05.2014, 11:16	" 
			
			Hi Olivita, 
for certain groups of employees the insurer SUVA is mandatory to use. However, even though I don't know exactly what kind of work your employee is doing but I assume in your case you can choose from any insurer. The permium for this policy is dependent mainly from the kind of work (risk) your employee is doing and it is determined every year by the Swiss goverment. So changing your insurer might not change your premium. However, it's certainly worth getting some offers from big insurers like SUVA, CSS, CONCORDIA or HELSANA.   
Alternatively, check out the list with all UVG insurer:   "	Posts: 33	Join Date: Jul 2009	Junior Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 18 Times in 6 Posts	considered knowledgeable

			At the time of signing the contract, I was told by the Notary that I have one month to cancel the Insurance that the previous owner took for the house otherwise it will automatically get transferred in my name. The previous owner  had two insurances for the house. One was the mandatory insurance callled ECAB which I have to takeover anyway as I understand. The other called, ""Assurance des batiment"" was taken from AXA by the seller. The agent he got the insurance policy from works at an agency for AXA in Fribourg. The seller says that he has already called and cancelled this insurance for himself.   
- Do I need to cancel the ""Assurance des batiment"" by sending a letter as well?  
- Where do I send the cancellation letter?

			As noted above, if you stay you need mandatory medical insurance.    
This is the same no matter what insurer you chose, but some are (much) more expensive than others. Also, (especially!) at your age you want to chose the highest excess available unless you have a medical condititon that brings annual costs above the CHF 1000 range. Check out available offers at    
If you don't get insurance within three months after entering (also noted above) the authorities are likely to pick one in your stead, and that probably won't be the best solution for you.

Addition.

464	Insurance	Assura insurance question on medications	BTLC	3232	13	Location: Morges	14.11.2014, 15:17	"    Sports are covered by accident insurance, not by health insurance. An employee is insured against against accidents by his/her employer (if s/he works at least 8 hours a week). It seems to me you absolutely want to check if your wife has that option subscribed as part of her health insurance.    
The additional cost by increased excess is typically recovered in less than two years of no health issues (actual annual costs below 230CHF) by the reduced premiums paid. So if you're (resonably) healthy you want the highest excess available, and if necessary use the savings to increase your reserves. Presumably insurance brokers are paid by premium volume generated, thus they want you to pay more rather than less, and advise accordingly.   
You can switch excess at least twice a year (with 3 months avance notice), plus at the end of November if premiums change. So if you develop a condition you need to wait a maximum of nine months until a change in excess becomes effective.

			Hi Strunty,   
There is absolutely no difference in the level of cover for the basic insurance with full choice of doctor. The price difference comes from the fact that each health insurance company must balance their books for the basic insurance. Higher claims means higher premiums.   
You can find all the official prices for the basic insurance for all companies on    
While the level of cover doesn't differ, there are differences between the various insurance companies in terms of customer service, whether they provide English support and documentation, how quickly they process reimbursements etc 
Hope this helps.

			Kolping says they can't keep the dental insurance going because the base insurance has been canceled. I'm not much into insurance, but IMHO this reasoning alone does make it a ""Zusatzversicherung"" (supplementary).   
Btw, very little ""dental"" is covered by basic insurance. The typical hole, or cosmetics, are not covered. What is covered are actual illnesses, for instance periodontitis.

469	Insurance	Anyone heard of Bupa Insurance?	ihtxam	1377	5	Location: Neuchatel	26.11.2014, 01:19	"    It won't work.... Their basic worldwide plan only covers in-patient hospital treatment, it does not cover outpatient doctors consultations. You'd have to take all the options included (worldwide/worldwide plus/medicines, etc.) to get anywhere near the swiss basic health insurance, and even then the cover levels will not be sufficient. Plus there is the ""pre-existing conditions"" issue.   
Some people have tried getting the cantons to approve them using Bupa instead of the mandatory swiss insurance with very limited success. You'd have to prove that you have some very special medical circumstances and it's a great wall to climb administratively.   
All things considered the swiss basic insurance is actually quite good and well worth the money IMHO - plus you can reduce your premium if you consider yourself ""low risk"".     the Bupa Worldwide cover works very well and is very good as as a ""supplementary"" option on top of the basic health insurance for in-hospital treatment, particularly if you prefer being treated into private clinics and chose your own surgeon instead of going to the public hospitals.

471	Insurance	Why the Hausratversicherung [home contents insurance] is so cheap	chiheng	2369	7	Location: Zurich	01.10.2014, 22:16	" 
			
			It's not just what you pay, but also what damages need to be paid with the premium.    
Total insured value of the buildings (residential plus commercial combined,  without any contents such as your furniture):  
2100 Mrd CHF,  typical total annual damage around 600Million CHF.  
So statistically speaking one million insured value will cause about 350CHF in claims every year, 360k insured value about 160CHF in claims.   
Number of fires (alerts for the firefighters): 20'000 each year thus the average alarm is cause for 30'000 CHF damage claims (600mln total divided by 20k fires). Obviously most fires are smaller ones, e.g. a burning hearth with a destroyed kitchen, xmas-tree that devastates the living room, etc.    
How does that translate to your rented apartment?   
Let's assume you pay 1500CHF rent (without heating etc), that's 18k per year, which would typically be around 5% of the apartment value, thus the apartment is worth around 360k which (see above) will cause annual claims of about 160CHF. If you have your furniture insured for 36k that's 10%of the apartment value, thus it will cause damage claims of about 16CHF (one tenth of the claims caused by the building) per year.   
I would prefer to leave it at that as that's how far I got solid numbers, but unfortunately this is just a very broad and probably rather incomplete back-of-the-envelope calculation.   
Here's why: 
A fire in your living room may do very little direct damage to the building but, due to the residual smell, still require major overhaul(which would probably be paid by your ""Hausratsversicherung"" too, assuming the fire was caused by you), so the calculation above may be quite silly when compared to the actual figures. But I lack the info for that so here you are.   
One more thing: 
Real estate insurance in CH is heavily regulated, the insurers of buildings are even part of the kantonal government and thus not-for-profit. This definitely helps keep costs low, even though many US-americans would probably be inclined to call it socialistic.

			Summary:   
If you work more than 8 hours per week for a company or individual, you are employed by them. You must inform your employer if you have an accident. Physiotherapy is usually covered by the accident insurance. Often the bill is sent straight to the employer. If you send the bill for an accident to your health insurance, they will return it unpaid (see last paragraph).   
The compulsory employer's accident insurance pays for all your accidents: in work and out of work, even when you are abroad & on holiday. Even unemployed people registered with the RAV or ORP are covered for personal accident injuries. The insurance covers you for injuries during employment, up to 3 months after you leave the employment (<- check the 3 month period).   
If you are   employed, or receiving  , you need to inform your health insurance, and buy accident insurance cover.

			Apply in January- with start date 1st of Jan- you have 3 months to do this- but it is always back dated to date of arrival, both in payment and effect. So... if an emergency happens to you on 30 or 31st of December (and really odds are it won't) then you still apply in Jan but put date as 30th December- but you will have to pay for whole month. We found out the hard way, as we put our arrival dates, I think it was 29th March... and had to pay for whole month, which we found a bit of a pain just for a few days.

			From what I can gather, any dental insurance will be based on a previous thorough dental inspection, with x rays - and if problems show up, they will either exclude such or make you pay a very high premium to cover. So, if you basically have healthy teeth and gums, it is not worth paying for insurance. And if problems are anticipated, wisdom teeth, etc, then the cost of insuring would be prohibitive.

If it comes back, send it to your son's insurance, enclosing copy of letter from your insurance company. Wait and see, insurance can be complicated!

We had a similar thing (but not doctors) We just told them to get on with it, and by by and have a nice day.     
Never heard any thing again     
Just give them an Email (as good as a registered letter) with all the details, and that should be the end of things.

500	Insurance	Unemployment. Language Courses	garfield185	2971	37	Location: Vaud	22.10.2014, 16:18	"    If you are on an intensive training course other than something they setup for you, then you are not available for work, so no benefits...   
You normally need to demonstrate to the RAV that you are unable to find work without such classes... and even if they do agree to language courses they certainly will not pay for such courses abroad - the SVP would have a field day with something like that!      You can go to seek work, if they agree to it, but again this is something that comes up after you have actually tried to find work here.  The alternative is that you accept that you will have to pay everything yourself and accept and penalties or reductions the RAV may decide to hand out.

We have had a number of claims on several different policies over the years (car insurance, home insurance, liability insurance, travel insurance) with some of those claims running into 10s of thousands of francs. We haven't always gotten 100% of what we were asking for but I think we have been fairly treated and we have not had any nasty surprises.

If they deny you should still have the chance to choose your own insurer after you get the reply [as it is the same authority who chooses an insurer for you that makes the decision]. In case of denial I recommend Swisscare. This is definitely accepted by the Zurich authorities if you are a student.

My policy states that the household contents are insured at replacement value (I guess this is equivalent to your ""new-for-old policy"").   
But I think this is different from the sum of compensation. The way I understand my policy is that even if the household contents are replaced at the new values, the sum compensation will be capped at the new lower value.   
In your case, your premium increases yearly but your compensation sum stays the same?

If you did not get any other meds, call your insurance for an explanation, they should provide you with the original bills sent to them by the pharmacy so you can check if a mistake was made

			Hello EF, longtime reader, recent poster...   
I know there is no ""one size fits all"" and I have certainly used the search function, but I still have not made my mind:   
I am looking to choose an insurance for me and my family (man, wife, baby 2yr old) and wanted:   
- basic and supplementary insurance (will decide later if it is 300, 2.500,...) 
- english speaking phone/email/written support/brochure/documentation 
- private room (in Zug where I live, or Zurich if I decide I want a hospital there, or elsewhere for that matter...) 
- ""global"" coverage (be able to go to my own doctors while abroad too) for emergency and non emergency 
- dental (do they cover cleanings and cavities?) 
- vision (glasses, lenses?) 
-  
Among other things...   
Also, is there ANY provider that allows me to KEEP my insurance if and when I move out of Switzerland?  The problem is, where I live now, I have insurance.  If I cancel this insurance, and only stay in Switzerland for 5-7 years, when I come back, will be very hard and/or expensive to get the same insurance again, so it would be best to keep the Swiss insurance ""forever""....  Does that exist with anyone/provider?   
I have spoken with two brokers and some only worked with ""xyz companies"" and others worked with ""abc companies""...   
I have also gone to comparis, and individual sites to check and read everything,... but I am resorting to the EF community to give me their views on the matter.   
Thanks in advance,

We have been paying tax, AHV, pension and all others like every Swiss employee.Due to certain cost reasons, the contract is being terminated at the end of 10 months, instead of 1 year.Iam told that we can receive refund of pension but not the AHV.Is this true ? I read somewhere that if the spouse is also working and is contributing to AHV, then we can claim if the contribution is less than 1 year..is this true? Iam really worried because it is a huge amount for the two of us.Please suggest and help.Thanks in advance !

If the garage assumes that the invoice will be paid by insurance the estimate might be higher. Because ... some customers expect the garage to repair one or the other older little damage that has nothing to do with the incident at the same time. My advice: make it very clear that you will have to pay the invoice yourself and that you don't want a luxurious repair, only what is absolutely necessary. If the estimate is high: get a ""second-opinion-estimate"" from another garage.

538	Insurance	Effect of claiming on house insurance	Andrew9039	847	3	Location: Canton Zürich	01.09.2014, 20:48	"    Nope. Not correct. Landlord is responsible for the damage and his building insurance company should take care of this. So you need his insurance information. It is also possible to have your insurance company contact his to argue it out. That is also an option. But clearly you are not responsible for the event unless you had something to do with blocking the sewage pipe (i.e. putting foreign objects down the drain or toilet.)   
If you have the name of the company who unblocked the pipes do be sure to give this to your insurance company.   
In cases like this photos of the damage and an inventory of what was in your cellar is useful. I always advise clients never to keep anything directly on the cellar floor. Use shelving. Mostly I advicse this because because of dampness but now I have another good reason.

539	Insurance	Health insurance for a baby with extra needs	nirak	1935	16	Location: Lausanne	26.08.2014, 14:13	"    He is quite right regarding being turned down for supplemental insurance once baby is born and the condition is known -  even totally none related cover.  Our son is autistic and we got supplemental insurance for him before he was born.  Aside from his condition - which is entirely covered by the IV system and not health insurance - he is in rude health and does not visit the doctor from one year to the next - but we cannot change supplemental insurance we obtained before his birth as given his autism, no one would cover him for supplemental insurance.   
Have you asked the doctors about the IV at all?

They are useful for workers that for some reasons are not covered by the usual swiss system.

Mica, we are pretty sure we want the family doctor program as it sounds most like what we were used to in UK and it worked for us there.  If the other models are better then we'll change at renewal when we are a bit more savvy!   
What happens here in terms of going on vacation?  Do you have to include overseas cover in your plan or can you take out travel insurance for the 2 weeks (or whatever) that you go?  Are we still covered with our EHIC cards for vacations? (As we still own property in the UK, wonder if that means we can still be classed as residents...) and for that matter when we go back to the UK can we still use the NHS?    
There is so much to consider!  This is why I have been putting it off   "	null	null	null	null	null	null

Your Italian health insurance provides the same benefits as Swiss insurance would for the duration of your stay. This works if you are a student staying temporarily.    
If you were to get a job in Switzerland, you would need (to switch to) Swiss insurance.   
Simply send the copy of your italian card and an   from your university to the cantonal authorities as suggested   by the university itself.

			So sorry to hear your bikes have been stolen- but really no-one can help you on a Forum- you need to talk to your insurance- as each insurance, and each policay, can be vastly different.   
We are with La Mobillière, and expensive bikes would have to be declared as individual items if over a certain value- and cost of insuring would depend if they are kept in a private always locked area, a public area which is always locked, a public area unlocked, etc, etc. You really need to look at the small print of your insurance policy for detailed conditions.   
Valuable items,be they bikes, or jewellery, watches, cameras, etc- have to be insured as single items to be covered.

I believe they can sell just supplemental. A few years ago, we had Innova for the basic and in 2011, they shifted (sold, I assume) all their basic customers to Visana under the VivaCare product. Innova now concentrates on the supplemental market, afaik.    
Whether there is a complicated corporate structure beneath this, I don't know.

			If you go to Comparis and look at the ratings of pretty much   insurance company, you find some people complaining that reimbursements take forever while other people who have insurance with the same company say it's always been easy and fast for them.    
I have no idea why that is. Maybe it depends on which branch office is handling your account, maybe some companies don't like customers with an R in their names, who knows. But it explains why there is no agreement (here on EF either) about which company is ""the best"".

Having locked horns with the Spanish authorities myself, my impression is they always get their way. It was nothing as serious as your case but basically the authorities didn't accept my version of events and I had to pay a fine for something that wasnt true. My Spanish friends say that Spanish judges don't like to take definite decisions and so cases can drag on for many years and usually stop not when they get a definite ruling but when one side runs out of money or interest.    
I don't want to discourage you but make sure you find a lawyer who genuinely wants to help you and who wants to win rather than wanting to suck money out of your pockets for doing nothing.

			By far the best package for holiday accidents or illness in CH or abroad is REGA- their services are fabulous. 
They will liaise with any hospital around the world- checking that the services, facilities, conditons and treatment are ok- and if they have any concern, will send a privat plane or helicopter, with doctor and nurse- to pick you up- any time, any where- and for the price of a meal for a full year. A charity- and you are covered when you become a donor/member (OH loves it, as his REGA card says 'Gonner'  ). 30CHF for one person, 60 per couple and 70 per family- best value-ever.

572	Insurance	Experiences with new TCS Insurance for health expenses abroad?	Nukles85	1481	0	Location: Bern	15.07.2014, 00:26	" 
			
			Hi everyone,   
I used to have the ETI with TCS covering accidents abroad. Now they sent me a letter proposing a contract that basically for 50 CHF more per year I get reimbursement for all the health expenses incurred abroad.   
I didn't pay too much attention to it as I usually do here in Switzerland when insurances ask you for more money for some stuff you don't really need, then I double-checked and I saw that I am paying actually more than 50 CHF per month to cover me and my partner with the complementary insurance TOP from Helsana... which I basically use only for getting the 200 CHF reimbursement for fitness and some treatment abroad (which they cover only up to a certain amount, and 90%).   
I am considering cancelling the Helsana TOP and getting the TCS one, but I don't know if there's a catch somewhere? Anyone got any experience with the TCS insurance?   
Thanks.

			If you tell us where you are going to be- perhaps one of us could check with a local renal surgeon if the medication you are taking is available in Switzerland- and if not which is given instead- so you can discuss it with our surgeon in India beforehand (as said above, lowest franchise possible in your case- as it will be cheaper in the long run.

Insurance for a classic car has a restricted mileage clause (it's really low).   
Do you really think insurance companies haven't worked this all out yet?   
So, for all the posters who think this is a cool tip to be passed on, it's not, and could prove very expensive - if you need to make a claim on your insurance.

Basically you'll need to pay in as long as you are mostly in the Swiss social system regardless of your address.   
Second question: If you happen to work for a Swiss company and they send you on a short term assignment abroad but keep you in the Swiss system in terms of pension fund and social insurances do you also need to keep your Swiss health insurance.

582	Insurance	How to submit to SUPRA Basic Insurance for reimbursement?	camima	3015	5	Location: Lausanne, VD	18.02.2013, 08:31	" 
			
			Hello,   
I wanted to follow up on this topic, in case someone has a similar question at some point, as I figured out how that works quite a while ago now and have been reimbursed a couple of times. 
In fact, getting reimbursed by Supra is a very easy process. They provide an online form that needs to be filled out, printed out and sent to them together with all the original receipts from pharmacies and doctors. Scan or copy those and keep for your records before you sent them. 
Once they receive it, they confirm it via email and then, everybody's favorite moment, they issue reimbursement  
It takes a couple of weeks to get reimbursed and the receipts can be submitted anytime of the year.

When we sorted out health insurance just before our baby's birth, we got a deal which included dental cover (and an increased worldwide supplementary coverage) for FREE for THREE years! So it's a good idea to shop around.

It's not a question of a list of hospitals that *exists* but rather a list of hospitals that your insurance will *accept*. Also note that in many cases of emergencies you dont have a choice of hospital but you have to go to the nearest one (hence emergency).

			I have had both KPT and SWICA and can give the following comments:   
SWICA is slightly more expensive, but contact with them has been more pleasant, and they seem to be willing to actually help you where possible.   
KPT is slightly cheaper, but contact with them is more difficult. They seem a little more rude, and unwilling to help. Also, contact with KPT is done mainly via their secure website login (like e-banking), which is kind of a hassle, and the server seems to be down often as well.    
I have KPT at the moment, and will probably switch back to SWICA next year.          How did you manage that? I have KPT and was considering eye laser surgery, but didn't ask them if they would pay because I didn't think they would (?)

At the beginning I didn't quite understand what they were talking about. I thought it was something official and even accepted to have them coming home.   
Then I searched in internet and found this thread. It reminded me of when they cold called me to my office phone offering financial services. 
Today I have called them back to cancel the appointment and ask them to cancel any personal data they have from me.   
I've also written Stadt Zürich warning about the scam and given them the phone numbers from where they called me.   
I'm a bit surprised of this kind of techniques from cold callers.

600	Insurance	Insurance covering psychologist	zzzlaf	2457	5	Location: US	06.05.2014, 21:57	" 
			
			I have been told (by my psychiatrist) that it depends what kind of psychologist you want to see.    
If you go to see a psychologist who is practising on a private basis, then basic insurance won't cover it.    
If, on the other hand, you go to see a psychologist who is practising under the supervision of a psychiatrist, then basic insurance will cover it.    
For example, I attend a large centre which provides both psychiatric and psychologist care. Both are covered by insurance because the psychologists are overseen by psychiatrists.    
Just a word of advice (which is clearly advertised in the my centre) - mental health services of any kind are very expensive, so make sure you take out insurance with the lowest franchise (deductible), even though the premiums will be higher. I pay between CHF 200 and CHF 300 per week. If I had a franchise of, say, CHF 2,500, I'd have to pay all of that out of my own pocket before the insurance kicked in. But as I have the lowest franchise (CHF 300 with Assura), I only have to pay for one or two visits in full and then pay the 10% of each bill after that.

Later, you inform the insurance of your plate number.         True, the B03 emissions requirement is not hard to satisfy. BUT you also need the car to have an electronic sensor/display of emissions faults, which only the ""high-end"" cars like yours had 10 years ago..

			If I were you I'd go to your employer and nicely ask for a contract. If they refuse, nicely point out that what they are doing is illegal, employing somebody without a permit, without insurance, avoiding payin their AHV, accident insurance etc and paying well below minimum wage. That might get them to give you a contract.   
If not, walk away.... And maybe mention that you'll report them.   
I think you need a 50% contract to get a permit!

A public hospital room here is about 4 people max anyhow- so not a problem. If your local hospital does not have the required specilaist, basic insurance allows you to be referred further afield anyhow- as was the case for my OH when he had to go to hospital, and was referred to Bern instead of Neuchatel.

			Another confirmation that it will be the mid-wives that do the delivery unless anything problematic happens.   
We also went with Assura, but in Geneva, and had gynaecologist visits with a recommended gynaecologist up until shortly before the birth, and then the last check and the birth were at the hospital.   
We encquired about the idea of paying for private in a clinic like you are thinking, so that our gynaecologist could be ""in-charge"". The response was that for a normal birth it was something like CHF10,000 but the big risk is if there are complications when you would be liable for serious additional costs which would have otherwise been covered if you were in the cantonal hospital.

625	Insurance	insurance abroad	GeorgeSword	1457	16	Location: fribourg	15.03.2014, 13:21	"    You have to pay health insurance premiums from the day you register with your local commune. You have up to a maximum of three months to subscribe to one but you will have to pay from day one. Your foreign policy will only be valid if it acceptable to the Swiss authorities so unless that is the case there would be no point in continuing to pay for that insurance once you move here and register.

			It's not over-reacting... just pointing out that the law is you pay from day one. Not doing so if unfair to those of us who have paid since day one. You think I like 10% of my monthly salary being paid out for health insurance?   
The only way the OP's friend can make it legal is by paying the back-dated amount.

629	Insurance	My kitchen sink faucet broke (pipe inside) and burst in my kitchen	rapunzel09	2973	6	Location: N/A	10.03.2014, 16:28	" 
			
			This happened to us in our first week in Switzerland, on an Easter Monday. Fortunately, we were able to turn of the water, and our neighbours got us the emergency plumber.   
The landlord's insurance covered it. (They went after the kitchen installer who hadn't secured a pipe properly).    
Remember the default setting of any landlord will usually be ""you need to pay for it/you need to claim on your insurance"". In this case, it's far more likely to be the landlord's responsibility. Make sure any water damage is clearly documented. Our landlord tried to stiff us for carpet cleaning when the visible tide mark was obviously caused by the flood. If a dehumidifier is required to dry the room, that should be paid for out of insurance and the cost of electricity to run it.   
As noted, most likely your insurance will talk to the landlord - especially if it needs to come off his insurance!   
If in doubt, join and talk to the tenants association. (Mieterverband in German).

635	Insurance	Best insurance model for pre-existing condition check-up by a specialist?	joannerandy	1029	3	Location: Basel	25.02.2014, 05:06	" 
			
			Joannerandy, it's not just the type of insurance that limits access to specialists - some specialists will not see patients without a GP referral regardless of whether or not one's insurance policy allows one to do so.   
Also, a GP referral may significantly cut down the waiting time for an appointment with a specialist. With a referral it might be only weeks (or even days), whereas without a referral you might have to wait months.   
So as you are making health care decisions, do also look for a good GP even if your care is likely to need expertise beyond what a GP can offer.

636	Insurance	Police report, stolen wheels [in Germany]	pwiese	1783	12	Location: Zurich	24.02.2014, 21:00	" 
			
			My 2 cents:     
1) Insurance in CH will liekly want a Police report, at least it was the case with my 2 claims (1 hubby got his stuff stolen and 1 bike stolen) (and in both cases there was little chance to ever get items back but it is procedure and insurance checks)     
2) Police in CH will not accept a claim for a theft happened abroad. Local German police should. 
3) The guy refusing to show police report is fishy. Should his insurance not covered thefts happened in his garage for items of clients? I know he was holding them as a ""favour"" but still, if a car got stolen whilst under his care, his professional insurance should cover it? 
4) Also fishy you were not informed at the time of the theft....     
Good luck!

			I had a knee surgery 1 month ago. I have torn my ligament 7 year ago in my home country. Everything has been covered by the normal insurance company (not the accident insurance). Usually it works like this - the doctor contacts the insurance company, explains the situation, and if they agree to pay, then you will get the treatment. If not, then you will be refused the operation unless you can prove you can finance that. So just talk to the doctor and he should be able to clarify the situation with the insurance company. In most of the cases the insurance company will cover all the costs.

			It's also worth remembering that a couple of cantons (Vaud is one) have a state-run fire insurance, so your contents insurance will cost less in those cantons (that's also one reason the insurance company needs to know where you are). Note the fire insurance (also deals with floods) is mandatory for both contents (and if you're an owner) also for the building.

The only thing is that they might make you pay the ""jeune conducteur"" fee, even if you have been driving for years.

It was them unfortunately as it was an illness.

If you keep below the 3 months residence registration requirement, you should be able to avoid health insurance and wages tax.

			I am a UK citizen who is resident in the Bahamas but owns a chalet in Canton Vaud. I want to export a LHD car from the UK to be kept in Switzerland, and to be used for the 4 months of the year I am there. 
As I am NOT resident in Switzerland, I am told that I can register the car on Gibraltar (tourist) plates, avoid paying tax on taking the car into Switzerland, and the only restriction will be that car cannot be driven in Switzerland for more than 6 months of the year. The annual cost of the registration is 250 pounds which is much cheaper than resident Swiss registration !  
INSURANCE is the challenge !  The only comprehensive quote I have so far got is from Clements International. It was outrageous and equals 8% of the car's value !  That is with a completely clean record, no offences on my license, and a $1,000 deductible ! Does anyone have any ideas of insurers I can contact to try to get something more reasonable ?

660	Insurance	Insurance needed for 6 month trip	burningjane	1282	10	Location: Valais	23.01.2014, 01:52	"    I spoke to someone from the EHIC team this morning - the EHIC card will cover me up to 6 months. Over 6 months, they consider it living abroad and I'll no longer be covered.   
I have lived in other countries so I know that you have to be out of the UK for 6 months before the UK consider it ""living abroad"", and that can mean you are viewed as a resident in more than one country, but I have never lived in Switzerland or anywhere else with compulsory health insurance - hence posting in this forum!   
But yes you're right, all I can really do is wait until I get there and register with the canton then it will be up to them whether they accept the EHIC cover or not. It would have been interesting to hear from anyone that had been in the same situation but I guess most of you guys are over there for longer than 6 months so wouldn't be covered by EHIC anyway. I will keep the travel insurance because EHIC doesn't cover repatriation.     
Thanks for you help,

			It's really easy. Just tell your employer, they will report it to your insurer. You will probably get a short questionnaire that just asks you what happened and if you work for any other employers.

670	Insurance	Frontalier health insurance	M. Ploymi	2097	3	Location: Pays de Gex	05.01.2014, 21:49	     Hi there,     I work in Geneva and live in France with my (not-working)Russianwife and our son in the Pays de Gex.  Iam British, have a G Frontalier work permit and pay my taxes in Switzerland.  I pay for Frontalier health insurance for meand my family out of my own pocket.  I earna low 6 figure CHF salary and after tax half our income is spent on housing.     I have recently moved from a 1 year contract to a 3 yearcontract which, as I understand, will allow me to apply for a B Work permitshould I decide to move to Switzerland  this would also mean that my wifecould also receive the right to work in Switzerland which would improve herpossibilities in finding work significantly.     I am aware that the French government is looking to pass alaw that will force all frontaliers to opt into the French social securitysystem.  I am trying to find out what thefinancial impact this might have on me and my family and whether it is worth usrelocating from France to Switzerland.  Ihave drawn a blank on this as no-one out there seems able to let me know howthis new French rule will be implemented. I have hear that from May I may be charged 13% of my gross salary to opt-intothe French system.  Other rumors that I hearare that this might be 6% during the first year.  I have also been told that nothing is yet setin stone on this issue.     Can anyone inform / direct me to where I might be able tofind out what is happening and whether we should consider relocating to Switzerland?  I understand that the cost of living ishigher, but we would be happy to downscale the size of our accommodation evenif it meant that we spend the same money.      Many thanks in advance  	Posts: 899	Join Date: Mar 2011	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 43 Times in 28 Posts	Thanked 796 Times in 347 Posts	a reputation beyond repute

			Most off-the-shelf legal insurances (that include employment) will cover the cost of litigation only. They will not cover the damages that you will have to pay, if that's what you are asking.    
If you need insurance against damages the insurance company will have to know more about what is at stake (money, that is, - are we talking about the coca-cola recipe, or..), and what you are doing to avoid accidental disclosure.

672	Insurance	Health insurance for newcomer	seph	3398	38	Location: Luzern	13.12.2013, 20:40	"    FYI, 3Wishes' example is pretty much in line with what I pay - just had a full blood chemistry done, along with a 30 minute consultation with the GP, and the change back from my CHF 500 won't buy me a coffee and gipfeli.  Obviously costs of the blood test will be dependent on what parameters are being analyzed.   
Another thing for the OP to think about : consider taking out supplemental insurance. If staying in Switzerland is even a remote possibility he really should consider getting the half private or private hospitalization now, while he is still young and healthy enough to qualify. If you wait until you need it you might find out that you no longer qualify.

673	Insurance	Looking for good supplementary health insurance for alternative medicine	muze7	3394	5	Location: Uk now	30.06.2006, 13:35	" 
			
			Dear All,   
I am looking for Swiss insurance that has excellent to good refunds for alternative medicine like acupuncture and TCM and Chinese medications etc. 
If possible, good maternity cover would be nice but this is not required.   
I am using Comparis as well but have not yet been very successful finding the right cover, and the Comparis forum is full of horror stories on the treatment of people and their claims, some of which involve major companies.   
Anyway, I am just looking for someone who also uses acu/TCM a lot and who likes their supplementary insurance. I know not all companies are everywhere but I can always check. (I am in Bern).

674	Insurance	Life insurance decreasing scale..	John_H	1287	3	Location: Nyon	06.01.2014, 22:35	"    Thanks Nomad for your detailed reply!   
To be honest, the UK mortgage is pretty small, two bed flat in a crap area of scotlandshire.. And we hope to sell it at the first possible opportunity, hopefully when the current tenant's contract expires in a year, if not sooner.   
Interesting the bit in bold.. I thought/think the sliding scale applies to the value of the mortgage, not the age of the borrower. Although i guess they are intrinsically linked since it's a repayment mortgage!   
Medical stuff I will definitely research carefully.. I have a friend in the UK who had a mild heart attack at 45, shat his pants, got his mortgage paid off and a big lump sum.. He was back in the pub within a week and back at work within the month like nothing happened. Whereas I've read T&Cs that talk about how serious the heart attack has to be or cancer has to be near terminal, skin cancer that can be cut off does not count etc etc ..    
I have an insurance agent at work that I can get a meeting with so I'm really just looking for some pointers on what to ask for.  I think some critical illness cover for me as the breadwinner would be good and I'll discuss the UK cover for the missus. She has no income to protect but likes the warm feeling that if she pops it then something gets paid off..which of course i respect.

675	Insurance	Insurance Coverage for Pregnancy and Birth	digitsclimb	7163	21	Location: Zurich	15.12.2012, 19:21	" 
			
			I am getting exceptional service (and coverage) from  !   
So, I am also pregnant and have insurance with Swisscare (as a student).   
I recently submitted my receipts for up to now for 2013 (all of them from Unispital Zurich).   
They are reimbursing everything, except for Elevit Pronatal (prenatal vitamins, they are considered a nutrition supplement, cost is negligible, about CHF20 per month).   
Some other medication (extra magnesium and iron) is covered, but I have not reached my franchise of CHF300 yet, so I still have to pay.   
Important: One of the visits was not planned (I went to the emergency room after an emergency). They also fully covered this one (even though I suppose it should be considered a ""complication"").   
All in all, Swisscare is amazing considering how low-cost it is. The only disadvantage is that you have to pay first and get reimbursed later, which might be a problem for someone's cash flow.

			GM is one I would not recommend! 
Cheap, yes, it is! We started with them for this reason but soon enough we decided they are not the ones we want to continue with.   
In Switzerland I find client service not to be one of the top areas but GM really is on the lower side of the scale.    
Just to give an example of my last experience with them: my wife works in a mobility role for one of the companies in CH and her jobs involves arranging the moves of people within the company including taking care of their health insurance while they go outside Switzerland for an assignment. From the very first moment she had a case where GM was the insurer for the person moving outside Switzerland we ended up somehow in their database with her work mail address. We have struggled for the past 8 months to explain to their customer service that our personal invoices should arrive at our home address not to the financial department of my wife's work place -> no success with this.   
I have to call them on a monthly basis to explain this over and over again and get the details of the next payment slip so I can make my monthly payment on time.   
I hope they handled properly our notice of terminating the contract with them and we will hopefully start with a new health provider as of 1st of January.   
Hope this helps, 
Jorgeu

I think you are confusing 2 different concepts:   
a) You are insured in the Kanton you live in and pay premiums according to that. NO WAY around it. 
b) You can have an insurance company that is lenient about you visiitng hospital/doctor outside your Kanton AND/OR (more likely) you ahve a complementary insurance that caters for that.   
For example we have a complementary insurance that allows us to choose ANY hospital in CH (semi private ) and when I have the fully private coverage during the maternities, this was even including Europe.

I know it depends, but on average, how much does a treatment in the Notfallstation cost?   
In my case we spoke with first 2 GP's (one being a student) and then with 2 Neurologists (again, one being a student). We had about 2-3 visits. There was also some ""Oberartzt"" somewhere above that was approving everything. We had also a blood analysis.   
We stayed in the Notfallstation for about 5 hours...   
Do you know how much such a treatment would cost, on average? We will receive for sure the payslip but I just wanted an estimate, since I learnt (aftewards) that it can be quite expensive...

			No, but the best approach is to pay your premiums and submit your claim as soons as you incur the costs or are invoiced. Then just keep paying at least until the refund arrives. If you do it all early and not right at rhe end when you are about to leave and provided the claims are legitimate then it should be fine.   
Refunds are not based on how much you pay in but that you are making a legal claim and if it hits the riules then you should be fine.

			There should be, it's pretty standard as part of a company's insurance obligations I think.  My OH's company also has worldwide interests and their employees' insurance covers them abroad.   I know because he suddenly became ill on a trip to Malaysia and the company insurance covered the costs.  Why not ask your HR first?   
I'd also check with them on whether you need to let your commune/canton know you'll be out of the country so much.  Being absent for long periods can affect your permit status as usually you're only allowed to be away for 6 months at a time max on a B or C permit without permission from your commune/canton.  Being sent abroad by your Swiss employer is one of the few reasons that's accepted.  Here are a couple of threads on the subject:          "	Posts: 2	Join Date: Nov 2013	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			In my experience landlords are very likely to ask for liability insurance which I think is understandable and is very cheap anyway so well worth taking out.   
We've never been asked about contents insurance and as FMF says it would only really be of any importance to the landlord if it was a furnished flat.

My advice would be to contact ""jenny"" on the forum. She will be able to give you some really competitive quotes from various companies and takes the time to carefully explain what's included and what's not etc.   
Signing up before the birth meant that we were able to get a deal whereby some complementary insurance and dental are included for the first few years for free (we went with Philos)    
Hope this helps.

720	Insurance	Travel insurance	Geordiegirl1	1563	9	Location: VD	09.10.2013, 11:23	"    I couldn't agree more. We used to take out annual policies when we lived in the UK, but really only to cover anything resulting from ski accidents, as we were making four or five ski trips per year, and relying on the E111 (as was) would not have guaranteed full cover, especially for heli-rescue or off-piste accidents.   
Since we've been in CH I've never felt remotely inclined to purchase any additional cover for travel - all else apart the hassle of making police reports, filling in claim forms, etc. is often worse than the theft or loss itself. Oh, and most UK travel policies had the habit anyway of pushing any claim back on your household content insurance, making the travel policy worse than useless, as you'd then be subject to additional loading for next years premium as well.

			I recommend you get on comparis.ch and start looking for a basic policy (presuming you are healthy and won't need more coverage). If you have health needs it may be worth it to spend more on coverage. My advice is to avoid having the canton make the coverage decision for you by being pro-active in complying with the canton's rules on minimum insurance then adding to that if necessary for your needs. Don't wait until the canton sends you a notice explaining that you'll be receiving coverage from company X. It will be over-priced.

Would have been a different story if you'd have rocked up with 'no casco' (3rd party only). 
You'd have been liable for all the costs (had you authorised them)  and then you'd have had to reclaim the money the garage charged you from the other driver.   
Which is the situation the OP is in.

			Thanks for all your replies. Below is the confirmation I have received from the Insurance company   
1.  When I purchase a new car my insurance will not increase since I already had a bonus protection   
2. From the date of the write off agreement, the insurance contract will be open for 2 weeks. After which they would repay me back the remaining premium amount for the unused months. At this point my contract will go into a sleeping mode until the expire of the contract.    
During the sleeping mode if I were to purchase a new car, my premiums will not increase (due to the bonus protection) but based on the car type (PS etc) the premiums might go up or down.

Do you know if there is some sort of legal and/or practical delay to ""register"" the insurance (a bit like for bank transfers), or if a contract signed on the 30th could indeed be valid as early as the next day? Or the signed copy would maybe act as proof that an insurance was indeed subscribed, even if it's not fully registered yet...

			Hello again to all,   
Well, after a long pilgrimage through various administrative and bureaucratic systems, I have to tell you that (unfortunately) you are right. There is no way to avoid the painful (for the pocket I mean) payment of a health insurance in Switzerland. The only way is to have an equivalent health insurance in your country of origin (I'm a foreign student). Now, I should search for the cheaper option!    
Thank you for everything!

			As of 2012, the compulsory insurance changed so that you can receive care in another canton. There are some restrictions based upon your specific canton, and i don't know them all. But, for example I live in Zurich and see doctors in Bern. If you have a Gp or HMO model, you may have to check a bit more, but i think the idea is that if a physician refers you to someone outside your canton it's generally ok.

If you were to say no, you'd be committing fraud and likely invalidating the insurance anyway.   
There's no percentage in it for the insurance company to cover an existing condition, so I would not expect that you'll be able to get coverage for it from anyone.

The nurse told me I was NOT seeing the head on the date she rang me and that I was seeing him on a later date... in actual fact I was supposed to see the head on the date she rang (and missed that apppointment), and was down to see her on the later date she gave me.      No charge yet, but this is all linked to the CHUV who bill several months later.

It's cheap as well so if for some unforseen reason you don't need it anymore or need another one, just cancel it. It's under 100chf for the year, mine was 92 and covers me and the wife and kids in case they break something.

I was looking at Klug recently too. I did see it on comparis however and I think it had a 5.0 plus rating and offered similar rates to Aquilana, which has a 5.5 out of 6 rating. I hear from locals that Klug is reputable, however I'm trying Aquilana. Still in the process of getting it organised now!

757	Insurance	Delimma,should I claim or not after falling off my seat on bus doing emergency stop?	San250	4046	35	Location: vaud	10.04.2013, 15:24	"    Firstly, I'm sorry to hear about your current treatment for your Lymphoma. 
I can understand that you are somewhat more fragile and this maybe influencing your request.   
If you have hurt your knee, hand, and shoulder, it's still a lot better result than if the bus had not stopped and killed the kid - how would you feel then?   
This sort of injury should have been reported to your doctor immediately, and your insurance should easily cover the medical treatment and recovery therapy associated with your injuries, so I'd start with a visit to the doctor before you do anything else.   
Keep on good terms with the bus driver, you may need his support to testify that the bus had to perform an emergency stop.     
If on the other hand, you are looking to claim for some sort of compensation then keep in mind the following: 
YOU WILL MAKE LIFE HELL FOR THE REST OF US   
Insurance premiums will increase, Liability cover reduces, and the general cost of opperating a public transport system naturally has to increase. 
Tickets will get more expensive, and by and large, everyone else will lose except for your Lawyer.   
By all means take whatever action you require to repair your body, and keep in mind that the bus driver did the right thing at the time and this couldn't be helped, nor was it in your control.   
Best of luck with your recovery

			Don't mind being called thick ....but still trying to understand Swiss Health insurance. 
I have contacted Jenny ...and await a quote. Being holiday season, it seems the whole of Switzerland is on holiday at the moment:-)   
Anyway called Sanitas independently and got a quote, but seems expensive ...maybe they have added some extras I don't need.   
Back to my original question. 
We will arrive now on the 2nd of September. 
I understand I can't start medical cover until I get a residents permit and have thus registered in my canton (Zug). 
Also understand that I will pay for  the insurance for both of us from the 1st of September. 
My concern is how I bridge the gap between arriving and insurance being live ? 
Or does the fact I pay from the 1st of September , mean I'm covered from the 1st of September ...that sounds a bit mad however.   
10th of September - Insurance becomes live and pay for whole month from the 1st of September ....then claim for a medical issue that took place on the say the 5th of September.   
Holiday insurance cover maybe ? 
E111 will that cover me ? 
I simply don't want to take the risk of not having cover ...even if only for a few days. To me its like not bothering insuring your car for a few days ....   
Maybe they will let me start the insurance before I have my residents permit ?   
We now have an apartment from the 2nd of September and an address in Zug and one way flights from UK are booked.

			A 5 million is generally not possible on a motor policy, 100 Million is the norm> as a Swiss in the US correctly says the personal liability and road liabilities are different things.   
If one caused a big motorway pile up and paralysed 50 school kids for example 5 million would never be enough cover and seeing as each of those cases could come at you for care for life the amount is more realistically set at 100 mill.

If you can prove that you have acceptable medical cover for your stay in Africa and that you won't be living in Neuchatel until you get back from there they might just allow you to wait until you come back and actually take up residency here before starting Swiss  medical insurance. I wouldn't hold your breath though.  ( I know of cases where it was accepted and others where it was refused so you never know what will happen).   
Medea Fleecstealer is absolutely correct, the Neuchatel authorities will not accept a UK based insurance.

			Hey everybody! 
I'm having the same doubt now. 
I arrived in April in Switzerland and unfortunnately Swiss authorities ask for my Permit be valid since the first day I arrived in Basel. Unfortunatelly I only noticed about this in last week, when I received all documentation and my B-permit. 
So yesterday I realized that the 3 months to apply for a health insurance were done. Today I spend some time calling and sending mails to some insurance companies. Fortunately the problem is not that big and I found some companies that can accept me without paying some  penalty (eg:KPT): 220 CHF/month. Although a colleague told me yesterday that for people like me that is doing only an internship I can apply an Insurance with   that is quite more expansive: 80 CHF/month. 
I send them an email today explaining my timing problems, and they simple told me this:""You only have three months to choose the insurance.     Now the period has already passed unfortunately.    Kind regards, Meilleurs salutations, Mit freundlichen Grüssen.""   
Even if I did such mistake they could be a bite more kind with me no    
Anybody knows another company that practice this kind of prices for interns?I would really appreciate your help.

			swiss contents insurance is usually very cheap plus you get the third party liability add on which is essential (and very cheap) in a society which optimizes insurance claims. the liability cover sounds superfluous but its worth getting, for example a friend of ours recently accidently ruined a whole parquet floor at a party due to a ruined heel and the insurer picked up the chf 6000+ bill

			Agreed with the above. I think you meant to state you need to find and register with a midwife   the birth!    
You should also realise that you need to insure the unborn baby BEFORE the birth. They only charge you the premiums from the birth date, BUT if the baby is born uninsured you can have administrative problems. The insurance company can refuse to pay for stuff you received in hospital for the baby if it is not insured!

In the next month I' moving out from the apartment.  
Unfortunately, I noticed in several places that windows are broken in the corners. The building is very old and windows are in old style. Probably it has happened during the closing them or during the winter.   
Could you tell me how should I solve this problem? 
Should I change the glass before moving out? The insurance will cover the costs? Or maybe the agency will change that after taking over the apartment? 
This is my first renting in Suisse so I really don't know the rules.

			The best way would be to have an Italian garage to carry the repair as they 
 usually deal with the paperworks.  
Alternatively you could contact the insurance company directly and ask for the procedure, they will help for sure. If not contact this:     
It is the institution of car insurers and deals with all the international disputes. THey managed the refund when a Spanish lorry driver destroyed my car and quietly left the ""crime scene"" when still living in Italy and it took just a few weeks.     
The normal procedure is that a technician from the insurance company""inspects"" the damage. As I suppose this is not possible, take any possible pictures of the damage with details of the car (plate clearly visible)  before the repair is done.     
As per some comments, yes there are things that need to be sorted out in Italy but this is not the norm.  
And to the OP, I look forward to hearing the positive outcome of the procedure

			The insurance agency at Novartis offer SWICA for health cover (and AXA for everything else).   
* SWICA standard rates  are not always more expensive than others, it depends on your circumstances 
* Can choose between all the levels and types of cover that SWICA offer 
* Can cover whole family  
* Discount from SWICA advertised rates 
* Pay monthly rather than annually in advance 
* Policy documents in English 
* Not locked in to additional elements for several years as is common with other companies   
In all, they might not be the best or most suitable, but for the first period till you know exactly what you want, could be a good starting point

			Thanks swisspea. Will try to speak to a doctor before getting her over.    
QUOTE=swisspea;1896199]I'd agree that it would be a case of checking with your medical insurance in Switzerland to check that it will be covered. Did you keep paying the health insurance through this time ?   
Doing a quick skim on the internet, it sounds like you need a wound-care specialist, not an Obstetrician, and I'd be extremely cautious about infection.   
Is/was there an infection ? A friend of mine was still suffering badly from an infection when her baby was 6 months old - I remember talking to her at the time and it was horrible - and she was medically trained herself, so knew who to talk to and where to get the best advice, and she was still suffering.   
I think I'd also be very keen to speak to a doctor on Switzerland before she comes over - but like I said, I think you need a wound care specialist, not just another surgeon.   
I also think that if there is no infection, and the stitches/staples are gone, and there isn't anything else in there, then maybe it's also important to give the body time to heal....    
I don't think it's a 'rare' complication, and although 4 months sounds like a long time, another friend of mine was in very nasty car accident with substantial abdominal injuries, and she was still recovering 2 years afterwards - she did get an infection in the wound and it did take a very long time for her body to start to heal properly...[/QUOTE]

Just an FYI when you buy your new bike: ask your insurer about a policy that would cover bike theft. Like yours, our standard HH insurance doesn't cover OH's bikes so he has a special rider adding coverage for replacement in case of damage or theft. IIRC the rider wasn't all that expensive when you consider the cost of the bikes.

793	Insurance	Reporter working on story about Swiss health insurance	simnlin	1236	3	Location: Geneva	06.05.2013, 18:38	" 
			
			Interesting article.  Should have picked up in your opening post about the employers and insurance though.  As far as I know all Swiss employers have to provide accident health cover for their employees.  It's just that individuals also have to have their own insurance too.  Company insurance covers you for accidents whether they happen at work or elsewhere.  So my OH pays slightly less for his insurance than I do because he works and I don't, so gets the accident side covered on the company insurance.  Not sure if the company one covers you for anything else, but certainly accidents.   
What I haven't seen mentioned is how Obamacare is going to cope with those people with no jobs and no money to pay for their insurance.  Fining them doesn't really help as they still have no money.  And of course, won't have insurance either.

			There is a warning in this week's copy of the Beobachter, a Swiss consumer magazine. There are thousands of people living here who cannot, or will not, pay their health insurance premiums, and are listed as debtors at the ""Betreibungsamt"". The health insurance companies have tried to get the debt settled, but it remains outstanding.    
If the premiums have not been paid .    
There are also reports of doctors requiring new patients to produce proof that they are medically insured. There is a report of one woman from Basel, insured with SWICA, who was refused an operation and sent home by the hospital as she owed her health insurance company 75 centimes. She had accidentally not paid the full amount the previous month and the insurance company had listed her as a defaulter.

Anyway, it's a moot point, as they've now told her that they're not bothered. 
For a longer period I could imagine they might be, although I recall that when I first came here I wasn't fully aware of things and didn't actually get any health insurance until I'd been here for about a year and a half. No-one seemed to notice until that point, when my employer started pestering me for a copy of the certificate.

			Swissmedic B drugs are prescription, allow refils. If you have a label on your box, i guess it would be considered a script by some pharmacies, certainly not all.  It's rather sloppy work. Of course the high value drugs (pain meds, ritalin, etc) are all A, i guess they figure no one will try to resell or score most of the B drugs.      
And if you sent in the bill to your Swiss insurance, it might be covered, so would count against your franchise. Try it and see.

			For a rough budget add 15% to the gross salaries to cover this.  For more specifics you need to spend some time doing research online for the AHV and other payroll taxes, and for the BVG and UVG suggest you also ask for a quote from an insurance company.  Basler seem to be quite supportive of small businesses.

809	Insurance	Road Traffic Accident Fatality & Injury Compensation Advice Requested	agafitei tiberiu	5159	30	Location: bellikon rehabilitation klinik	27.01.2012, 23:06	"    Swiss law is guided by the principle that you shouldn't be better off after the accident than before (that is the meaning of the word ""compensation""). So lifetime earnings + medical bills + longtime care bills it is as compensation.   
What you are really looking for is monetary compensation for ""pain and suffering"" AKA ""reparation morale"" or ""Genugtuung"". This has nothing to do with how expensive the car involved in the accident is. It has to do a lot with how much other drivers are at fault. From your description, your father may not have been at fault for coming to a stand on the fast lane of the motorway. But then the driver who crashes into a car that is stationary in the fast lane may not be a fault either, or not very much so.   
As I posted earlier, up to CHF 50'000 in ""pain and suffering"" (ie in addition to compensation) have been awarded to the spouse of a man killed in a traffic accident. A young man disabled for life has been awarded CHF 200'000 (plus compensation). In both cases the other driver had been found to be gravely at fault for the accident (very reckless driving, with the eventual victims being more or less innocent ""bystanders"").    
You need to talk to your lawyer.

			Hard to say if it's a good idea or not without looking at your options. If your wife is in good health and has not had any surgeries within the past 5 years, it's possible she would easily be approved for supplemental or worldwide coverage (for a price). If she's got any medical issues whatsoever, expect to be stuck with the basic coverage.   
I don't have a clue on what type of coverage is offered in Spain. Maybe there's some sort of policy you could get for her if she's living there temporarily, that would be independent of your Swiss policy.   
On the other hand, perhaps it would make more sense to have your parents come and stay with you in Switzerland for a short time instead?

812	Insurance	Student health insurance	ruchiksy	3981	24	Location: Edison, NJ	17.07.2012, 02:15	"    Swisscare and CSI StudentCare are not accepted in cantons Aargau and Neuchatel.   
My understanding is that Swisscare has a few ""gaps"" in coverage in case you're ever had a pre-existing condition (ie. Asthma, diabetes, etc..), but since the website was unhelpful, and the reps I spoke to never made me feel secure in their coverage, so I decided not to go with them.   
StudentCare covers everything up to the most extreme illnesses at which point they repatriate (this is what I read in 2010 when I was looking for coverage), but the franchise is quite high for students over 30 (I think it's 2500) and therefore no different than regular coverage in cost.

I have the same situation: 27 years old but female. As far as I know women even pay more for insurance.    
I checked comparis and read some recommendations... From the 1st May I just joined to KPT.   
I have to pay 270 CHF monthly. I think this is one of the cheapest options I had. However I live in Basel and the fees are different canton by canton.   
So far I am satisfied with the consultant who helped me to fill the papers. I speak German, I don't know if they are similarly helpful in English or not...

			Thank you all for the answers, even for the haters, love them - the problem was chicken pox (probably also taken from a restaurant..) so, not big deal.   
It was at CHUV - Lausanne   
The idea here is not about money, because my insurance will pay the amount back to me.   
It is about a principle, for ex. if I am musician, if I do a concert, and when everybody is there I would welcome them and after that I would just say to wait for me couple of moments, and after 3 hours I start my concert. Or I not doing a concert of an hour when i play only 15 min.   
It was just a problem of costumer policy   
Regarding the doctor know best, when and how, I am sure that is applicable? in most of the case, this would be ideal, and I hope it is like that, but still.. sometimes

			Yeah, I'd agree with Fatman. Myself, I have been with AXA Winterthur for at least 15 years for a whole string of BMWs, including my current M3. A couple of scrapes and a bunch of windscreens, never a problem, but that doesn't mean there aren't others just as good, maybe better.    
As a side note, the DMV is going to want certification for all the non-OEM modifications that make up the RS46, so I'd get RD Italia to give you all the papers, if indeed the RS46 has been certified in Germany and Switzerland.

			All insurance have some form of this waiting period as otherwise people would only take up insurance in case of a problem and that of course would destroy the business model, based on many paying and a few using, and become very expensive.   
For work related issues I think you can also go the unemployment office and ask advice: they are typically keen in you not getting fired   but maybe someone can confirm if this is true as I am only basing my statement on hearsay.   
Lastly, you will almost certainly not be successfull in suing an employer in CH.

			Hi, I have an all-inclusive Premium coverage with Swica which grants a lot of benefits (worldwide private clinics, single room, etc.), it's included in my company package so I don't pay for it but I know my company pays something between CHF 600 and 700 per month and I think it might also be a special deal they have with my company as far as I know. I never used it as I'm luckily very healthy and haven't seen a doctor once since I moved to Switzerland but my coworkers who did said docs were always asking them ""seriously, your company pays for this? There's nothing better than this"" and they said treatment was luxurious and amazing, they even let you jump in front of the line in some occasion which is something I find questionable when we talk about health...

828	Insurance	Basic insurance choices when combined with supplementary	minimimi	1063	1	Location: Zurich	03.04.2013, 14:11	" 
			
			Basic and supplementary insurance are independent of each other. Basic insurance is mandatory for everyone living in CH, and the insurance providers cannot refuse to insure you, whereas supplementary is an extra, and the insurance companies can refuse to insure you. As a general guide to the difference: basic insurance deals more with your regular GP appointments and prescriptions, whereas the supplementary insurance would be taking care of those less frequent but more expensive events.   
For the basic, there are different models - like you can go to whichever GP you want, you can choose to only go to a certain GP, you can choose to call a medline first before going to a GP, there are some insurance companies where with the basic model you will pay for prescriptions up-front, whereas with others the insurance company pays and bills you after.....all these different options affect the cost of the basic insurance. What you have available for the supplementary (e.g. choice of doctor) would likely be for what is covered for you if you were in hospital, but it wouldn't allow you to go to a different GP every time, if you had opted for the CallMed model for basic insurance, for example. In this case, you'd have to call the medline first, go to see a doctor if necessary, and if they decided you needed to go to hospital then you'd be free to choose your doctors or hospital or whatever is covered by your supplementary insurance.   
Hope that helps a little - maybe someone with more experience can explain better.

However I am not always sure if that is the case... The US is really a different can of worms (one I prefer not to open  ), but perhaps some insurances also had that viewpoint.

			Someone did that to me on a Monday morning. 
They did the right thing, left a note under my wiper with their phone number. 
I rang them, met them the same day, filled out the accident sheet, we both signed it. 
The car went to the repair shop the same week and was fixed by Friday. 
Easy, simple, painless when done through the insurance company.   
I recommend using insurance. Contact them straight away.  
That's what you pay them for.

837	Insurance	Supplementry Health insurance	Charlene	804	0	Location: Basel	07.03.2013, 21:56	" 
			
			Hi all,    
New in Switzerland and as part of relocation we have an agent who is supposed to help us with obtaining health insurance. Firstly he only spoke about Assura until we asked about others and he reluctantly got one other quote for us. On the basis that all basic health insurance is the same the price seems to be the only difference we need to look at. Right? Well apart from the minor detail that I understand we pretty much do the admin for Assura and that is why they are cheaper. The real mind field for us though is the supplementary health cover. As we live in Switzerland we are obviously looking forward to exploring neighbouring countries so travel insurance is a need. Then there is this extra for being insured outside your canton business. Well I suppose we will be exploring the rest of Switzerland too. Not sure I fully get this bit though. And then there are even more extras. The main problem is understanding the website that are only in the official languages and I can't rely on google translate for this completely. The agent who was supposed to help us has me concerned as he gave us a policy to sign for the extras (travel and cover in Switzerland) which turned out to be for a 5 year duration!!! He never mentioned this and now I don't trust him.    
In general we are all in good health. My husband and I do sometimes get the odd back pain for which we have visited osteopaths and physiotherapists for and we have an 18month old son and one on the way due in June (pre-existing condition I am told, basic only for me).    
So how do we navigate the lost in translation minefield for the supplementary cover and is a 5 year contract the norm???   
Thanks for you help and advise. I am pulling my hair out and don't want to be ripped off.    
Charlene

			The RC insurance is also known as 3rd party liability insurance.   
The most common use/need in CH is when you rent an apartment you need it so the owner of the apt. is covered if you cause any damage to the apt. It is also the insurance you need (should have) when riding a bike. The old system of liability insurance via sticker that you would put on the bike each year has been discontinued.

			Hi Everybody, I haven't been here for ages but have been busy selling our Chalet which we have nearly done. We are signing on 19th April but my buildings insurance runs out on 31st March 2013. I have had the contract with National Suisse for 5 years. I am trying to contact them to ask if I can renew for one month but have not heard anything. I have contacted their Basle office and sent another email to their Sion office. Does anyone know where I can get one months insurance or any experience dealing with National Suisse. i very much look forward to hearing from you soon

840	Insurance	RC responsabilité civile - advice?	dan2k3k4	1206	0	Location: Geneva	04.03.2013, 23:31	" 
			
			I'm just looking at different insurance companies for RC, my girlfriend is with Helvetia as she gets a good student deal with them.   
I'm with CSS for Health Insurance, they have the RC options but I hesitate to get the same insurance for both health and home in case one effects the other...   
Anyway, I decided to check out Helvetia and they had a Youth option for people under 25... I'm under 25 for another couple months, so can I technically sign up for say a 2 year option and pay the same ""youth"" rate? I'm not even sure if it's calculated the youth rate, it ended up as the same for when I tried the Generali calculator (which didn't have a youth option).   
I suppose there's not much difference in the companies, has anyone had any bad experience with Helvetia or would you recommend someone else? Would be for Geneva, I don't mind the documents in French as my girlfriend can help translate those if needed.   
(Off topic, how about for the CFF? Can I ""cheat"" the system and buy a year at the youth rate (under 25)?   )

			Just an update:   
I ended up having one of the regular prenatal checkups (including ultra-sound) at the Unispital in Zurich. It went quite smoothly.   
Since I was covered by Swisscare (whose cards do not have an electronic chip), I was labeled ""Barzahler"" at the registration desk, and they asked for a credit card as guarnatee. I paid cash for my visit (about 420 CHF) and received a ""Provisorische Rechnung"". About a month later, I received the final bill by post. Then I forwarded this bill to Swisscare by post, according to their instructions (see website), and got the money in my account about 20 days later.   
So, if I had to choose a student insurance again, I would probably choose CSS (since everything is billed directly to them). But Swisscare also delivers as promised!

			Yes agree about GM. I had an accident that my employer said was claimable, but GM refused. Apparently (according to GM)the law is quite clear on what is covered and what isn't. I haven't read through though on what's covered and what's not - seems something else needs to be involved, or something that you do only occasionally. Nonetheless, I don't understand why if you hurt yourself at the gym, or out running it's not considered an accident, simply because it's something you do every day. It's not like we set out to injure ourselves, is it?

My Visana health insurance covers tourist medical insurance world wide. Have you asked your health insurance company?  
Then you only pay for the extra risk above the normal Swiss health cover. If you are on business the employer should be paying this.

			Medea Fleecestealer is correct. We have successfully had the international insurance provided by my husband's company approved. But it takes a lot of effort and involved a lot of letters going backwards and forwards between the company and our Gemeinde. 
The international insurance must provide cover at least equal to that provided by the Swiss insurers. 
I certainly would not have wanted to go through the process without a strong HR department fighting our corner. They dealt with all the correspondence for us. 
I think it also helped that we have L permits so are technically only here for a short time.

			As soon as you change anything your bike may no longer be street legal. This is especially true with suspension, wheels, braking discs, muffler, etc. (performance, and noise related stuff)    
You do not need pre-approval but you will need a new MFK before you can hit the road again. Any part which is different then the one mentioned in the   will be mentioned in your bikes gray card and need special approval and testing.   
Now, the MFK will ask that you can show them that all your new parts will meet the Swiss regulations and are safe to be used on your bike. Just because you changed something and the MFK people did not frown does not mean that it is legal. You have to specifically point them to all the stuff you changed and ask them ""Look this is new, this are the papers, is it o.k."" And the guy will look at the thing, may be measure it, read all the papers and says: ""Sorry buddy, put it is too big and those are the wrong papers.""   
This where it becomes tricky, time consuming, and costly: The quest for the right papers. 
There is not many companies in that are able certify that a certain piece is according to Swiss regulations and suitable for your bike. Here is the complete list:  ,   (  an ECE type approval is good enough).    
For some parts they may have to do destructive testing (  of guy and is one of kind Japanese rear spoiler).   
If you change muffler/silencer you may have also to prove that your bike still meets the Swiss noise and pollution regulations. This may need additional testing, certification, (and cost) by the guys from  .   
In general: Your plans are not impossible, not something that was never done before, but time consuming and maybe not cheap.

864	Insurance	Supplemental insurance - when to reapply?	3Wishes	2398	5	Location: Bern area	07.01.2013, 15:30	" 
			
			Usually the 2 most important points for supplementary are 
1) your age 
2) your medical history   
From certain age on they just don't accept any supplementary insurance, even if you have been healthy all your life and you have never seen a doctor. Every insurance is somewhat different when choosing the age cut but some of them avoid taking supplementary insurance from 50-something years old and on.   
The medical history is important but it is something that you can discuss with the insurance and they can approach their own underwriters.   
Health insurances have small offices in many places and you can book an appointment with a sales person. Also some times they come to your place for free if you request so. There you can discuss your situation and they can make their own suggestions. This could be your first approach if you want to keep the same health insurance.

			I was told recently that if your 2nd pillar fund is significant then you can withdraw it in cash with a tax payment. Iwas also informed that ths tax could be reduced by spreading the payment over 3 tax years. You have to take it before 65 years of age and within 3 years of the first withdrawel. So latest start would be around 62 years of age.

			We have Cigna International through my husband's company and it works fine.  The only thing is, a bit different than the States where you show your card and just pay the copay, you get a facture sent to you and have to submit it to Cigna for the reimbursement.  We have never had a problem here.  We live on the French side.  The International also works in any other country, so I have went to doctors when I go back to the States to visit and we get reimbursed for that also.

870	Insurance	Cigna International Medical Insurance-valid in Switzerland?	Sharona	4788	6	Location: zurich	25.03.2012, 14:04	" 
			
			I got a quote from Cigna, found it interesting called the hotline and was   it was going to be accepted by the Swiss authorities (Kanton Schaffhausen). Ingenuously, I accepted and payed the full one year premium: as other things in life, I found out it was too good to be true.  
2 months of fights with the authorities had started: Cigna coverage is NOT RECOGNIZED. Cigna through the office in Zurich and in the UK did not offer any help, except the following mantra over the phone and over the internet: "" buy dental coverage and they will accept it"".  
These people are jokers, salesman who do not know what they are talking about and do not care if they give the wrong information: they kept mentioning rules that only apply to researchers and students, despite clearly explaining if was not my case (employee with Swiss employment contract). 
Result: Kanton Schaffhausen did not recognize the validity of Cigna and subscribed a Swiss one on my behalf which turned out to be expensive (400CHF/month for basic coverage with Progress). Only after 3 weeks of painful negotiations, I could cancel the Progress policy and subscribe a new one.  
And Cigna? Nothing from their side, only the information that I would have lost all my money if I cancelled the policy. 
I promised them that they would have paid for what I believe is a scam: broken nail? Doctor and medicines. Light headache? Doctor and medicines. Stomachache? Doctor and medicines. Pain in the back: Doctor, Ultrasounds, Massage and medicines.  
And they keep paying in their unique style: without saying anything.

			You are not registered as a dependent of your husband on his insurance. You get your own insurance, with your own premiums and deductible. Insurance here is not through the employer, in case you are wondering.   
Insurance coverage is effective from the day you arrive, which basically means it is retroactive. Let's say you arrive 01 May but you don't get the paperwork done until 01 July. You are covered (and have to pay the premiums for it) from day one. So you   go to the doctor on the day you arrive, but you will have to pay cash and wait for the insurance to reimburse you.

874	Insurance	No permit yet - can we get health insurance?	Zoe&amp;Mike	2741	7	Location: Zurich	13.01.2013, 11:08	" 
			
			Hi my family and I just settled here and this is how it went down for us. Maybe someone can pick up some pointers from it.    
Housing was arranged and we're EU citizens so might be a bit more difficult for other nationalities   
Arrived early November, registered at the townhall 2 days later. Had to pay that moment for the registration fees for the Residence permits (B). No one asked about health insurance. The migrationsamt sent the permits by mail to our townhall. We were informed about a week later that we can go and pick them up. Still no questions about health insurance, 2 days later we received a letter with the request to have our insurance company sign a declaration that we have a valid health insurance and send this to the townhall within 14 days of writing.   
We started the application process for a health insurance right after moving in November but the insurance companies were holding off asking for a residence permit. I even had an argument with one agent about this strange chicken and egg problem.    
Anyway it comes down to the following I believe: 
you have to have  a health insurance within 3 months of arriving. If not they will chose one for you. so once you have your insurance policies I think it's wise to at least go by your local community and show them that you are insured.

			I don't know which one ist better. A good health insurance should include a supplementary cover for non-mandatory medication, ambulance, glasses and emergency treatments outside Switzerland. That's called Krankenpflege-Zusatzversicherung TOP with Avanex. In addition you should have the whole Switzerland covered in case of hospitalisation. That's Hospital Eco. This way you should have a decent coverage without luxury.    
In case you don't work you should include accidents.

880	Insurance	Working in the UK, resident in CH: where to pay health insurance?	Coeos	1811	8	Location: Geneva	06.11.2012, 11:29	" 
			
			Thanks for your thoughts.    
I've dug into the exceptions for this obligation to take up health insurance in CH and found that in the case where you work in the EU, you are exempted (see link below). That's simply because there are agreements in place that should prevent people from paying twice.   
For those in a similar case, you need to request form S1 (previously called E106) from HMRC in the UK. To request that, send them form CA8454 which is on HMRC's website under ""forms"" and then send a copy of the S1 to the ""Service de l'assurance maladie (SAM)"" in Geneva. They will certify you are exempted, which you can then pass on to your insurance in Switzerland. It takes about 2 months to get the S1 - I'm still waiting for it, but I will send another post if there is anything else that's good to know.

			Depending on your insurance, it is up to you to pay all the bills and then claim back from the Insurance. This is what we had to do. But of course there is the deduction for your franchise or excess - do you know how much your is?

883	Insurance	Is Sympany Health Insurance Good?	Swisstobe	3131	6	Location: Basel	29.12.2010, 22:06	" 
			
			I realise this is an old post but just incase anyone like me, was looking at this thread more recently.  I joined Sympany as it was recommended by husband's employer.  I am on basic insurance and frankly I find it expensive and the customer service a bit poor - all they want to talk to me about when I phone is my bills even when I am asking a policy related questions.  I once had to call them more than 4 times in one day and was transferred 8 times.  The bills are confusing and I believe I have been wrongly charged in the past  but as the bills are in German and I can't be 100% sure I can't prove this - clearly I appreciate that my language skills are to blame here.  I am however, looking to change in 2013.

884	Insurance	Over-the-Counter vs Prescription drugs? Whats the Difference in Switzerland?	Javo	16949	38	Location: Lugano	19.02.2008, 20:10	" 
			
			Great answer.  I have had way too much experience in the Swiss pharmacies and find your answer to be quite helpful in beginning to understand what appears to be arbitrary decision making on the part of the pharmacies and pharmacists.   
My experience has been that the whole concept of  pharmacy counseling in Switzerland is incredibly inconsistent from pharmacy to pharmacy and it also depends on who is helping you.  To give an example, I required a cortisone cream for an allergic reaction.  This is the typical medicine I use in my country of origin.     
Apparently, this was a `C` because the first pharmacist would not give it to me without a prescription.  However, I went back to the same pharmacy the next day and spoke with a different pharmacist and-presto change-o, I had the med in two blinks (still without a prescription).     
Another time my husband ordered a stronger than normal vitamin for me-was denied, and argued with the pharmacist saying that he knows it does not require a prescription and she finally gave it to him.  Of course, to avoid further headaches, we asked the doctor for a prescription.     
That whole inconsistency regarding the meds that require counseling thing is what I find to be confusing and unnerving.        "	Posts: 190	Join Date: Apr 2007	Member	Groaned at 71 Times in 22 Posts	Thanked 20 Times in 15 Posts	annoyed a few people around here

Potentially RD wheels have been homologated for Switzerland - but I doubt very much whether the rest has. You could call Emmenegger Power - they may point you in the right direction.   
FYI - I have a set of Tarox 6-pot brakes to go on a an E36/E46/E85 lying about the workshop in the UK - EP told me I would have no hope of putting them on a car in Switzerland due to having to get them homologated.

As you didn't work for 8 months then yes, you would have been billed, but once you started working you should have informed your AVS office to tell them so and letting them know who your employer is.  If you are working it's deducted automatically so there shouldn't be any reason to pay again as far as I can see.

But the actual situation may be different. Your car may have options that are not reflected in the Eurotax value. Or the insurance company did not know all options or did make a mistake. It is also possible that the Eurotax value does not reflect the real market. In either case you will have to do your own market research. The insurance company does not care for how much you could have sold your car. It looks at how much you have to pay to get the same car model/year/options/condition now.

			I  can recommend that you contact an insurance broker in your area. I use ""Travex"" in Zürich and they help compare prices and benefits - and even help us fill out the applications and adjust the level of ""out of pocket""etc. it's cost free since they get paid by the insurance companies. Service is in english and has been a great help for us when moving here.

 lowest deductible selectable is 200 + you pay 10% beyond deductible   
3) Allianz

I was also able to chose where we met up.   They also then called me to check that I had gotten all the documentation in the mail, that I needed and if I needed any more help with anything.

			For regular stuff like 3rd pillar, health and life insurance what has worked for me is to ask for quotes and pick the best without resorting to 3rd parties, as I imagine they don't do it for charity. Better yet, ask for a quote and let'em know that you are shopping for the best conditions.

They reimbursed us on time, they cover half of the fitness center annual fees, available on the phone 24/7. They tend to be on the higher end of the range when it comes to premiums, based on comparative offers from comparis.ch, but we still decided to choose them based on positive feedback received from multiple current SWICA insured acquaintances.     If SWICA and Provita will merge, I would assume that the same level of service will be the norm for Provita as well (unfortunatelly I do not have first hand experience with them).

It is operated by the Federal Health Authority (and no they do not get any commissions!)   
Or you can go to

Many cantons   dog owners to carry liability insurance, usually in the area of 1-3 mio coverage. For most dogs, standard Privathaftpflicht (personal liability insurance) is all you need. If you have questions, speak with your insurance agent or with your Gemeinde.   
The fine for dog owners who do not carry liability insurance in Kt ZH, btw, can be as high as CHF 1000.

We would only be concerned with more major offences, if there was an accident as a result or say dangerous driving conviction made.

Many thanks for all the feedback when I first posted this question!   
The accident occurred in July (beginning) and since then all I have heard from our insurance is that they are debating liability, they believe other party was more at fault.    
Is it normal to not hear a word for almost 4 month? When should I expect a nice, big bill to arrive! 😀

937	Insurance	Swisscare costs for private clinic	Verna	3148	16	Location: Lausanne	09.10.2012, 16:14	"    YEs,   is covered - but if treated in a hospital, one might not be able to choose the physician under basic insurance. According to comparis:       
From what others have posted on various threads this does not always seem to be adhered to - but it certainly has been in my experience. I was not able to see the 'expert' in my condition under basic insurance, only junior staff.   
So if the OP doesn't have supplementary insurance, there is indeed a chance that she will need to pay privately if she wishes to see a specific doctor who normally does not take patients with only basic insurance. However, if her Hausarzt has made a referral to a specific doctor, not just to the hospital clinic... chances are that the basic insurance might cover it.   
As always, check with the insurer before treatment to avoid surprises.

Obligatory medical insurance has a special law. You can change insurers. And insurers must accept all applicants. Only a basic set of treatments and medication are included.   
Before you switch to another obligatory insurer, check your contract with CSS. You may be getting a discount on the supplementary due to having the compulsory with them. You might loose that discount and be hit with a higher premium for the supplementary!

Yes the limit of being able to be exempted is 2 * three years. The canton will no longer prolong your exemption after that period.   
And btw - researchers are no longer going to be exempt in the forseeable future. BUT there are no such plans for PHD Students - that is still being evaluated.

			Don't forget the other insurance you need - online backup.   
Nothing like losing your work when you're approaching your finals.   
Small amounts could be covered by iCloud, Google Drive, Skydrive, etc   
Large amounts should be backed up using something like CrashPlan or Carbonite.  The nice thing about CrashPlan is that you could work with your classmates and back up to each other.......for free.   
Unless you have a high-end DSLR then I'd not insure the camera.  It may cost more than a replacement......   
And AppleCare if you care about your Mac.

It is a scheme which allows casual workers and their employers to easily manage the required payments (insurance, pension etc.). The employer signs up and then the administrative side of things is taken care of.   
I don't know much more than that... perhaps someone from your area might be able to tell you if there is something similar in Zurich?

			I had to go through the exemption process, so I've seen the recent papers that list the exemption possibilities, and I'm afraid you might be out of luck if you're here for longer than 3 months and not a student/researcher/professor. Doesn't matter if you have outside health insurance (even if it's better than what the basic Swiss insurance would require.. included dental, anyone?).    
I had to do a lot of back and forth with the Gesundheitsdirektion, and they wanted stamped documents from my insurance company. Since US insurance companies don't typically have 'seals' or official 'stamps', I needed the same person who signed my exemption forms to write a cover letter, also stating that I was covered. Gotta love bureacracy and inter-continental paper communications. I'm covered as a student/researcher, but I wish you luck anyways.

956	Insurance	When the Health Insurance must start?	jchocholacek	856	1	Location: Frenkendorf, BL	24.09.2012, 12:54	"    As the insurance is compulsory from the first day you arrive in Switzerland, in theory you should be paying from the 1st of July. 
However, as long as you sign up within the first 90 days, some companies are more supple than others and will ""let you off"" with the first month or even two months depending on when you sign your contract.   
It's something of a grey area but in theory, you should pay from the first day you enter the country.

			Just a quick reminder on changing supplementary insurance.....   
It isn't compulsory, therefore you have to complete a health questionnaire to see if the new insurance company will accept you or not (as you don't  to take it, so they don't  to accept you).   
If you are in doubt as to whether or not you'll be accepted (e.g. you've had health problems in the last year or your BMI has changed and is now too high/low) then you are better off playing it ""safe"" and making sure you have written confirmation that the new company will indeed accept you before cancelling your old one.   
If you're fighting fit and have a good BMI then you should have no problems - but there are never any guarantees of course!

959	Insurance	Accidental damage cover for rented flat	smakubaku	2872	6	Location: Switzerland, Zurich	23.09.2012, 01:25	" 
			
			There is a table which is used to calculate the 'write off periods' magnum_pi mentioned for all kinds of things in rented flats (floors, walls, kitchens etc...). You can probably find it on the renter's association site. My German isn't good enough and the French one wouldn't be much help to you.    
So if you have damaged part of the floor, my understanding is that they will consult this table and charge you according to how much needs replacing, how old the floor is, and how long you've lived there... using some complicated calculation.   
But I very much doubt your ENTIRE deposit would be held back for a small amount of damage.    
If you're concerned, join the renter's association. Probably a good idea to do that anyway. They should help you with that kind of thing.    
However, don't try and 'wriggle' your way out of paying for any damage you have caused. It's part of the hazards of renting, but trying to escape from paying will just get you a bad name. You may well find you've caused other damage before you move out.    
I'd lived in my apartment (which had been refurbished before I moved in) a grand total of one day when my dad knocked a small dent in the ceiling whilst trying to put together an IKEA wardrobe. By the time I'd lived there a month, a Swisscom guy had come to fit a new connector and in doing so had left an unsightly hole in the skirting board. I've also knocked my iron on the floor, which broke the iron and dented the wooden floors. And there are some marks on the walls. But the way I see it, that's life. You can't live in a property and keep it immaculate. And if and when I move out I have something deducted from my deposit... well that's only fair. I prefer not to try and fix it myself, as if the landlord isn't happy with my 'repairs' I could face a much larger bill!    
But of course the longer I live here, the more wear and tear is 'expected'... so one solution is not to move!

960	Insurance	Basic and complimentary health insurance in different companies	Kutuzov	1843	2	Location: Lausanne	20.09.2012, 00:26	" 
			
			I posted a similar question some months ago and got no answer.    
It depends on the treatment and payment schema. For surgery or hospitalizations it's common that the Hospital deals directly with the insurance(s).   
For regular medical expenses it seems that the procedure is to request two invoices, send one to the Basic insurer, see what it rejects to pay and then send the other copy to the Complementary insurer.   
Complementary insurers can refuse to insure people based on the common age and health factors, and you could lose some or all coverage in case you lie in your application.

961	Insurance	Travel Insurance - Repatriation to the UK	Lyanne	678	0	Location: Basel	21.09.2012, 13:33	" 
			
			Hello,   
Forgive me if someone has already asked this, but I couldn't find a thred with the answer to my exact query.   
I have SWICA health insurance which covers me for repatriation to Switzerland in case of medical emergency or death. In the case that (God forbid) I did 'cark it' - it appears I am not covered for repatriation to the UK. Does anybody know how to resolve this?   
Sorry it is such a morbid subject!   
Thank you!   
Lyanne

Hopefully, this thread will be of benefit if dredged up in a future search by anyone else who is unsure how to navigate the often Byzantine procedures that are the part and parcel of the Swiss health insurance system.

			I pay 380 CHF per year for 100k contents insurance, including glass breakage and 4k cover for simple theft out of the house (einfacher Diebstahl auswärts).   
The simple theft option has covered stolen bicycles, and has been worthwhile.   
If you don't have the options I do, and reduce contents coverage to something like 20k, your premium will reduce accordingly.

			I had very good experiences with Quality1.  Read about them here:       
They offer varying levels of cover, with 5* being the highest (most comprehensive).  Most dealers offer 1* or 3* as their standard -- it's worth asking if they will upgrade you to 5* at their cost as a bargaining tactic.  In the worst-case scenario, you can pay the difference in cost yourself.

Persons who do not work more than 8 hours a week, at any one employer, must make their own arrangements.

			Yes, have heard CSS are not very good employers either.   
My neighbour worked for them for years, dealing with customer enquiries, problems etc.  Along comes a new management team with big ideas and pressurizes the people working there into sales and cold calling customers and prospective customers with deals of how to increase their coverage (that they didn't necessarily need), and how they would help them terminate the contract with the existing insurance.     
She was put under pressure to sign a new contract whereby a large portion of her salary was based on commission.  After refusing she was ""let go"".  A very suspicious move because she had just passed her 50th birthday and was considered an expensive employee.....   
Anyway, happy ending ... she got another, better job with another medical insurance firm.

Just to update for anyone else who might come across this thread looking for info - we wound up postponing our entry until August 1st.

When I registered at the commune, he never asked when we entered, but when we received our Aufenthaltstitel cards in the mail last week, August 1st was listed as the Einreisedatum. So, I'm guessing he got that date from the form I filled out at the Swiss consulate in Germany.

Due to a bit of a snafu, my sister had a gap of a couple of days in her coverage when switching from one job to another. And as Murphy's Law would have it, despite having to that point a textbook-perfect pregnancy, my niece decided to make her entrance into the world during those few days - some 2 months early.   
Emergency C section, months in neo-natal ICU - with no insurance. My sister and BIL have finally finished paying for their daughter's birth - just in time for the young lady to head off to university.    
Thank the gods that the highest quality medical care was available, but do not underestimate the expense. A complicated delivery, a premature birth will likely be far more expensive in the US than in other countries. Make sure you fully understand your insurance coverage, especially the fine print.

			Welcome to the Forum.    
Yes, acceptance for the good basic health insurance is compulsory here. You must have Swiss health insurance, it will be back dated to when you arrived here. You can choose which company you want from    The cheaper companies offer the same compulsory cover, but tend to be very slow when re-imbursing the medical bills.    
You should get insurance for the baby as well. It starts when your baby is born and is very cheap. This will ensure you are fully covered at the birth for  .    
Please search the Forum for more information.

			Member Jenny is our English speaking expert on health insurance,         
You could ask her about your situation, and sign up for Swiss medical insurance through her.    
I fear you are right, and special medicines will have to be paid for by yourself.

1003	Insurance	nanny/housekeeper insurance	shelby123	1027	2	Location: london	25.07.2012, 20:56	"    That's correct.    
If the weekly working hours are 8 hours or more, then you need to also pay for the non-occupational accident insurance, otherwise only the occupational accident insurance. The non-occupational accident insurance can be charged to your employee, the occupational accident insurance however has to be paid by you.   
If the monthly salary exceeds CHF 1740.-/month, then you also need to pay contributions to the pension funds. Half of these costs can be charged to your employee.   
Tax at source must be charged to the employee (as a rule of thumb, only if she's not Swiss and does not have a C permit, but there are exceptions).

			Thanks Jenny for your thoughts.   
I am now contacting insurance companies directly (columbus and travelnomads - but I prefer the former), asking about the issue you raise.    
Thing is that I can't have my residence set back to Italy without spending some time there (the police has to come to your house to make sure you live there - it might take days before they show up).    
After all I keep my flat and all the rest here in Zurich, as I will come back for work (though I do not have a contract signed yet), so I hope they won't refuse a claim before I de-registered (they told me I had to - maybe I shouldn't have said anything) at the town all...   
In fact, here's what columbus direct wrote me about it, so I am fine:   
""To be eligible for a policy under Swiss residency, you must be able to proof that you have been residing in Switzerland continuously for at least the last three months. In the event of a claim you will be asked to proof by bank statements/utility bills that you are permanently or temporarily living in Switzerland for more than 3 months.""

			You'll need to write a letter to cancel the policy, and you can only cancel at specific times of the year. If you don't pay the bill, you could get a betriebung, registered at your gemeinde, and if you want to move or take out a loan, this could impact you negatively. Plus you'll be charged extra fees and fines.

			Sorry to her about your wife's illness.   
Both these answers above are correct. You either pay the doctor directly or, if they will, get them to send you a bill, being new you might need to show your permits and perhaps a business card will  help. When you put a policy in place you can submit the bills for consultation and medication and they will count towards your deductible for the year, well hers to be acurate.   
Under Swiss health insurance law you will be back dated and charged from the first of the month that you entered anyhow. The 90 day period is to put your affairs in order and not a grace period.   
If you wish to PM me your details I will gladly expalain the system and can get my team to run you some quotes.

Works like this:   
TPL is the mandatory 3rd party 
casco ( in addition to TPL ) : things such as natural hazards, fire, theft, animals, glass, vandalism and parking damage ( if you have and are valid for such options ) 
Full cacso ( in addition to part casco ) : you or someone driving is responsible for damaging the car

			My Father is Swiss, and is also a resident of the U.S.  He is retired and goes back and forth 1-2 times per year.  He has full American insurance through Medicare (for retirees) plus private secondary insurance.  Recently it was suggested to me that because of his age he should have Swiss insurance too, in case he should get sick during the months he is in Switzerland.  I know that he has emergency insurance at the least, and I could increase the American retiree insurance coverage.   
Anyone have any suggestions for us?  Thank you in advance.

1029	Insurance	ECA - Insurance of Natural Elements	septiale	12737	27	Location: Lausanne	15.03.2010, 10:15	" 
			
			The documents you should have received with the ECA letter should have explained the situation.   
In Vaud fire insurance is complusory for all households. You can choose to insure with any company (and if you do you'll be asked to provide proof of cover), you aren't forced to use the ECA.   
As a renter the landlord should have insured the building but you still are obliged to insure for your contents,   
The aid to compiling your insurance (from memory from when I arrived) was little more than a checklist to give you an idea how much to insure for.   
The ECA cover is purely for Fire and natural disasters (mainly floods) so it doesn't benefit you for insurance against other damage to property.   
The cost is pretty low as a result of this limited cover. I also vaguely remember there was a formula provided for the cost of the cover based om a value per 1000 of property.   
The reason given for making it compulsory is so that other residents of the canton don't have to contribute to the costs of people who've just burned themselves out of a home - and seeing the number of buildings in our small region that went up in smoke over the last couple of years there might just be a tiny grain of truth there.   
Or maybe the insurers don't investigate cause as thoroughly as they might:-)

			Putting it bluntly, if you don't get the insurance, you don't get the apartment. Or in your case, you would be thrown out. However you could make yourself into a test case, be thrown out of your apartment, take the landlord to court, and be told ""You agreed to this clause"" ""Case dismissed"".

			I believe with pre-existing conditions you will only be able to get the basic insurance, which generally means you have to get pre-authorisation for for things ( though so far from my experience not a problem) the main thing you might comeup against is if you want to go out of your home Kanton to someone of your choice if there is a recognised specialist in your home Kanton.

			I have the same situation. I work in Switzerland, fly home almost every weekend (in my case Berlin). According to the Swiss authorities I am considered ""local"" and need to have insurance here and pay my taxes here. This was also the case when I lived in a hotel. 
You could argue with them on a Grenzgänger/frontalier status, in which case you would pay tax at source only in Switzerland and the rest will be taxed in the Netherlands. For that I would check the DBA (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) between Switzerland and the Netherlands.    
In my case I have decided to stick to the Swiss side of the story as any disadvantage from insurances etc is made up for by the much lower tax rate!    
Coming back to your insurance, my experience is as well that if you have a work contract here, you need to show local insurance. The only cases I have seen where this was not necessary was if you are on a expat contract.

			Decisions have to be made whom is to blame and by how much. From your story the other driver is 100% to blame, but the police cannot make a decision until they have all the facts. Were there road marks from your heavy braking, did you take a photograph?    
I wouldn't worry too much, you have a witness who is not your relative, so he can substantiate your story and your driving actions.

			Because they are not considered health insurers in the sense of the health care act. They offer mostly equivalent covers which fall under the insurance act.   
Basically, some groups of people (foreign students, researchers etc.) can be exempt from mandatory coverage if they have an equivalent coverage (for example from these two insurers).  But you need an exemption from the cantonal authorities.

I always assumed you could get into one of these things early on and then keep the cover going into old age. Obviously will have to read the small print very carefully indeed.

Just an FYI: many cantons do indeed make liability insurance compulsory for dog owners - some up to 1mio coverage, many 3 mio.   
In most cases this is simply part of your Privathaftpflicht - but every dog owner must know the cantonal rules, and check one's policy to ensure that one is appropriately covered.   
(In SZ, I had to give a copy of my policy to the Gemeinde when registering my dogs.)

1049	Insurance	Increase in Car Insurance Policy	spalebärg	1445	0	Location: Baselland	06.06.2012, 17:28	" 
			
			This year's car insurance policy just came in for payment (Smile direct).  
This year (as often) there was a small increase in its price of nearly 5%. 
Well my pension has not gone up that much so I thought this time to do what Swiss and Germans do and that is call back on the 0844 number and politely ask why it has gone up. The lady on the other end took the policy number to check for me and came back saying she couldn't really see why it had increased and said she would try recalculating my insurance on a new    This she did with the end result that the same insurance is a couple of percent cheaper.       Don't generally accept increasing prices without asking for a reduction.

1051	Insurance	Health care advice	sunni	1911	13	Location: UK	10.04.2012, 23:37	"    At a 190 chf/months i guess that they may have a 2500 franchise. 300 chf/months sound more like a 500/300 CHF franchise. (unless their are differences extremes in canton, doctor solution formula and brand)   
Also you have to make sure you have the doctor solution ... telmed, medecin de famille or basic. Price difference can vary by 100 CHF as well.    
Then it also will depend on what canton you are located in. Some are cheaper than others. And depending on the canton ... they can differ.    
A typical case is : a person is insured with insurance X, which is the cheapest in Zurich (exemple only !), the person moves to canton Bern ... and with insurance X will pay more than previously and also more than other insurances that were more expensive in canton Zurich.  
It is regulated ... with reserves  ... that is why a same insurance has often more than one brand. (like Group Mutuel you refer to has Philos, Avenir, Group Mutuel and Easy Sana)   
But basically, the insurance coverage of the Basic remains the same accross all basis insurances. They are regulated by the Government. the law is refered to as Lamal. No matter what price you pay.   
If you send me a description of what you have i can sort it out for you. I will do it for the sake of helping.

1053	Insurance	Tips for a good supplementary dental insurance?	tinuviel	2349	7	Location: Clarens/Montreux	30.05.2012, 13:32	" 
			
			Don't forget, that if the bad teeth are threatening your health, then the basic legal health insurance covers the dentistry work.    
How that is interpreted I have no idea. Maybe extraction and false teeth are covered?        
Is dental treatment covered by compulsory health insurance? 
As a general rule, the costs of dental treatment are not covered. Costs are only reimbursed in cases where treatment is necessitated by   or by another serious disease or its sequelae, or where measures are required to treat a serious disease or its sequelae (Art. 31of the Health Insurance Law). According to Federal Supreme Court rulings, the list of conditions likely to necessitate dental treatment covered by compulsory health insurance is exhaustive, and these conditions are enumerated in Articles 17–19 of the Health Insurance Benefits Ordinance:    (german),   (french),   (italian). 
Dental illnesses covered are here,     "	Posts: 14	Join Date: Apr 2012	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 5 Times in 4 Posts	no particular reputation at present
1054	Insurance	Insurance for baby	Shopaholic	2899	13	Location: Zurich	07.03.2012, 00:55	" 
			
			We set up a prenatal plan with Insurance Jenny (do a quick search on this forum to find her contact info) and I'm so glad we did! There was concern that our daughter had aspirated amniotic fluid when she was just one day old and she had to be transferred to the Neonatologie at the University Hospital. The insurance covered EVERYTHING!!   There was nothing to be worried about in the end, but the doctors wanted to be safe instead of sorry and having the insurance already in place gave me peace of mind.    
Our insurance is with Mutuel, our supplementary with Sana24 and our daughter's is with Visana. Her basic policy is around 85 chf per month and covers basic medical with hausarzt (main doctor), accident, etc. Then we added on supplementary for 20 chf per month, which covers her out of the country on vacations up to eight weeks long, emergency transport, alternative therapies etc. While in the USA she had to see a doctor and they reimbursed me for the visit 90%. In short, insurance in Switzerland is awesome!    
But, as others have already said, sign the forms and get it sorted BEFORE you give birth. So important!!! So so so important!   Have an awesome birth!   "	Posts: 21	Join Date: Sep 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 9 Times in 4 Posts	no particular reputation at present

They are in reality interested in understanding if you had several appointments with the gynecologist for checkups or for medical complication.   
The basis insurance only covers a limited number of checkups.    
If there were some complications, the basis will pay for it. as well as for the first checkup. But as said the number of covered checkups is limited.    
If you have no complementary insurance, have your gynecologist writing explanations that your wife had complications, resulting into several examinations. And have it sent (by the gyneco or by you) to Helsana. That should settle your case.   
Basically, they are not entitled to know what your wife has. But the nature of the appointment. Therefore, legally, they would have to ask another (appointed) doctor to take contact with your doctor ... and the secret of what your wife has would stay among doctors. Then, their doctor would inform them about the nature of your appointments.

Thus in Switzerland if you are ill and poor you pay more than if you are healthy and rich.    
Of course the belief here is always that people ""choose"" to get ill through their lifestyle. Peasant mentality really, stuck in the 19th century!!!

I am amazed you can pin down any employee of a large organisation in Switzerland, normally several people need to be consulted & 2 people seem to be required to sign a very standard letter.   
I am sure they are not allowed to give any information to someone other than the policy holder without a power of Atorney.

1067	Insurance	Health insurance on changing canton	johnmayer	1556	1	Location: Bern/Zurich	14.05.2012, 19:28	"    You definitely have to inform your insurance. As you say, since Sansan, member of Helsana group is the reference in Bern, you may have to pay a higher premium.   
And definitely you better change insurance company depending on where you will go.    
It is not possible to change during the year. Therefore take position as soon as you know where you go, knowing that all will take effect as per the 1.1.2013.   
Would you go to Zurich, the Group Mutuel seems to be the best company. With Group Mutuel, you can also lower the premiums paid by increasing the franchise and taking a complementary that ensures your franchise in case of more than 24 h in a hospital.

1068	Insurance	Mid year subscribed insurance	Ilcristian	703	1	Location: Ticino	15.05.2012, 01:07	"    You can, yet just make sure you respect the deadlines of the company. Some ask for 6 months preadvise !!!  so you can start with a high franchise ... in order to pay a low premium and then go for a lower franchise in order to cover your health bills.   
But it depends also what type of checks you will perform. Are they normal ? because simple checkups aren't covered by the lamal. Unless you have pain somewhere.   
A smart thing would be to take a high franchise, in order to reduce your premium, to take an insurance on the franchise, to cover the franchise if you get hospitalized and also subscribe to a complementary that covers checkups !! You may end up at a lower global premium and get the coverage you need. Else, maybe you may pay a high price and your checkups may not be covered !

In the end they gave us an introdution NCD as it was clear that we had been driving for years without claim. 
Try a comparison site or 2 and see if you can get a better deal - usually when you say you can do better they magically reduce the price.

It might be that the cost of the contacts will go towards your franchise - it depends on your contract. If it does, you'll find out at year end. In the meantime, assume it doesn't and you might have a pleasant surprise.

1088	Insurance	Using the doctors and insurance system	jimdrake	2915	12	Location: VD	16.04.2012, 10:52	" 
			
			Yes, but even when I get sick (or have babies) I don't actually need my very own room.  Nor do I need any other ""5 star services.""  I just need health care provided by competent and experienced doctors, which is exactly what basic insurance has provided so far.   
My only point was to the OP-changing doctors is most likely all that is necessary, and private insurance is a luxury, not a necessity to get good care in Switzerland.

			If you search on this Forum you will find that getting insurance on a British registered car, while living here, is expensive and definitely a grey area. Insurance companies are famous for taking your money and then finding an escape clause in the rule book, just when you need to make a claim.    
With your young age and driving record, you would be better off leaving your UK car in Britain. As you will only be here for a short time it isn't worth the trouble and expense of bringing it here.    
When you get here, exchange your GB license for a Swiss one, and you can use   at the weekends, and public transport for daily commuting. It will be cheaper if you buy a monthly season ticket for the town where you live, and far less hassle.

			There are lots of different travel insurance products out there. Majority of them are actually quite cheap and not surprisingly not very useful. Lots of people who own travel insurance never bother reading their policy and exclusions, and as long as nothing happened, these people will stay as happy customers and may even recommend what they have.   
If you provide some information as to exactly what you would like your travel insurance to cover, some more useful suggestions can then be provided.   "	Posts: 249	Join Date: May 2011	Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 94 Times in 68 Posts	earned some respect

			I had my 2nd child here, having gone into prem labour at 32 weeks with my first.   
With my 2nd ... 
I had extra scans, bed rest, hospitalization and in the end he was born at 33 weeks, with breathing problems.   
He was looked after inthe CHUV in Lausanne, it is the specialist centre for neonatal in the French part of switzerland and the care we received was amazing.   
For me, my additional tests and hospital trips were classed as illness and subject to my deductible, as soon as this was used up then everything was covered.   
For the baby, we received copy's of all the bills and we didn't pay anything. I believe that the insurance companys can claim money back from the government, we were also encouraged to claim back expenses for travelling to and from the hospital. (the bills were in excess of 60k chf)   
If we decided to have another baby, I would have no hesitation in having it he, I know for lots of people the medical care in Switzerland is very invasive and you have lots of tests/scans etc, for me this was necessary and it was comforting to know that envy thing was being taken care of.   
Good luck

1105	Insurance	Health Insurance Claims - Tips	Andreag	933	0	Location: Zug	15.03.2012, 21:14	" 
			
			Hi All,   
I have a complimentary insurance which covers for all check ups (weather is a prevention or just a check up).   
Everytime I go to the doctor, the invoice issued is incorrect (which means wrong code). Step no 1 get the invoice reissued with code T1 (check up/vorsorge in German).   In case of vaccination is T2.    
Than the invoice should be refunded by the Insurance (in my case 80%) without problems. Guess what, they book it to my basic insurance whereby I have the highest excess. Then I call the insurance and every time they admit the mistake and the refund is credited into my bank account.   
This happens for every single invoice. What a rip off if you are not after them. So far, I could have paid unduly 1,000 CHF.    
Hope this helps you members.

If you wan't to deal with a person, have the cover explained, and stand any chance of English documents for your criteria... I'm not sure comparis is the tools for you, and unless we have some clairvoyants on here how could anyone guide you.   
For my last car, comparis gave Generali as 'the top', I was with Die Mobilar who were actually cheaper but all in German, but Zurich beat them both on price with slightly better cover, and were cheaper with the new car and all my doc's are in English... worked for me would it for you, who knows.

1116	Insurance	basic insurance holder want to go to private i.e hilslander	apiapiaba	1730	18	Location: lausanne	28.02.2012, 18:56	"    Agree on checking out the paperwork in advance - if you don't have the parents birth certificates and marriage certificates in an acceptable language and dated within 6 months of the birth it could take you a while to get the birth certificate through. I'm not sure what you mean about not having to stay here for the birth cert - you may not be allowed to take the baby out of the country without the correct documentation and passport (depends where you're going, what other paperwork you have, etc - I'm only an expert in my own situation).   
To be honest, if your residency runs out in the same month that you baby is due, and you would have to be on a tourist visa if you stayed, I would hotfoot it back to my own country to give birth. Its not ideal if your husband might not make it in time (maybe he will - maybe you'll be overdue or he can negotiate early release or hop on a flight and hope your labour is long!) - but it's potentially less stressful than trying to deal with all these issues in a foreign country when you know you are leaving imminently.      Again I'm no expert but I'm not sure about this. I was at the dentist yesterday and she commented on my own hereditary teeth issues, telling me that I should get dental insurance   basic health insurance for my swiss-born (though not swiss, but insured before birth) daughter before she is 3 or 4 in case she has similar problems.

1133	Insurance	AHV withdrawal after leaving CH	Island Monkey	9570	18	Location: Wallis	27.02.2011, 10:59	"    Are there any documents to file or anything that one needs to do before one leaves Switzerland for UK in order to ensure that one gets paid the Swiss pension? Where do we apply at the age of 65 in the future? Someone wrote that our AHV gets transferred to the UK social security system???    
By the way, AHV has been extremely unhelpful in answering questions to emails and when I call them, they do not speak English....   
A Swiss friend told me that most of the foreigners when they leave Switzerland they forget to claim the AHV pension and that it is very small amount that ones gets per month.   
Is this monthly pension paid out until death? and does it get transferred to the surviving spouse for married couples?   
How do they calculate how much one gets paid per month?  Does it depend on how much one has contributed (e.g. if someone had very high salary and they had a lot paid in to AHV)?

1134	Insurance	Health Insurance - Bill from beginning of work permit	aimar10	3109	27	Location: Bern	09.02.2012, 17:11	" 
			
			Basic health insurance is obligatory in Switzerland, even though the health insurance companies are private and not state run. That's why you received a bill from the date you registered as a resident in the country, as you were covered from that date. 
Whilst the authorities don't usually do much in the way of checks, they won't accept health insurance from non-recognized companies and that means in general non-Swiss companies. They might accept such a policy for short term stays, but not for permanent residents. 
The EHIC is only valid for emergency treatment and non-residents.

			Hi Mark,   
No you will not have to pay the whole year, just up to the end of the month you leave.   
You must de=register with the commune at your Gemeinde and send this proof into the company with a termination, same as other insurance covers.   
Best,

1138	Insurance	Health insurance for border hoppers? CH/FR	Where2	1042	7	Location: zh	07.02.2012, 22:12	"    Bear in mind that there is always the option to go with the Swiss system (KVS/LaMal). French frontaliers usually don't do that and opt for private insurance (usually) or the French social security (rarely), but most of these private policies allow treatment in Switzerland for emergencies only. If your level of French means that you struggle to read that website, you should consider an option that allows you to be treated in Switzerland rather than having to get to grips with the French healthcare system  .

			You are only allowed to have one basic health insurance policy. The first company needs to inform the second company that you are still insured with them. After that you can claim your payments back from the second company. If you stop paying either of them you will incur extra charges.    
If you want to change health insurance, you need to resign the first company before the 29th November 2012. They must have your resignation letter   the end of November 2012.                  
Termination deadlines for changing insurance companies:   
For termination as of December 31 , the termination letter (registered letter) must reach the former health insurance by November 30 or the last working day of November, respectively. This is the final deadline, no matter if your new premium is higher, lower or remains unchanged.   
For termination as of June 30 , the termination letter (registered letter) must reach the health insurance by March 31 or the last working day of March, respectively. This only applies to policyholders with a deductible rate of CHF 300 (children: CHF 0) and a standard basic insurance (no alternative insurance models such as e.g. HMO or Telmed). In all other cases a switch to is only possible for the end of a legal year.   
Click here for a prepared termination letter:  
Basic health insurance (Word)      
If you have a bonus insurance with your current insurer:  
You may only terminate 5 years after contract conclusion for the end of the calendar year and must give three months‘ notice. However, should premiums rise, notice of termination must only be given one month in advance if the contract is over five years of age.

I am thinking of subscribing to AXA 3rd party liability insurance. 
Two people covered up to 10M, 200CHF franchise. 
It's 100CHF or 130CHF if you add coverage for 3rd party vehicles.  
Any opinions?

On the ""goodolusa way"" is it true that you are only covered by insurance 48hrs after childbirth (I have heard this from a few sources) so if you give birth at 03.00 - out you go at 03.00?

As for additional insurance (which might be helpful if you need glasses/want to try ""natural health treatment"" vs. school medicine etc) - they don't ask that many questions and either include an existing condition asking for a higher premium or just exclude that condition and all possible follow-up treatments.

			SUVA is a great choice, but they don't take everyone, only risky jobs. 
For desktop jobs, they will refuse.   
I would start with 1500.- IF you have kids, you'll get child support. But you don't have to pay BVG yet.  
You have to pay AVH, EO etc. 
Accident insurance will be mandatory. BU and NBU   
The company still owes you this money, with interest BTW.   
BUT, from something you have to make a living. You ether have to show some savings you could live on or you will be questioned if you taking some ""black"" money out of the company.   
YOU are NOT required to draw a salary - there is no minimum wage introduced yet here in Switzerland. (This said, I read today that in the French part is seems so) You can declare yourself as ""no income"", then you have to pay AHV as no-income, around 470.- a year. 
EO would not be charged and no accident insurance will be mandatory.   
BUT again, you will then be asked from what you make a living. 
If your partner works and has income, great.   
Don't forget to deduct EVERYTHING, deduct more, the tax office will scratch off what they don't like.    
And first 2/3 years you have to make a loss - it's the law :grin:

1171	Insurance	Health insurance	mike_n	908	0	Location: Bern	11.12.2011, 14:52	"   By chance I made an interesting discovery. 
This year I changed canton, so I let my health insurance company know  my new address. They acknowledged it and sent me the new premium to be paid together with the new increased premium for 2012. In the old canton it was one of the cheapest premium, but in the new canton with the new premium they were about 30-40% percent more expensive than the cheapest alternative. So I give them notice saying I'll leave at the end of 2011. So far so good. As I didn't communicated the name of the new insurance company they sent me a letter saying that the cancellation is valid only if they get the name of the new insurance company. Here comes the interesting part: together with the letter I got payments slips for 2012 with a reduced amount. It would be no increase, moreover they would reduce the 2011 rate!!            I've already changed the insurance company and  I don't intend to consider the new offer, because  the new one is better. But anyway threatening to leave is something to be considered and may get you a rate reduction.

Are they asking you to pay for months were you were out of the country? Did you actually deregister when you left? You may be able to get out if you play dumb, send the deregistration letter and tell them that of course you sent it to them. They must have lost it. (sure it's a game. But it could work).    
If you can't get out of the contract that you simply do not have the money to pay the year in full and that you will continue to pay like you did before so there is no use in them insisting.

			Generally dental for adults here is pretty limited. As alread mentioned there are usually waiting periods before your cover is effective on certain treatments and that there is also an upper limit each year to the cover which in some cases is easily reached.   
This is not uncommon here and the most likely cover is that children are covered to around 18-20years of age.   
What you will then find is that a fund will say yes you can take out the insurance but read the small print first since it may also mean you will have a qualifying period before your cover is effective of 12-24months. This may limit you if you want to change insurers in a year for cost reasons that you will face the same qualifying period again. Take a closer look at the conditions since dental cover does not mean 100% cover straight away.   
If you only want to cover the preventative better off skipping across the border or using a dental hygenist. Dental hygenist will cost 100-200CHF depending on city or away from city as the rate charged by dentists is based on the tax rates where they are based. In germany expect to pay 30-50% less then the swiss rates.   
For these reasons we don't have the cover and while I am not from the UK any one with NHS type entitlements in the UK is better to keep using those. It is also the case here that dental hygenists are much more affordable option and skipping across the border to germany is significantly more affordable then using a swiss dentist besides most of them are german trained in this area anyway.   
language is usually not an issue with dentists in the german speaking locations as most dentists being well educated have strong english however having reasonable german yourself is also useful as your correspondence will not be english (but heh there is always google translate) and receptionists vary.

1176	Insurance	Ambulance Services - how much does it cost in switzerland?	yeak	8839	20	Location: Zurich	01.12.2011, 21:34	"    Hello, that was me! So our final bill for a call out to the park and a 5 minute journey to the hospital was 758fr for the ambulance plus 606 for the cardiomobile.  The cardiomobile was sent by the hospital itself so basic insurance for my son covered almost 90% of that but for the ambulance we got back almost 50%. Definitely take a taxi if it is not life threatening!    
As for the stranger calling a taxi I don't know the rules there, she certainly got away with it because we left with the ambulance! There may have been some sort of miscommunication due to the language barrier as my French is only basic and she knew no English at all.   
Also when we first got here we called an ambulance for my son (yes another one!), he'd cut his finger deeply and was bleeding everywhere, we didn't have a car at the time, knew no taxi numbers, my boyfriend is a bit rubbish with blood, I nearly passed out because I'd had a sickness bug all day, hadn't eaten and was exhausted...just for the call out (when the paramedics turned up they told us to get a taxi to the hospital)we were charged 445 and we have not had any money back for it. So just be careful :-)

Just read the links you provided as well as other links from those above. Apparently    And it seems like the ""technical"" requirement part can be satisfied through a variety of methods.   FAQ 11   
I can't say too much about those exams, but what I can say is that the one listed as accepted for a US based qualification, ""US - Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter, CPCU"" would be almost USELESS (or irrelevant may be a better word) for brokers advising clients on health insurance, for example.  Argh...

			That is their Hospita General policy, which covers hospital stays outside of your home canton in general ward.  It's a supplementary policy, so yes, I think you had to cancel it three months in advance.     
However, I heard (in another thread on here) there was some changes to basic insurance that would cover hospital stays outside your home canton, which would mean it would cover some of that SWICA supplementary policy.    Probably best to ask SWICA what the Hospita General coverage will include that the basic will not for 2012.

1186	Insurance	insurance for frontier	Leibniz	2364	15	Location: Geneva	13.10.2008, 17:30	" 
			
			Hi, 
I am too looking for frontailer health insurance. We live in France but hubby works in Switzerland and kids go to school there. The kids need an insurance that is valid both in Switzerland and France. We got a quote for one special frontalier insurance from Credit Mutuel for the whole family but it is very expensive and they keep telling me that this is our only option. I don't believe it is and am trying to look for other options.     
We are originally from another EU country and my husband and I have foreign policies that would cover us everywhere but the kids are not included in this. It seems that it is impossible to get an insurance just for the two kids.  Has anybody had any experience with frontalier insurances?   
Regards, 
Anne

			What would happen to you if, in the first month, you were diagnosed with cancer?  Your travel medical insurance has a fixed limit, and they will not pay above that level. Your foreign EHIC health card is only meant for emergencies.  So either the Swiss tax payer steps in and pays for your treatment, or we watch you die horribly in pain. Everyone working here is able to, and must, buy Swiss health insurance.

1189	Insurance	No Maternity Benefits :(	quackyprincesslauren	2401	11	Location: Kansas, USA	14.11.2011, 14:05	" 
			
			In order to get onto the French public health system, you must be working in France. I'm pregnant too and just moved to France a few months ago. Although my husband is French, I'm not eligible for the public system since I'm not working here - just finishing up contract work in Germany. He's also working in Switzerland and was able to take out French private insurance. He could have opted for the public system but once you get on the public system in France, you can never go back to private.   
We got insured with Credit Mutuel. There were some problems at first accepting my pregnancy (partly because I was 7 months) but we put pressure on them and they caved. My insurance costs about 200 euros a month and covers everything. Plus, being privately insured means I can see private doctors - was able to get all my ultrasounds after 6pm so my hubby could be with me. Private ultrasounds cost 200 euros and all were paid for no question. Mid-wife classes and private consultations also all paid for as well as postpartum pelvic re-education classes and treatments.   
So I recommend checking in with Credit Mutuel - especially since you're still early in the pregnancy. They also have a special frontalier plan where you can divide a Swiss salary into a francs account and a euros account and also freeze the current Swiss currency rate for 6 months to a year. Feel free to PM me if you'd like more help!   "	Posts: 12	Join Date: May 2011	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	become a little unpopular

			Isabella, I was about to write an extensive answer to your reply to my previous post. However, after reading your post a bit more carefully, I decided to ignore this thread in the future. Congratulations, you just ousted one of the very few, if not the only professional in this field on EF.    
I absolutely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your attempts to gather useful information, but I cannot stand the way you ridicule a whole branch of science and make fun of the fact that my conclusions drawn from said science enabled me to get hundreds of women through pregnancy without the loss of a single tooth, without even a single gingival pocket, just some bleeding that could be easily kept at bay and abated after birth.    
It's my job, and I've been very successfully doing this for almost 40 years. Calling that experience of mine ""anecdotal"" is an affront. Several hundred cases without an exception are not anecdotal.    
The references you provide are based on fundamental misunderstanding of some simple facts every dentist knows but most GPs totally fail to comprehend. Don't expect an MD to know much more about periodontology and cariology than an ambulance driver or a midwife. I very much respect those folks but that kind of knowledge is not their business, and it often shows.    
All your objections could be easily dismantled, references included, thousands of them.  In the course of four decades in this trade, I collected several hundred books and several thousand magazines that cover this topic, but since you did not even properly read my post, let alone try to understand what I wrote, I'm not going to waste any more time. Sorry.    
I dislike the way you treat me just because I had the cheek to point out a few very popular (also among MD's!) misconconceptions that cause a lot of damage and could be easily avoided. Nevertheless, I would like to ask you to go on brushing your teeth very carefully despite the bleeding. Forget the acid thing for a while, that's yet another misconception, understandable, correct in certain cases but wrong most of the time.    
Just do what ng1412 obviously did: Don't be afraid of the bleeding. That's the hormonal part, besides the gagging. It's frequent and per se harmless. I do not want you to run into troubles just because you p1ssed me off to a degree where I refuse to cooperate.    
Please brush your teeth as well as possible despite the bleeding. Thoroughly brushed gums generally are much healthier than those just tickled by a brush. Bleeding must not discourage but encourage you. However, brushing three times a day is another old and obstinate misconception debunked already decades ago, although true in certain cases. But please don't ask me for details; you can always find some sources that say otherwise. Internet-based half-knowledge is one of the biggest challenges to modern medicine.    
I wish you all the best for the rest of your pregnancy and a lot of joy with the little one. I'm sure your bleeding gums will heal after giving birth, provided you really keep them clean until then. Take care.

			My main house doctor bills me every 3 months, but I go for controls on a weekly basis. My specialist bills the Krankenkasse direct.   
At least it is not as bad as the Tax system where you can get hit by unexpected bills years later.    
Usually I can claim the Hausarzt money from my Krankenkasse   having to pay the bill - which is good for cash flow after I have reached my Franchise level. This is usually in February due to expensive tablets.   
Anyway, the main thing is to get your Asthma and allergy problems pin pointed and sorted and then worry about the money and job later.   
Good luck - I hope you find the right specialist.

1202	Insurance	Questions regarding the Telmed model	bargil	1996	1	Location: Zurich	22.10.2011, 08:43	" 
			
			Welcome to the forum. It would be great if you would start a new thread and  introduce yourself here           
Here's a link to a previous discussion... (where I probably said the same thing I'm saying below but whatever)       
We've had the telmed model with innova for the last 4.5 years. It saves us some money -    
Some people have better experiences than others, but ours has been innocuous. It is true that when you call, you may not find an English speaking person, although one usually appears after a brief wait. The exception might be cold and flu season when they are slammed. The idea is that by calling them, they may be able to treat you for things like cold and flu rather than have you go to a doctor's office, or to emergency.  They are gatekeepers in a sense, but so flimsy in our experience that the savings are worth it to us.    
There are a number of call centers, the one we use is Medgate. They are staffed with people who man the phones and a few consulting physicians.   
When we call, we have two options - announce an appointment or ask for a consultation. Sometimes for a new issue they will ask if you want to have a consultation -  a physician who will call you back, usually within an hour (if he/she does not, call back).  The physicians speak English.    
I have health issues and so when I call, it's always to announce an appointment, so I say this is related to ""blah blah"" or I need to have a checkup for ""blah blah"". I tell them the doctor and the date of the appointment, they usually give me 2 more without calling in the 3 month period (they use quarters ending in March, June, October, December). So I don't have to call again if I see the doctor once or twice more within that period.    
This year, I had to go to the doctor weekly, and have some treatments daily for a short time. It would have made me nuts to have to call every three days, so I asked them at the start of the year what could be done. They opened a window for me so I didn't have to call for any  of my treatments in a particular hospital (this included doctor's visits) for this calendar year.    
When we first moved here, I think we saved about 25% on our premiums. This year, since we've moving to Zurich and our insurance will increase, we save maybe 15%. Because I've had such a complicated year with health care, and it's worked so well with insurance, we'd rather pay the increase than look for another insurer. I used to work in a hospital with a nurse triage center so the telmed concept doesn't bother me.    
You might also be interested in the Hausarzt (family doctor, GP) model, where your family doctor is the gatekeeper and refers you to all specialized care, or the HMO model where you get your care in specific clinics designated or run by the insurer. These are both effective if you are comfortable with your hausarzt or clinic (hard if you don't have one yet), could be a problem if you wanted particular specialists.    
We've fouind the Telmed model to work well for us, and it saves some money. We like the service of our current insurer so we're willing to bear the cost increase.

It varies between insurance companies, but almost all of them offer some ""Family"" package, which tends to fit best.   
You must confirm your insurance wishes BEFORE the birth date to ensure full cover.   
You can do everything with one simply phone call.

			A very short answer - take it out in the US as it'll most definitely be cheaper.   
However, to get a cheaper rate in the US, you will likely need to go through underwriting (which may include a medical or a paramed part depending on how big of a death benefit we are talking about). And, in order to qualify for the cheaper rate in the US, you'll need to qualify for the preferred (which means ""better health""/""better risk"") class. And to qualify for this, most insurance companies require you to be a resident of the US which in your case, this is no longer true!   
Of course, you could choose to lie on your insurance application and say that you are a resident of the US, but the insurance company will have a 2-year period to contest this. In addition, since you are not physically in the US, it may just be difficult to go through the entire underwriting process.   
There are some other options in the US where you can get ""instant"" approval or something simliar, but these policies tend to be more expensive with a limited (lower) death benefit amount.   
When is the next time you're going to be back in the US? Could possibly do it then.     
And a general comment about Pillar 3 (regardless of whether we're talking about the insurance or the plain vanilla saving option) - be careful about putting any money in Pillar 3 as Americans!!!  The ""correct"" thinking and tax optimization for Americans in Switzerland are often the opposite of that for people from a different country, simply b/c of the US tax liability.

If you can, It sounds as I predicted, that others have said  you come back and register but quick as the doctors will realise the problem cut is old and not inflicted in insurance period. Sorry for no good news.

They seem to have some aversion to trees here with the amount of stuff that gets printed out and sent to you!   
Some companies have log ins (like KPT/CPT as mentioned by Blonaybear) but it's not commonplace.   
The Swiss like you to be ""responsible"" for yourself and your bills etc. and assume that you keep that kind of record for yourself at home.   
Also, don't be fooled by an English website. It just means that they've paid someone to translate their website. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll have English-speakers when you call them etc. (I know people who went with certain companies specifically as they had their website in English but can't get hold of anyone that speaks English). 
The majority of companies will have at least some documentation (e.g. summary of what's covered in supplementary etc.) in English even if their website isn't.

Because I have so much vacation-time left, my boss now suggested I ""sacrifice"" some of that. 
I have refused to name an actual number and I'm now waiting for his move :-/   
I find it a bit silly, but it's maybe a sign that he considers me overpaid. 
OTOH, while my pay is generous, I also do a lot for it (I think), as doing maintenance-work in off-hours and week-ends etc. 
(I'm a unix sysadmin) 
The Swiss go into the WK every year (he complained about that, too)....   
I had actually suggested to do some work from home (while technically being sick, I was also bored no end) but nothing really came forward.

			Dear all,   
if I am probably going to change my canton next year, is it wise to look at the premium of the insurance company in the new canton? I can see some dilemma here - usually one would be advised to choose the one with the lowest premium, but what if this company turns out to be more expensive in the new canton? But if I choose a not-the cheapest company in the current canton but I end up not moving, it will mean also loss too right? Any advice on this? I read somewhere a change of canton could not be used to change into new insurer in new canton? Thanks.

			Why not do this:   
For the duration that you live in Switzerland, and are travelling, make CH your registered place of residence.   
Once you have arrived in AU, and made AU your place of residence, then you cancel the CH residence.   
That way you have no overlapping residences, and no time where you have no residence.   
You respective insurance then covers you for your place of residence. 
ie: the CH insurance until you take up residence in AU, and your AU insurance from when you start in AU.   
You'll need to discuss with the Geminde as to how to cancel residence once overseas, or to cancel in early with an effective date in the future. This way you keep the safety net of CH in place to handle that worst case scenario.   
As to repatriation in case of health issues, well, you need to decide what country you wish to be repatriated to, and arrange cover and residence accordingly. In conjunction with your choice of residence.   
Most administrations and insurances around the world work on the basis that a person only has one place of residence. And you need to set this accordingly.   
Welcome to the global village, where changing country of residencehas many things to think about... (I've done it 4 times, including NZ to AU, and AU to CH, and CH to NZ).

1228	Insurance	Is it easy to change health insurances	Nuro	1107	4	Location: Lausanne	21.09.2011, 00:42	"    You can choose your new company after cancelling.  
The new company will send an attestation to your old company.  
In theory, this should be done by the 31.12 but it is sometimes done in January depending on how many new insurees the insurance company has received. It's clear that if you have 200'000 new people to send attestations for, you may not get it all done in a month!   
But yes, you're right, you need a new company to go to for the 1st of Jan.   
The basic insurance is compulsory so you can't just cancel it without having somewhere else to go.   
So, to summarise, you need to respect 3 things in order to switch companies :   
>> Cancellation letter needs to be sent by registered mail before the 30th of November   
>> You need to be up to date with your premiums (no poursuites)   
>> You need to have a new provider for the 1st of Jan.      "	Posts: 13	Join Date: Mar 2010	Newbie 1st class	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	become a little unpopular

			Hello, 
I am italian and I am about to move to Zurich in a few days. Through the Italian health system (ASL=azienda sanitaria locale), I managed to have a health insurance (with modello 106) for residents in Switzerland (I will stay there more than a year infact).  
In Zurich I have to take this document to a health district (somewhere where Switzerland can accept this insurance I made).  
My question is: Where can I find a health district in Zurich or, if there is any Italian reading this message, where can I find something that is like and ASL in Zurich? 
I thank you very much

			You need to take an accident insurance out - you can do this with your insurance comapny that has your family policy. 
i think you do need to employ your nanny officially tough as you need to supply a copy of her contract with what she is earning.   
you also need to register with AVS and again based on her monthly salary pay a fee for unemeployemtn etc ( i think it is 6 %)  
they will also sort out for you automatic bills if she is not here for 5 years she will be taxed at source (ie by her employer - so you) , you should deduct this tax from her salary tough.   
it was all vey straight forward - i called the gemeinde who gave me the papers for the RAV registration   
Good luck.

			They will offer you insurance as if they were a basic health care provider. If you live in Switzerland and are only here temporarily, you, and your spouse, can be exempt from the obligation to have the basic health insurance here by the cantonal authorities, provided you have another insurance that covers you. For this you have to fill out a form and send it to the insurance company you have here, who will then say you are insured by them. Depending on your home country, that can be the insurance you had there (this is for instance France, if I am correct) or an insurance like Swisscare, tradiconsult, etc. They then say they will provide AT LEAST the same cover as the swiss basic insurance. If you have a pre-existing condition, they will probably refuse you. If they tell you now they believe your wife had a pre-existing condition, I would imagine the burden of proof should be with them. But, they are an insurance company after all, so they might try to get out of paying...

1238	Insurance	Can my Mom drive my car?	Shiny	3904	7	Location: Zurich	10.09.2011, 14:39	"    Absolutely, unless there is enforced stipulation for some reason if the car is insured for accident and casco then any driver with appropriate permission and not under a rental agreement is covered to the level of the policy. If a driver is under 25 there is a 1000 deductible on liability as governed by Swiss law which may be different to the existing deductible. This can be coupled with a 500 excess increase.   
It is always good to have a partner or ""regular"" user named, this is generally use of over say 2 days a week per year. The name of another user than the principle driver is coupled with their date of birth and only affects the main premium if they are under 25. If there are several additional drivers then it is the name and sex of the youngest that is noted on the policy   
If they are a Swiss resident living at a different address, have the 3rd party motoring extension on their personal liability and it is a rare borrow of the vehicle then the excess and perhaps subsequent increase of the policy holder's excess in the event of a collision is covered.   
For Zurich:   
Art. 102 Insured persons 
The owner and the persons for whom he/she is responsible according to road traffic legislation shall be insured.   
13.1 Third party liability and collision Drivers If, in the event of a claim, the driver of the vehicle is younger than the drivers declared at the time of application (main driver or additional driver) and younger than 25 years of age, then the deductible for third party and collision damage shall be increased by CHF 500.   
13.2 Liability 13.2.1 The deductible agreed for young drivers shall apply if the driver of the vehicle is under 25 years of age at the time of the accident.   
13.2.2 The deductible agreed for other drivers shall apply if the driver of the vehicle was over 25 years of age at the time of the accident.    
( This is usually shown on the policy as perhaps 0/1000* with *TLP First amount for other drivers, second amount for young drivers )

			Are you by any chance here on a time-limited international assignment?   
If so, BUPA might be acceptable.   
That was the case when we first moved here on an inter-company transfer paid through the home country office, not through the Swiss office. OH's company set it up with whatever powers-that-be rule on such things, so I really don't know the details. In any event, we were not required to have a Swiss health insurer for our first 5 years here, we had coverage through BUPA international instead.   
It was only when OH switched to a local contract that we had to go with a Swiss insurer.

			I called my legal insurance. They advised me that I should personally call the building insurance and they seem confident that I have no liability and that either the gebauedeversicherung or another type of insurance should pay this bill. If the insurance say no then the legal insurance will take over the case. So Im glad I have them.   
The funny thing is, having informed the management company of the route that I am taking (l.e that I would like to personally speak to the insurance), they are being very polite.

You are meant to be backdated from the entry date and usually are but I have noticed some of the policies we do for people, especially expats at the 3 month time, with our partner companies tend, at the moment, to be charging from the date signed we don't know why and as it is beneficial neither us nor the clients are questioning it in case they decide to change their mind...

			Good evening   
1. The deductible of ten percent up to CHF 700 always applies, not matter what kind of franchise you choose (except of course for birth costs etc.)   
2. Supplementary insurance has its one rules according to the general terms and conditions. It does not change every year and should it change you will be informed by your insurance company.   
If you would like further information i will gladly help you out.

High value products have to be listed separately under household and usually cover only equates to a couple of grand outside the house unless otherwise increased, but generally only to a maximum of 4k under the standard household. If one is using specialist expensive AV, musical or computing equipment it is not automatically under the household policy, especially if it is used for professional published works.

At a minimum, you should have Rega so they can get you back to a Swiss hospital.        
If you have an iPhone, you should also get the   app from iTunes store. it is free.   
You could also look at TCS travel insurance (either Europe only or World). It might help as well.   
Here is the French page:       
They also offer an insurance for long-term care (after accident) in another country.

			In my personal experience they want to see that you are aware of the requirement of Health Insurance ONCE you live here.  Thus they ask you to produce evidence that either you already have local Health Insurance coverage, or at least a quote from a Health Insurance firm in Switzerland, in your name.  What that means is you can just walk in any Concordia (or any other firm) office, ask for a quote for you, and use THAT as your ""proof of insurance"".

1272	Insurance	Epilepsy and Health Insurance - please help!	kerrilumsden	2064	8	Location: Wiltshire, UK	10.07.2011, 00:40	" 
			
			Hi there - my son also has epilepsy. He was born here so it is slightly different. All his epilespy costs are covered by the IV (Invalid-versicherung) none of it by his personal health insurance.   
You are going to have to be careful. Epilspy medication costs vary enormously depending on the drug/s your child is on. My son was on 3, the most expensive one was hundreds of CHFs per bottle, a bottle lasted under a month. The other two were cheaper, but it all adds up.   
BUT many of these medications are not approved for use in children. Obviously children use them, but my understanding is that they havent been tested (who is going to allow their child to take these medications just as a test) and as such are not ""approved"" although of course many many kids have taken them. So you will need to check with your provider that they do pay for them. I believe some may claim the medication is not ""approved"" and therefore they don't cover it. I may be wrong, but that is what I have been told.   
We looked at changing health providers last year. And even though the IV covers all his epilepsy related costs, the new provider wanted an exclusion on any epilepsy related costs that may occur in the future. Our existing provider had been the same since birth so he didn't have any exclusions and so we didn't change.   
Hope that helps. Please let me know if you have questions.   
Jo

			many u.s. americans may also be more comfortable with the free choice (classic) model.  i didn't choose gp here because i was worried about getting stuck in a restrictive network, which can happen in the us. turns out it didn't happen. i've always used my primary care doc as a referral source for most things.  there is really not a gp equivalent in the us - i don't think family practice has the same background, and internal medicine isn't quite the same either - my primary care docs are usually internal medicine   
here's a question. is HMO the same as hausarzt? i guess i better look this up. in the US HMO  - health maintenance organization.

However if you knew you had the bill to pay, so why haven't you been setting the money aside.   
All I can suggest is you pay the bill, as insurance company ultimately take action against you if you don't.

Contact them and they will let you know if you can't tell..... and if not, take the time to ask.     
How much it will cost will depend also on how much you need to be covered for etc. 
(perhaps also dependant on the deductible structure you choose, if applicable)

1285	Insurance	Car insurance before its registered in Switzerland?	alanmack	2148	8	Location: Geneva	23.11.2010, 19:17	"    Yes this is correct, It is very tricky now...   
We for example can provide temporary cover if the car is imported whilst it is having all the tests, conversions and matriculation done. ( A process that can take a couple of months ) As soon as the duty is paid and a Stamm number is assigned at customs we can insure.   
However, In your case this would not be very sensible as you would need the car here to get it underway and then have the works done here, not very cost effective I would imagine! Also, if you have just purchased it you will have to pay the VAT on import, where as if the works take over 6 months and then you bring it in you won't.   
This really is a case for a specific underwriting unless you can get the garage doing the works to insure it on their trade policy whilst it is in their care until delivered to Switzerland.

			Insurance - not sale:   
Swiss drivers aside, I'd say the chances of you hitting an expensive car here are higher than, say, France or UK. 
This means higher repair costs etc, which should surely reflect in premiums.   
I decided on Swiss insurance for my (low value) UK car for my peace of mind. 
Right hand drive car, my inexperience on the wrong side of the road...   
This was also based on advice of my other half (12 years UK insurance work). 
She said not to trust a UK insurer to cough up if something happened... also UK issued green card expense.   
The Swiss vs UK cost was about the same but Swiss cover was better and had a green card, but then I was paying inner city premium in the UK. 
If you're paying Scottish Highlands rates, you're in for a shock...

			I'm not sure I would necessarily mention a lawyer in your first letter - it might get things off on a sour note when actually you understand it was an accident, he's happy to pay and it can all be done amicably. Plus, it might seem excessive to claim to have consulted a lawyer over CHF200 before he's actually refused to pay!

1300	Insurance	Car insurance cancellation and insurance refusal	hoover	5211	8	Location: zurich	08.05.2011, 23:58	" 
			
			Let me a bit explain situation.   
 You already send cancellation and it was accepted. 
 You had required car insurance plus additional insurances   
 Now - at the time when insurance should be cancelled - you do not change papers are SVT.   
 Of course you need to have mandatory car insurance however you are not obligated to have additional insurances.   
So at the data when cancellation was accepted with data 01.march.11 let's say - however I have not changed at SVT until 1.may.2011 - do I have both insurances or just required since my cancellation date already passed and both parts of insurance should have been cancelled ?   
In other words should I have accident and drive over street lights - would I still be covered (since it's my fault - it wouldn't fall under basic insurance) or rather insurance company would say ""no , sorry - you are on you own - yes, we had to covery your SVT mandatory insurance since you haven't changed papers however nothing on top of it"" ... ?   
Thanks

1302	Insurance	Franchise, Quote-Part and Hospital Contributions	Vlh22	1738	3	Location: UK, formerly Vaud	10.05.2011, 23:23	" 
			
			Finally got to the bottom of this...   
It seems that Assura made a mistake in January 2010 and should have charged me the hospitalisation contribution.    
Interestingly, I was told the hospitalisation contribution doesn't actually go to the hospital! (I found this out because I rang up the hospital to query the number of days they'd charged me for - I'd had several days leave - and the lady there explained that the hospitalisation contribution is nothing to do with them, and said she hadn't even known that it went up in January this year.)   
This is rather puzzling as my social worker tells me the hospitalisation contribution is based on what you would spend on food each day... so I would have thought the hospital, as providers of that food, get the money!   
The really frustrating fact is that social aid doesn't cover the hospitalisation contribution. No-one thought to mention that fact to me, so now I need to find 615 CHF... Thankfully my insurance company have agreed a payment plan.    
The really bizarre thing is that when you are hospitalised for more than a month your social aid is cut. Because you are in hospital and are being fed! But you still have to pay the hospitalisation contribution... because you are in hospital and being fed!!! Can someone explain the logic of that please?    
(If anyone is wondering why I never noticed this before... a) the hospitalisation contribution has increased by 50% this year, and b) I am very appreciative for getting social aid, but I it happens quite often that I submit for various things at the end of the month and the amount I receive is subtly different, and you don't get a breakdown. I've given up trying to figure out why. It just so happened that I made a claim at a different time of the month and it was only for my contribution towards a hospital bill... so when I got less than I was expecting I spotted it.)

			Similar happened to me when I moved from UK to Basel a couple of years ago.  Pickfords (the useless twunts) insisted that they needn't remove the bed bit from very heavy,large sofa bed to get it out the front door.  Consequently they ripped the leather on either side along with sh*t load of other damage which I didn't know anything about until furniture was unpacked 3 months later.  When the fell-mi-laddy came around to assess all the damage, I made it quite clear that they could try to make 'good' the other damages but the leather sofa had to be fully reimbursed as I would not accept a repair.  It caused loads of bother and paperwork and I waited, waited, waited but 'cos I dug my heels they completely reimbursed me in full for everything (took 3 months).  Its a right pain in the ar*e when the 'professional' movers mess it up so I hope you strike a hard bargain and get whats fair.

			With OKK, there was a flexiplan, which is Standard insurance, which can be upgraded to Private, for hospitals, and Birthing houses. 
Most of the birth, and the 3 days thereafter was paid for.  Unfortuantely if you decide to take this plan after you have become pregnant, then any Birth bills will not fall under Private insurance.   
It would be best to contact your medical aid agent.   
Btw Congrats on deciding to go to a Birthing house!  All the best for the birth.

1308	Insurance	Notification of Changes to Health Insurance at Federal Level	Vlh22	1096	0	Location: UK, formerly Vaud	10.05.2011, 23:00	" 
			
			Hello,   
I have searched for information on this, but with no joy.   
Are health insurance companies obligated to notify their customers of changes which will take place (to their cover) as a result of changes at a federal level?   
To give an example:   
I was hospitalised in January for a month and a half. I had 3 hospitalisations last year, all at the same place, so I thought I knew the drill.    
Bills went to Assura, last week I got the bill for my share (except it's not exactly a bill, but a notification of when the money will be taken from my account).    
I've already passed my franchise (I'm the sort of customer health insurance companies hate), and this little stay used up my 'quote-part' too, as far as I can make out. They haven't charged me for the full 10% at any rate. But the bill was still rather high. Then I looked at the hospital contribution. It was MASSIVE. I looked out the bills from my last little visit. No-where close.    
Then I saw the small print on the latest bill. Apparently the 'Department Fédéral de l'Interieur' raised the hospital contribution rates on the 1st January 2011. From 10 fr to 15 fr. That explained my huge bill.    
Now my question is: should I have been notified of this change by my insurance company? I have a copy of the policy conditions for basic insurance, but it is the one I was sent when I took out the policy in 2009. Shouldn't they have re-written, and re-issued, the policies to reflect this change, which is, after all, pretty major? Or do they not have to because it was a change at federal level?    
And, if they   have notified me, does that mean I can contest the payment and only pay the 10 fr that is listed in my policy?   
In the interests of giving people the big picture, I don't actually pay for my health insurance because I get revenue d'insertion. One branch of social services pay my premiums, another pay the 10% and additional costs like hospital contribution fees and ambulance fees. So I'm not in a panic because I have a huge bill I can't afford to pay... I'm miffed because I wasn't informed of what I consider a major change in my conditions. Of course, if I were earning and paying my own way I would be panicking... but just to make it clear I'm not looking for information on how to pay this unexpectedly big bill... just clarification if it is legal to inform me of the change in the law   when it affects me.   
I have a second question regarding quote-parts and hospital contributions, but I'll start a   because I think it's a different issue.

			[GEEK]Alcohol is very good at drying electronics. It is hygroscopic and has a very loving relationship with water; even distilling will only get you to roughly 80% pure for isopropyl or 90% for ethanol as it forms an azetrope with water and can only be increased in purity by chemical drying or with molecular sieves. [/GEEK]   
It's probably OK to soak an Ipod with it, if you want to try get some 99% pure isopropyl at the drug store. Iso is what's preferred in the circles I run in for water removal. They sell loads of it and won't give you the suspicious stare asking for pure ethanol might bring on.

			There are so many types of Insurances, and so many types of 'basic' Insurance. Check with your Insurer, it's the only way to be sure.

1314	Insurance	Regarding work permit to VISA	New UZH researcher	881	1	Location: Zurich	01.05.2011, 14:48	" 
			
			The basic immigration process is that you take some paperwork and money to your local Swiss embassy or consulate and they place an immigration visa in your passport.  I believe that the ""ERMACHTIGUNG ZUR VISUMERTEILUNG"" is part of this paperwork. Then you have something like 3 months to enter Switzerland and register which then causes a more permanent identification card to be sent to you.   
The details of this are dependent on the exact type of visa (I'm not sure if research visa's are different) and the processes of your local embassy or consulate.     
You'll probably need an appointment at said consulate anyway.  So, send an email to your local consulate. ""I am a citizen of x, living in y, and I have been offered a job at UZH. I have an 'ERMACHTIGUNG ZUR VISUMERTEILUNG'.  I am [single/married] [with/without] children.  What paperwork will [I/we] need to receive [my/our] entry visa(s)?  When can I bring it in, and how long will it take?""     
This Swiss may be sticklers for rules and forms and such, but my experience is that they are happy to explain them when asked nicely and ahead of time.   
You probably won't need any insurance paperwork yet.  If so, it is something different from, say, my situation.  However, once you take up residence the local authorities will want to make sure that you have health insurance - which is easy, and you will have a month or more to sort it out.

			We had a baby here with my wife's basic insurance as well.  We are not used to paying high monthly premiums that we have to in Switzerland, but... we were very impressed with the treatment throughout the pregnancy as well as the birth process.  We felt very comfortable with each doctor, midwife or nurse who took care of us at the hospital.  My wife had a very comfortable birth because of it, and the food she got wasn't bad either!  We didn't have a private room, but because it was quiet in January in the Baden kantonspital, it ended up that our room was private or semi-private at most!  We loved the Baden kantonspital and have heard good news from others who have had babies here.   
(Just to make you feel more secure about it all! )

			We are in a similar situation- trying to get a driving record for my husband from the cantonal car transport department (DMV-equivalent) to submit to US auto insurers.    
We are based in Zürich, so here is the relevant link for this canton:  . If you Google ""ADMAS"" and your canton's car transport department, you should find the relevant webpage for you.   
Per the website, we sent a letter to the authorities asking for his excerpt from the federal ADMAS register, including a copy of his Swiss drivers license. Unfortunately, we experienced a hiccup with this, as he wasn't found in the register, so we are trying to find another approach. However, this could be an exception, so this might be worth a shot for you.    
We did not own a car, but were Mobility members. Thinking out loud here, I wonder if Mobility could provide a driving record. To the OP- thanks for inspiring this line of thought!   
When we successfully get a copy of his driving record, I'll post an update.   
Good luck!

Before you do it, check if the contract has a capital at the end. 
With this amount you will received back from the tax office around 2500CHF depending of your income and residence.

			How good is your German? Before getting a lawyer, I'd go to their office and ask to discuss this with an advisor - and attempt to strike a deal. If your German is not too hot, take somebody with you and make sure they are briefed properly. They can't cancel Insurance and yet keep taking the money. But if you want to keep the same Insurance number, etc, you probably just need to pay for the 3 missing months. No point in going to the trouble and expense of a solicitor if you can find a solution with them, surely.

			Of course different Companies have different additional coverages in that case. For example, at Groupe Mutuel you can either choose a ""daily allowance insurance"" which covered in case inability to earn due to an accident or a sickness  ( )   
or you can choose their ""Provista Insurance"" which is a lump sum that you can be paid in the case of a disability related to an accident

I can recommend Jenny as she has just finished arranging health and home contents insurance for me.   
My circumstances are slightly different as I came here directly from the UK mid November 2007. My compulsory insurance did not start until beginning of February.

			Thanks for the update... after I'd calmed down a bit I realised that seeing as I'd spent  4 months in hospital last year and seen my psychiatrist once a fortnight outside that and done a 20 week therapy group and also gone to ergothérapie twice a week... it was probably all covered!    
As for why I don't go home...

That was all the psychiatric help I got for 3 years... I'm not kidding. I wish I was.

1330	Insurance	Insurance for a sailing dinghy	eng_ch	1265	0	Location: Richterswil	28.03.2011, 10:51	" 
			
			I'm in the process of trying to get my dinghy on the water (at last!) and no doubt will need some sort of insurance. I'm hoping to store the boat at the local sailing club (when I get round to ringing them) so some sort of theft and accidental damage/loss insurance is probably in order; the trailer will be worth rather more than the dinghy. I presume my Privathaftpflicht will cover third party. Any recommendations?

1331	Insurance	Used Car Insurance	vvvnaga	1556	2	Location: Adliswil Zurich	26.03.2011, 21:57	" 
			
			I have a first generation A6 (pretty much the same as an Audi 100). I pay 630 CHF for obligatory insurance (with Zurich connect) + 650 CHF in annual road tax (kanton Bern, so it's based on weight of the car).   
Of course if the car costs 1000 CHF you can be pretty much sure it wont have MFK, and since it's over 10y old, you will need a fresh MFK in order to register it.    
Good news is that these cars had galvanized bodywork so rust is not usually a problem (main reason for failing MFK). Other things are not expensive to fix in these cars, as long as you're not fixing in Switzerland. Find out why did the car fail its last MFK, as if it could have it, it would have it.

1332	Insurance	Best option for an expat Between a 3 Pillar A and B.	Stan4	7000	10	Location: Fribourg	19.03.2011, 11:09	" 
			
			Stan4   
It is common practice to open a whole set of different 3a accounts, rather than pay all into a single account.  The reason ?  At retirement the saver will usually want to draw down some value each year to supplement his/her pension income.  The rules of 3a accounts do not allow withdrawals from the same account within a 5 year period.  So, the norm is to take from account 1 in year 1, account 2 in year 2 etc.  In the sixth year you can again withdraw from what is left in account 1 and start the cycle again.   
Now, I guess what you are suggesting is that you have found a product which will withdraw the full amount in year 1 and place it into a normal savings/bank account, from which it can be paid monthly.  That is fine, except that if your account holds a lot you will receive a sizeable tax bill in year 1, rather than almost nothing per year by the normal method.   
Again, rather than constantly making assertions that people disagree with, please provide a link to your source of information.  Then we can all be equally well educated.

			Your mother should be able to find Tourist/vacation insurance in the US prior to coming. It is taking a huge risk if she comes without, as she will NOT be covered in case of illness or accident, and YOU, as a resident here, will be liable to pay all costs. If no Insurance is prepared to cover her, because of serious pre-existing conditions, it is better that she does NOT come over, and that you go and visit her in the US. An extensive stay in hospital, especially if surgery needed, could add up to 10000s - and YOU will be expected to pay. I've just Googled 'vacation insurance for US citizens' and dozens of options came up. Much much cheaper and safer, honest.

			You cannot drive a car in Switzerland without insurance because you can't obtain licence/number plates without insurance.   
As Swiss car insurance is still not particularly competitive, you might ask the dealer to handle it all for you - they should have a tame insurance agent...

If you just think twice in future before groaning, remembering that there might be more behind a comment than you realise, I'll be content.

Looking through the current policy, I don't see any mention of what happens if he gains the weight back. I would think if there was such a clause it would have to be in the policy, oder?   
There must be many people who are no longer as slim and fit as they were when they took out a policy 10, 20 years ago. I would doubt that there is an automatic loss of cover if one gains weight, but I honestly don't know - and am not inclined to stir that pot by asking the agent.

			I had almost (or exactly) the same thing happen to me with Avanex. I received a confirmation of acceptance in late November and that the transition would be handled automatically. I even confirmed with the contact by phone.   
I was still receiving bills from the old insurance company so I gave them a call and found out that they had not received a termination order from anyone. Call Avanex and was told that I needed to send the termination order myself. Complete contradiction to my earlier phone call.   
So in Dec 2010 I sent a letter to Avanex instructing them to cancel my policy asap. I get a phone call in Jan 2011 and I reclarified that the policy should be cancelled. Then I received another invoice reminder from them. Luckily, I had another contact who was quite helpful. I sent him personally a letter (sent by registered mail) and followed up with a call to make sure that he cancelled my policy.

1351	Insurance	Frontalier insurance	swisshel	2360	2	Location: Geneva	12.02.2011, 15:56	" 
			
			The 2 main options are the Swiss state insurance (LAMal) or a private frontalier insurance. A third option is the CMU which gets you onto the French state system but from what I've read is quite limited in how much you can claim (and this is not the same as the French ""sécurité sociale"" which you cannot subscribe to).   
As far as I know the LAMal is the most expensive and similar to what Swiss residents have to subscribe to except that frontaliers are unable to reduce their premiums by opting for a higher excess (or any excess at all by the sounds of it).   
So that leaves private frontalier insurance which seems to be the most flexible and apparently a lot cheaper than the LAMal. I think that is the reason but I'm no expert on this.

			Hi,   
I just move to Lausanne in early January. After a while, i decided to join the EGK care (GP models) since it is the cheapest one. And i have 2 questions regarding that.    
1. He asked me when should it begin. I told him that i came to Switzerland in early Jan. and then he asked if i have a letter from the commune. then i saw him the letter from the commune asking me for a copy of my health insurance. After he read that email, he decided that i could to start the insurance from Feb. Is that really ok??? I read the letter again and again (using google translate, i don't speak french) and i couldn't find information saying that i could start from Feb . Will this lead me to a problem?   
2. I have to tell them the doctor of my choice from their list. From the list i found one who can speak English. So i called her and tell her that i am a new customer of EGK health insurance and i want to be her patient. She told me to come next week to her. Is she going to do a preliminary health check on me? I have a little bit concern wether i'm going to be honest or not. I have a little issue with my health. All women in my family have a auto-immune disease, i'm the only one without it. My previous doctor told me that i also have a tendency and i do some blood check every year. Last year i already show some symptoms but it still negative and he want me to do some test every 6 months. Should i tell this to my new doctor? or can i just stay quiet and then in June i come to her and ask her to do some blood check? I am still healthy. If i tell her the situation will it increase my health insurance premium?? i already sign the contract with EGK and it said that my monthly is 205 CHF.   
thank you so much for your advise

			Great to hear you're healthy, but may I ask - why are you paying the high premiums for 500chf excess, when you could be paying much less for 2500chf excess? In worst case (depending on your insurer) you could perhaps pay 800chf more that single year when you happen to need expensive treatment. You could save more than that in one year if following your usual scheme (medical bills not exceeding even the lowest excess).

It was claimable via the normal basic insurance, but we didn't bother as we're always thousands of CHFs off the franchise limit anyway.

sometimes two providers will offer the same cover.... but with different limits, and applications to the excess structure.

1368	Insurance	So confused by Sanitas	guest	5853	4	null	null	" 
			
			Okay so I'm with Sanitas for health insurance because they are the cheapest. I got my policy back in October.    
My Wife came over in January. It turned out that Sanitas is the cheapest for her as well. So I sent the form away.    
A few days later the Neuchatel canton people sent me a peice of paper saying they have chosen my insurance for me and have chosen Sanitas. So I let things linger, hoping that Sanitas will work things out.    
So my wife got a phone call at home last week. She doesn't speak French so it wasn't so good.    
She got another phone call today from someone who speaks a bit more English. He said he would get his friend to call who did speak English.    
So I decided to just phone Sanitas and see what the lay of the land is. The lady on the phone had no record of my wife's insurance form    
She said she would send another form out by email. It had completely the wrong names on it though    
But I KNOW they received the insurance forms. Because between me getting my insurance and me sending away for the Wife's insurance I moved and got a land line. I had no land line at my old place.    
Also Neuchatel canton not giving you the full three months to find insurance is a hassle!

			my understanding was that you could continue to pay health insurance for up to 5 years after you left CH. This may only apply to EU members and may be health insurance company specific. in the end it comes down to the cost of the insurance of where you go. the more i look at this the last thing to do is chop and change unless you have access to a public scheme.

1371	Insurance	Insurance rates higher if last car was stolen?	Mapache	1444	4	Location: Zurich	11.01.2011, 16:59	" 
			
			It was stolen in Belgrade, while parked on the street. Don't try to tell us that police systems in Serbia are as sophisticated as in the west unless you have firsthand experience to relate. What someone told you while complaining about the Italian police is just heresay. I have spent several hours in police stations in Belgrade (dealing with visitor registration, car registration, the stolen car and some other paperwork), and I can tell you that their ""systems,"" so to speak, are antiquated, disorganized and highly corrupt. Unless you have experienced it firsthand, it is hard to believe. And fwiw, language has not been an issue in my experiences since I've always been accompanied by a native speaker.   
For example, when registering as a foreigner in Serbia, it is of no importance to the police where you are actually residing for your stay -- what matters is bringing a copy of the national ID of the apartment owner. If your landlord is out of town and this cannot be furnished, not to worry, any apartment owner will do -- friend, relative, whomever. They are perfectly happy to enter an admittedly false address into their book, and no, there is not one computer in the room.   
I have also witnessed police corruption firsthand, but to admit the details would be imprudent. Suffice it to say that a couple hundred euros placed in the right hands (that part is key) can induce a burst of efficiency to rival the Swiss.   
As stated in my original post, my copy of the stolen vehicle report was furnished from a big book in a room full of big books. It had been typed into a form using a computer, and the form had been printed and filed away manually. The information may be in a digital database somewhere, but when I needed to retreive my copy no computer was employed and the only form of indexing was the date (it could not be looked up by name, make, etc). Nobody in the station knew where to point us for this either -- we were misdirected twice before locating the proper room. I highly doubt that stolen vehicle reports are shared across Serbia's borders, or even that they are shared with any efficiency within the state's borders or even the precinct building.   
And for the record, I had (stupidly, yes) opted out of theft insurance and been too lazy on this instance to electronically cripple the car.

			I have spent several hours searching for UK style travel insurance.  The Swiss policies seem to be focussed on the medical issues, rather than flight cancellations, baggage etc.   
The best I have managed to find is:  .  I spoke to a lady who said they cover people living in Switzerland.  Obviously proof of how good a policy is comes in the claim, but best I have found so far. 
FYI: The TCS policy does not seem to cover bad weather or airline failure etc. 
I emailed ELVIA / mondial-assistance.ch to ask questions about their policy to be told:     Have you already booked your flights? If yes, then the coverage thru our annual policy for cancellation is not longer possible. We are very sorry for this. In our annual policy there is no baggage included. We can offer a separate baggage insruance for each trip.  Please note, that the volcanic eruption is a force mjeure and never covered thru our insurance. The bankruptcy of an airline is also never covered.   
Just a warning to those with travel insurance, wanting more than the medical related cover: I suggest you check what you are covered for.  We almost found out the expensive way.

			I was ill for nine months, and gave the blanket permission as asked - I signed a standard letter that was sent to me. It gave me no problem whatsoever. The insurance co is only trying to do its job, and hasnt got the time or inclination to ask your doctor questions out of mere curiosity. It asks what it needs to know. Your doctor knows the insurance law well, and will not give any info that is prejudicial to you. I am a health professional, so well-placed to know.   
My adivce would be to sign the letter that is sent to you.

			I really dont think you are going to get far with the agent, the law is pretty clear on this one. He/she may have been a bit slack/remis by not informing you, but that doesnt really change anything in regards to the beginning date of your insurance  
Best thing, as others have said, is to contact your insurance and spread out the payments to ease the pain a little. 
Good luck

1383	Insurance	Terminating a 3 year Car/Van insurance	p42	1326	3	Location: Kanton Zurich, Adliswil.	22.12.2010, 15:16	" 
			
			With all insurance policies here, if you can prove you don't need them any longer you can get most of your money refunded. However many policies tie you in to a 10 year contract, but if you leave Switzerland or sell the van you get a refund. Handing the plates back stops the insurance running, but there is usually a SFr 50,-- handling fee.    
You must, before you sign any contract, understand what you are signing up to, and if you don't like one of the conditions get it removed.    
I crossed out the automatic annual renewal clause on my Fitness center contract. They said they couldn't agree to that. I walked away. They called me back and agreed to a 12 month clause.    
I found out that the TCS insurance is on a 12 month renewable basis, web page is only in D/F/I and I think the company behind the TCS offer is the Basler Insurance, and therefore can be reccommended, (but you have to join the TCS, membership is Fr 90,-- per year):

			If you are living and working in Switzerland full time and not here as a student or someone similar then it is law to have Swiss health Insurance. My partner was here with UK insurance for four years and we had twins born here with UK insurance. No problems. Then the Kanton authorities stated that we had to have local insurance and there is no way round it, its law.    
The exeptions are students, au pairs and the like who are here for a temporary period of time, before returning to their home country.

The list of different tests here :       
The list of procedures and everything else can be found here :       
As you can see, it's pretty complicated. However, the law states that you have to informed that a particular medicine or procedure is not reimbursed by your health insurance.    
In fact, you will get a better feel for things if you realise that in Switzerland there is no health insurance, but sickness insurance.

1386	Insurance	Who pays?	biff	1236	5	Location: basel	18.12.2010, 01:37	"    Yes, that was my first reaction. ( and I mentioned to him that  there is an excess to pay. He replied that there is probably no excess on ""glass"" replacement.  ( I am presuming he meant porcelain, not that he wants me to claim for a nonexistant broken window)    
 But then I began to wonder if there would be longterm consequences for me: eg: losing a no claim discount, or having premiums raised.     
But, I also have no intention of fibbing to the insurance company , if there is any question as to when the crack first appeared.  I have no intention of any long term consequence that may include me going to court for attempting to defaud an insurance company. That is why I want to be very sure of the facts before I see the landlord again.

			Hello everybody, 
I need to find a basic medical insurance provider (new in Suisse, 3rd month of employment running out). Basically I aim for lowest possible costs, and using comparis.ch (age 29) I found the cheapest one -   (with GP model, 195/month). But since I am contracting here, and my contract runs out to 1.5.2011, I might be moving outside canton VD (Zurich is most probable place). And I am not sure if this will work OK, if there are enough doctors compatible with EGK etc... I have also seen quite popular Assura (which is like 35/month francs more expensive than EGK). 
Which one (or another one) would you choose? 
I am completely new to this, so I apologize if I ask simple questions, but I wasn't able to find definite answers even here   "	Posts: 503	Join Date: Mar 2010	Forum Veteran	Groaned at 26 Times in 21 Posts	Thanked 307 Times in 172 Posts	earned the respect of many

			We had just one skipped bill and a back payment of two months when we arrived here...that was bad enough for a family of 5 on a tight budget    
Our health insurance company were more than happy to issue us with a broken up set of payment slips, due various times, according to the agreed payment schedule...   
I'd be working out as quickly as possible what you can afford to pay, and how quickly you can clear the debt...and then make them an 'offer' on that basis....far less hassle for them than following you through the legal system...as long as you keep paying up... you might be lucky and avoid a bad credit history...or living on potatoes for the next year or two...

1396	Insurance	"Car insurance questions - parking & ""other risks"""	alanmack	1505	5	Location: Geneva	09.12.2010, 20:18	" 
			
			All insurances pay into a fond for when the person at fault cannot be found. I know this because I've 'benefited' from it as some drunk or whatever rammed the side of my car while it was parked. The major drawback is the excess CHF 1000. I've also got lucky once with a car scrapping mine in a parking lot. Thankfully it was only superficial so I could get it polished away. Personally I think I'd pay the CHF200 cause paying 1000 at once because of some idiot is not fun. Unless you have an excess on top of those 200 extra.   
I've also got all the extras you've mentioned. CHF 400 may be alot but it's nothing compared to the damage of your car burning down to the frame, some drunk idiot deciding to take his anger out on your car or a marten feeling a bit hungry. Hail is also something you wanna have covered

			Hi Rob,   
Sorry to hear that someone has burgled your laptop...    
Just to let you know this has happened last month in my apartment also, the thief had broke open the window when we were not at (Guess he would have watched us going out).   
He had come inside searching for valuables that are easy to carry in hand but couldnt find anything but for the laptop.    
Thankfully we had insured our house few months back only. Though we had lost peace of mind , we are happy that we got the money back for the laptop from the Insurance co. So its always safe to insure the house as these kind of uncertain incidence can happen anytime.   
Regards, 
VSS

			Send the copy of the bill to Atupri, with perhaps a note telling them your insurance policy number and address / date of birth etc. You can even scrawl this on the bill itself. They will reimburse you pretty quickly, but only to the amount agreed in your policy - not the full whack. If you don't know where to send it, give 'em a call. They're very efficient.

			Unless you sign up for the super cheap restricted health care insurance, regular swiss insurance gives you choice of doctors.  The only thing I would be concerned is that if living in the greater Lausanne/la Cote area, there is generally a shortage of drs. and it may take a while to find one that will take you right away without a waiting list or calling around to many before finding one.

1411	Insurance	Urgent: Does my health insurance cover counselling?	Vlh22	2744	11	Location: UK, formerly Vaud	17.09.2010, 20:55	" 
			
			Hi all,   
Thanks for the advice and sympathy yesterday.    
Just in case anyone ever finds themselves in a similar situation, I thought I'd post what I have found out.    
Your insurance will cover counselling in some situations, e.g. if it is prescribed by a psychiatrist and given by a psychologist who is supervised by the psychiatrist.    
However, how this works out varies from psychiatrist to psychiatrist. My psychiatrist, for example, is attached to a hospital. She spends 50% of her time working with inpatients and 50% of her time with outpatients. So there is a limit to the amount of time she can spend with me, and the same is true for the psychologists attached to the hospital. If your psychiatrist works in a private practice with psychologists under them, you will be able to see your psychiatrist more often (assuming they have space), because all of their time is with outpatients. However, you can't pick and choose, e.g. you can't have both at the same time!    
I feel much better having spoken to my psychiatrist and we are going to increase the frequency of our meetings and also try and speed up a referral for further assessment by the psychologists. She has also reassured me that in the event that I can't see her, I can always access the 'medcin de guard' system at the hospital, which is a 24 / 7 service.

			I would like to have a question too. I am about to buy (actually lease) a used 3 year-old audi. I do make back-and-forth trips about 4-5 times a year to my home country Hungary where car theft is sort of a common sport, and I am dreading waking up one morning on such a trip to the car being gone.      
Apart from trying to get a parking place guarded by security (not easy), is there any form of CASCO that would cover theft within the EU? 
And if yes, how much would that cost me?

1418	Insurance	Student Family Member Insurance changes in Swisscare?	wang984	2747	7	Location: zurich	08.07.2010, 21:55	" 
			
			Hi, family members cannot be insured by Swisscare nor by another cheap student health insurance since more than a year. This is cause the authorities in some cantons has restricted the insurance plans only for students or researchers and no more for family members.   
Means that you cannot insure your family member with a student plan as your wife is not a student.   
But in fact the partner company that is provided by Swisscare, named Sanitas is a very good option. And the premiums are the standards ""cheap tranche"" in Switzerland.   
If you as student has an insurance by Swisscare, you must continue your insurance for one year more if you dont cancelled your insurance within the cancellation delay. Swisscare has 3 months delay for the end of the year as this company is a Private one.   
But by far, you cannot fine better option for you with the Swisscare plan or only with CSS plan but attention, they not provide all coverage that is provided by Swisscare or with additional premiums.   
In fact, advantage with Swisscare is that they cover the ""Allgemeine Abteilung"" in the package. This is if you need a treatment in another canton as yours. By CSS you have to buy this option additionally and finally your premium is then higher by CSS as SWISSCARE and you have to fill out a full medical questioner for your additional plan (who is not the case by Swisscare).   
Both companies are currently leaders on the student insurance (all other companies has medical questioners, restrictions in their plans and this can grow the risk of a coverage refusal if you announce claims.   
For the Sanitas, your wife has one of the most efficient company in Switzerland and I think it is a very good solution.   
For kids also this is good and you have to know that premiums for kids are around CHF 80 / month   + -  depending if you choose a franchise (but often no franchise is choosed.)   
Finally the solution Swisscare for student or researcher and family members with Sanitas or another company is a very good combination.   
Cheers :-)

We have not submitted a claim but can confirm that they were quicker in issuing the paperwork and medical cards than our previous insurer. I also like that they make the effort to send out a newsletter in English as well as IT/FR/DE.

Have a small issue and having trouble finding the required information, maybe someone here can point me to the required info......    
my girlfriend has moved in to my apartment and has been added to my current household insurance policy.   
Her existing houshold insurance is still running (5 year term ends oct 2011), she was told by my insurance and her insurance helpline that when she is transferred to another persons policy that has a higher value,  her insurance will no longer be valid and can be cancelled.     
She has been trying to cancel her household insurance but here existing company now say no its not possible and it will be cancelled only at end of 2011.   
Does anyone know the actual regulation as we both believe her company are trying it on.   
thanks in advance

			It's well worth the price to have your personal household contents insured and also to insure yourself against possible damage claims from 3rd parties.   
We had a fire this summer in our apartment ( ) and without the household insurance we'd have had to pay 1'000s to replace what was damaged. Stupid things can happen faster than you can imagine sometimes, so .... I'd seriously advise it.

			I am not sure if this differs by Canton, but here it Vaud there is a list of exemptions to the swiss health insurance.  There are indeed a number of cases whereby swiss health insurance is not mandatory, including in the case of a traineeship.  Best to check with your Canton authorities for the equivalent information.  Here it is in French:       De plus, d'autres personnes sont exemptées sur requête si elles bénéficient d'une couverture d'assurance équivalente et font parties des catégories suivantes; Si l'assuré possède un des statuts mentionnés ci-dessus et qu'il bénéficie d'une assurance offrant des prestations équivalentes à la LAMal, une dispense lui sera délivrée pour la durée de son séjour en Suisse.

Assuming I leave in say Jan/Feb of 2011 would an adjustment in my deductibles constitute a change in my policy and thus force me to keep the insurance coverage for all of 2011?

1438	Insurance	Questions about Complementary Insurance	swiss bill	1020	0	Location: vaud	24.10.2010, 16:45	" 
			
			My understanding about complementary insurance is that you should check before changing companies because the alternative insurer may not accept you.   
But, if I sign a contract with an insurer that offers a 3 or 5 year contract (which will offer certain discounts), does this give the company the right to increase premiums on an annual basis, within that time period, and obliges me to remain with them?  And, at the end of the overall period, (3 or 5 yrs), does the insurer have the right to reject me as a client (because of increased age, and/or medical history within that period)?   
Thanks in advance.

			You will probably find it is down to the terms and the cover taken out rather than the insurance provider.     
Best to do is to call the company and speak to them.  I would have thought most of the large insurers should have English speakers, I know Zurich connect does.

Everything had been brought from the US and I did not have receipts. I gave model #s and purchase dates as close as I could remember and the insurance company made payments on their estimates of value. I was happy enough with their payour so did not challenge it.   
Good luck.

Even if I was to say ""Yes, I did it, using the same insurance company as you"", that still doesn't mean   covered, and you still should call them before incurring expense.

1446	Insurance	How are HMO and GP models funded?	greencelery	2361	1	Location: Baden	15.10.2010, 12:19	" 
			
			Hi   
I've only half an answer from you (and as a newbie its fairly theoretical). I'm sure some American EFers who are used to HMO type models may have a different view!  A bit of a long rant as well as I find the whole area of comparing international systems fascinating.. geeky I know..   
On a systems basis this document has a good summary of how Swiss system works and how Drs get paid:      
(interesting Switzerland has way more Drs than most other developed countries, but not way more nurses - you could ask the question does this mean that Drs are doing things nurses/AHPs could be doing???)   
So in theory you're right - with an HMO model Drs are incentivised not to treat you and keep the money.  However in the main this would be a really poor call on their part for a number of  reasons 1) professional integrity, 2) you may well get sicker and then you'll cost the HMO/Dr way more money down the line 3) most HMOs set at least loose standards re treatment (drugs formulary, standardised lengths of hospital stay, semi-standardised pathways of care).   
With a standard GP model primary care physicians are paid on a free per service basis (and again bear in mind this has perverse incentives  ie to follow up patients more often, to over test or to refer onto specialists at a lower threshold, to over prescribe)    
Re the wrong drug prescription this could occur in either model and could be influenced by a range of factors which are behavioural as much as financial.  Drugs formulary could be set by insurer, HMO, State or Canton (I think, not sure on this one) etc etc.  Theres loads of research which shows that Drs are as influence-able as the rest of us (thats why drug companies spend gzillions on drug reps).  It could also be an honest mistake or just that the drug didnt work for you.  Unless its a highly specialised drug then the cost of the drug is likely to be a fraction of the cost of the Drs time anyhow.     
So a bit of an essay but hope some of it useful  in deciding which option is better theres definitely pros and cons.  Ive worked in both English NHS and the States and Im more comfortable with a GP as gatekeeper/HMO style than fee for service free for all but then that might be my socialist roots showing..    
J   
PS  youre not quite right re GPs in England  they are paid a proportion of their income based on what treatment they provide  both directly and indirectly.  Directly under an arrangement called 'Quality and Outcomes Framework' and indirectly since they are effectively owners of small businesses so they choose what they spend their revenue on.  Eg if they choose not to employ a practice nurse to support diabetics they can take home more pay themselves BUT it could be argued the patient gets worse care- controversial.   
PPS - From talking to people about this is seems that as costs spiral upwards in Switzerland the old methods of providing gold standard healthcare (employing more Drs and paying them more) arent working (not surprisingly re cost containment) and so theyre looking increasingly to UK, US and Germany in particular for learning on standardising tariffs, managed care (a dirty word in the States but actually shows some good outcomes), Clinician owned groupings etc.  So likely we'll see more shifts towards HMO type models.

			If you are resident in Switzerland then you should have at least the basic Swiss Insurance unless you come under some special category which allows exemption.     Its unlikely that any UK policy could meet Swiss standards. For example, the basic insurance has to be provided by a non profit making company and they have to  accept you, at normal terms, irrespective of your state of health. They cannot alter the cover, increase the premium or refuse to renew your policy, no matter how bad your health may become. The companies also participate in various health schemes.

Your Gemeinde Social Services Department can give you more information. I know for instance the IV will pay for straightening the teeth, but not sure if they pay when the child is born outside of Switzerland.

1451	Insurance	Chiropracter	blueocean	701	1	Location: Basel	10.10.2010, 23:42	   My understanding is that chiropractor services are under the mandatory insurance, not the supplementary (same as Dr, hospital, etc). So in order to get any reimbursement you need to first use up the franchise.    other alternative services such as osteopath, acupuncture, massage, etc are covered in supplementary insurances.      Also, each insurance company covers different things in their supplementary so it is not possible to say which on you need as it depends on which company you go with.   All insurance companies will provide the same coverage with the mandatory insurance.

1452	Insurance	Health insurance for new arrival but staying here less that a year	jimboyuk	759	0	Location: Zurich	08.10.2010, 21:53	" 
			
			Hi all,   
I would appreciate if someone is able to answer the following 2 questions for me.   
Does anyone know what the procedure for a new arrival applying for insurance for the first time. I have been on a price comparision website and the policy quote I was given was for insurance start at the new year, even though I stated that I was  a new arrival. How do I get insurance for the remaining current year?   
Secondly, what happens if I intend to leave in about march? From what I can see most insurance companes have 6month or 1 year contracts and require 3 months notice. Does that mean I am going to have to end up paying about 6 months worth of policy for only 3 months worth of cover?   
All answers will be much appreciated.   
Jim

1457	Insurance	Theft from unlocked car - insurance claim	gooner	7142	23	Location: ch	26.11.2007, 11:26	" 
			
			[quote=gooner;136620]My car was left unlocked in my basement garage (locked and not public) and my navigation device was left in the car.   
As you can imagine, the device was stolen.    
I had a similar experience with loss of skis from an unlocked locker in a locked ski room and I claimed on my ski insurance policy. At first it was rejected because it was claimed I had left the skis in a public place but when I showed them the receipt for storage, which indicated I paid for the privelege, they paid up and did not alter the next year's premium. I suspect your Insurer will pay up, perhaps under a bit of pressure, because your garage was locked and it is not a public garage. Good Luck.

			My husband, daughter, and I arrived here in August 2009 and signed up for basic and supplementary health insurance. We have B permits. My daughter graduated from high school this past June and has just started university in the US. She will probably not be spending much time in Switzerland while she is in school, and I'm trying to figure out what our options are relative to her health insurance. I would like her to maintain her Swiss residency if possible in case she does want/need to return here for a longer period of time, but I'd rather not pay for expensive health insurance that she will almost never be able to use.    
I found lots of information on EF about insurance exemptions for students going to school here, but what about students attending school out of Switzerland?

1464	Insurance	Car insurance before receiving permit?	Eiger	774	3	Location: Zurich	16.09.2010, 23:47	"    I called Zurich Connect, they don't check whether you have a B permit - but you have to complete the form stating that you have one, otherwise you can't get cover.    
Whether this means you are in fact covered if you are still waiting for the permit is not clear, but I suspect not. Given that insurance is about worst-case (hitting that Ferrari), and that insurance companies will seek to minimise their payouts (e.g. seeking ways to invalidate your insurance), I feel a bit edgy about such an approach.    
Maybe its a case of not worrying too much and just going ahead...

1466	Insurance	SwissCare	SwissArt	5104	4	Location: Zurich	14.09.2010, 18:10	"    Added an initial, optional step in bold above...   
Our experience was similar when signing my wife up (she's a researcher.)  Keep in mind we're in Canton Vaud.   
A. Signed up via the SwissCare website (can't remember how we proved her status.)   
B. She eventually received an email from SwissCare confirming the application.   
C. She eventually received a lot of papers from SwissCare by regular post, one of which was a form she had to sign confirming that the insurance met Swiss standards (SwissCare is based in Paris, I believe.) She signed, we mailed it back to SwissCare (at their instruction), they in turn sent it to the government.   
D. Independently, the government eventually sent a letter saying ""Send us proof of basic health insurance within 30 days of this letter or else.""  Had nothing to do with SwissCare... the government monitors this stuff.   
E. A couple of weeks later, my wife received her SwissCare coverage card by mail.  I scanned it, printed a copy and posted it to the Canton government in the envelope they provided.  Then stuck the insurance card in my wife's wallet.   
Can't comment on the quality, haven't had to use it yet (knocks on wood.)   
Caveat: people warned us that with SwissCare, you must pay charges yourself then mail the receipts to SC offices for *eventual* reimbursement. I *think* this applies to all but birth costs.  One individual complained that his reimbursement took months.  My thinking is that the monthly savings with SwissCare (>50% less per month than comparable) are much greater than any interest you could earn on cash sitting in the bank.  Still trumps the interest you would pay if you have to float it on a credit card till you're reimbursed. YMMV.   
Hope that helps.

Telandy - although the amount is insignificant, it will add up and it´s more the principle of the thing - I thought it was very clear in the law what is reimbursed and what is not, but I don´t know where to find this detailed law information. Hopefully the ombudsman can help. For me to go across town to give a blood sample, just so it can be analysed in the same lab it´s taken it makes no sense, when it can be done quickly in the doctor´s office.

			Yet another update.  The problem is still not sorted, though I've been promised new in-country documents this week.  I had to contact someone in Zurich to get this organized; Italsure didn't handle it for me.  This included giving Zurich information about me and my car which Italsure already has.   
To add insult to injury, one month ago they hit my charge card for another 435Sfr even though I've paid for the entire annual policy already.  I need to go home and look over my documents to see if there should have been a credit as well (since they canceled and then re-issued the out-of-country portion of the policy).   
I never knew that simple auto insurance could get so FUBAR'd.

the Canton, Community, and the person behind the desk.   
A second note, I had foreign insurance and had a ski accident which

I say that because it is funny how things don't seem to be recorded when there is a problem and there will not be a problem until your brother has an accident.

			Generally speaking all households in canton VD have to be covered by ECA for fire and natural disasters.   
I believe it comes down to whether the room is a separate household or not.  Presumably you have exclusive rights to that space and are not a family member, as such ECA is treating it as a separate household.  Also, consider if there was a fire, the family makes a claim for their contents, but does not consider you part of the family, thus your items are exempt.  Probably best to clarify these fine details with them though directly. (there may be also some exemptions if having coverage under existing swiss insurance for these elements coming from another canton)      "	Posts: 4	Join Date: Jun 2007	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Welcome to the forum.   
I am pleased to read that you are in the Lausanne because the CHUV is one of the best in the country in regards to cardio-thoracic surgery. Your little one is in very good hands.   
Surprisingly you might find that your cardio-pediatrician can help you in regards to your question. They are used to filling out forms for their little patients and do know quite a bit about insurance and how to help the parents.   
Naturelover..... it won't be 2 months.... it will be minimum 4 to 6 months    
Maybe your employer can hold on to your position for a while so that you can take leave of absence ?   
There's a parent infrastructure here to help you (in French) though not on EF 
It's been years, but I still have the info. 
If you wish, I will help you. Send me a PM

1494	Insurance	Unfallversichrung (accident insurance), who has to pay for this?	Angelina.zhang	1846	10	Location: ZUG	31.05.2010, 16:56	"    I believe it is lawful and I also believe that you are in a collective insurance scheme which basically means that your employer will be charged based on the AHV salary declared at the end of the last year. As he can be audited on what the AHV amount is and as the insurance companies get a copy of the audit then it is most unlikely that he will accept your unilateral rejection of the policy for which he will have to pay anyway.

1495	Insurance	Retrospective Charges	T Sparks	1655	9	Location: Zurich	28.07.2010, 00:07	"    I don't claim to be an insurance attorney, but I did take courses in 2 different universities on US and European insurance law. One of the basics of insurance is this: you cannot be paid twice for the same cover. (Slight simplification because there are stated value policies, and there are also situations where two parties each with an insurable interest get paid in full by their own insurer. But this is not relevant to health insurance.) One policy may be primary and the other secondary; a travel insurance policy for example will be secondary to any valid and collectible health insurance you may have. Ditto for, say, ""free"" credit card (Amex, for example) cover.   
But if you have two policies that are intended to be primary -- and that would include, say, a Swiss medical payments policy and a US policy such as one written under FEHBA (Federal Employees' Health Benefits Act) -- you will be asked to state, when claiming benefits, whether you have any other coverage. This might be workers' compensation, Medicare, a foreign or domestic policy in your name or that of your spouse or parent, and so on.   
If and only if there is double coverage, the two insurers work out between them (or decide independently in the absence of cooperation) how much each will pay. The general rule (that's legal theory, and it can be displaced by statute or company policy; or by an insured lying on his claim form and just perhaps getting away with the fraud) is that each deals with a proportion (presumptively half) of the loss -- within the terms and limits of the coverage underwritten.   
So if my annual out-of-pocket (""franchise"") is $300 with one policy and CHF 400 with the other, I won't get any payment from either insurer until that insurer's out-of-pocket amount has been met. Then there is the co-payment amount. If it's 10% on one policy and 20% on the other, I am obviously worse off than if the 10% policy underwriter were paying everything. Plus, I (and my ex-employer if the insurance is a retirement benefit) have been paying double premiums without any perceptible benefit for that double payment.   
Some kinds of insurance aren't health insurance at all: ""cancer insurance"" is more like life cover (and Americans including AIG were big and profitable operator in that sector.   -- it is popular in Japan where there is an extraordinary fear of casncer (I am told), and shame as well so not all eligible policyholders and surviving families ever claim). Some hospital cover, especially that sold in the UK is also independent of any actual cost outlay.    
Hope that helps. Read your policy, and also the law behind it. ""New-for-old"" and ""stated value"" cover are anomalies and (except for the cancer and hospital niche policies I just mentioned) I can't think of anything comparable in the health insurance field, where as in any casualty and non-life indemnity cover you are not supposed to get back more than you lost and you can't collect in full from two different policies even if you paid full premiums for both. (Distinguishing, of course, where an owner and a lessee of a building each have fire insurance on that building, and each collects in full when it burns down as each as an insurable interest in it.)   
For the rest: the exemption I wrote about has limited scope and is not connected with present immigration status but prior employment with an eligible international employer. I would not try to address the issue of retroactive cover except to say that it is open to fraud since obviously if one contracts or discovers a loathesome or chronic or expensive disease one will obviously opt for the best retroactive cover available.

1497	Insurance	Is Semi-Private Hospitalization Necessary?  For Pregnancy?	foliorose	5278	47	Location: Zürich Seefeld	15.07.2010, 22:50	"    Whilst I was very happy with the care I received, my understanding is that generally the more insurance you have, the more senior the doctor you get. Doesn't always apply (usually with birth you choose your doctor and go wherever they deliver).   
Also, other people mentioned that you can sometimes upgrade your room at the time - some hospitals allow it and some don't. For example I had my first child at Triemili in Zurich and there I could have upgrade to a semi private or private room if I wanted, but I didn't as I was fine in the shared room. But I had my twins at Unispital and there I could only upgrade if I paid for the entire birth (I think they said it was around CHF15,000?? not sure on that). Clearly, wasn't going to do that, so I stayed put in a crowded room hating being there.

			Thanks for all the reassuring replies.  
I was really confused by some things I had seen while looking around the forum.   
My meds are on all on the spezialitätenliste so everything checks out there.  
And why the heck not?  
A large number of them are Novartis and Roche so perhaps produced in Basel directly. Go Swiss meds       I am currently covered in France by the national social security system like everyone else is.  
Add to that some premium private insurance package that costs little more than pocket change every month but I have almost never needed premium coverage. 
Regular social security in France = 100% reimbursement for pre-existing long term afflictions 
Regular prescribed medication that is allowed to be reimbursed can get reimbursed up to 80% or 90% (I forget).

1499	Insurance	should I get a USA Indemnity Insurance	braxton_ct	891	4	Location: zurich	14.07.2010, 22:04	" 
			
			The classic sort of health insurance that pays 80%, customer pays 20% after deductible, frequently no payment for preventative measures is called an indemnity plan. The classic Blue Cross model, for example, is indemnity.    
To be honest, if the cost of insurance here isn't much different, you're better off with Swiss insurance because the reimbursement scheme is going to be a nightmare. I'd find out how the US policy pays out claims - are you going to have to foot the bill and be reimbursed - how do they manage currency exchange, and how will they interpret bills and statements in a foreign language. The administrative nightmare that you will likely encounter might well be worth a few extra CHF to have a Swiss plan.

			You have 3 monthsfrom entry to get insurance(you have 10 days to get registered in your commune). untill then you may stay on your own insurance. If you do not have prove of Swiss insurance after the 3 months (they will continue to send letters asking for proof) then they will appoint you one and back date it....   
Thats how it went for me so this is personal experiance   
However I know of several people who stayed on there UK insurance for years and got away with it.

Eat pastas and rices. eat a healthy balance of fats (of which there's probably enough in any meat you eat plus vege oils for salads and cooking. Save yourself and the insurance company the bills in the first place   . My little girl turned out fine like that    
Avoid alcohol    
LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. If, for example, tomatoes make you wanna hurl, don't eat them.   
I ate a bit of cheese and raw fish that I ""shouldn't"" have eaten and we were both fine. I think as long as the produce is fresh, it's no problem. I even had the occasional mouthful of red wine with dinner  . Though I heard of other women drinking half a bottle of wine before the birth to relax!    
I hope it works out with your insurance claims. Sorry I can't be more help in that respect. I would read your policy in great detail and find any clause that might suggest such costs are covered. Don't trust what they say on the phone; these things can be denied in future if it suits them  .

			You have wasted 40 bucks, this insurance covers only costs for occasional but not repeatly driving the same borowed car or a car from the same owner, it would be less than 10 times a year. Mobility cars are covered anyway by their insurance.  
I doubt you can get any additional insurance to cover excess and further covarage like passenger in a car which is not regitered on your name. Read the terms of contract from mobility and their insurance terms.   
You are saying you would use mobility cars to practice driving, make sure that is alowed by mobility and the set of regulations regarding to your actual driving license while beeing a permanent resident.

In other cases like mine, they gave me a complementary insurance that applies for all my body except for my back, since I had an operation in my back 10 years ago. They wrote a special line in my contract specifically saying that any back problems were not included in the (complementary) insurance. I had no choice but to accept it, since in another place (ÖKK at the time) they had refused to give me a complementary insurance at all. Nevertheless I had to pay the full cost of the complementary insurance  . By the way the contract with ASSURA for the complementary is for 5 YEARS, with a notice of 6 MONTHS for quitting (most companies have 3 months).

Nah, of course I wouldn't be happy paying for someone else's mishap, but we just paid 100 CHF each for an alleged ""New Battery"" for the electric!  Some battery hey?   
But at <35 CHF per appartment for the door, I wouldn't have a problem paying that, we just got a brand new door.  See what I mean?   
Now, what happens if someone breaks a collective door which is 10 years old and the excess is 10000 CHF according to the Insurance Company? 
Should the individual involved have to pay all that to subsidise a brand new door for everyone else?   
1 year old, 4 years old, 10 years old - what's the difference?   
I'll dig up the e-mails from the Insurance company and double-check their wordage.

			Pamela, you have 3 months after your registration at the gemeinde to register to a local insurance. 
Although I had readabout that backdating to arrival date, I registered to CSS almost 3 months after my arrival, and they did not charge me the 2 first months.   
So if I were you, during your first 3 months job search in Basel, I would just stay on my travel insurance

1523	Insurance	Chicken or egg?	maximum	1011	6	Location: Richterswil, ZH	10.06.2010, 14:01	"    Assuming you're an EU national (coming from Amsterdam), then you don't need any visas to enter the country.  And travel insurance doesn't work once you're resident (which is pretty much immediately, as you must register at your town's admin place within 8 days of arrival).   
It's all fine, though, this is all sorted out in the first few months and backdated to your arrival.  If you do need any medical help in those months, just keep the bills and submit them to your insurer for reimbursement later.

Tourists and temporary visitors ought to have accident and catastrophic health and repatriation insurance, including EU/EEA visitors. But if they don't, a EHIC will cover basic emergency needs for the latter (as others have said).

1525	Insurance	help! choosing health insurance / pregnancy	stephinzug	6942	11	Location: zug	10.01.2010, 06:56	" 
			
			Have been following this thread and wondered if anyone can help with a slightly different enquiry.......I am 5 months pregnant and moving from Basel Stadt to Basel Land, we found out that our insurance company states that for the maternity coverage we have to give birth in the hopital where you reside.     
I have nothing against the Brudeholtz hostiptal, but would much prefer to give birth in University Hospital in Basel as the reports there regarding the environment and birthing experience is much better for an English speaking only person.  I am now thinking of taking out a second health insurance, but so far the ones I have looked at on comparis.ch are also saying 'in hospital of residence'.     
Does anyone know of any insurance companies where you can join, and have the option immediately to choose the hospital you want?   
Any feedback of help would be great   
Thanks

This is basically bollocks.  The insurance policy gets stamped in the owner registration document so you must possess an in-force policy on registering.  If you have the policy and it has a start date then you are most certainly covered for going for the MFK and the registration office.  I think you probably just spoke to the wrong person.

         Legal  protection insurance preserves policyholders' interests where coverage  is applicable and covers costs for legal representation, court  proceedings, expert reports, compensation to the opposing party and  loans for bail.  
 Many legal cases are not eligible for insurance protection either in  whole or in part. Conflicts pertaining to employment laws are frequently  exempt. Family legal conflicts (marriage, mainenance payments, divorce  proceedings), inheritance conflicts, building processes, tax and most  cases of criminal law are either not covered at all or limited to legal  counselling.

Thanks for the detailed reply. I contacted Sanagate and they agree to change to the Standard model.

I finally found one (not the cheapest one by far) that was willing to fudge the dates a little so I didn't have to backpay all those premiums.

			I have read most of the reply and I have to say that after living in 6 EU countries the worse one for car insurance is UK indeed.   
- most ""continental"" insurance companies cover you with a 365 days ""Green Card"". UK only 14 days   
- only in UK you have to call the insurance company asking (?) them the permission to bring your ""own"" car abroad.   
- only in UK you need a ""MOT certificate"" to pay both the insurance and road tax   
- only in UK your ""own"" insurance pays you if a third party damages your car

1537	Insurance	accident insurance - is there a franchise for this?	juice99	3579	25	Location: Zurich	26.01.2010, 14:27	" 
			
			Hi,   
I don't know in general but I also took out insurance with Mutuel. The franchise is something you choose (I chose CHF 500) and in my case there was no difference between accident or illness.   
It always makes sense to send in every bill (all you need to do is post them the bill with the policy number) because as soon as you reach the level of the franchise they start to pay out the cost (less the 10% contribution).   
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. I didn't bother trying to work out the difference on the premium between high and low franchise - it certainly doesn't take much to run up CHF 500 in medical bills and medicines - and with a monthly premium of about CHF 400 each it's best to claim for everything - there's no no claims bonus here.

			it's not actually an 'or'. It's like we both said, but we just put it differently.  
As I read it, the parish will need to have written, signed, stamped proof of Insurance. And there's probably a form to fill in for their records. Otherwise after three months the poster will likely get a bill for Insurance in Switzerland which the poster didn't ask, didn't want and didn't need. I'm sure this has happened to someone on here before.   
But as Blonaybear said early on this Thread - contact Jenny and you'll be  sure you've got it right. (And please come back on here and tell us to help future readers)

1539	Insurance	Accident insurance chickening out	marvinwb	2308	14	Location: Lausanne	15.04.2010, 15:32	"    The above exposition appears quite knowledgeable, and I know nothing about Swiss insurance law. I studied EEC (as it then was) insurance law and US insurance law at universities. A quick Googling suggests that your answer may be incomplete in one respect, perhaps not germane here:    
""Les maladies professionnelles reconnues en Suisse sont, à de rares exceptions près, celles qui figurent dans la liste des   de l'Ordonnance sur l'assurance-accidents; ...""    
If this were my case I would want to see what those listed industrial illnesses are:   A quick look suggests that this concerns mainly   such as   (asbestos) and  . But the Ordinance is worth reading and, if there is doubt and considerable money involved, consulting an expert would be sensible.   
If the employee has been seconded from an affiliated firm in another country, that other country's law may also apply. I once instituted simultaneous complaints before the labour commissions of the UK and of New York State on behalf of an aggrieved seconded worker and the firm increased its redundancy settlement offer dramatically.   
I had a long, drawn-out (3 years') litigation with AXA France over a hotel accident where I filed suit against their insured in Florida and against AXA in the Tribunal d'Instance du 9e Arr. in Paris. I was about to file a further suit in London on the eve of the statute of limitations expiring when they settled. My medical consultant was the leading British surgeon, theirs was a tired, typically uninterested and inexpert insurance doctor in an unkempt third-floor surgery in out-of-the-way Paris. (The Paris suit was because they failed to pay the British surgeon his £650 and stopped responding to correspondence. They admitted liability before the judge and even then didn't pay the judgment until I sent notice that I was going to register the French judgment at the Royal Courts of Justice and attach their 2% shareholding in Legal & General.)   
So much for insurance companies.   
I am not giving advice here, just providing library references and sharing my disdain for insurers. In my experience the best chances for a quick and reasonable outcome are where both insurance policies in question are with the same insurer. Probably not possible where health insurance is involved.

1541	Insurance	Annual health Care Bill for someone in general good health	guest	1778	12	null	null	" 
			
			1000 chfs is huge, I think, for an average 'well' person.  Last year, I spent about 100-150 chfs, which was mostly asthma inhalers and the annual flu jab.  An average doctor visit is 50-100 chfs, depending on time spent discussing how sick you are (my pre-driving licence check-up took about 30-40 mins and cost about 100chfs).   
I pay about 180chfs for basic with Assura (2000chfs franchise), and 38chfs for supplementary to cover off all the things that Castro lists above.  I'm 39 and live in Vaud, so these figures can perhaps be reduced for younger people living in other cantons.

1546	Insurance	Storm damage & insurance claims	Tinks	1006	0	Location: Vevey	12.04.2010, 23:46	" 
			
			Back at the end of February, we got hit by the tail end of the storm that swept France (Xynthia?) That weekend we had a friend staying with us, and during the night the winds lifted up our daughter's wooden play house and jammed it between his hire car and our own car, causing various scratches and dents in the two cars.   
We took our car to our local garage and they dealt with the insurance people to get it all fixed. They said that in cases of extreme weather, there was some kind of rule which meant you didn't have to pay the excess. (I didn't entirely understand this as my French isn't great, but we've not had to pay anything yet!)   
My friend took his car back to the ariport and they didn't deduct any excess at the time. He's just opened his latest credit card statement to find the company involved has now taken the full 1500SF excess!!   
I've tried to find if there's any way we can claim for this on our house or accident insurance, but it doesn't seem to cover damage to third parties. Does any one have any ideas whether this is standard? And can anyone help me verify if the waiving of excess due to unusual weather is true?    
Insurance is confusing enough but in another language I'm really struggling!

1547	Insurance	Mental Health Coverage	A2Z	2139	8	Location: Zurich	12.04.2010, 16:42	"    Swiss health insurances indeed cover also for psychologists! I would first get a referral from your GP if you feel that you need counseling. Usually, every insurance has a list of therapists you can choose from.   
If your psychologist recognises the need of counseling (e. g. depression etc.) the basic insurance will cover the costs. BUT if you want to see a psychologist only for a 'identification process' you have to pay it on your own.   
Best is to check directly with your insurance - I'm sure they'll be glad to give you detailed information.   
Good luck!

What I do is to write a letter (I write mine in English) to the insurance company.  Stating what each receipt is, writing an amount owed (minus the 10% which the insurance company keeps).  The insurance company wants the ORIGINAL receipt and the doctors prescription (make yourself some copies of this to keep just in case BUT the insurance company should send this back to you!).   However,  you will have to call and ask if someone speaks english so you can get the correct address to mail the letter. 
The receipts from 2009 should be paid IF you are still with the same insurance company.

1559	Insurance	Life Insurance - Swiss pricing a ripoff?	skyblue	2094	4	Location: Lausanne	06.03.2010, 10:48	" 
			
			OK, this is where I ended up. 
Swiss pricing is a ripoff :-) I'm not totally sure if it is ""personal"", or whether native swiss people get the same outrageous rates. Some sites I found suggest that expats in many countries are charged more for life insurance, but that might be because:   
most sites/companies offering ""international"" (life) insurance, or even catering specifically and ""exclusively"" for brits abroad in Europe / Suisse appear to charge nearly as much as the local swiss companies I tried. Well, why try harder, I guess? Some companies attempted to explain this huge discrepancy, but werent very convincing ;-)   
Eventually, I had a breakthrough - calling Legal and General DIRECTLY, not through an agent, they said they would offer me more or less UK rates, on the following conditions: 
1) I am a UK national 
2) I have a UK ""family"" address. My parents were OK 
3) the premiums are paid from UK bank account by direct debit 
4) At the time of taking out the policy, I intend to return to being a UK resident at some point in the future. There didnt seem to be any specific timescale they required, so I said something that seemed reasonable to me given schooling etc.

			My husband was at fault and not insured properly.  Luckily his work has great accident insurance so his medical is being taken care of.  However, we will be responsible for the other two cars and their repairs.  There will also be the criminal fines etc.  We are at our ropes end, only hanging on by the grace of God.

			Hey folks,   
So, I guess the simplest way to phrase this question would be - do you need to be registered in Switzerland to get personal liability insurance?   
I have dual Swiss-Canadian citizenship, but am here for a few months on my Canadian passport, and am looking to rent a short-term apartment.  It's my first time doing any of this!  What should I be particularly aware of?

1567	Insurance	Old-age & survivors insurance AHV	Flower	3978	20	Location: Zurich	17.02.2010, 13:38	"    This is because people retiring at present are still doing so under the old rules, where by they get partial pensions from different EU countries where they have made contributions e.g. Ittigen who replied to your query.   
There is no indication on the descriptions given on the websites as to when and how the new rules are being applied and more importantly how voluntary contributions will be handled... for instance if you make a voluntary contribution to the UK or Ireland during a period when you are also contributing to one of the other countries will it in fact count for anything?   
That is why I'm interested in hearing about someone who has received a pension under the new rules...   
Good luck with that,   
Jim.

I will have an MRI (magnet resonance scan) and an OP (on my hand) soon (at UniSpital ZH). I have a German health insurance that is also valid in Switzerland. I would like to check if UniSpital ZH is offering me a standard or inflated cost for those..    
Do you know any website that gives some indicative numbers as a reference for the costs of MRI, OP (hand) in Switzerland?   
Cheers,

1574	Insurance	Bringing a UK car to Switzerland	missmcp	3064	21	Location: London	17.02.2010, 16:12	   Hi all,     Thanks for your prompt responses and some great info.  I agree that Swiss public transport is fantastic.  When my hubby was out in Zurich last week it was something like -5 and snowing yet the trains were running, warm and on time, not like here when we have a centimetre  of snow and everything stops.  Last time he was in Switzerland he used the train unfortunately though his new place of work is in the middle of nowhere so he will need a car.  Thanks for the heads up on the ticket machines, barriers etc, I'd never thought of that although I did have a chuckle imagining him stuck somewhere trying to lean across the car to reach a ticket!      Will definitely look into some of the suggested info here.  I guess that means for the first couple of weeks he should be fine but he will need to get organised pretty sharpish.     Thanks so much for your help   	Posts: 6	Join Date: Feb 2010	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Normaly yes, but some insurance companies do exclude some items which are glass. e.g. Windows. ceramic. glas stove. You have to buy an extra option to cover this. Perhaps there is an higher excess on glass.   
I realy reccommend, when you get an insurance, read the conditions  before you sign a contract. Some companies offer cheap premium but also with a limited coverage.   
It is a smart thing to get an insurance for your haushold items in which you can cover expensive equipment (if you need one for it) combined with haftpflicht because you will recive a discount.

1576	Insurance	Insurance with Sanagate	Dietiker	3153	0	Location: Binningen	03.02.2010, 15:11	" 
			
			Hi all   
As every year, I made a search on Comparis in the last quarter of 2009 and found a Insurance called Sanagate which was cheapest in 2010 for Dietikon where I live. I made a check and seeing thats its CSS which is behind and therefore I signed up for it. They also promised that an Insurance Card will be provided in Jan '10.    
The situation now is that I have received an Insurance Card and yesterday it did not work at a Pharmacy. The Pharmacy told me that I have to pay the bills and then claim to Sanagate. I checked the website of Sanagate and realized that all bills have to be paid by me and only send to them when the total amount is exceeding the franchise.    
Can someone (Jenny ?) who has also signed up for Sanagate confirm if I have to pay all the bills at hospitals, pharmacy and doctors myself and then later claim to Sanagate ? If yes, what is the Insurance Card for ? Esp for Hospitals it is quite risky if the amount is very high which might be difficult for me to pay myself. Just taking a worst case scenario if someone has to be in hospital a month.    
I guess I will be careful to switch Insurance companies from 2011.    
Regards

			On the Telmed model, do they provide health advice and what are the costs for the call?   
I'm wondering if in some cases a call to Telmed would end up cheaper than visiting a GP if the GP just ends up doing a referral anyway.   
(Concrete example - sprained ankle, just need a physio referral - would Telmed just refer me without adding the additional fee that a GP would?)

I have cartilage damage, and the surgeon said he could put my leg in a splint so I could still walk on it, but I couldn't bend it. Perhaps this is a possibility.   
As for help with showering, couldn't your husband help you with this in the evening? You could also enroll your kids in daycare for the months you are recovering. I had my son in a krippe part-time and when I was admitted to hospital they took him full time. Many are open long hours, and my husband could still work a normal day with a commute.

			Did not find any information on this in the threads. Please reply if you have first hand experience.  
My wife is an independent worker (selbsständig), and currently expecting. I spoke with AHV and they told me the following: She will receive the 14 weeks of maternity insurance equivalent to lost earnings. This will be calculated on the ""expected earnings"" declared by us in a year (This is the first year that she is working as an indpendent). The AHV lady told me something that confused me: She said, if the actual earnings for the year are higher, she will be paid more money retroactively later. However, if the actual earnings are lower, she does not have to give money back to AHV already received after birth!    
Can somebody confirm this? Doesnt this motivate people to declare higher expected earnings just before the due date?

1600	Insurance	UN Insurance scheme on B permit?	Alobar	3261	5	Location: Gland	23.11.2009, 12:58	" 
			
			Runningdear is right -- it depends on the type of carte de légitimation or, to be more specific, on the type of contract your wife has. It does not matter if it is a professional (P) or general service (G) post. What matters is whether this is a fixed-term or short-term appointment. Family coverage is generally not possible for short-term staff.    
By the way, permit-wise, depending on your wife's status, you may be entitled to is permit Ci, which is reserved for spouses of international civil servants and gives you the same status as a regular C-permit except that it is valid only as long as your wife works for the UN.    
It does not matter what type of permit your children have, once they are recognised as your wife's dependants by the UN she will be able to insure them through UNSMIS (UN medical insurance scheme). You can also profit from this scheme in two ways: as your wife's dependent (this probably does not apply because you have a job) or at a preferential rate for spouses (if you work and your salary exceeed certain threshold). In the latter case your wife will be able to buy a policy for you which is the same as for the rest of the family only costs more -- 350 CHF per month.    
Now to the Swiss insurance -- once you buy an insurance policy in Switzerland the company may not allow you to cancel it automatically without transferring to another LAMAL-recognised insurance company, unless of course you are leaving the country. You will therefore probably have to get an attestation from Service de l'assurance-maladie of the Geneva Canton that you are exempt of this obligation which you will forward to your insurer.    
Naturally, you should not believe everything people tell you on the forum    
If I were you, I would undertake the following steps:    
1. Your wife should call her HR assistant or UNSMIS helpdesk and ask about procedure for adherence to the UN medical insurance scheme for the whole family;   
2. You should call your insurer and ask about procedure for cancelling existing policy and switching to UNSMIS. Call Service de l'assurance-maladie in case your insurance agent does not know, they will know what to do. You will probably not even have to go there, if you fax them a copy of your wife's carte de légitimation they will respond by fax or email.

			My concern is not whether I'll avoid paying for it or not, but rather the opposite. 
I really need it now (after Christmas actually), and the reason why I stopped my contract with Helsana and decided to go for Assura was the fact that I want to take the 300 francs deductible and also add some extra coverage for hospitalization. 
Only last Friday I realised that I might have an issue because of the fact that I don't have a valid permit at the moment and I don't expect to receive by year end...

			It's the accident coverage that matters. If accidents are covered, I'd still not brag in front of them about having been drunk, but dental accidents are accidents just as any other accidents.    
Even ""masticatory accidents"" are covered, e.g. if you bite on a screw in a sausage and crack your tooth. However, if it can be proved that the damaged tooth was totally carious already before you put that screw in the sausage  , you might be in troubles. But that's not the topic right now.    
Dental coverage in health insurance is a different matter; that means that repair of carious cavities, gingival inflammations and the like is covered, usually pretty expensive and normally not worth the money since more than 99 % of all cavities and gum problems can easily be avoided by careful oral hygiene and good nutrition.  But again, that's not the topic brought up by the OP.

			The premium does not depend on the resale value. An absurd anomaly, but that's how it is. Hence, many car owners stop the optional comprehensive insurance when the car is older.

I'm with Zurich Connect.   if you want their phone number. 
Questions are for free and you certainly will know more...   
You don't ""have"" to take an insurance from them, unless they give you a good offer, of course.

1611	Insurance	Private & Semiprivate Health Insurance? Worth it? (especially for children)	Venturello	4144	14	Location: Hünenberg, Zug	12.11.2009, 22:57	" 
			
			In the end, after thinking through the weekend, we went for semi-private for all of us. We are in our mid-30's and who knows what can happen... it's peanuts to be honest, and the extra 120 CHF for both of us when we are saving already 100 CHF by changing insurers.. so net 20 CHF increase with additional coverage - makes less of a point.   
Hope this also makes it easier for them to accept Esteban, our 5 year old, who has a mild case of ADHD. We'll see.   
Again thanks the forum for help!

			I don't think anyone will give you insurance without a check-up first, it would be a bit like the in insurance company signing a blank cheque. If indeed you did manage to find a company willing to do it, i think the policy would be so full of exceptions and caveats avoiding payout that it would be as good as useless anyway.

			Is there anybody out there who could shed some light on the g-permit, cross-border health insurance? We live in France but my husband works in Basel and the kids go to an international school there. I am not employed. We are EU nationals. We chose to take on Swiss insurance as a French private insurance company rejected us (husband's 'high-risk' blood-pressure condition). The only other option was to have just the French Social Security but that would not cover the kids and the husband while they were in Switzerland.    
We are now with Sanitas on their EU basic insurance. They are now not only increasing their rates but also informed us that the for the past year they have mistakenly charged us too little anyway so a major hike is coming up from January on. I want to see now if there is any other company that would be more reasonable. I would love to hear from other g-permit people how they have arranged their insurance.    
Kind regards, 
Anne

As far as the marriage stuff is concerned I don't see why there is a problem. We are both EU, and my wife registered 18 months before me (I was travelling back and forth to France) first but forgot our marriage certificate. What the gemiende did was tax her a single until I brought the certificate from France on my next trip. The certificate is Thai, so we had an English translation which was acceptable, then they automatically adjusted her tax and back dated it to when she first registered.... dead easy.

they gave her cover based on information supplied, that information was incorrect \ missing vital parts, had all the information been supplied then they would have viewed it as a much higher risk, with a higher premium or refused cover. Ignorance is no defence. don't forget insurance companies employe whole department of people to look at ways of refusing payment

			Thanks everyone. I will clarify with the local authority on arrival and see what could be done. I am a tax advisor myself. I don't know the system in Switzerland, but in the UK, immigration rules and tax rules are separate. Just because you have a permit doesn't mean that you will automatically be taxed under the UK system. Generally, you still need to have spent enough time in the UK to be considered a resident before you get taxed unless it's UK source income. So may be things are different in Switzerland.    
But I am just not sure whether the companies would consider his application if he does not already have a residence permit although he is entitled to one and will probably get one. You know, applying for jobs on the basis that you will get a residence permit in 2 or 3 months just don't seem very attractive to employers. And we can't really afford to have just one person working. Who knows how long it would take for him to get a job in Zurich, might be a year or even more.

			Its best if you always go to the same pharmacie as they will have a dossier for you and you can leave the prescription with them. It can be for more than a single drug, for example, Im currently having to take 5 different medications and my doctor gives a prescription for 6 months at a time. It dosent cost more and, in fact, it cheaper for your insurers than if you keep going back to the doctor.     Another advantage of always using the same pharmacie is that its all on their computer and if you were prescribted two different drugs, by different doctors, which were not compatible, this would come up as a warning on the pharmacie computer.

			Hi,   
If you look at your insurance bill (rechnung) it will tell you exactly how much bonus you get.   
Eg. your bill will be something like this :   
Haftpflicht          Jahres-Grundprämie  Stufe   %der         netto prämie 
                                                            Grund pramie    
                                 2071.20           0        30%             621.40   
Teilkasko                       248.40                                       248.40 
Stempelsteuer 5%                                                             43.40   
Unfallverhütungsbeitrag0.75% Auf Haftpflicht                           4.70 
Beitrag At.74 und 76 SVG                                                     4.20   
Saldo zu unseren Gunsten                                                 922.10     
So as you can see, the bonus is 70%.   
So whenever you see what percent is in the ground premium that is all you pay and the rest is your no claims bonus, so if you just take a copy of the bill with you and that should do the trick.

1642	Insurance	Terminating a 10 year insurance agreement ...	patrious45	1096	0	Location: lausanne	30.09.2009, 16:30	" 
			
			Hello,   
I want to share my (very small) victory with fellow members of EF!   
Shortly after I arrived, I wanted to take out 3rd party liability cover.  Accordingly a trip to the local insurance broker followed, resulting in me signing up there and then for what I thought was a 1 year deal - having had a long discussion with the insurance broker and stating specifically that I did not want to sign up for a multi-year deal as I believed it was anti-competitive.   
As the terms were good, I paid again for the 2nd year and only this year considered cancelling it if I could get better terms elsewhere.  My local insurance broker then pulled out their trump card, which was to show me a copy of the agreement I had signed.  To my anger (given my previous discussions with them) I saw that in the small print a period of 10 years had been specified, effectively sticking two fingers up to any thoughts I may have had about not cooperating with anti-competitive practices !   
Somewhat surprisingly given that its only a CHF150 policy, the broker refused to change the term (their loss, as I was not unhappy with the deal or service, just that they had locked me in for 10 years).  Accordingly not expecting any help, as I had after all signed the original policy, I then escalated this to the HQ of the insurance company concerned.      
After much discusssion, they have today agreed to terminate the policy if I wish on its anniversary next year    
So its not easy, but from this I deduce that if you make a big enough fuss and inparticular escalate these issues to the HQ of the insurance company they may get resolved - even if, like me - you have actually signed up to a multi-year policy.     
Ironically in this case, as the company concerned has been helpful in resolving this, I'll certainly be putting more business their way in the future - although probably not through their local broker ...   
Patrious

1650	Insurance	vehicle accident - strange process ?	guest	1534	3	null	null	" 
			
			A quick update.   
I contacted the 3rd party's insurers about the letter from the company who requested the bike handover.  They said they were kosher so I handed in the plates, cancelled the docs, and sent them everything.   
After about two weeks I got a nice letter from the 3rd party's insurers offering my valuation of the bike plus replacement (new) value of all my bike clothing and helmet plus an amount for the inconvenience suffered.   
Excellent  .   
It was actually quite straightforward in the end but I have still learned my lesson and will only do fully comp from now on  .

medicine and went to the pharmacy,the Pharmacy offer me to supply me my Medicine and told me if that will be alright i say yes,they keept the prescription from the Physician,gave me the Medicine,i didnt pay them a dime,and got about a month after a paper from the insurrance that they have pay them minus the 10 % copay,so i guess i will get a bill for the copay,i guess doctors are different,some expect you to pay and send you the bill that you pay and you wait to get the money back from Insurrance minus the copay,but you still have a month to pay the doctor,so you can bring the Wwite paper to the insurrance and wait to get the money to pay the doctor,before the due date ,and some other doctor directly do that with the insurrance.

1655	Insurance	Moving to Zug pregnant, need some advice	Quest	1965	1	Location: Zurich	23.08.2009, 02:13	   If you are pregnant when you arrive you will still be able to get basic health insurance to cover pregnancy related costs and the birth in a public hospital. The public hospital system is Switzerland is very good and I have heard positive things about birth experiences in public hospitals. One thing to be aware of is that you are less likely to have access to fluent English speakers in the public hospitals, and if this is your first child you may want to think about how comfortable you are with that if you do not speak German.      If you want private cover, ie so you can go to a private hospital (as either half or full private) you will generally need to have had your health insurance cover for more than 12 months before delivery. The private cover basically increases your hospital choice and allows you to have your doctor and a private or semi-private room, but all other pregnancy care should remain the same. I have heard that you can pay for a room up-grade if you go to a public hospital that has private rooms, but you would have to speak to your individual health insurer to find out more about this.      Another thing to be aware of is that it is not uncommon for people to apply for full or half private health insurance, but to be denied and forced to take basic cover only. I am unclear as to the circumstances in which this might happen, but something to be aware of.      I would recommend speaking to an English speaking broker to find out what your options are for the care you desire.      One last point, I recall someone saying that Zug is special in that there are no private hospitals and therefore you can get more with your basic cover or maybe the other way around??? I am not sure, but worth asking about.      Good luck!  	Posts: 30	Join Date: Nov 2006	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 0 Times in 0 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Yes, I do. Don't touch them with a bargepole.    
To cut a long and painful story short, they refused to honour the price on comparis for my health insurance, tried to force me to sign a more expensive policy and even went to the extent of committing fraud by hand writing a date on a policy and pretending that it was me who written it to try to force me to accept their policy.   
The legal logic is that when you send in the policy from the comparis site, you are making an offer. They then refuse to accept the offer you send in and send you a more expensive policy to sign, essentially asking you to make a new, more expensive offer. They also refuse to explicitly reject the original policy leaving you in a legal limbo in which they can accept the original policy at any time.

I am insured with TCS. I once got their help in defending a traffic offense. Main advantage of TCS is that they are not a classical insurer. So there is no conflict of interest when you are contesting another insurance. And TCS rates are among the lowest.    
I am also insured with TCS for travel insurance. The services were exceptionally good. They provided excellent support during the crisis. They organized local medical attention in a very distant and underdeveloped country. They paid for emergency repatriation. That single incident cost TCS more than 200 years of premiums.

1662	Insurance	UK National Insurance Contributions	Guy Lauterbrunnen	4920	12	Location: Lauterbrunnen	05.08.2009, 14:14	"    The current rate (09/10 tax year) is £12.05 per week:      
This very useful thread has given me a kick into looking into whether it's worth me paying voluntary Class 3 NICs. I rang a surprisingly informed person at the International Pension Centre, who told me which form to use to apply for a pension forecast; she did say that I have 8 years' Home Responsibilities Protection 'stamps' (for being at home with small children), so I reckon with working years I'll be around half way there to the 30 years' required for a full pension.   
I then put on my shiniest actuarial hat to work out how much the remaining 15 years' contributions might cost me, how much I'd have if I just saved that money compounded instead, how much additional pension it would buy me, etc. It's currently coming out that it's worth paying the voluntary NICs if I plan to live at least 3 years after retirement. (I've had to make some major guesses based on contribution rates and possible pension amounts, but it's ballpark enough.) So it's probably worth doing.   
On the other hand, I've got 28 years to go until retirement. And how annoying would it be to make voluntary contributions for 10 years, then move back to the UK and work/ pay NICs for 15 years anyway! So I guess I'll leave it for now, but review it every few years or so.   
Andy02, thanks for all the links, very helpful in doing the research.

SwissBob - thanks very much - this is exactly what I have been saying. 
In the UK, I would put 100% of the focus and responsibility on the owner of the building full stop.   
The complexities and lack of familiarity of the Swiss system as put so far, puts a lot of work on myself. (The thought of the language barriers in locating the council and police departments and actually getting to communicate the incident and attend etc - with no German at all - (I do want to learn) then claiming through my employer etc.. makes it tempting to let slip if you have a very demanding work life - which I do.    
I will investigate that line and it is good to hear an alternative viewpoint first-hand from a business owner about the public liabilities I feel so strongly about. Thanks SwissBob. And continued thanks to all for contributions from different viewpoints

			This policy is all good and well, but considering that a lot of us are moving around the world a few times, it would be great to have a good international health cover that would be excepted anywhere. Because, the older you get, the more expensive the cover will become each time you enter another country and have to sign up with another insurer.  
And they call it a globalized world... ha!!! You're havin a larff...

1674	Insurance	car insurance for uk-based car	peebix	2422	7	Location: Zürich	24.07.2009, 12:24	"    Sounds about right. From memory, my driving licence one took about 40 mins, and involved a long chat about my medical history and current lifestyle, blood pressure, listening to heart and lungs, checking skeletal alignment and so on. My 4 yr old had a similar one to start kindergarten! My medical cost around 120 chfs.   
If you need to change your licence too, you can combine the medicals to save costs - my husband did this with his driving one and another one to join the company pension scheme. All they do for the driving licence is stamp and sign the licence application form, so as long as they've actually done the medical, even if it's technically for something else, that's fine. I think his was a little longer because it also involved blood tests (to make sure he wasn't going to keel over dead before retirement and cost the company money).

1682	Insurance	Health Insurance - Cancelling	Cashboy	2982	15	Location: Ticino & London	08.07.2009, 12:48	"        Yes, I am sure about that.    
  You have to be insured, with an approved insurer, and if you give notice to cease your cover then your insurers have to receive confirmation from your new company that they are taking over. If this is not received then the existing insurer has to continue covering you and you have to pay their premium.   
  Just a further note to clarify something I wrote earlier regarding cancellation. To cancel by the end of June you have to give 3 months notice. To cancel by the end of December you also have to give 3 months notice   your insurer has announced an increase in premiums for the following year. In this case you can give one months notice.   
  To get back to the original post, you cannot be resident in Switzerland without having an approved health insurance. You may have, so far, enjoyed excellent health but 
  I also had a good health record with my only visits to the doctor being for the  occasional check-up then, two years ago, I suddenly developed a condition. Total cost to my health insurer is currently over CHF 100,000, so far, and likely to increase.     Illness or accidents can strike at any time no matter how healthy you have been so far.

			Your costs are driven by where you live, your age and your gender and the deductible that you choose (here it is called a franchise cost).    
The required insurance is quite good here, I think. I used to work for an academic hospital in the US, and had a fairly unrestricted indemnity program, but I've had better care here and less hassles with the insurance. Insurance does cost a bit more, however - especially since our employers paid in the US.  Defintley contact Jenny though, she can help you with specifics in your area, and explain all of this to you clearly.    
The confusing part for me was the difference between the required, basic insurance and the other, supplimental things. We've found the required insurance to be more than adequate.    
There are different models, but one thing I've found here is that most specialists require a letter from your family doctor, even if you choose that specialist yourself. In the US, this was often the case for busy specialities as well.    
I think it's key to find a good family doctor (hausärzt).

magyir thanks for the information. I think before I get in touch with 
anybody I would like to do the research and understand a little bit 
about the products on offer then meet someone in person.   
Because I have met some agents who were willing to speak in English 
but they were very Pushy and without understanding/or asking any questions wanted me to sign the contract and when I did not they give me the cold shoulder --> were not interested in answering any more questions.   
I was not aware regarding the 6000 CHF but a work mate  I spoke to 
mentioned that he was spending around 5000 Per Annum.   
Thanks

1688	Insurance	Travel insurance - recommendations?	lokami	1843	6	Location: zurich	01.07.2009, 16:06	"    Exists in French though. Good enough for me. That's what I will take.    
I am glad I could read it because the insurance policy has this insane string of exclusions (each is nested into the previous one). Essentially: 
I am covered for injuries abroad,  
EXCEPT if there is a war or it's a terrorist act 
EXCEPT if the injury is sustained following the highjacking of a plane, during the period of captivity that follows, while jumping in parachute if needed to save my life, while crashlanding if needed, while returning home after the crashlanding/jump or while continuing my voyage after that (up to a full year) 
EXCEPT if the war is between Switzerland and a neighbouring country or among some countries like the UK, the ex Soviet Union, the US, China or one of  those and a European country, and 48 hours have passed since the beginning of the war 
EXCEPT if the parachute jump/crash-landing has already taken place (then I have a full year also to make it home/to my destination).   
At least half of the premium has to go to the lawyers who drafted this. They must not sleep very well at night, frantically writing their nightmares into policies.

1689	Insurance	International Health Care Insurance?	Miss-Lizzy	1367	3	Location: Zurich	29.06.2009, 23:26	" 
			
			I currentlyt don't have a health insurance in Switzerland as I'm still in the UK.   
I'm not quite looking for travel insurance - with that you usually can't go to another country and just turn up at the GP or go to the dentist if it's not an emergency.   
And I'm considering the fact that I'll be moving around Europe still for the next 10-20 years and it will be harder and harder to get a good health insurance in every country the older you get. So, keeping an international one would kind of make sense in the long run. Otherwise, every time you go somewhere else you have to start a new health insurance and the older you are the more expensive it will be. Unless you stay with one insurer.... if that makes sense?

1691	Insurance	Cancellation acknowledged; insurer still tries to renew policy?	meloncollie	1773	5	Location: SZ	23.06.2009, 13:38	"    According to what we here (in the UK) are being continously told - this just CANNOT happen in Switzerland. Everyone is - apparently - sooo efficient and perfect  . 
Evidnently not - and that makes me think that maybe Swiss people have a bit of a human side too...   
As for cancellation, if you did what you did, just stop paying... Good luck.

1695	Insurance	Private Health Insurance not required if....	travnett	4748	38	Location: basel	23.06.2008, 20:41	"    That's fine by me if I have a condition that requires more then 30 days in hospital I would rather be in Ireland anyway! In which case I can revert to a normal VHI plan and be treated indefinatley at home.    
Since I have been with VHI since birth, then I have no problems regarding pre existing conditions, however if I gave up my VHI for more then X years (can't remember how many), then I would have no cover for 12 months on returning home to Ireland.    
Also as an inpatient I don't have to pay up front VHI will take the bill but they need to be informed as soon as possible on entry to hospital.    
I do need to pay outpatients bills myself and then be reimbursed by VHI for them. This is a relatively uncomplicated procedure which I have already gone through. Furthermore the VHI policy is cheaper then insurance here and gives me more benefits which I am happy to have then a local policy will give me, such as travel insurance etc.    
If you intend to stay here forever then fair enough take the local insurance, but for an Irish person staying here temporarily then it is a no brainer. You pointed to a link yourself yesterday that gave the exception which allows people to use the VHI.

			Many thanks for everyone's comments. I contacted Zurich, who referred it back to our broker. They emailed me to apologise, said Zurich had changed the terms and conditions recently, and that we would get a full refund for the Zurich Assist policy. In addition, they will also pay the costs of us being towed off the motorway and other additional costs (eg getting home etc).   
Very happy with this outcome - and all offered without me really complaining

			Yes, you can have it as part of your household effects insurance - make sure the amount covered for personal belongings taken outside the home, eg travel, is sufficient.   
You can also have insurance for professional photographers but there are pros and cons. Your insurance agent should be able to explain it.

1700	Insurance	Swisscare new : no deposit for Unispital Zurich and CHUV	youtubeman	2421	0	Location: Lausanne	05.06.2009, 00:23	" 
			
			Dear all,   
Lots of students, researchers and their families are insured by Swisscare Student insurance.   
I have very good news.    
In fact, for stationary treatment in Unispital Zurich or CHUV in Lausanne, a deposit was requested.        
Now I contacted the Unispital Zurich and they informed me that if you present your Swisscare student card you dont have to pay a deposit for an operation or for maternity and childbirth.   
If you have doubt, contact the billing service in the UNIZH hospital.   
Swisscare confirms me also that for CHUV no deposit for stationary treatment is no more necessary.   
Swisscare from 01.01.2008 has the reimbursement office no more in France. The office is since 2008 in Basel Switzerland.   
For ambulatory treatment (doctor visit or pharmacy medicine) in Switzerland,  lots of companies refund the money on your account after sending a claim form and your bills. This is the case for example by the company ASSURA.   
This will definitively close the doubt about Swisscare deposit questions or payment for operation and paying big bills.   
Also know that Swisscare has to cover the benefits of the Swiss health insurance law. If you have problems with the paid benefits, you can contact in Zurich the Gesundheitsdirektion which are the BOSS of health authorities. I had a problem with another company with a student plan and they helped me.

Resist any long-duration insurance policies, unless you are offered a substantial sign-on discount. Once you commit, you are bonded and can only retract when you leave the country.

1706	Insurance	Supplementary Insurance-should I claim?	february	1589	7	Location: zurich	12.05.2009, 12:34	"    Yes but not basic insurance, I'm talking about the ""supplementary cover"" you said you had to fight to get. The comparis forums are full of people whose additional insurance cover was canceled by companies. Though not everyone does have a yearly contract, mine with Mutuel is for 5 years.      You wouldn't. I meant that if you don't submit this claim now (this is your hesitation isn't it?) and then later submit some entirely different claim unrelated to this one; they may refuse to pay and cancel your contract (the supplementary cover) immediately because you failed to mention this visit to the psychotherapist.   
And finally the disclaimer: I am not an insurance expert; just sharing what I came to learn.

			Hello ForumMates   
I have some questions regarding accident insurance.   
Some months ago I had a road accident and SUVA was informed about it. 
They have covered the initial expenses. I had lost some tooth in accident. Now they say only dental bridges will be covered by insurance and they will not pay for implants (even though bridges may not be stable in long run because 4 upper and 4 lower tooth are lost).   
Any suggestions how and if we can claim for implants.   
Thanks in advance

			There are several student insurance companies around.   
The most popular seem to be Swisscare, Goldencare and CSS Studentcare.   
They are all very similar - offering low premiums (usually between 80.- and 90.- a month) and a low annual deductible (between 75.- and 100.- p.a.)   
Some have add-ons available, some don't.   
Premiums may vary if you choose to pay annually, quarterly etc. depending on which one you go for.   
All 3 are reputable companies as far as I'm aware.

I know nothing about the various options available (other than that there are many) for household insurance.   
I would appreciate it if someone better versed could tell me what insurance I need to cover accidental damage to the walls/kitchen appliances/wooden flooring/bath/bathroom tiles etc. in a rented apartment.    
I am not interested in insuring my personal belongings - just want to be sure that if anything happens to e.g. the ceramic stove top or the parquet floor that we will not be faced with a multi thousand franc bill.   
Thanks.

			As far as I understand it, it is better to sign up the baby for insurance before birth as the child is then covered unconditionally. If you sign up after birth, the insurance company may place conditions on problems that may have happened during birth or right after.    
In any case you and the baby are insured through your insurance during pregnancy and delivery.   
So probably the insurance company simply wants to discuss with you which coverage you want for the baby once it is born. I've never heard of them trying to sell prenatal stuff.

1726	Insurance	Missed flight connection Travel Insurance	Castro	3161	15	Location: Basel-Land of Smiles	18.01.2009, 21:27	"    I've done that several times and always had the return honoured (eventually).  I am surprised that they insisted.   
On flights in general, local flights to out-of-sector (e.g. LH from ZRH to LHR to SFO with BA will be cheaper than LHR to SFO with BA because they are getting you out of another airlines homebase (ditto ZRH to AMS to SFO with KLM vs AMS to SFO).   
Unfortunately Virgin doesn't do this due to its lack of code-sharing-air-partners.  Very annoying.     
Your onward journey is only guaranteed if it is the same airline (some airline partners) are delayed.  E.g. Swiss and Lufthansa no problem, Swiss and Singapore won't normally work despite them both being *A (star alliance).   
The EU covers you against denied boarding with massive EUR compensation but not for delayed flights.   
I also agree with the fly-the-day-before crowd, especially London or Amsterdam and both are used to long delays.  Most other Euro centres are better (less the French strikes in which case no one flies).   
Generally I wouldn't fly Virgin for all these reasons even though in the UK they'd be one of my first choices...

That sort of insurance model (HMO = Health Medical Organization"") is the cheapest model but with same coverage as the classical model. With that model you go to a doctors network when you are sick. It's an interesting model for healthy persons. 
In Switzerland major part of doctors speaks english.

			Kevlegs,   
That is indeed true for some insurance plans.    
And if you do find one that will insure an older dog, check the premiums, excess and exclusions carefully. When I looked into insuring my older dogs, the cost of the plan was higher than my annual vet expenses for all but one of my mutts. And, the list of excluded conditions included pretty much everything for which I expected to need vet care...   
For my dogs, insurance did not make financial sense. YMMV.

1729	Insurance	Natura Assurances.. Any Experiences?	Kevinoh	754	0	Location: Leysin	11.02.2009, 16:13	" 
			
			Hello Everyone, 
  I'm Kevin and was just thinking of signing up with this company, Natura Assurances.  They dont have any rating listed on the comparis website so i thought it might be a good idea just to have a check to see if anyone here has had any previous experience with them such as reliability, english competence etc. 
 Thanking you in advance 
  Kevin

			I've just been charged 360.- chf this week for a set of general blood tests. Iron, diabetes, liver, that type of thing.    
Each test cost between 30 and 40 francs each. Some a little more but not much.    
Hope this helps.

1734	Insurance	Insurance Termination not acknowledged - Help urgently !	kumar	2199	16	Location: Zurich	19.12.2008, 16:49	"   Well at last this morning I could get the termination confirmation (from 31st Dec 08) from CSS. 
I went to the stadhouse (where I registered as a foreigner) and complained to them on the complete issue verbally. It appeared they had addressed similar issues earlier as well as person concerned there was at ease and could find out someone 'at the top' (I asked him whom he contacted for that he said there is a list with government with contact details of people at top who need to answer urgently ! Cannot share the information as else all will be calling that person for petty matters ) in CSS and called him to seek explanation. 
Now after a short conversation they said they will check and call back, which they did after 15 mins and showed their surprise on how and why these letter was sent from their office as the policy stands cancelled in their system from 8th December 08 !!! I demanded immediate fax or scanned email letter stating the same since I had horrible time following the same since last 2 months now. The fax followed in next 15 mins.  
Now what can be said about this all !!!! Strangest and most annoying conversation I have ever had for sure.

			Mondia is a supplementary insurance with Assura which costs next to nothing. 
It covers you for any emergencies, doctors appointments, hospitalisation, transport costs abroad as well as repatriation so if this is your main concern then I would say that the Rega insurance would be superfluous.   
Having said that, I consider Rega to be a bit like the lifeboats in the UK and you can become a patron or simply make a donation      
so I know quite a few people who have taken this out anyway even though their health insurance covers it. (It's only 30.- p.a. for a single person)   
Rega do a very good job, can't say a bad thing about them.   
There is also Air Glacier which a lot of Valaisans use as it is based in Valais.

			An update -    
Got a call from one of their bigger bosses. My case has been transfered from the local office to the regional office. Now they have decided that they will pay after all. When I asked why they did not want to pay before, he mumbled something about a note in my file about a previous enquiry about entitlement to Spitex costs... then suddenly he changed subjects...   
Hmm... so a few months ago, I gave them a call to ask about what I am entitled to seeing as they do not provide anything in black and white, and they decided to black mark me? This is what it sounds like.   
Anyway, I think it's the fact that I threatened to move my whole family of 4 to another insurance company that did it. As they changed the prices for 2009, I could have done it at the end of November!   
Thanks everyone for your input!

			You might never see a doctor's bill at all if the clinic or doctor bills your insurance company directly. For example, this is the case if you are insured with Swica and you elect IFA in Baden (that's the medical centre on the ABB/Alstom grounds) as your HMO. It does cut down on paper.       
Then all you receive is a statement from the insurance company with the charges and then showing what portion was reimbursed and what is your share. Until you have met the annual franchise, you will pay all of the eligible expenses. After that it could be that you only pay 10%.   
Quite often the pharmacy will also bill the insurance company directly. They just swipe your health insurance card and they then have all the details.

1743	Insurance	Accidental Damage - Covered in Household Contents Insurance?	Stu&amp;Kara	3935	13	Location: Oerlikon, Zurich	16.12.2008, 14:38	" 
			
			OK, so the results of my investigations. I called AXA and asked about accidental damage. When I asked whether they would pay if I broke my own laptop or TV the representative said:   
""No, you would be better to say that your friend broke it and claim from their private liability insurance.""   
She did add a caveat that this is ""kind of fraud"" but seemed genuinely shocked when I mentioned this was normal to have accidental damage cover in UK insurance policies. She eve said she would be happy to ""rip such a company off"" if they would pay for all her accidents.   
Clearly ""ethics"" isn't high on the list of employee requirements at AXA!   
So, the lesson is - this doesn't seem to exist and you would be better having a list of willing ""clumsy"" friends to take the blame if you ever break anything.

			Thanks for the replies. 
I was trying to find out if by law I had to accept an extended contract length. I'll contact the company and see what they say, but I can imagine that as they stuck us with a 10 year contract - something we unfortuantly missed when we signed it, that they will try to force us to also extend the contract. 
I'm actually married to a swiss guy, so the wording 'shouldn't' be a problem, but he is often rather unhelpful with such things with the opinion 'they do what they want anyway and you can't change it/discuss it with them...' - hence the fact that I'm trying to find out what our rights are...

BTW If you'd got informed beforehand (on EF for example) you would have realised that you didn't need all those extra insurances. Being ignorant is not really an excuse. You are not going to blame the insurer for trying to get as much money out of you as he could?    
The 3 month cancellation period is pretty much standard for swiss contracts, it is also the case for mobile phone contracts, fitness center contracts...I don't think it is that bad if you are well organised.   
Look at it on the bright side: If you do have a health problem next year you will be able to make the most of your additional insurances.

			Well, yes, it is ""only"" about hospitalization. However, in case of childbirth, you can often get better treatment in a nicer medical facility, if you opt for a GG2 or GG3. Although, if something goes wrong during the birth, the birthing mother will usually get taken to the local hospital anyway. Also, many private medical facilities do not perform a cesarean, but only not birth. For that again you need to go to the hospital.   
But, a major difference again is with GG2 and GG3 you can have free choice of doctor for treatment anywhere in Switzerland (world if GG3, although max reimbursement is Swiss prices for the procedure, ie. if the price is 300 abroad by 200 in CH, you only get 200, plus bills have to be in French, German or English). The free choice is good, since if there is a specialist somewhere here in CH (or elsewhere) you just go there.

			Our insurance didn't require a medical beforehand.  If you have just basic insurance I think most have to take you whatever but the semi-private and private coverage can be optional on their side as well as yours.   
Some policies ask you to declare any underlying or chronic conditions that you know about, which is sensible to do because if you have an attack of, say, advanced Crohn's Disease or an asthma attack with which you have knowingly been suffering for years they could either refuse to pay your treatment and perhaps bump up your premium.   
You are best to check out your health insurance choices online then direct any queries to them.  What works for some people doesn't work for others - everyone's policy is different.

I responded on email to   sending a pdf copy of my actual insurance policy and their letter which they had sent me.   
10 days later I received a copy of their letter cancelling their request to Helsana.(my email to them was stampled behind) - below is a copy of the french text a colleague helped me with, so it worked out fine.   
Geneva appear to be fairly relaxed versus other cantons from my experience.

On a l lighter note, I once got my pharmacy to bring me something at home. The delivery came as two drop dead gorgeous teenage girls. Too young for me? Definitely, but it was still nice chat 'em up.

			Thanks for the tip Jim!   
Well, I had a phone call from my potentially new insurance agency and they let me off the hook. And my old agency called too and offered me a 15% discount. Now the monetary difference between the two offers is only 60 CHF, and often the old agency has a sharing fund program sort of like dividends, and passes them onto to their customers, which could mean I end up with no difference at all.   
so all, in all, I learned a few things about contracts and have learned to be loyal to my current company, even if I am paying a bit more ""on paper"".    
They, both companies, were very nice to understand that, well, I don't understand much.   "	Posts: 285	Join Date: Apr 2007	Senior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 87 Times in 57 Posts	considered knowledgeable
1759	Insurance	Cost of Medication with and without prescription	lana	4446	18	Location: zurich	08.06.2008, 00:14	"    There were extended negotiations between the insurers and the pharmacies. The insurers wanted to discourage the pharmacies from giving out expensive ""originals"" (higher margin for the pharmacy) instead of cheaper generics. Therefore they agreed on a flat processing fee. Consumers pay 10% and the insurers 90%. So what is good for the insurers is also good for the consumers.    
Those who are not insured can do comparison shopping, e.g. get mail order, buy abroad, etc.

1762	Insurance	Intras minima vs First Med?? help	caz	2499	6	Location: Tuggen SZ	06.10.2008, 21:26	" 
			
			Intras have the systems ""First Call"" and ""First Med"" as alternatives to on the basic insurance.   
First Call = TelMed   
You have to call a 24h call-centre first before visiting a doctor. You don't have to actually follow the advice given but you must call. 
It is very important with Intras to make the phone call because if you read the CGA you'll see that if you don't, they only reimburse you 50% of what they should have reimbursed    (you didn't stick to your part of the deal)   
First Med = GP method / primary care physician   
You choose a GP or pediatrician for the children. It can be any family doctor you like - i.e. not one that has to be chosen from a list they give you. 
You must visit this doctor first before visiting a specialist (like we have to do in the UK anyway). 
You need to visit the doctor for every new scenario. 
For example, you have a rash, you visit your GP, they refer you on to a dermatologist. 
The dermatologist asks you to come back in a couple of weeks to check on how it's going. 
You don't need to re-visit the GP again as it is the same dermatological case.   
These alternative systems have been put in place to try and help people save a bit on premiums although I can appreciate that it's not to everyone's liking.   
As a general rule, the TelMed options tend to be slightly cheaper than the GP method options.      "	Posts: 248	Join Date: Aug 2006	Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 237 Times in 96 Posts	an excellent reputation

According to comparis.ch KPT is one of the cheapest health insurances in Switzerland so if the people on this forum are with more expensive insurances I'd advise them to change over.   
Health insurances provide very little service (=paying bills) so IMHO there is absolutely no reason not to go for the cheapest option in the lists provided by comparis.ch.

1766	Insurance	Supplemental Insurance Denial	India	3007	11	Location: Zug	19.10.2007, 22:23	" 
			
			I recently changed my insurance mid way through the year (on lowest deductible so apparently you can change whenever) I applied for 2 supplementary insurances extra and got them no problem (I am not a perfect specimen of health either! - and didn't lie on the forms)    
I applied for semi private hospital cover also with the same company before I went with them for basic and supplementary insurances and they declined due to me having to declare a recent operation even though there was a conclusion to the operation and no further treatment needed - I mentioned this to my doc and he called up the insurance company and explained to them in better detail the case surrounding my op, soon after his phonecall to them I got a nice letter from them asking me to re submit my application and they would accept it. After they agreed to this I decided to go with them for all other insurances also.    
FYI the insurance company is Concordia   
Also I can highly recommend jenny on this forum to help out with insurance matters, she is extremely knowledgeable and helpful and tells you lots of things that you wouldn't normally know about insurance

1769	Insurance	assurance RC?	Torso	12190	4	Location: Lausanne	22.05.2008, 18:06	"    You'll need both - they're completely separate things. The deposit is a lump of cash, held in a bank account with yours and your landlord's name on it, to pay for any damage/ cleaning remaining at the property when you move out.  (Edit: or you can take out an insurance policy in place of the deposit, which will pay out in the event of damage at the end of the tenancy.  The annual premium will naturally vary depending on the size of apartment and cost of rent, ie, based on how much money 3 months' rent would have been in the first place.)   
The assurance RC is a public liability insurance, which is technically not compulsary but seems to be required by most landlords/ schools/ official bodies.   
It's not that expensive by Swiss standards. I've got mine lumped together with the usual household contents insurance against theft, insurance against breaking the landlord's ceramic bathroom fittings and windows, that sort of thing. The whole package cost 400 CHF for a 4-person, 6-room house family, and the RC was only a small part of it.   
'Assurance de menage' is more what I've described, insurance for your household, but it usually includes the RC within it. It's nothing to do with actual moving. Can't recall off-hand if that's included in household insurance (it was on my UK policy) or whether you need to take out separate insurance for this via the movers.   
(Note on this: we had 3 moving companies tell us that the only way to do this was via 'marine insurance', as the stuff was being put to sea - for a few hours on a ferry across the Channel... Marine insurance would have involved several hours pricing all our belongings separately on a huge form, and a premium in excess of £1000 for about £40,000 worth of goods. One other moving company said they'd speak to their company underwriters and get it included in their normal contract liability for us. Guess which got the business..?)   
Anyhow, if you need to know anything more any insurance, search this forum for 'Jenny', who's a helpful insurance broker who has an excellent reputation on this forum for answering queries and organising insurances via email. She did mine!

1771	Insurance	Are you insured for trekking? (Check the small print!) Ayup.	Deep Purple	1058	0	Location: England	28.08.2008, 21:10	" 
			
			I am planning a trekking holiday around Zermatt area and have a travel policy through my Bank.   
The policy includes cover for winter sports, mountain biking etc. but I noticed a potential problem:   
I am   insured for trekking unless I stick to designated paths and do   use any specialist equipment. More reasonably, mountaineering with ropes or a guide is not covered. My question to my insurer was: Are trekking poles or crampons classified as specialist equipment? Their initial response was yes, and that I would not be insured.   
This could mean that if I walk up a snow covered path on my own, with no safety equipment, and ski or cycle back down, I am insured, but if I take part in an organised trek with a guide and safety equipment, I am not insured.   
I had to get this referred to their claims department before they could see the stupidity of their policy and I now have cover.   
I would strongly recommend that you check any accident policies etc. to ensure that their are no loopholes to catch you out.

1 May was a bit of a punt, but the insurance came back from 1 April, which seemed completely fair.

			Yes, I would feel a little better talking with a lawyer...but time is of the essence, and she is not up and around much.  So, we will probably visit with someone after she leaves.  My mom is documenting everything and we have photographed the black and blue leg...and she is recording the expenses.   
Lucikly we were able to leave the hospital without putting the entire 18K bill on her credit cards.  They accepted a partial payment.   
I'm not sure if the police actually charged the driver with anything.  I just know the last we saw, he was still being detained about two hours after the accident.   
thanks for all the advice!

1780	Insurance	Swiss insurance.Stuck between a rock and a hard place!	happyeverafter	2641	10	Location: SWITZERLAND,Lugano	02.04.2008, 14:22	"    The problem is happyeverafter that in many European countries people are covered by a national health insurance scheme which virtually everyone is a part of basically by virtue of living in the country and paying taxes or social security payments. This would qualify you for the E109.   
In Switzerland everyone is responsible for setting up their own (mandatory) health insurance policy with the insurer of their choice. Premiums are paid by the insured to the insurer direct and are not collected by the state. Therefore, you would only qualify for the E109 in Switzerland if you are insured by name with a Swiss insurer (and in fact the ID card given by insurers to policyholders doubles in most cases as the E109). However, you can only be insured for basic Swiss health insurance once you are resident in Switzerland and have the paperwork to prove it.   
I hope that clarifies the situation for you.

1784	Insurance	What's the deal with Dental [Insurance]?	buckkitty	4071	16	Location: Adliswil	30.07.2008, 18:58	"    You are not alone. Funny thing is that some dentists (or their assistants) do not even ask if you are paying by insurance like in a typical doctor visit.   
There was this bad experience where the dentist did not finish his job during the appointment (must be made weeks in advance) and the patient had to pay another separate visit. Needless to say, that means additional charges, let alone the horrendous rate of few thousand CHF quoted for some rather simple follow-up dental care.   
Like you, it may just make perfect sense to time your home visits with a trip to the dentist for annual check-ups (and any essential fixes while there).   
Good luck.

			You must take out health insurance within three months of arriving in CH. Preexisting conditions are covered and can't be excluded. All you do is give your date of arrival and expenses can be claimed as of that date, even restrospective to the date you actually take out the cover. Premiums however will also charged as of that date. However your policy will include an excess which is variable (higher excess = lower premium) so you will be out of pocket until you hit the excess limit. Technically E111 does not cover UK residents abroad.

			Well if you know you will never go to the doctor in CH, then get the cheapest, nasties one you can find on Comparis, company doesn't matter, only premium does in that case. Normally you would have to pay from the start of your non-coverage (so from Jan in your case).

I didn't find it terribly useful. When moving I found that water damage wasn't covered. So this excludes floors damaged from water, ceilings, windows and walls damaged or marked from condensation.    
Our sink leaked and damaged our pull out rubbish bin and a couple of cupboards. And our bathroom with no window and a crap fan meant the ceiling paint flaked off. We lost most of our deposit.

1813	Insurance	Pre-existing conditions?	alanmack	3293	8	Location: Geneva	04.05.2008, 22:15	"      I can agree with your comments about disclosure of previous medical history if it relates to private insurance but  .   
  For the basic insurance an insurer cannot ask about your medical history and, even if you did decide to disclose it, they cannot refuse you or charge a premium higher than their published rate. If they attempted to do so they should be reported to the insurance  . See this on the   website (if it comes up in German you can switch it to English).   
  As you say, the insurers do issue their own policy but they all have to apply the law in an identical manner. See the   which says:      So, there is no scope for an insurer to issue a policy which does not provide the full benefits. See  .    
  In your first post you state:      What serious conditions are not covered by the basis insurance ? There are certain procedures which may not be covered but these tend to be when a more expensive one is available over and above the normal one. For example: Dealing with varicose veins by the traditional surgical method is covered but, treatment by laser is not. (This information was correct in 2006 but may have changed since).    
  If a doctor proposes any procedure that is not covered by the basic insurance they are required to inform you of this fact.   
  The example you give of someone having a heart operation and then needing further treatment is not correct.    The new insurer has to pay the bill for any further treatment that may be necessary. For example, if towards the end of the year you have a condition needing treatment such as physiotherapy and on the 1st January you change insurers then the new insurer has to pay the bills from that point on.   
  With regard to the original question raised by   if he had been covered by a Swiss employer at the time of the accident then, as you say, anything relating to it would be their responsibility. However, as he was not, apparently, here when the accident happened it can be dealt with as a medical condition under the basic insurance.

1815	Insurance	bike insurance	josan	1124	2	Location: geneva	09.05.2008, 01:55	"    You should have changed your driving license to a Swiss one before the end of your first year in Switzerland (Switzerland, get it? - there is no such country as swiss).   
It is highly unlikely that you will be able to secure insurance in Switzerland in your current circumstances as your Indian driving license is effectively invalid.  Without insurance, of course, you cannot get the number plates for your bike.   
Your best option would be to go to the local vehicle office and explain the situation and find out what steps are necessary to change your license to a Swiss one.  The options range from a simple competency test to the full test including compulsory training and a written test.

1820	Insurance	Health insurance: evacuation and repatriation cover	Suse_H	2908	11	Location: Geneva	27.03.2008, 16:37	"    Re swelling, when they put the cast on my son's leg they cut it along the length so it could accomodate swelling - it was kept closed with elastic bandage.  That's one of the benefits of the material they use these days - plain plaster doesn't flex at all.  Only a week after he got to London did they fully close it.   
When it comes to insurance I can recommend a guy I know in Zürich.  He  uses 28 years in the industry to pick an insurance that really matches your needs and budget and is value for money.  Let me know if you need his details via private message.   
As for quality, I suspect he's liable to potentially downright refuse to sell you something that he thinks is wrong but so far I haven't found reason to doubt his choices.  It's rather unusual to be able to trust an agent, but that's exactly what I ended up doing - maybe because he stubbornly works like me (let me do it right or don't bother me  ).  He gets the insurances to work for you.   
Oh, and as so many Swiss he speaks fluent French as well.  We talk in both German and English because we need the practice :-).   
As for my son, his cast came off 2 weeks ago and like any decent 9 year old he already has to be slowed down  .  It appears at his school there has been a bit of ""changing of the guards"" - he came out of a cast and a friend of him had the same thing happen in France (break, airlift, the works).  I'm working with a few people on Swiss awareness campaigns for next season - there is an increasing level of accidents and injury on the slopes which needs addressing.   
Anyway, enough waffle.  Time to get some work done, only have half a day today..

1824	Insurance	Health insurance for family - family not living in Switzerland	gykon	3796	6	Location: Erlenbach	20.09.2007, 19:10	" 
			
			The form E106 was issued by the swiss insurance I chose. But after closer checking I gound that the local country health system (FR) has no way to find out anything about Swiss healt system. 
So my recommendation would be: 
1) If you live in FR and husband in CH - your husband should get CH insurance. For the work permit regiustration he needs to insure you as well, but he can cancel your insurance immediatelly (not to have extra costs). You register yourself in FR. You will be covered in FR and your husband in CH. 
2) If you and your husband live in CH, get insurance in CH as it should be, cancel all others.   
The basic rule is, get insurance where you live and stay most of the time. This insurance covers only Serious Accidents in other countris (not high temperature etc.. but PART of havy car accident). So you will never be 100% covered in other countries. But it is most reasonble if you do not want to pay insurance in CH and FR at the same time (which is not allowed, but possible).

			By virtue of the fact Health insurance is compulsory all medical care is therefore private. Just the facilities and coverage are deisgnated differently (norma/basic, semi-private, private).   
As insurance company recognition is cantonal you may need a copy of the cantonal permission/recognition of your insurance provider for your stay in Switzerland depending on the merits of your situation (eg a temporary right to outside Switzerland coverage pending education, work exchange etc).

			I had the same question a few months ago, and the best solution for me was to get a 'Zusatzversicherung' to my basic health insurance. Not only medical costs, but also cancellation, luggage, assistance etc are covered. I took it because of the travel insurance, but it also gives me better covering in Switzerland and it costs like 11chf per month.   
-oops, just realizing that you will not have Swiss health insurance anymore.  
It's true that you can't apply for Australian travel insurance whilst you're living abroad, ask about expat-insurance. It's usually a bit more expensive, but the only way to stay covered if you're residing abroad for a longer period of time.

			Pregnancy complications are only insured, if the pregnancy commenced after the health insurance contract became effective. This can be a problem for expats.    
Generally, pregnancy and childbirth are 100% reimbursed, i.e. exempt from the standard 10% deductible.   
Basic principle of insurance is that past conditions are not insurable. Only future events are insurable. Premiums are calculated based on probability statistics. If the probability is 100% then the premium is also 100%, i.e. not reimbursable.

1835	Insurance	Trainee=Intern?	guest	1184	0	null	null	" 
			
			Hi, I'll stay in Switzerland for 6 months starting in middle March, to do an internship in a local company. I checked (and spoken with) the KVG/LAMal website, and found out that foreign students, researchers and trainees  
can be exemped from the compulsory health insurance, and use the EHIC (European Health Insurance Card); basicly you pay for yourself your GP, drugs, medications, etc..., and then you send KVG the receipts of payments, that they'll reimburse you (sooner or later). 
This would be great, because since I'll stay out from my country (Italy) for less than 12 months, I won't loose residency, so I will be able to use the EHIC. 
My only problem is, if you look at the documents in this page -   - expecially the first one, relating the the Kanton Aargau, there's written that the exemption is valid for students, researchers, and trainees...So, is trainee a synonym for intern? In the Italian version of that document, 'trainee' is translated as 'stagista', which is also the italian translation for 'intern', but I'd like to know if in Switzerland trainees are 'something else'... 
If I have to open an health insurance, I'll do it, no problem, but I'd like to know if I can avoid all the paperwork of opening it, and then closing after 6 months, when I'll leave the country. 
Thanks a lot

			While optimizing the ""excess level"", consider also the tax deductibility. Non-reimbursed medical expenses that exceed 5% of the taxable income, are deductible.    
Hence, under certain circumstances, it could be better to pay a lower medical premium, absorb the ""excess level"" and then deduct it from taxable income.   
You need a spread sheet to calculate the bottom line, including tax impact!

			Find a friendly doctor. Mine is amenable to answering the phone and sending me a repeat prescription.   
If you consistently require medication, consider a mail-order pharmacy. They offer a discount and waive some of the fees. Depending on your insurer, the mail-order pharmacy is even prepared to directly invoice the insurer.    
Disadvantage of mail order: delay of 2 working days, i.e. not suitable for urgent medications. Also, if not at home, the parcel must be collected at the nearest post-office. That may not be convenient for hardworking singles.

			Not sure what your are asking, but as far as I know concerning the basic legal minimum health insurance, you have the 300 or whatever annual deductible (Selbstbehalt) that will be calculated in on all medical expenses. The 10% is deducted for prescribed medicines and ambulant doctor's bills. For surgery with hospitalization, however, I believe is fully covered.

You are incorrect in saying the VHI Global does not meet Swiss requirements. VHI Global is NOT travel insurance, it is health insurance 'for Irish residents who are living or working abroad for more than 6 months but intend to return to Ireland to resume residency at a future date'.    
I spoke with the Zurich city authorities and they are satisfied with this cover. The main point which they emphasised was that I am resident here on an internal transfer from my company and the expectation is that I will return to Ireland. This may be different to others situations.

			Hi,   
Sub: maternity insurance   
I've been reading in the threads that if someone is already expecting and enters Switzerland, then she will be automatically covered by the insurance co. for expenses related to maternity.   
AS my wife is about to join me (hopefully in a couple of weeks) and she is expecting, I am looking for possibilities of insurance coverage in geneva. FYI, I am covered by wincare insurance (and am on B WP) by my company and they have planned for covering my wife too in the same. My question is that:   
1) How much and what all do these guys cover in terms of 'insurance' in such cases? 
2) Do I need to declare explicitly to the insurance company that my wife is expecting or is it done implicitly? 
3) I've been to UHG (University Hospital) and it looks good to me.. how and what are the services/insurance coverages helped here? How much would I need to shell out (expenses) from my pocket in the whole process?   
Well, it would be great help if someone could guide me to appropriate answers...    
Looking forward to help...

			I know I can't have both at the same, time so I'm ready for the compromises..   
Can you tell about your experiences contracting additional coverage for dental insurance? Most concerned in gething these for my kids.   
My madatory insurance company offers it, but sell it in addition with other coverages which I'm not interested in.   
any ideas?   
thanks

But these things take time.  I am leaning towards getting rid of the company car and getting a rental/short term lease as a stop gap.   
Or maybe buying a L/R Defender cheap..

			My (87yr.) mother coming out this way in the summer and has TRICARE. At her age I'm all too worried that something unfortunate might happen and I just want to be assured she'll be ok with the coverage from TRICARE. So I was just wondering if anybody in here happened to have it while living here and if you have any warnings I should know about. You can PM me if you'd rather not mention this in a public forum.

1853	Insurance	Insurance and Elder Care Issues	meloncollie	1206	0	Location: SZ	17.12.2007, 12:59	" 
			
			Searching didn't bring up relevant posts; apologies if I've missed a similar thread.   
We are weighing the pros and cons of bringing our elderly parents to live with us here - and health care is a major concern. In all the years I've lived here I've never even had to make an insurance claim, so I'm rather hazy on how the system - specifically hospitalization - works here.   
Given that the parents are in their 80s, both in poor health with long lists of pre-existing conditions, I believe that they will only be able to get the basic insurance, which covers general ward hospitalization only. My question is whether this would provide sufficient coverage for their needs.   
With the basic hospitalization insurance, is accommodation the only difference, or is the level of medical care or treatment options any different from what is available to patients with private or half private insurance?    
Broadly speaking, what is care like in a general ward? (We're talking about two elderly, at times easily confused folk who speak no German - I worry that they would not be able to communicate their needs to the nursing staff.)    
Is it possible to pay out of pocket to upgrade to private or half private care for a specific treatment/surgical stay if needed?   
Also, I fear that some kind of assisted living/ nursing home care may be needed in the not too distant future.  Looking at options available, I've been unable to find an independent or oversight agency which rates residential care homes. (This is fairly common in the US, most states have a oversight agency which reports on incidence of complaints, etc. - a tool which is very helpful when choosing a provider). Does such a thing exist here?   
If any of you have brought elderly relatives here, I'd appreciate hearing about your experience with finding appropriate senior care services.   
Many thanks.

			You should have three months.  Have you asked them why they seem to think differently?  Either way, I would call the HI company and ask them what can be done to satisfy the authorities.  Maybe they can call them. Neither I nor my GF had a problem with this, but we probably had our insurance confirmed earlier.

			No need to worry about that, except if you want private/additional insurance.    
Essentially, there is a basic catalogue of coverage that has to be given to everyone and quite rightly, as insurance is obligatory for all. This does not include homoeopathy and suchlike, but many insurances offer a fairly cheap additional option, I don't know if that option is subject to provisos though.

In known cases, you must be examined by a professional(s), go through all the appropriate personal tests within Switzerland (and your partner) and have meetings to ensure that the only way for you to become pregnant is by IVF. But still, not all HI will accept this so you must find this out first and who will allow partial coverage. Normally, most places will make it so hard for you to prove, it is not worth the foot work.  
Good luck.

			A public liability insurance is very advisable. It is called Haftpflichtversicherung here. I don't know if a normal Haftpflichtversicherung covers commercial activities, too.   
Organisers often write ""Versicherung ist Sache der Teilnehmer"" (insurance is concern of the participants) on entry forms. This isn't enforcable in court - I think this is either widespread because it's an old habit or because it protects the organiser from damages not covered by the public liability insurance...

If you need an insurance to cover flight cancellation, luggage lost etc..try Elvia-Versicherungen, which specialized as travel-insurance compagny.   
On the other hand, your health insurance will cover health problems abroad as well.   
Or even die Mobiliar or Allianz...etc...

			They should, however, apparently they have some ways they can attempt to refund less for you, and then it is up to you to fight it.   
For example, some companies have added clauses to their rules, like, there is this company I nearly signed up with that someone mentioned on here, they ask do you smoke, you say no, you get a cheaper policy for non-smokers without realizing it. Then it turns out if you get lung cancer (passive smoke anyone?) they won't pay anything!   
Now how is that for trying to get out of normal obligations! So read the AVB (the policy rules) of the grundvers. before you sign!

			As I understand it, once your address changes to something outside of Switzerland, you will need to get a new insurance policy.    
Unless you are moving to Malaysia to work for a Swiss organisation, then you will no longer have any real link to Switzerland, so I cannot see any Swiss insurance company wanting to cover you.

1865	Insurance	cost disparities between cantons ?	GVA offline	1306	7	Location: Genève	28.10.2007, 14:22	" 
			
			I did a little research. I believe this to be a reliable source.... and really, I'm guessing on some of this       
Comparing Swiss health care to the US where insurers dictate pricing, contracts, coverage and so on:    
""Managers of public hospitals are prevented from creating such contracts in return for lower fees, as the authority to do so rests with cantonal parliaments, as they are so heavily engaged in the financing of their hospitals. The Revised Health Insurance Law specifies that cantons must 
cover 50% of hospital costs, and requests that cantons draw up lists of hospitals with which insurers must contract. Thus hospital sector competition is stifled.""    
People  stay in their canton for most health care (certainly if you're on compulsory/basic). The cantons determine the cost of services in public hospitals  - they must if they have to fund 50%  and determine which facilities, etc - and that must influence the private. I'm guessing that costs depend on labor, real estate, equipment, improvements, and patient demographics which drive the need for some of the services, as well as which researchers end up in which universities - leading to the development of specialities. (at least, that's what drives costs in the US - might be similar here) But here, the cantons make a lot of the decisions with federal oversight, and in the US, it is very much insurers at facility level.    
And...the insurers here have some lattitude in their pricing, as prices can vary as much as 50% from canton to canton. (I assume for the same gender, age, franchise profile).  Here's a source for that too...       
I wonder, are there cantonal pork barrel politcs in Switzerland?

			Hi, I've just posted this on another thread (not sure of 'forum etiquette' in this repsect) and you might find it useful. The thread was started by NicktheGreek and is called something like ""starting date"".   
""The websites are clear thanks. After following the usual chain of phone numbers in British bureaucracy it sounds like the EHIC would be useful as long as you don't intend to be resident here. It sounds to me like a straight replacement for the E111.    
If you are intending to work then i think you can get up to several years cover with a 'Residual E106' if you have contributed enough National Insurance in the last 3 tax years. This may be acceptable in place the most basic of private paid Swiss insurance. There is also a 'non-working E106' and an E101 for people who are working but i'm not so sure about those.""   
EHIC:    
If you want to go for the 'Residual E106' as proof for the Gemeinde then this is the best number i found: +44 (0)191 218 1999. Have your National Insurance number handy.

			This is a question you should ask your insurers about. Without knowing the terms of your policy I don't see how anyone can give you the answer. 
On a UK policy the extension which provides third party cover for a vehicle not owned by you normally applies only within the UK and not abroad. 
Why not just ask your friend to get you included on his insurance for the period of your visit ?

			Hi all   
I wonder if anyone might be able to help, pretty please ?    
We have Sentinel credit card insurance for our cards & documents in the UK, but are unable to transfer this to Switzerland as we have to be UK residents. (The UK cards we have transferred here no problem !  )   
I would like to sort out some kind of Swiss or international equivalent of Sentinel if it's possible. I tried to get Sentinel themselves to send me some info but had to ask 3 times, then they sent the wrong info and I almost lost the will to live trying to resolve it, so I'm wondering if anyone has an arrangement they could recommend ? And before anyone says ""this is Switzerland, nothing ever gets nicked"" we just might occasionally go back to the UK or elsewhere where the crime rate isn't quite so low.....    
Any help would be hugely appreciated. Thank you.   "	Posts: 36	Join Date: Jun 2007	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 7 Times in 5 Posts	no particular reputation at present

			Following on from my previous post, as stated, a normal maternity does not require drugs and therefore, if they have to be used, it is considered an illness and the deductible applies. A caesarean is considered a normal part of maternity.  
  I think the position regarding any drugs used for a caesarean is that if they are a normal part of the procedure the deductible will not apply but if they are used because some complication arises then they may be considered as being for an illness and the deductible will apply. 
  Im not 100% sure that this is the right answer but thats the best I can offer.   Hope this helps.  "	Posts: 56	Join Date: Apr 2007	Junior Member	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

In reality however, this only applies to special situations. Someone who is just visiting does not require this as it only comes into force as a requirement after 3 months - for the insurance companies however it is upon request ie day 1.   
Note it is not saying that everyone in Switzerland must immediately take out health insurance!!

			Please check that before you pay those premiums, as I have doubts it would work. Since you have to deregister with the Gemeinde (local council), your company will find out you have left through the council, and could therefore refuse to keep you as a client, or worse, let you pay and refuse when the hospital bill arrives.

			Yeah I already checked out Winterthur as I have some other insurance there, but it's useless since bagage belongs to household, and the intertours-policy doesn't cover medical costs. That means you'd also end up with 3 different policies... it seems to be the same everywhere.    
UBS-insurance option seems to fit the bill, but I don't have a UBS credit card. At least I'm hopeful again that I can find what I'm looking for.    
However, I'll check with my employer whether private travel is also covered - that would be great. Never thought about that. Thanks for the input so far.

  You can download the Tarmed Browser  . Its also availablenin French and German if you changes the language setting.

			We shopped around for the best quote before having to buy but we only had a few days to look. Our Swiss policy is still almost £500 more per year than the lowest quote we got in the UK for a similar vehicle. If your employer has a preferred insurance agent it may be worth dealing with the same person. It seems that person-to-person business deals are cultivated in Switzerland and the agent that arranges insurance for my wife's employer came up with the lowest quote for us.

As I said, you can get the basic Swiss insurance irrespective of your condition and at normal rates. If you wanted supplementary cover then that would be a different matter as it is subject to your medical condition. However, the basic insurance here is very good and many people have nothing else. 
Regarding paying for drugs, you will find that the pharmacy will supply them and bill  the insurance company direct so you don't have to worry about waiting for reimbursement. 
Have a good look at Comparis to understand the full extent of the cover.

1903	Insurance	getting reimbursed for prescription drugs	GVA offline	2154	6	Location: Genève	01.07.2007, 22:38	"    The replies are almost correct.....   
Nearly all companies work in the same way. i.e. you present your insurance card at the pharmacy and you don't pay straight away.   
However, Assura is the company whereby you have to pay first for your medecins, keep your bills etc. and then send them all off together when you reach your deductable. They are (to my knowledge) the only ones who do this which is why they remain one of the cheapest and stable (in terms of prices) companies. They do this to reduce their administration costs.   
Secondly, it depends on your medication. If it's covered by basic there should be no problem. However, if it's covered by your complementary/supplementary insurance then you may have to pay upfront. Though that seems to depend on the pharmacy you're dealing with.   
Either way, you have to pay up to your deductible anyway!

			It depends on your deductible. If you have only the mandatory basic insurance, you can normally select how high the deductible will be. Any costs that arise that go OVER the deductible will be reimbursed. Costs underneath the deductible will not.   
Also, why don't you just apply to a health insurance company directly? An advisory company is no doubt going to charge you some fee, or take commission. Plus, it only takes like a day or two to get your policy number.   
Try   for rates for various insurance companies...

			That's a general question, have you done ""the homework""?         
You have to have paid AHV/IV roughly since the conception and it is required that you work 5 months during the pregnangcy as an independent or employee to get the insurance. Since you have no employer at the moment, you have to contact the compensation office directly. You can find the form and further details with the first link.

I am sorry to insist, but I am insured non HMO (or casamed or whatever they name it on the different Krankenkasse) and I am booking ALL kinds of doctors and therapies directly and not through my GB for the last 11 years and never had a problem. So do other people I know, from other Krankenkasse. Actually only the HMO Modell forces you to book through the GP (except gyneacologist). You save money on the Prämien thus but you do not have the free choise.

I question comes to mind though - when did you buy it?  If you have had it less than 6 months you will have to pay duty on it.  You won't have to pay on the spot but you will get a bill later.

			This is a tricky one.     
I've been asking around a bit and generally the answer is no, once you have proven your insurance then the history tends to be forgotten.  This was the case with me - I had about 6 reminder letters before I did it, one a month, once I sent in the name of my insurance company I was left alone and has no problem renewing my permit and oving from an L to a B.   
But, there is at least one example of a friend in Basel who had to backdate his insurance payments - however he did require medical treatment (which he paid for but was still asked for his insurance company which he didn't have) so I guess that may have triggered it off.   
I think the final answer is you will have to take the risk and see what happens.

I needed some legal advice so I contacted the local British Vice Consul who gave me a list of local lawyers who spoke English and recommended one of them. I phoned them and asked if they could indicate the cost of consulting them and described the problem. By the time we finished chatting I got all the information I needed to know and that cost me nothing !.
Theres a lot of talk here about going to court. Im not qualified to advise on the Swiss system but, in the UK, most cases never get near a court. This only happens when the two parties cant agree and the injured party feels that they want to take it further. 
Try your Vice Consul or Embassy and they may even be able to give you the legal advice themselves.
For the future have a look at your own insurance. Most companies offer a cover for legal expenses if you have an accident and if you have this you have no worries.  "	Posts: 149	Join Date: May 2007	Member	Groaned at 1 Time in 1 Post	Thanked 31 Times in 22 Posts	considered knowledgeable

An ex-flatmate once claimed, and given a police report and orig receipt for the bike (they need something to value it of course) they will give you new value minus a deductible - unless you are really lucky.   
Just give em a call :>  I am sure you can get someone who speaks english, they can check what your policy covers etc - they won't bite !!   
You can get additional insurance if your bike is worth alot - ask them what your policy covers 
and you can also get insurance for crashing your bike with TCS.

Companies often link in the RC (personal liability) bit to the contents insurance. More and more landlords are asking for it and won't rent you their property if you don't have one (though in theory it's not compulsory!).   
For those who may not know, I also do RC Ménage for people. If you let me know what you need, I can get a quote done within the day and faxed to you.    
In fact, I do every kind of insurance with the same principle. Work with different companies to get the best deal for each individuals needs.

It is interesting that some people also apparently managed to get top up insurance while pregnant. There is no legal obligation for this and often it comes with the clause you can have it for anything that is not pregnancy related until this pregnancy is over. Often there is a 12 month wait before additional insurances kick in for the case of pregnancy. One exception is often for Swiss wide hospital coverage - which of course is only sensible...

			No you won't get fined or anything,if you've not been sick,then you've not made any claims, so everything will be fine.   
The worst that could happen is,( but I doubt it, ), you'll be made to pay back three months of insurance, but as you've not signed up, who'll know other than the council,and as you've not signed up, there's no missing premium to have a court order at you for non payment of premium. 
Court order(BETREIBUNG)   
Anyway when you sign up just make the start date from that day, and don't say too much.   
Regarding the premium if you are healthy,and never really go to the doc. you may be better taking a higher franchise as this reduces the premium quite a bit, and make sure when you take out the insurance you know exactly what your covered for. 
Sometimes it can be very clear and other times not, eg. if your not carefull you can be covered twice, ie. unfall( ACCIDENT INS.). 
your covered by your firm compulsory, then why bother paying extra in your krankenkasse, IN SOME CASES YOU MUST PAY AN EXTRA PREMIUM, OTHERS IT IS INCLUDED IN THE PREMIUM but these are things to discuss with your insurer, so it's better to ask plenty if your not sure ,however on the whole the krankenkassen insurers are pretty helpfull.

1930	Insurance	What is covered by the Basic [health] insurance?	sparks1061	2013	0	Location: Vaud	07.04.2007, 11:20	" 
			
			Hi, Have found plenty of information about the basic medical insurance, but what I can't find is what is actually included in that cover?     I suffer from Palindromic Rheumatism which needs fairly frequent treatment, and my girlfriend is asthmatic, so I need to know if these treatments will be covered by the basic insurance, or if not would I still be able to get additional insurance to cover them, or will they not want to know because of the costs?   
Thanks   
Dave

Yes, with the ""border-LaMal"" you have access to health benefits both sides of the border.      You can opt out at the latest three months after your first working day in Switzerland.      Are you sure - the general opinion is that CMU has a fairly good coverage in comparison with Swiss basic insurance. Coverage under CMU for Swiss-side services is limited though.

			Hi Learmont,   
Welcome to the joyful world of Swiss insurances. This will be your first of many insurances. I would not suggest taking an insurance company by way of recommendation, because what works well for one person may not work well for you. The cost of your basic insurance (the one which is a legal requirement) changes according to your age and your gender, as well as where you live (how on earth your choice of residence has anything to do with your own health baffles me). Oddly enough, whether you are a smoker or not has no effect on your insurance premium.   
Your first stop should be   - enter your basic details and you'll get the quotes for health insurance. Be aware that the prices change according to your ""franchise"" which is the amount that you have to pay yourself each year. For example, I have a CHF1500 franchise - meaning I can only start to claim after I pay the first CHF1500 myself per calendar year. You have to decide which level you want - if you get sick alot, and you can't afford to stump up CHF1500 yourself then pick a lower one, but your monthly premium will be higher.   
There are different ways to increase or decrease your premium. For example, you could elect to have ""private"" cover which means you get your own room - this is expensive though! I have an option called ""HMO"" which reduces my premium - this means I can choose from a list of doctors that the insurance company provides - this has worked pretty well for me and makes a big difference.   
Since you say you have a colourful medical history you may have problems getting additional insurance in addition to the minimum level (the nice part is that you MUST have this insurance, and the companies cannot deny it to you). I only have 3 additional health insurance products. I have accident cover (your accident insurance will be paid by your employer if you are a full-time employee), cover for the whole of switzerland (by default, if you get sick outside of your home canton, you are out of luck!), and an option that upgrades me to private cover for accidents only. The last one is handy because it is really cheap, and since I engage in all sorts of dangerous sports I figure that the chance that I land up in hospital  after an accident is greater than for sickness!   
Hope that helps, and once you've done some initial calculations drop back in and maybe we can help you further.   
Mark

1935	Insurance	Insurance for non-EU applying for B-dependant permit	IT_research_student	1762	5	Location: Somewhere near Leman	20.03.2007, 12:59	"    HeatherM,   
I guess that you are not a Trainee/Student.   
You can still use Assurance-Etudiants's insurance  , 100% reimbursement. 
45 Euro/month (if you are non-EU) or 25Euro (if you are Eu), the only drawback: you have to pay yourself first, and get the imbursement later by sending the bill to Paris.   
For my case, since I am WAITING for my permit to be approved, I am unsure whether I could use that Cheap 45Euro/month French insurance or not?

			Well, after a very long silence I received a Mahnung (""reminder"", but with bad connotations) from my health insurance provider yesterday for these payments. I snapped and immediately phoned them (in German). The woman claimed that her computer was down and that she would call me back -- I have heard this before.    
However, she actually called back early this morning. After reviewing my file and the information that I provided they have decided to drop the charges. I wish I had this in writing though.

			Spmull, thank you I will read and look at the Danish as you suggest.   
My e-mail is  . Thank you. This is all very interesting to me.   
AbFab, thank you for your reply. Most appreciated. No, I hope I never get sick again. But it is a concern. I had breast cancer 6-1/2 years ago and as people get older although I don't think of myself as old, middle aged but not old, I think that healthcare is a concern for retirement.   
So are taxes and quality of life.  I find that as we get older our priorities change and so does lifestyle in some ways.    
Switzerland has everything on our list, quality healthcare, close to skiing, lots of photography opportunities for my husband to do his hobby, easy travelling to other parts of europe easier than flying across the atlantic and can be done by train which is probably cheaper and for me easier than by plane.  In all honesty, Switzerland looks like it has everything to offer both of what is on our list of retirement living. We would be happy to live in a very small town.  I can even play Jass.   
I go out of my way now to buy swiss made products if possible. I grew up on ""only Swiss cheese and chocolates"" I didn't eat an american candy bar till I was in my 20s. Sometimes a Swiss aquaintance brings back a biernbrot or some bieber.  Sorry off topic.    
So yes, healthcare is a big concern for me, but no I don't want to ever need it. I would happily pay the premiums and never use it. I just want to know that good high quality is available should I ever need it.

It will take a matter of minutes to fill in a form for your health fund and a few days to it to be confirmed. Payments and cover will be backdated to when you were first registered here...

1. But still not every office clerk will speak English with you I suppose. 
2. They will but a few countries are excluded, e.g. Sweden. 
3. The only advice to it is to take highest Frachise = CHF 2500

1955	Insurance	SUVA ACCIDENT or Illness?	Ronald Mast	2871	1	Location: Wald	30.11.2006, 12:57	"    Hello Roland.   
There may well be a difference and this is not to be underestimated... Generally accident insurance affords private cover whereas it is most likely that your health insurance is basic cover. Secondly there is certainly some form of residual (selbstbehalt) with your health insurance whereas with your accident insurance there is not.    
I forget the wording but an accident is defined as an injury resulting from the influence of an external source. In your case you could argue this was due to the tray. But to get the exact wording I would most definitely involve lawyers if you have them available through work or insurance.    
No the SUVA decision is not final this is an initial judgement. Generally if in doubt insurance companies will reject claims as not their liability.

			Our insurance had worldwide cover except USA where we were covered for CHF100,000. 
However, Im a bit annoyed now as we recently asked to  change the semi private ward option on our policy to a communal ward, they duly did this and the monthly savings are quite significant, however, it now turns out that we are only covered for CHF20,000 abroad and zero in the USA.  I dont know why this option of which ward we stay in should affect our type of medical cover abroad, but then again, I dont know a lot of things. 
Check the small print.
