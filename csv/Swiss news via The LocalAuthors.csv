0	Swiss news via The Local	SVP to immigrants: Dont mess with the Swiss flag		55,803	171	Location: Zurich	28.09.2011, 18:20	"     
exactly. I do not see any reason to not adapt if you go somewhere. If you move to US or to Russia, you either have to adapt to their values or you just die on the street because there is no social system to catch you.   
I do not say that Russia or US should be the role model but indeed it helps immigrants to be motivated to adapt...

1	Swiss news via The Local	Allow porn in schools: Swiss men's group		9,212	36	Location: Zurich	16.07.2012, 16:27	"    That's your words. What I said: 
- my lesson kick-off 
- extreme example 
- philosophy class 
You mixed them all in your blender. Not me.    
The reason I don't discuss the Local's lies is exactly what you point out: one does not discuss porn as such in class, it's not a subject and not part of a subject either and won't ever be it. One knows that porn exist, accepts this fact and does not censor it away from the actual teaching. We teach concepts, and if by doing so, we ""touch"" pornography, then so be it. We don't avoid it here but it's not a porn class.    
Even in sexual education, where the discussion about showing porn originated, the idea is to liberate verbal expression in order to kill myths. Giving them condoms to roll up on colourful dildos is part of it, the reflection leading to porn is the ground attitude that if one needs something in class, we use it, no censorship. How useful and for what pedagogical purpose porn could be useful, that's the core of the discussion, and it's not what TheLocal catching line is about. Hence my refusal to relate to them.    
By deviating to philosophy when talking about porn in this thread, it should be clear that I don't advocate the use of porn films. Not because I'm shocked by it of even condemn it as such, but only because in my professional eyes, it would serve no pedagogical purpose. When porn is relevant to my teaching, pictures are not necessary, they all know what is it about and we can proceed to the actual teaching. But who am I to forbid other people to continue that discussion for sex education with pupils 16-19 years old? I do advocate sex education in school, but I don't tell them how to do their job. There are enough people in the field of sex education who participate to this debate, they don't need theLocal's headlines to lead a sensible pedagogical discussion.    
In each field of education, there are outrageous ideas out there. Sex makes it to the headlines, not the other ones. To me, this story is a pedagogical discussion like another one. Business as usual, people have different opinions, exchanging ideas is always a good idea, disagreeing is positive for constructive professional educational discussions etc.

7	Swiss news via The Local	Prosecutors arrest Swiss club Xamax's owner		31,121	8	Location: Zurich	27.01.2012, 09:43	" 
			
			Swiss football has quite a sophisticated youth development system coordinated by the national association. Xamax was at the time of their downfall responsible for one of the 13 top-level youth organisations in the country supported by the national association and covering the area of the cantons Neuchâtel and Fribourg.    
When Xamax inc. went bankrupt, the bankruptcy judge agreed to keep the youth organisation out of the bankruptcy estate, so this part continued existing with the support of local Xamax-afficionados and the national association. The Under-21 team was at that time playing in 2.Liga Interregional becoming in the same year the 5th level with the introduction of the new national 3rd tier, the Promotion League.    
So, this Under-21 team is the basis of the new Xamax. The majority of the team are still today young players from their own youth organisation. But already from the beginning of the new Xamax some really good and experienced Challenge League (2nd tier)-players from the region (mostly Biel) could be added to the team.    
So, Xamax moved up to the 1.Liga (4th level) in the first season and at the same time merged with the local FC Serrières already active in the 1.Liga (and rather a good team there). From a purely sport point of view the merger was not really necessary, but they think it's better for sponsoring purposes to reduce local competition. So Xamax became again the nr.1 football club in the city after only one year.   
They managed also the promotion from 1.Liga the following year, and currently, Neuchâtel Xamax FCS is even in Promotion League on the first place after 17 out of 30 games with 4 points ahead of Rapperswil-Jona (the other team that moved up with them from 1.Liga this summer). Only the Promotion League champion is promoted at the end of the season to Challenge League.     
So, they have good chances to move up to Challenge League. Afterwards, it will be vital to not repeat the mistakes of the past. They had allowed for Chagaev to take over their club because their ambitions were too high-flying and not realistic in the first place.    
The situation has changed since their haydays in the 80-ies. Nowadays, the place of a club like Xamax is between the lower half of Super League and the upper half of Challenge League. They have the potential to return to Super League, but need to be aware that every now and then, they can drop down to Challenge League and they need to refrain from unrealistic adventures trying to fool reality. FC Aarau is a good example for Xamax, a club with very similar possibilites, but more realistic expectations during the recent decade.

I would say the risk of the Euro not even surviving ten more years or the US defaulting on it's debt/losing it's petrodollar reserve status between now and ten years is substantially higher than the risk of gold losing 2/3rds of it's value between now and 10 years...   
And even if you would still have a third of the value left... fiat currencies drop to absolute zero value after a while with a 100% 'succes' rate of this happening so far.

It is not like there was some great peacemaker or a friend of the Israelis waiting in the wings to take over. Mahmoud Abbas is/was just another out of the same mould as Arafat - both rumoured to have embezzled billions.

22	Swiss news via The Local	Swiss mull tough benefit cuts for asylum seekers		8,818	41	Location: Zurich	13.06.2012, 11:32	" 
			
			We are (almost all I believe) foreigners. We (almost all) contribute to this country, usually more than we get back. I don't mind that, piece left for me is still generous enough for me to stay and having time of my life.  
These asylum seekers, it's not an easy topic. Many sad stories. Problem is, not many actually need protection. As said, amounts to get here from Africa, Asia are usually 5-digit USD equivalents, and you need to be really rich there (or be utterly stupid and get to huge debt) to go for this ride. 
And Switzerland is tiny spec of dust. It cannot embrace all people from whole world (and Switzerland has quite a special status, many people want to get exactly here, not just generally Europe). So with current global economic conditions, either flow is throttled quite intensively, or problem gets worse.  
Mentioned Mongolians - I seriously doubt they are here for anything else than money. There are no persecutions of minorities there, and the state is more or less democracy. So unless they are criminals back home, this is economic migration. And same applies for many, many others.  
If this would be up to me (and it is not, correctly), I would accept only truly endangered people, that can prove they would face execution or torture based on political/racial/ethnic membership. You know, north korea, few african states (really just few), and that's probably it. Rest of them, they could live back home, in worse condition than here, but perfectly manageable (as they did before coming here).

It is a clear security flaw that a guy enters to a disco hiding a knife. Making the security staff liable for such crimes might improve the situation as they will care more to prevent this.

We will be visiting the zoo with my husband's daughter and her four year old daughter, so hopefully will see these babies. 
For a birthday treat a few years ago, I got up close with a tiger (fed it with pieces of meat on a stick and actually touched his paw!) and got a private viewing of the snow leopards, such beautiful and magnificent creatures.

Naturally, I've taken the time to explain to other readers that the local is not news, that they simply plagiarize and translate content from other unattributed sites. I don't expect to significantly slow their page hit growth, though.

It was a good opportunity to ask, though.  
I often notice that use of words is far less accurate in English than in German. Fact of life, I don't mind.

105	Swiss news via The Local	Only a lunatic would join the EU: Swiss minister		2,518	37	Location: Zurich	21.06.2012, 15:07	"    That's like saying that the United Kingdom was neutral prior to WWII because it had a treaty with Poland.       I'd say that being invaded by a foreign power is a loss in anyone's language -- even if the invasion ultimately resulted in the coherent, stronger confederation we see today. Switzerland isn't the first country to benefit from a little dose of invasion. Britain (and Switzerland) did pretty well from the Roman invasions and arguably, most former Bristish colonies are economically better off than their non-colonial neighbours (even if colonisation resulted in certain other disasters which will take centuries to rectify).

(Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham), I can assure you   
BTW there are so many very strong regional accents in France. And here in CH, a trained ear will quickly and clearly identify a Neuchatel from a Vaud, a Fribourg from a Valais or Genevan accent. I live near the Neuchatel / French Franche-Comté border, and the Franche-Comté (dept 25 Pontarlier) is just as strong and slow as Neuchatel, but with a totally different emphasis- hilarious.

And i would NEVER put ""honest"" and ""tax paying"" in the same sentence!! Thats just absolute rubbish!!!          I am not sure that drugs is so much the problem, as is breaking into cars & houses, petty crime.  For drugs you need contacts and a network. I'd say that the locals were more into this. 
My neighbour swears that since That House has been filled with Those People.. well, there were 20 beak-ins into cars last weekend alone!!   
As for that other stuff. That is something that will never be in the paper, due to the nature of the beast.  But you can see it in their eyes.        Aren't stereotypes fantastic? 
1) don't take the headphones off the blonde, she'll forget to breathe 
2) all blokes are hung like horses 
3) if he's chinese, he must be hard working    
Hate everyone equally, i always say....

176	Swiss news via The Local	Swiss-bashing hits new highs in EU: ambassador		4,893	22	Location: Zurich	04.06.2012, 12:13	" 
			
			I find it hard to believe that the Swiss government believed that there would be no response from the EU over their new immigration restrictions.  Certainly there will be intense pressure for a response within the EU from the nations who will suffer from the quotas, and this is a core piece of EU ideology.     
When you have the economic upper-hand like the EU, you can afford to impose ideological policy; in Switzerland's position, you're left with the pragmatism of trying not to get your arm twisted too hard.    
As in all its dealings involving adopting EU regulations, Switzerland has to make a decision as to the payoff between the cost of implementation versus keeping its major trading partner on favourable terms.  Economically, Switzerland needs the EU more than vice versa, so generally they are forced take the hit in return for the market access they need to survive - the potential cost of non-compliance is just too high.  Switzerland has to pick its fights carefully, in those areas where it would otherwise have most to lose.    
However, I'm not convinced Switzerland have picked their fight very well here - the imposition of the quota on this relatively insignificant group of people has relatively little to gain economically compared to what the EU could impose in revenge.  If they were talking about entirely rewriting their immigration relationship with the EU, then it might have been a fight worth fighting - but at the moment, the Swiss government are probably relieved that currently they are receiving only criticism and not action.

202	Swiss news via The Local	'Blessing' not to be in EU: Swiss poll		3,435	55	Location: Zurich	24.05.2012, 11:53	" 
			
			I really don't understand the negativity towards the EU (the Euro yes). Most (if not every) country in the EU has benefited from it in some way or another. Now I admit that not every country would but that I guess is a reason for not joining in the first place. Have to weigh the pro's and the cons.   
There is a lot of negativity towards the Eu at the moment and that is normal with the catastrophe that the Euro has become. I acknowledge that some people have reservations about how it is run but that's par for the course with any large organisation.      If there is an opt out clause than it is not an obligation to EU membership and thus not mandatory. I'm sure the EU in general would prefer if the Euro was adopted but that's the beauty of democracy, people make their own decisions.      I don't understand your point here in regards to the Lisbon Treaty. The people of the EU (or their elected representatives) ratified the Lisbon Treaty in all member states.      Would you care to expand on this and explain your reasoning. I'm honestly curious what it is about the EU that made it preferable to live elsewhere.      I don't know but who wouldn't want access to a market with 700 million people. I'm sure there are plenty of countries who would still love to join (and I guess will) once things settle down again. While I'm confident the EU (and the Euro) will survive, what shape it's in by the end I'm guessing will be different than what it is now. Just my opinion however and I have nothing to back it up with.      The thing about democracy is that people can just keep saying no and then vote in another crowd during the next elections who don't ask the question. If they no longer ask however and just go ahead and do to it as you seem to be insinuating then indeed the EU has a major problem.    
What advantages are there for the Euro to fall apart for the countries who have adopted it. The Euro in principle is a great idea it's just the implementation which left a lot to be desired in my opinion.    
In regards to the EU and dictating rather than negotiating I don't see the problem (well in general). The EU attempts to look after its own citizens and interests as a priority over others, what country or similar organisations don't? To me it just makes sense.     
For the record (in case you haven't guessed by now  ) I'm very much pro EU however I don't say that everything the EU does is good. It has its flaws but its the job of it's citizens to try to rectify that just as in any other country.

Third, progress in the region, in spite of some ""disturbances"" will reduce the problems a bit   
Add to this, that whomever for whatever political reasons deserts from his army will also in future be  and so still will be within the rules of asylum against political persecution,     
Which means that the new law will be a lot of paper and a lot of hot air

249	Swiss news via The Local	Racism rife in Switzerland: human rights chief		15,700	280	Location: Zurich	29.03.2012, 11:06	"    I would disgree with that.   
Switzerland has accepted its status as a multicultural and multilingual country at a much earlier point in history than any other country I can think of. It was until Mitterand came to power that the French government was awkwardly ignoring the very existence of such minority languages and cultures as Breton and Basque. In the UK Welsh did not start gaining any official recognition until about the 1980s and Scottish Gaelic still has no legal recognition today. As recently as post WW2, ethic cleansings in Eastern Europe led to the expulsion of ethnic Germans from places like the Sudetenland and Poland. Even today, Spain and Belgium are struggling to remain united countries due to groups that were oppressed in recent history distrusting the new staus quo and wanting their own countries (and who knows how long Scotland will remain part of the UK?). In comparison, Switzerland has enjoyed a long period of comparative peace between the linguistic and cultural groups in the country. There have not always been sunflowers and rainbows but disputes were mostly solved in an amicable way. To say Switzerland doesn't get multiculturalism is misrepresting history in a big way.

			There are a lot of expensive hotels in Switzerland, but I do not agree with the comment in the article saying that it lacks budget accommodation. It does in Zurich/Geneva and top resorts - but there is a lot of great but simple budget accommodation in some stunning areas (see example above).  
We use Freedreams and stay for 3 nights for 2 people in some great locations for 85CHF - but yes we have to take one meal in house. 14CHF per night isn't bad is it? Not many in towns in Switzerland- although a 4* hotel is available in Lugano - 14CHF per night!!!   
I've used hotels.com - to book hotels in Sharm-elSheik , Tenerife and South of Spain. Most people using the site will be booking for stays in such places - no wonder!

Yes Basel can ko Bayern,FCB have a very good team,especially in the attacking department.   
But,if i was to bet i would go for Bayern to go through,say 3 0 tonight,so 3 1 over the two games.   
For European football in general,it would make a nice and healthy change to see the Swiss and Cypriot Champions in the last 8.

368	Swiss news via The Local	New investors eye Servette rescue		509	1	Location: Zurich	02.03.2012, 12:03	"    First of all, I hope that Servette-Genève and Xamax-Neuchâtel get rescued in the end.    
Do not be mistaken, there were similar things about those clubs in Luzern and Aarau, and Grasshoppers and FCZ in Zürich are only minimally better off !  The only football club who might survive minimally commercially is the FCB of Basel    
There not only are many different sports in Switzerland, but most of all, there are too many local/regional football clubs around here. Would all those local FCs in Zürich merge into either FCZ or GC, those clubs would be saved. They could maintain local ""subdivisions"" for training facilities of course.    
FCZ and GC a few years ago have merged in regard to icehockey. The result is good but not overwhelming.

He quite obviously simply wanted to stop the bus from crashing. The word ""hero"" may not be exactly correct, but is possibly the best term availabe.    
There is a difference between the two ""heroes"". This young man acted with an incredibly swift reaction and deciseness, while the ""hero pilot"" saved those 250 people by employing his professional abilities.    
Neither wanted to be a hero, but both did what needed to be done at the right time. If they got praised as ""heroes"" so be it.    
What I do not really like are ""Winkelrieds"", chaps who go into death ""heroically"" just to save others.    
The young man stated to be soooo sad that he could not do anything for the driver. He before departure had spoken with the driver about the four children of the man, and deeply felt with the berieved children

I hope petroplus survives and keeps working its important Neuchâtel refinery.

I suppose the kids will be OK finding babysitters for the next few years!

601	Swiss news via The Local	Why Swiss gun love is coming under fire		643	2	Location: Zurich	05.01.2012, 16:26	"    Maybe, but that rate will /would hardly drop due to more anti-weapons laws. More important is that people realize that the present regulations were introduced in times when A) there usually was at least one member of the household around mostly or often throughout the day, and when the place of work of the weapons-holder was less than 5 kilometers away from home. What IS needed is that the soldiers have the possibility to deposit their weapons Monday to Friday and also on Saturdays (between 9am and 6pm) and to take them over from Monday to Saturday between 9am and 6pm), and this without much ado and in many places (places less than 5 km away from home). The last proposal which was recjected did NOT include much help for the soldiers but mostly restrictions. Any new proposal also has to include the interests of the Shooting Associations which are very powerful outside the cities.    
Strangely enough, both supporters and adversaries of the proposal last time suffered of the impression that most Swiss soldiers WANTED to have that weapon at home, which is rubbish. True however is that most Swiss soldiers do NOT want to first travel an hour and then  to queue for two hours and fill out endless forms just to deposit or take back that piece of shit.

740	Swiss news via The Local	Brutal killing sparks army gun debate		4,868	109	Location: Zurich	09.11.2011, 17:58	"    Statistically, you're wrong. In both the US and in Switzerland, auto related deaths per 100,000 people outnumber gun related deaths per 100,000 people by a factor of 2-3. The difference is in Switzerland, most gun related deaths are suicides whereas in the US half are suicides and half are homicides. Thus, in CH, you're more likely to get run over by a banker late for a very important meeting or someone driving while texting than you are to get shot by someone. It's cute the way you defend all things Swiss but you should at least be backing up your claims with facts.

they at CS already use the past-tense to speak about new strategies.  Their CEO Brady W Dougan and his team are possibly a step further than Ermotti and his folks.

The deflationary preassures remain, partly because the franc is still overvalued against the euros and import prices keep lowering (albeit not as much as they should) as contracts are renegotiated, and beacuse the swiss national bank has not been printing any franc so far to fight against investors who would try to break the 1.2 barrier, as they simply haven't dared to try to fight the central bank's aim, in fact the exchange rate has not even approached 1.2 since then, staying above 1.22 for most of the time (notice that right now it's 1.23). Why should we head into a major inflation? There is not reason for that to happen.

In case you haven't noticed: The Eurozone's problems go way beyond Greece. Italy's on the brink, Portugal, Spain and Ireland aren't in great shape either, France is in danger of getting downgraded, the EFSF is basically full of hot air, German people are getting angrier day by day, etc.   
The peg would make sense if this were some temporary overvaluation of the Swiss Franc but unfortunately the current situation is much more serious.

im quite the lefty multikulti tolerant sort of person, generally speaking, but there are two things which bring out my Inner Fascist  : Vandalism and Holliganism. I wish such acts were dealt with with treatments like public floggings and putting people in cages hanging off of bridges for a few days.    
i have more sympathy for thieves (who at least have a rational motive) for their crimes; theyre desperate or poor or addicted to drugs or whatever. People who just for no reason destroy property, which benefits noone (not even the perp) or who go to sporting events just to get drunk and have a go at others should be rather severely and corporally punished, in my humble armchair fascist opinion.

You pick up the lady from nearby, drive in, do the business in relative comfort, drop the lady off and take the mess home with you. It protects the lady from the customer, but not from the pimp.    
There are probably police cameras watching out for dangerous situations, so if anyone is murdered they have the car number plate and the driver on video.

			I fail to understand how those figures are found. 
To get a precise idea, you would need to compare the comparable.   
The world's richest country does not = the highest consumer purchasing power.. or does it ?   
The Big Mac index seems more relevant in assessing a population's wealth (or lack of) via the purchasing power per capita.   
Seems to me that once you take in consideration the high cost of living (rent food, insurance etc), people are not wealthy at all, just average.... or at least not the common mortals.

			Dear Mabern - I apologize for misunderstanding your remarks....  Call ME paranoid!     
As I just joined, I didn't realize that threads on this site regarding gun ownership were frequent and getting harder to stomach - Good heavens - I didn't think there WERE any gun ownership ""issues"" there!  So much for what I know....  Gun control is a HUGE issue here in the US these days, so finding an article on gun ownership being on the rise in Switzerland of course immediately aroused my curiosity.   
My name really IS Heidi and my Great-Grandparents were from Einsiedeln.  Hoping to get over for an extended stay in the future.   
Joining this group is a small reconnaissance mission on my part.  Info about learning Einsiedeln's Swiss German dialect is what I'm shooting for.  (FORGIVE the pun - he he - sorry, couldn't resist.  )  Do I understand correctly that it is its own language?

			While absence is absence for an employer, obviously, being home due to being incapacitated through labor and all, and taking a few weeks off every year to go shooting and boot camping is incomparable. Those are two completely different country services..Army here gives you great opportunity to network, career-wise. Staying out of work to take care of babies gives you nada, career-wise. I just cannot see maternity through uber pragmatic filter. I think it is a societal duty to take care of their moms and babes. And not push moms to work too early, but also enable moms to go reconnect with their career. I would fix day care situ first, since it is just blackmailing families, then offer better maternity leave and paternity, too.
