0	Concerts	"Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"""	Yokine	147999	1100	Perthia	06.05.2009, 16:20	"    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....      "	1233	 Mar 2006	5.0	['1', '1']	['901', '444']	6

			I want to go out with my girlfriend tonight and watch some live music but it's being very hard to find anything.   
I've been asking around and checking on Google/FB but the only thing I could find is a pop concert in Moods, but those CHF30 for an artist I don't know seem a bit excessive. Either way I'll keep the idea as a last option.   
Anyone else has any tips about where to find some live music tonight? I'm up for pretty much anything of a reasonable quality and not too extreme ( jazz, blues, pop, rock, indie, ...)

			He's definitely not an 80.- artist. Yeah it all sounds the same, but people are prepared to pay in Switzerland, I guess. The problem is that many of the great world music stars don't stop off here so often, I guess its the cost of touring in Switzerland is so much higher then the rest of Europe, that they can't be bothered.

Martin Hennig - Clemens Klopfenstein - Marcus P. Nester - Christoph Geiser 
Die Lunte   
Die Autoren Martin Hennig, Clemens Klopfenstein, Marcus P. Nester und Christoph Geiser lesen aus ihren neuen Büchern, moderiert von Sabrina Habel.       
Christoph Geiser: ""Da bewegt sich nichts mehr"" - Erzählungen   
Drei Mordfälle, einer in Leipzig, einer in Berlin, eine Mordserie in Australien. Täter, aber kein schlüssig erklärbares Motiv. Geiser, der Erzähler ist immer nahe dabei, er scheint selbst gefährdet. Als Rechercheur versucht er herauszufinden, was hinter den Morden steckt. Entstanden sind drei anspielungsreiche Texte, die das Material der angeblich die Wahrheit vermittelnden Medienberichte aufnehmen, sie sprachkritisch zerlegen und der Frage nachspüren: Was war wirklich? Bis auch die mediale „Wahrheit“ sich immer mehr auflöst.       
Martin Hennig: ""Teufel, Mestre und Madonna"" - Novelle   
Mathieu verliert sein Herz an Sarah, die  Moderatorin der Wettersendung „Räge, Blitz und Sunneschtrahl“. Die Aussichten für die junge Liebe scheinen, trotz einiger hartnäckiger Nebelschwaden, sehr gut zu sein. Doch dann verliert Mathieu seinen Job und dann die Kontrolle über sein Auto. Tödlich verunfallt, landet er in einer anderen Welt, die ihren ganz eigenen Gesetzen folgt. Auch Sarahs Welt verändert sich, als sie sich auf die Suche nach Mathieu begibt. Es scheint, der Teufel habe seine Hand im Spiel. Aber gibt es den Teufel überhaupt? Eine Erzählung voller überraschender Wendungen und ironischer Pointen, mit blitzenden Dialogen und einem sunneschtrahlenden Surrealismus.        
Clemens Klopfenstein: ""Als ich meine Filme stahl - Das ganze Geständnis""   
""Clemens Klopfenstein ist für uns der unabhängige Filmemacher par excellence - kreativ, temperamentvoll, fantasiereich, humorvoll, dem Experiment aufgeschlossen. Die Lust auf das Abenteuer und die Erkundung des Fremde, Exotischen, aber auch die selbstkritische Observierung des Nahen, Vertrauten und Bekannten sind Klopfensteins Grundmotive. Und immer gibt es bei ihm eine Ebene der Ironie, der Doppeldeutigkeit, des Spiels mit Nuancen.""   
(Aus einem Beitrag des Filmhistorikers Ulrich Gregor)       
Marcus Nester ""Sturzgefahr"" - Krimi-Erzählungen   
Der Basler Autor landete mit der ""Migros - Erpressung"", zusammen mit Clemens Klopfenstein, einen frühen Erfolg und schrieb für die Krimi-Reihe Tatort. Nesters hier vorgelegte Erzählungen handeln von Menschen, die sich in Gefahr begeben und darin umkommen - oder fast. Die Grenzen zwischen Opfer und Täter sind fließend: Bei einem übereifrigen Steuerbeamten und einem fast unbescholtenen Steuerzahler, bei einem allzu gerissenen Zürcher Politiker und seiner unehelichen Tochter und bei einem Ehepaar, das von gegenseitigem Misstrauen so zerfressen ist, dass es den äußeren Horror erst bemerkt, als es zu spät ist.

I got taken as a guest a couple of times and watching them practice is really interesting, as you get to understand the sort of stuff a conductor watches out for, stops the music, explains something, and makes them do it again. It makes you apprecaite the work that goes into producing a concert, but also some of the finer points of musical listening and interpretation that as a musical philistine, I would never have picked up by myself.   
There were only about four people besides us so it was quite an experience having a full orchestra perform for such a handful.

Downsides:  
1. The program was only in German, although one of the three choreographers is an American, and another (the Israeli) was educated in the US (at Julliard) and is married to an American. 
2. This program was FOR SALE for CHF 9!!!!

Top of the bill is Deep Purple for rocking moments and ""Smoke on the Water of Lake Constance"". The Baseballs concludes the first night.

As the release of  s third album nears,   and   are offering up another taste of   with new track  LP   is due out on     & the band are set to tour across Europe this spring.   
Whereas debut single,  featured West Coast punk vibes,   presents a cosmic trucker boogie and recognizes no journey is possible without being on the road.          was written entirely during  an evolving phase for Moon Duo. It was a rare and uneasy rest period,  devoid of the constant adrenaline of performing live and the stimulation  of traveling through endless moving landscapes. This offered Moon Duo a  new space to reflect on all of these previous experiences and cradle  them while cultivating the album in the unfamiliar environment of a new  dwelling; a dark Portland basement. It was from this stir-crazy fire  that   was forged.   
Catch the three-piece Moon Duo band    (guitars),   (keys) and   (drums) -- all over the U.S. and Europe beginning at the end of this month.

Date: 20:00-23:00, 24th October 2014 
Location: Volkhaus Zurich     There is so much  to do in the little big city of Zurich. You can hear some great Celtic  music and Gaelic folk songs with Irish whiskey at its best. This Irish  folk concert provides a close experience with Irish music including the  Irish bagpipes which are different than the Scottish bagpipes. The Irish  folk music is wonderful. Musically, the old Gaelic songs sound elvishly  lovely -- to me like a song far over the horizon.

			Copenhagen based Il Tempo Gigante, alias Rolf Hansen, creates an air of hushed intensity through a virtuosic and highly original use of loops, guitar and voice. His elegant spider web like compositions are imbued with melodic durability and stands out in their fascinating offbeat arrangements that gently, but determined, oppose every tendency to idealization. 
With a distinctive guitar playing style and epic lyrics he carries the listener into all kinds of human experience and theres often a presence on stage that makes a very thin line between sender and receiver.

			Good job! That was a reasonable outcome/loss, and hopefully made someone happy. We were looking at the people watching/listening from their windows rather pleasantly surprised by the evening's entertainment.   
Funny how ""first gig"" memories stick - my daughter's was Birdy at the Forum (Kentish town) this last March - we worked our way to the front and had a great evening, more so because it is such a small venue and the audience was there for her and her band. We just missed her in Zürich last February (was happening the eve I found out and was sold-out, Lausanne as well) so I did some quick searching to see when we might catch her next. I really hope she is well-managed and doesn't get exploited as teen-star because she is truly talented and must find the on-the-road life a bit overwhelming at times. Birdy (17) is clearly younger than her band members, but one senses they really communicate through the music and have a good time. The cellist is awesome, the mellow tone that richens the bass and with different bow techniques adds to the rhythm is quite special. I highly recommend catching them live!   
Amy MacDonald and Birdy on the same evening would have made up for the smokers  But that is the tactics of programming.

			The Sudhaus has an open stage night on the last Sunday of each month. It is quite fun. I got up and did something last year. It was quite fun.      
Contact   to register in advance. He is a nice guy and he speaks English. He does magic and introduces the acts. You could win a small prize if the audience like you. They have a clapometer.   
Best of luck

			Yes! Nels Cline is a long time trippy guitarist from Los Angeles. 
I'm sure you know he is the guitarist and band member many years now in the band Wilco...   
Both Nels and his talented brother drummer,percussionist  Alex Cline used to be heavily influenced by Frank Zappa in Los Angeles;and used to play together a lot in the little avant-guard scene.   
Alex has performed in Switzerland as well,and is also featured on some CDs with an old friend,band mate of mine John Wolf  Brennan, an amazing tasty composer Swiss/Irish pianist,organist,melodica player;based out of Weggis Switzerland. 
(I was the guitarist with his brother Peter Wolf in the Swiss progressive rock band called Flame Dream)   
That for suresy must have been a mega ahhsome performance Paul !

Was checking out the Zurich opera house website and came across this. Seems to be a interesting line up. Different programs from 22 to 27 April for the opening of Sechseläutenplatz. A movie on Paul Potts, Circus, Boog Shoot, Concerts (Bryn Terfel) etc

			Or buy cheapest ticket category to the opernhaus for mid-week performances and then hope to switch seats during the interval (a Swiss friend confirmed that this was socially acceptable   ) - mid-week best as a lot of people with subscriptions don't turn up.   
As an aside, not all 35chf category tickets have a bad view... just don't get the furthest rows at the back nor the extreme edges and you should be fine!

Loved the last set he did in Zurich. The audience was under strict instructions not to applaud between pieces or after the set (before the break) and he came shuffling on stage like he was attending a funeral wearing the most absurdly over the top cap.   
He's so melodramatic    
I'm hoping as he's just released a 'greatest hits' that he might be covering some of his older repertoire. I'd like to hear some of his older stuff again from Poses.

Prefer their early work to their new stuff, but still really enjoy listening.   
Surprised that there are still tickets left as so many of their tour dates in Europe have sold out.   
They are also playing in Zurich on Monday 21st....tickets still available for that one too.

			Hello music friends in Basel!    
The Münsterkantorei Basel is a concert choir affiliated to the beautiful  Basel Minster and conducted by Annedore Neufeld, a very virtuous,  enthusiastic and highly professional lady. About 50 singers work on high  level sacred music from all epochs, a capella and with an orchestra.  
Rehearsals are usually on Wednesday night at the Bischofshof, right next to the Basel Minster.      . Some german knowledge is required for understandig the conductor   (understanding ""german german"" should do)   
On Wednesday, 4th of September, we will start rehearsing Bach's famous Christmas Oratorio (all six parts).  
Concerts will be on Dec 21 and 22 at the Basel Minster.   
If you are interested in joining this once in a lifetime experience  don't hesitate to contact me or just come to the  Bischofshof (address:  Rittergasse 1, Basel) at 7:30 pm on Wed 4th of September  (or any other  Wednesday). 
Especially people with some singing experience under age 50 and men are needed! 
Come and join! Don't be shy, give it a try!            "	6	 Feb 2013	0.0	['0', '0']	['2', '2']	0

			Hi everyone, there's the Verbier music festival starting this weekend.  
I really recommend this festival for lovers of classical music, its a real hidden gem with world-class acts and tons of activities and free concerts for all the family.

You don't half get about mate. As for gyms, I'm at Indigo fitness its other side of the water from claraplatz. There is one called Migros fitness near you which is a lot cheaper.   
I'd be well up for Maximo, their lead singer Paul Smith lived round the corner from me in Billingham, so wouldn't mind seeing hearing a good old Teesside accent.   
Hope you enjoyed Pickwicks the other night lad,

			Is anyone with a car going from Switzerland (preferably Zürich area or nearby) to the Bon Jovi gig in Stuttgart tonight?   
I can no longer go to the Zürich gig on 30th June, so am considering going to the Stuttgart one. I would prefer to return tonight, rather than stay over, but the last train back to Zürich leaves Bad Cannstadt at 22:11, and the gig will certainly still be going on at that time.   
If anyone happens to be going, please let me know, and I'll share transport costs.

			I went to several open air festivals in Switzerland a few years back and had a great time at them all. There are designated camping areas and depending on time of arrival you can be closer or farther from the festival itself- but even the farthest site wasn't far in my opinion.  Many of these are in the mountains so its a beautiful setting to enjoy in addition to the festival fun.  They seem to get larger every year but there are expected numbers on the respective websites.  I would highly recommend, however, they do sell out quickly and many have no more tickets available for this year.  If you have any specific questions feel free to PM me.

			Even though played in German it is going to be a big show.       
The open-air performance in the forecourt of the impressive Einsiedeln Benedictine monastery will take place from 21 June to 7 September with 600 people being involved in the theater production.   
""Taking up the tradition of the medieval mysterious plays,    by the Spanish writer Calderón de la Barca (1600 - 1681) was for the  first time performed in 1924 on the abbey square by the population of  Einsiedeln. Since then, the play has been staged every five years or so;  the last time in 2007.""   
It is a short, action-packed play in which entire lifespans of a  society  from king to beggar, rich merchant to peasant, are explored. God here is the omnipotent director, who appoints his stage manager,  The World, and selects his players and their roles (not individuals,  but archetypes). Then, in line with the doctrine of free will, he pushes  them on stage. From the cradle to the grave, theyre free to chart  their own choices; only then will the Supreme Being intervene again to  decide their ultimate fates.

			Bollywood singer available to perform in any Indian Cultural events on functions or festivals. He specializes in Kishore Kumar songs but sings other singers too. A perfect solo singer with no hassels of band and instruments. He sings with original tracks which need to be played. A perfect arrangement to add on a Cultural event or a Solo event too. All this is negotiable terms.

			We would like to invite you the first showing in Europe of Being Becoming winner of the excellence award at the New York Fringe Festival. Being Becoming is based on Bharatnatyam the dance of Gods .    
Being Becoming is a 75 minute Indian classical dance performance that explores an idea central to Hindu and Buddhist philosophies: that one can become the object of their devotion, meditation, or desire. Devotional transformation, or the idea of losing oneself or being consumed by the other, is extensively expressed in Indian traditions of poetry, music, painting, and dance. Each piece in Being Becoming explores the different ways in which the individual seeks to become one with the other, as well as traditional Indian theater techniques that enact the transformation from actor to character. Being Becoming is made up of five different pieces for solo, duet, and trio.     
For further information on Malini please consult the website:       
To register for the event and for specifics regarding the Geneva event, please consult the below website

Reservations: 
Tel. +41 (0) 55 210 51 54 or per e-mail       will be playing new, original compositions as well as selections from his two acclaimed solo albums in the four CD Art of Sound series.   
Known for  , Johns aim is to make the improvising sound like its been composed and the compositions as simple and direct as if theyve been improvised there and then. In addition he brings to jazz a love of wide dynamic range and different touch at the piano, something which can best be experienced in the solo format.   
As well as an interest in advanced harmony and rhythm, Johns compositions and playing also explore harmonic simplicity and straight grooves.   
John Law, a prize-winning classical prodigy on piano, turned away from classical piano studies to pursue jazz and improvised music when he was 23 and has been involved in, and acclaimed for, his work in a wide area of different jazz, as well as modern classical, projects: from solo piano albums based on plainchant through trio and quartet work covering the whole spectrum from freely improvised music through standard jazz repertoire and works by Thelonious Monk, right through to composing large scale works for his semi-classical ensemble Cornucopia.  
His three main current projects are the acclaimed trio Congregation, with Yuri Goloubev and Asaf Sirkis, his new trio Three Ways, exploring both jazz and classical music, with Yuri and Julian Argüelles and solo piano concerts.

Any idea who he'll be here with? I guess Devin Townsend is too much to ask for...   
Also, his site says it'll be at the Volkhaus.

			I've just noticed there is a planned concert of Ute Lemper in KKL hall, on November the 17th.  
Mrs. B. and myself are big fans of this extraordinary performer and I thought it would be an excellent opportunity for us to visit this hall for the first time. 
My question is regarding the floor plan, and I would appreciate if someone who visited there could tell me if row No. 3 on the parquet floor is much lower then the stage.  The lowest price category is for Reihe a,b then there is second category for Reihe 1-2.The third one is for Reihe 3 and 4.  
There are nice seats available in the center of Reihe 3.  
Generally we enjoy seating close to the stage and feel the ""sweat"" of the performers, but I was wondering if we would need to stretch our necks in order to watch the concert, which obviously would not make it fun. 
The next available seats are in Reihe 5, which is another price category.    
If anyone enjoys good cabaret, and would like to listen to THE BEST performer of Kurt Weill's music - come and join us!

Warteck PP - Burgweg 7 - 4058 Basel     
> Kasko is located on the second floor of the former brewery Warteck. You can use the metal stairs leading to the second floor (located at the rear of the small court at Burgweg 15). It is on the same floor as the restaurant Don Camillo. You can also come to us by entering the restaurant, we are located behind the door with the opaque glass.    
Michael Northam 
Over 20 years involved consistently with a self-taught style of sound-painting with a combination of electronic, acoustic and organic sound sources. 
Sound has been for Michael a primary artistic form to explore indeterminate states of perception and consciousness.  Provoking questions about what are the building blocks of human experience and exploring that with extended and suspended states provoked by intuitively 'tuned' sound fields. 
This working direction is a two decade refinement techniques to explore complex, but deeply patterned phenomena found in nature and how such 'stochastic' sources are the essential elements of our most intimate inner and outer tapestries of experience. 
Michael records from nature elemental sound materials from wind, water, plant material and incidental man-made phenomena - often where these elements interpenetrate each other.  Using these kinds of sounds he then practices in primitive-musical ways to imitate elemental phenomena with various instruments (percussive, electro-acoustic, acoustic) such as playing sea shells, bird calls, japanese pentatonic flute, resonating metal objects, etc.  Furthermore years of auto-dictactic acousmatic studio experience produces 'compost' of interwoven live and recorded materials into ever unfolding new works that been left behind over the past years as internationally published recordings and site-specific installations. Most recently a series of works entitled 'watchthingsgrow' which have been 8-channel aleatoric sound-works for Botanical Gardens. The work ""Frozen Illuminations"" has been presented on Radio Deutschland Kulture, last year, as well as, numerous self-published collector edition items on Michael's personal label OROGENETICS. 
Because of years of developing a personal sound, he is increasingly sought after for extremely precise and unique experiential sound-design for international dance, performance and cinematic projects.  Works premiering in Belgium, India, United States and Germany. 
Currently developing a project with Bavarian performance/installation artist Judith Egger concerning indeterminate states of consciousness.            
B°TONG 
B°TONG is Chris Sigdell, former member of the German experimental/industrial group NID (1995 - 2005). With B°TONG, he reaches for the nether regions of experimental electronic sound, and has established himself as an acknowledged experimental soundscape creator. So far he has shared the stage with such known artists as: B°TONG has appeared at festivals like Sinus-Series (Basel 2006), Ausklang (Hamburg 2006), Shift (Basel 2007 & 2008), Lab 30 (Augsburg 2009), and has performed on various radio stations. B°TONG has collaborated with other artists, is part of installations (Polarkreis & 95° by Brigitte Gierlich & Camilla Schuler), video-projects (Images by Ulrich Fischer), and does his own clips to assorted pieces of his musical catalog. The video to Sphere II was shown at the 2007 Miami Art Fair as part of the Urban Nomad film-festival; the videos to Black Dog Dream and 95° were shown in Beijing (Taiwan), and his latest, Fragile Package, made by a local video artist.   
The music is a choice of dark brooding layers of sound, high pitched tones, and weird electronic sounds that give birth to images of darkness and tranquility, the solitude of an icy polar night or the equivalent of an underwater journey into the bottomless pit. 
B°TONG uses samples from television, radio and film, and processes these on the computer with recordings of his voice and other. There are no instruments involved! In a live-situation Chris relies on instruments like microphone, metal-sheet, electric toys, and kitchen utensils. The sounds made with them are fed and put through various effect-pedals giving him that trademark sound.                   
The concert is kindly supported by Kaskadenkondensator.

You know how they do a different cultural theme each weekend, well this weekend it seems to be American/country music.  There was a cover band playing some old faves from Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and the like.  They even had a line dance group called ""Happy Boots"" which I kind of want to join!     Anywho, I was pretty delighted at the whole thing, and we are going back tonight because at 8pm there is a country singer from the US performing.  I don't remember his name, and I didn't recognize it when I saw it, but who cares.  Should be pretty nifty!  Anyone going to go too?  Come say hi!    "	104	 Aug 2009	3.0	['2', '1']	['36', '21']	2

			Hank Chinaski aka Charlie Bukowski, would have loved this band. He'd  been much obliged and honored by them, picking ""Barfly"" as the title for  their first studio album in 37 years. Rocket from the Tombs was founded  in 1974, burnt out in 1975 and their recorded work survived mainly in  the form of bootlegs. Some say, this Clevland band originated  'punk'.  (Wayne Kramer, Wayne County, Johnny Rotten, Sylvain Sylvain a.o. might  disagree...). Actually, so does founding member and Pere Ubu frontman,  . 'Punk' was nothing but a fad, he says. Shortlived and  destroyed by it's own (but unavoidable) gargantuan consumption of drugs  and alcohol, that would have made even Keith Richard blush. (Can you  just see that...)

			Yea.. we were there too, right down the front getting thrown about. These guys have allways been a big part of my music al influence really , I play in a Swiss ""rock"" band but we are all really old punk rockers at heart, Stranglers, Clash and Killing Joke being in the top 3. 
If you guys like KJ then for sure your gonna like us too ( ) our EP solid state nation comes out this weekend (28th) ..spotify, amazon and so on. 
We also play at Rock City in Uster on Saturday night & if anyone wants free tickets to our London Camden show on May the 11th, just ask, I got 30 comps for that night.   
So lets debate .. 
is KJ a punk or a rock band or where are they .. Post punk alternative maybe.

			Well, its got to be said again -   IS part of the royalty of real jazz festivals in Europe.   
This is not Montreux Jazz festival's little cousin; this is   on the Lac Leman.   
Cully Jazz Fest still has a heart and soul and vibe, unlike, IMHO, its bigger cousin/cousine east of it on the lake.   
Check out the program. Absolutely outstanding.   
This Jazz festival is going from strength to strength, year by year.       
And probably on the finest location of Lake Geneva too.   
Plenty of ""Off"" gigs in about 12-ish wine caves dotted around the wine village, besides the more head line gigs by some real jazz monsters.

412	Concerts	Anne Clark concerts Zurich	sbobwilliams	1178	0	Zurich	28.01.2012, 11:13	" 
			
			For more than thirty years Anne Clark has held a unique place in contemporary music.   
  Combining literary, socially engaged texts with innovative and  genre-breaking music, she has covered every kind of style, while at the  same time maintaining her own identity on each and every recording,  whether it be the samples (before sampling became a concept) and  electronically treated acoustics of The Sitting Room (1982), to the  ground-breaking analogue synth classics of Sleeper In Metropolis (1983) and Our Darkness (1984).   
  In 2011 Anne Clark and her long time pianist Murat Parkal contributed  an arrangement of the Charles Baudelaire poem Enivrez-Vous (Be Drunk) to  the audio book and radio play Die Künstlichen Paradiese, (Hörbuch  Hamburg/Radio Bremen). The project was further developed into a “live”  concept with a performance at the Volksbühne in Berlin.    
 After  public and critical acclaim the “duo” are now taking the project  further, collaborating with LordMasters artists collective in Zurich.   
  LordMasters is an independent collective of artists and performers who  have stepped out of the main stream to follow their own personal path,  and whose artistry comes from a keen observation of the world.   Consisting of artists coming from all parts of the world, dance, music,  film, visual arts or literature, each medium is an equally important  part of a more global work.    
  After responding to the worlds  system overload, the constant bombardment of information and societies  over consumption of everything… “Enough” is an intimate concert  stripping back to the raw elements of music, words and movement.

			Hi all. 
Just to add some more info about finding Metal shows - have a look at this website:    
I saw this website advertised in the Volkshaus when I went to the Eluveitie fest and it shows a lot of upcoming Metal shows such as Judas Priest, Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, Steel Panther, Mastodon, Tarja Turunen (ex-Nightwish) and if you like the more Rock/Nu-Metal scene then there is 3 Doors Down, Korn, Black Stone Cherry, and more.  
Check it out!     
ALSO!!! 
Anyone into Metal should know about the Sounddock 14 club. It's a small club (but very intimate) in Dietikon with a lot of great band performing regularly and a generally good atmosphere. You can buy CDs, merch, and sometimes ""Viking"" stuff like honey wine, drinking horns, etc. outside. Keep up with it at:      "	122	 Nov 2009	3.0	['7', '2']	['30', '18']	1

			I was there and it was amazing! Pieces presented in Alhambra were created and performed as multichannel spatial ""music"". Technical equipment of Alhambra was on very high level so the effect of spatial reproduction was enormous. I will not comment particular interprets since this would be subjective. In general I can say that concerts in Alhambra offered unique experience in terms of featured artists as well as quality of sound reproduction.

He plays a very interesting mix of funk, punk, jazz, and rock that is undeniably all New Orleans. I caught his show at Montreux this year, and believe me you do not want to miss this show. Of every set I attended at the New Orleans Jazz fest last year, his was by far the most attended. He is our pride and we simply adore him in New Orleans. He got his nickname because when he started playing the trombon it was bigger than him. He is an amazing talent backed by an equally talented band.

I write some of my own songs and we also play cover versions of blues, classic rock and funk stuff.

			Anyone up for some good honest sleazy rock n roll in Pratteln on the 7th of December?   
Sister are the exciting newcomers on the Swedish Sleaze and Grunge Metal scene, and they are promised to be supporting German heavy metal legends UDO on their European tour this year in December.    
Sister, who are the prodiges of Martin Sweet of Crashdïet - a Swedish sleaze staple and cult favorite since the early 2000s - combine dirty guitar riffs with gritty vocals and ever so slightly cheesy, anthemic lyrics, and they promise to be a grand old show. My favorite songs from the album are: 
Bullshit & Backstabbing ( ) 
and 
Werewolves on Blackstreet ( )       
As for UDO and Sister Sin - I can't really speak for them much, except that UDO must have been doing something right to last this long.      
I will probably be reviewing this concert anyways, but I always appreciate company at the bar! Anyone up for a grungey night out in Pratteln?

			We just took our two older children (12 and 9) to Cats in Zurich.   
It was awesome.    
Our son was a little embarrassed when the doorman told him he had to check his backpack into the cloakroom - but we followed the instructions and discovered that they issue booster seats to short kids! - 10chf deposit and you get your money back when you return the booster at the end of the show.   
We took back row seats, which meant we could sit up as high as we wanted and wiggle to the music without bothering anyone...   
Oh, and during intermission 'Old Deuteronomy' sat on stage and we were allowed to have our photo taken with him !   
Unfortunately the final show is tomorrow, and it'll sell out - but we are thinking it might be worth saving up for the 'Thriller' show which is scheduled for Basel before Christmas and Zurich just after.   
The venue was Hardturm-Areal, in the big tent. And it was fully heated too!     
Absolutely fantastic !

			hello,   
i'm not sure if this is the right place to post but maybe someone who checks this area would find this of interest.  i'm 30 and recently moved to zurich from the US where i was very active in writing, recording, and performing music.   i sing, play guitar, bass, and keyboards.   i'm poking around for a musician to collaborate with.  i'm looking for someone specific..... either...   
1) someone who has a lot of experience making electronic music as well as music production who would be willing to collaborate in writing and recording together.  i have particular strengths in writing melodies, lyrics, and arrangments.  i'm looking for someone who likes to tweak and experiment with sounds who could help to flesh out the sonic environment the songs would inhabit... influences along these lines would be....the faint, new order, the cure (early period), cut copy, passion pit, joy division, depeche mode   
OR   
2) someone who is a multi-instrumentalist, capable of switching from piano to guitar to trumpet to cello etc.  the idea would be to perform songs that i've previously written and/or potentially come up with some new material.    music would be more singer-songwriter in the vein of bright eyes, the good life, elliott smith, etc.   
if you think you might fall into either of these categories or if you may know someone who does, feel free to drop me a line.   
many thanks,

Went to the Bernex country music festival tonight...what a great place.  Listened to some good music - some Zydeco, a little Bluegrass, some good bands singing some (to me) familiar songs in both English and Franglish....    
It looks to be going in tomorrow as well.

Lukather has taken him under his wing and invites him to play with him whenever he has gigs in Europe- lucky Matthieu. (he is home taught and I teach him English and German). Steve has invited him to LA when he has finished his studies. He's also done master classes with Guthrie Govan.

Crowd looked like a ghosts convention all swaying to the music with clear waterproofs on...very spooky   
Highlight was two male streakers walking nonchalantly through the crowd having a general chat until security caught up with them.   
Can you guess what was the only thing Security had to dress them in when caught????   Yes a clear waterproof each..sort of defeated the object of covering them up!

I went to the Basel tatto office with no expectation that they would change tickets for us but they did!!  And the new tickets were in cheaper seats and they refunded the tickets.  Worth a try.  The office is now in front of the Kaserne.

Here is my rating (and sorry I didn't reply earlier in the week, didn't see the post): 
-Night Ranger was ok, at least they had a bit of connection with the audience 
-Saga: disappointed. I felt them distant. No   (difficult to play, maybe that's why),   or  , my three favorites! 
-Kansas: Fantastic 
-Foreigner: superb! I was hungry for more. Loved  ! 
-Journey: worthy our three-hours trip to the concert! I am not too much into  , so not a miss for me. Don't stop believin' was just too good! and the finishing with   was perfect (btw   is with Steve Perry as solo singer, not part of the Journey repertoire, so I am afraid it will be a bit difficult to have that one  ). Arnel Pineda simply revived the band. Agree too many new songs (three too many!  ), but I guess, that is a good thing (although am with you, not the best!)     
Grade: A++ for less than a 100CHF it was a real bang for our buck!

While I agree it really is very personal and some find classical through pop or rock, some the other way around, it does not hurt to try and expose. I wouldn't try too hard and too obviously, though, since it is a turn off for teens, fo sho. Nonchalantly try.      
You can also have a teen who will do anything to be different than his stereotypical teen peers. Some teens so go for being different, what ever it means. If you play it right, exposing them to classical might be exactly the difference (the new uncool and untrendy) they will opt for to make themselves stick out of the blob. I enjoyed classical, but also appreciated help I got from others in terms of interesting choice to experiment with (parents, teachers, music classes, gigs, etc.).

			Hi everyone, I'm putting this under daily life because it's such short notice and perhaps more eyes will see this.    
Tomorrow, Sunday, Dec 5, I will give a free concert at the Sacre-Coeur Church in Basel, on Feierabendstrasse. The name of our baroque ensemble is ""Les Fabulists"" and we will be playing a short program of pre-Classical oboe sonatas from little-known composers from Italy, France, and England. The program won't be very long and is really suited to a lazy Sunday, as we'll be playing at 11:30 AM, after the mass. Just perfect for the time right between your first and second breakfasts.   
As mentioned, the concert is free (though donations are gratefully accepted), and is an easy way to get some culture into your diet! No need to RSVP, just show up if you're in the area. Hope to see some of you there. Go ahead and introduce yourself if you do decide to come.

			Dear All,   
I got a chance to attend this very well organized concert/festival by  Union Basel   . The Festival was celebrated with both Indian community residing in Basel as well as the local admirers of Indian culture and dance forms.   
The Festival started with Pooja ""Worshiping Godess Lakshmi ""The Godess of Wealth and Prosperity"" followed by some great Indian dance forms by the students and team of this organization having participants from both Indian as well Swiss society. After many classical dances there was also a much awaited ""Bollywood themed "" dances as well....the performers have done a great job with the last dance wherein they danced with lighted lamps in the hand.   
A very enjoyable evening indeed !!   
Wish you all a very Happy Diwali, 
Vik

Thought I would feedback about a recommended artist as I found the original link to the Zurich music scene here in the first place    
I went to see a lady called Lesley Meguid play a set at La Catrina last week, and she was brilliant! She's half American, half Swiss, sings in English and if you like live acoustic sets you should give her a look. She plays there again tomorrow (20/07/2010), see link below. You can probably find her on Myspace too if you wanted to hear her style of music before committing       "	49	 Jan 2010	2.0	['2', '1']	['37', '13']	1

			My name is Brandy. Some of you may know may because I used to run the Zuerich Open Mic.    
On August 25th, I will be premiering my new program with my band Chamber Soul in the Kaufleuten's summer sound series. We, chamber soul, are a trio composed of voice, trombone and guitar. The idea is to take a classical chamber approach to modern pop/soul music.    
In our new program we have invited the world famous string arranger Larry Gold to write arrangements of our songs. Larry is the man behind not only the ""Philadelphia Soul sound"", but has written string arrangements for everyone from Justin Timberlake, to Kanye West, to Al Green.   
The amazing local Galatea quartet will be joining us to play these arrangements.   
Chamber Soul puts on a great show, and have been written as "" a great band that presents a magical concert evening that feels more like dinner with great company.""     
Check us out at Chambersoul.ch   
Id love to see you all there!

			I went (For the second time), great little festival but I won't be going again! For the two headline acts, The Strokes and Kasabian, they dropped the volume to about half of what it had been during the day. We were about 50 metres from the stage and we could talk to each other without raising our voices. Totally ruined what should have been two mind blowing acts. Real real shame, which was second only to the disappointment of watching England get a thrashing from the Germans on the last day of the festival!

			At Stevie Wonders last concert in North Korea the crowd were so ecstatic thay began to shout out asking for requests.    
 It just so happend that Kim Jong-il (a massive Stevie Wonder fan BTW) was in the crowd. Excited and overjoyed he shouts out ""Do ah jazz chord""    
 So Stevie, amazed at the leaders request, plays a ten minute solo on the keyboard and the crowd goes wild.   
Kim Jong-il, now looking a little confused shouts out again ""no, no do ah jazz chord!"" Stevie, loving the enthusiasm of Kim Jong-il, decides to oblidge and plays yet another jazzy number. once complete, again Kim Jong-il, now a looking a little angry, shouts out AGAIN ""NO, No, No do a jazz chord! damit""- tired of this Stevie says ""Look man, how about you come up here and do it yourself if you're not happy!""    
 Kim Jong-il jumps on the stage, grabs the mike from Stevie and begins to sing ""ah jazz chord, to say, I love you""...

			Yep that's this Saturday. Almost a year after they played last in Switzerland, they are back to put on another blazing show. This time at Fri-Son in Freiburg. Tickets are only 22 CHF (25 with the starticket service charge).   
I would  classify the music as electronic but without computers, samplers as all  of the music is played live with keyboards and guitar pedals, drums.  Definitely one of the best live shows I've ever been too and I will  definitely be going to this one.   
Here's some examples of their stuff (check out Lovely Allen) from their  myspace page (the link gets filtered, but it should be the first thing that pops up on a google search).   
If anyone is interested in other details or the music appeals to anyone and folks are interested in  coming along PM me.

------------------------------------------------------------   
Upstart Entertainment Presents       Auditions on May 25, 2010 from 6:30 p.m. (venue will be announced on registration) 
  This new musical weaves together the songs of Jacques Brel in a trip around the world. Brel was an accomplished sailor and aviator who dreamed of one day making a trip spanning the globe. Brels World uses his music to take the audience on the journey that Brel himself never made. 
  Jacques Brel is a Belgian singer-songwriter who was active in the 1950s and 60s and into the 70s. He died in 1979 at the age of 49. His songs draw on the French chanson and troubadour traditions while also blending in pop music. His lyrics span a wide range of feelings and emotions. They are romantic, loving, tough, cynical, hopeful. 
  Cast of Brels World: Strong characters who can portray the depth of Brels lyrics and verse.     The songs will be sung in four languages, the narration and dialogue is mostly in English The cast will be required to sing in English, French, German and Dutch.  
  For the auditions, please prepare one Jacques Brel song plus a song of your own choosing. In addition, you will be asked to deliver a monologue of your own choosing. Your choice of audition material should reflect your major strengths. Previous knowledge of Brel is not required although an affinity would be an advantage. 
  A list of songs from Brel's World is available on request.

			I mentioned Nyon as that is the closest town and I didn't think ""in the middle of a cow pasture near Nyon"" would fit in the title.   
I never go to hear an actual band, usually just to hang out and eat at the stalls, and laugh at the Milk stand... and sometimes there is a not very well known band that surprises me    
You have to buy a ticket to go in, there are is no free stuff outside the gates like at Montreux Jazz or Cully.   
There is a bus-shuttle from the Nyon train station to the festival grounds.  You can also drive, though if you don't get there early enough you have to walk almost the same distance as from the train.

			The Underground Sessions steps it up a gear with 2 fantastic musicians. There have been a lot of changes at the venue and there will be a few more before this gig but rest assured that this is going to be a defining moment for the Sessions. 
Mark Kelly is a fantastic singer/songwriter originally from Manchester but currently residing Swiss side we are really excited to have him play, a real honour! 
Joining him will be the elusive James Carrington, he pulled a little on the line but we finally managed to reel him in to play for definate this time! His music has been used in such shows as Smallville and E.R. and he is signing to a major label too! He flys over from London exclusively to play this night! 
All in all an amazing night of acoustic pleasure awaits ...... look forward to seeing you all there, 
all love

Considered one of the best interpretors of Chopin, Schubert and Mozart's music, she is a poet amongst many musicians. She is also famously reclusive and her concert appearances rare - hence definitely an opportunity of a lifetime!! WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!

On the 13th of February five Swiss bands will be rocking the stage at the Papiersaal. The whole thing's called ""Monkeys on Stage"":    
It's a concert series that has started last April and is on going successfully, it's the third MOS, and it's gonna be great.   
So for anyone who likes rock'n'roll and a good concert, for all those who are interested in what good swiss rock sounds like. See you there!    
Cheers

Edit: A new headline act is to be announced tomorrow. Perhaps the organisers felt the same as me. (Or do they look at EF?  )

			The Fish era concluded in 1988, since then (21 years) their lead singer has been Steve Hogarth ""h"". They have now released 15 albums and were the first rock group to really use the internet to interact with their fans and also pre-finance their forthcoming work. Their last studio album ""Happiness Is The Road"" was an absolute belter - great atmospherics, good songs and pure musicianship.

liquid dnb has elements of soul, funk and jazz. makoto is one of the world's best producers from Japan and Deeizm is a beautiful & talented singer/mc/producer from the UK. Brookes Brothers are probably one of the most successful dnb acts from the UK who will also be in the line-up.

It is not the usual let's party music, that's fo sho, you might get tired of the work one does listening to him  ..It is not stuff to chill to, but I enjoy the intricacies and weirdness. If you want to hang with some interesting people and want to meet some not so usual crowd, go see him. He plays fretless bass or custombuilt 6string, whoa. It is definitely something else to listen to him online on some not so good speakers and see him live at a good sound place.

Oh, and see Reverend Beat-Man play if you can, he is something of a Swiss underground institution!

Not that it matters that much, I'm sure it'll be a brilliant concert.

			Now I've looked them up: ""bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and   vocals"", they sound kind of interesting.  Unfortunately, I'm out of the country that date.     
I'm seeing Dylan next month though...

			The idea here is to post the dates the groups are playing in the calendar.   
How about making an entry instead of placing the information here as 
a discussion.  Once the date is passed, the calendar will no longer be of 
interest, thus the new dates will not be seen.
