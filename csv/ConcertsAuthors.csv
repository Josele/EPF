0	Concerts	"Switzerland Gigs ""Heads Up"""	"""Yokine"	147999	1100	Location: Perthia	06.05.2009, 16:20	"    Why register to something that seems to cause you so much angst    
Anyone only using this ""Heads Up"" thread or the EF concert guide is going to miss out on plenty of things they might like anyway. It contains a mere fraction of what is going on. Compare it to a comprehensive gig guide eg   ,   etc   
Real gig guides exists elsewhere, so I certainly can't be bothered replicating them on EF. Call me selfish if you must, but it only caters for those who like to be.....

2	Concerts	Any date-friendly little concerts in Zurich tonight?	"""FelipeT"	352	0	Location: Zurich	16.12.2016, 17:59	" 
			
			I want to go out with my girlfriend tonight and watch some live music but it's being very hard to find anything.   
I've been asking around and checking on Google/FB but the only thing I could find is a pop concert in Moods, but those CHF30 for an artist I don't know seem a bit excessive. Either way I'll keep the idea as a last option.   
Anyone else has any tips about where to find some live music tonight? I'm up for pretty much anything of a reasonable quality and not too extreme ( jazz, blues, pop, rock, indie, ...)

Thanks a lot both of you! That's something (rather a lot) for at start.   
Had a look at them and most places looks really cool and cosy.   
It's always easy to Google places but it's only when people starts recommending them it gets really interesting.   
Thanks again! Highly appreciated.

I actually really enjoyed it, didnt think it would be my cup of tea.

			He's definitely not an 80.- artist. Yeah it all sounds the same, but people are prepared to pay in Switzerland, I guess. The problem is that many of the great world music stars don't stop off here so often, I guess its the cost of touring in Switzerland is so much higher then the rest of Europe, that they can't be bothered.

Daniel Waples on Hang, from London- perhaps the best in the world and Thaalavattam from Kerala India on percussion- mostly reused materials and pipes - absolutely amazing.

Martin Hennig - Clemens Klopfenstein - Marcus P. Nester - Christoph Geiser 
Die Lunte   
Die Autoren Martin Hennig, Clemens Klopfenstein, Marcus P. Nester und Christoph Geiser lesen aus ihren neuen Büchern, moderiert von Sabrina Habel.       
Christoph Geiser: ""Da bewegt sich nichts mehr"" - Erzählungen   
Drei Mordfälle, einer in Leipzig, einer in Berlin, eine Mordserie in Australien. Täter, aber kein schlüssig erklärbares Motiv. Geiser, der Erzähler ist immer nahe dabei, er scheint selbst gefährdet. Als Rechercheur versucht er herauszufinden, was hinter den Morden steckt. Entstanden sind drei anspielungsreiche Texte, die das Material der angeblich die Wahrheit vermittelnden Medienberichte aufnehmen, sie sprachkritisch zerlegen und der Frage nachspüren: Was war wirklich? Bis auch die mediale „Wahrheit“ sich immer mehr auflöst.       
Martin Hennig: ""Teufel, Mestre und Madonna"" - Novelle   
Mathieu verliert sein Herz an Sarah, die  Moderatorin der Wettersendung „Räge, Blitz und Sunneschtrahl“. Die Aussichten für die junge Liebe scheinen, trotz einiger hartnäckiger Nebelschwaden, sehr gut zu sein. Doch dann verliert Mathieu seinen Job und dann die Kontrolle über sein Auto. Tödlich verunfallt, landet er in einer anderen Welt, die ihren ganz eigenen Gesetzen folgt. Auch Sarahs Welt verändert sich, als sie sich auf die Suche nach Mathieu begibt. Es scheint, der Teufel habe seine Hand im Spiel. Aber gibt es den Teufel überhaupt? Eine Erzählung voller überraschender Wendungen und ironischer Pointen, mit blitzenden Dialogen und einem sunneschtrahlenden Surrealismus.        
Clemens Klopfenstein: ""Als ich meine Filme stahl - Das ganze Geständnis""   
""Clemens Klopfenstein ist für uns der unabhängige Filmemacher par excellence - kreativ, temperamentvoll, fantasiereich, humorvoll, dem Experiment aufgeschlossen. Die Lust auf das Abenteuer und die Erkundung des Fremde, Exotischen, aber auch die selbstkritische Observierung des Nahen, Vertrauten und Bekannten sind Klopfensteins Grundmotive. Und immer gibt es bei ihm eine Ebene der Ironie, der Doppeldeutigkeit, des Spiels mit Nuancen.""   
(Aus einem Beitrag des Filmhistorikers Ulrich Gregor)       
Marcus Nester ""Sturzgefahr"" - Krimi-Erzählungen   
Der Basler Autor landete mit der ""Migros - Erpressung"", zusammen mit Clemens Klopfenstein, einen frühen Erfolg und schrieb für die Krimi-Reihe Tatort. Nesters hier vorgelegte Erzählungen handeln von Menschen, die sich in Gefahr begeben und darin umkommen - oder fast. Die Grenzen zwischen Opfer und Täter sind fließend: Bei einem übereifrigen Steuerbeamten und einem fast unbescholtenen Steuerzahler, bei einem allzu gerissenen Zürcher Politiker und seiner unehelichen Tochter und bei einem Ehepaar, das von gegenseitigem Misstrauen so zerfressen ist, dass es den äußeren Horror erst bemerkt, als es zu spät ist.

35	Concerts	Classical music?	guest	2770	7	null	null	"    I'm not in this situation myself but know several people who have joined a friends of the Tonhalle society and this not only gets them some tickets at a better price but means they can come in and listen to rehearsals etc for free (and of course get informed when those rehearsals etc are).   
I got taken as a guest a couple of times and watching them practice is really interesting, as you get to understand the sort of stuff a conductor watches out for, stops the music, explains something, and makes them do it again. It makes you apprecaite the work that goes into producing a concert, but also some of the finer points of musical listening and interpretation that as a musical philistine, I would never have picked up by myself.   
There were only about four people besides us so it was quite an experience having a full orchestra perform for such a handful.

and 
Lutry Temple, 15th November at 17.00   
I know armistice day is 11.11. but celebrated today in London and all over UK. The musicians accompanying the chorists were amazing- and the 'Last Post' by the excellent trumpetist was particularly poignant.

			Saw this last night. The visual and auditory experience was absolutely amazing!!! Ballet+Lady Gaga+hip hop+Indian dance+ballroom dance (cha cha cha), all elements used to create beautiful body movements.   
I did manage to refrain myself from correcting the (German) speaker of the pre-show meeting who said that   is a palindrome ( ).     
Downsides:  
1. The program was only in German, although one of the three choreographers is an American, and another (the Israeli) was educated in the US (at Julliard) and is married to an American. 
2. This program was FOR SALE for CHF 9!!!!   
Does anyone know of other venues where one can see such shows?

But the concerts are great very often.

I live in Lausanne and there are some concerts i'm planning to go to in Pratteln, and as I have no company I thought I ask if there's anyone going there (from any city along the way from Lausanne to Pratteln) so maybe we can share the same car or something, as I actually don't have a car and trying to save on the transport cost  .

			Summerdays 2015 on Friday 28 August in Arbon has a great line up again. Having been soaked the last two times that I went, perhaps they are due sunshine this time. The festival will be opened by Fish, the former lead singer of Marillion. Next is Ian Anderson with his new band ""The Best of Jethro Tull"". Also The Alan Parsons Project. Top of the bill is Deep Purple for rocking moments and ""Smoke on the Water of Lake Constance"". The Baseballs concludes the first night.   
The Saturday night continues to be generally Swiss acts       
Additionally, the same acts will be performing at the Summernights Festival on the German side of the lake on the opposite nights

As the release of  s third album nears,   and   are offering up another taste of   with new track  LP   is due out on     & the band are set to tour across Europe this spring.   
Whereas debut single,  featured West Coast punk vibes,   presents a cosmic trucker boogie and recognizes no journey is possible without being on the road.          was written entirely during  an evolving phase for Moon Duo. It was a rare and uneasy rest period,  devoid of the constant adrenaline of performing live and the stimulation  of traveling through endless moving landscapes. This offered Moon Duo a  new space to reflect on all of these previous experiences and cradle  them while cultivating the album in the unfamiliar environment of a new  dwelling; a dark Portland basement. It was from this stir-crazy fire  that   was forged.   
Catch the three-piece Moon Duo band    (guitars),   (keys) and   (drums) -- all over the U.S. and Europe beginning at the end of this month.

Date: 20:00-23:00, 24th October 2014 
Location: Volkhaus Zurich     There is so much  to do in the little big city of Zurich. You can hear some great Celtic  music and Gaelic folk songs with Irish whiskey at its best. This Irish  folk concert provides a close experience with Irish music including the  Irish bagpipes which are different than the Scottish bagpipes. The Irish  folk music is wonderful. Musically, the old Gaelic songs sound elvishly  lovely -- to me like a song far over the horizon.

113	Concerts	Il Tempo Gigante - Denmark	"""Taichief"	1125	0	Location: Aargau	28.09.2014, 13:09	" 
			
			Copenhagen based Il Tempo Gigante, alias Rolf Hansen, creates an air of hushed intensity through a virtuosic and highly original use of loops, guitar and voice. His elegant spider web like compositions are imbued with melodic durability and stands out in their fascinating offbeat arrangements that gently, but determined, oppose every tendency to idealization. 
With a distinctive guitar playing style and epic lyrics he carries the listener into all kinds of human experience and theres often a presence on stage that makes a very thin line between sender and receiver.

			Good job! That was a reasonable outcome/loss, and hopefully made someone happy. We were looking at the people watching/listening from their windows rather pleasantly surprised by the evening's entertainment.   
Funny how ""first gig"" memories stick - my daughter's was Birdy at the Forum (Kentish town) this last March - we worked our way to the front and had a great evening, more so because it is such a small venue and the audience was there for her and her band. We just missed her in Zürich last February (was happening the eve I found out and was sold-out, Lausanne as well) so I did some quick searching to see when we might catch her next. I really hope she is well-managed and doesn't get exploited as teen-star because she is truly talented and must find the on-the-road life a bit overwhelming at times. Birdy (17) is clearly younger than her band members, but one senses they really communicate through the music and have a good time. The cellist is awesome, the mellow tone that richens the bass and with different bow techniques adds to the rhythm is quite special. I highly recommend catching them live!   
Amy MacDonald and Birdy on the same evening would have made up for the smokers  But that is the tactics of programming.

			heiterre is a decent little festival its small but i've never found any problems with it being overly crowded or anything so it makes for a decent chilled atmosphere.. if you're ever looking for a small festival feel good fest in nidergösgen near aarau is good. its mostly swiss artists but really nice friendly atmosphere.

Contact   to register in advance. He is a nice guy and he speaks English. He does magic and introduces the acts. You could win a small prize if the audience like you. They have a clapometer.

			Yes! Nels Cline is a long time trippy guitarist from Los Angeles. 
I'm sure you know he is the guitarist and band member many years now in the band Wilco...   
Both Nels and his talented brother drummer,percussionist  Alex Cline used to be heavily influenced by Frank Zappa in Los Angeles;and used to play together a lot in the little avant-guard scene.   
Alex has performed in Switzerland as well,and is also featured on some CDs with an old friend,band mate of mine John Wolf  Brennan, an amazing tasty composer Swiss/Irish pianist,organist,melodica player;based out of Weggis Switzerland. 
(I was the guitarist with his brother Peter Wolf in the Swiss progressive rock band called Flame Dream)   
That for suresy must have been a mega ahhsome performance Paul !

			Or buy cheapest ticket category to the opernhaus for mid-week performances and then hope to switch seats during the interval (a Swiss friend confirmed that this was socially acceptable   ) - mid-week best as a lot of people with subscriptions don't turn up.   
As an aside, not all 35chf category tickets have a bad view... just don't get the furthest rows at the back nor the extreme edges and you should be fine!

Loved the last set he did in Zurich. The audience was under strict instructions not to applaud between pieces or after the set (before the break) and he came shuffling on stage like he was attending a funeral wearing the most absurdly over the top cap.   
He's so melodramatic    
I'm hoping as he's just released a 'greatest hits' that he might be covering some of his older repertoire. I'd like to hear some of his older stuff again from Poses.

			Technically never seen them live - as I'm guessing streaming their live album release concert through youtube while working probably doesn't count - but have heard great things about their concerts.   
Prefer their early work to their new stuff, but still really enjoy listening.   
Surprised that there are still tickets left as so many of their tour dates in Europe have sold out.   
They are also playing in Zurich on Monday 21st....tickets still available for that one too.

They turn their foyer into a decent little bar and do excellent jam nights often involving the pro teachers and often entrance is free:  . I have been a few times and it is top notch.

181	Concerts	Sing the Christmas Oratorio from J.S.Bach with us! (Basel)	"""opernball"	875	0	Location: basel	02.09.2013, 16:19	" 
			
			Hello music friends in Basel!    
The Münsterkantorei Basel is a concert choir affiliated to the beautiful  Basel Minster and conducted by Annedore Neufeld, a very virtuous,  enthusiastic and highly professional lady. About 50 singers work on high  level sacred music from all epochs, a capella and with an orchestra.  
Rehearsals are usually on Wednesday night at the Bischofshof, right next to the Basel Minster.      . Some german knowledge is required for understandig the conductor   (understanding ""german german"" should do)   
On Wednesday, 4th of September, we will start rehearsing Bach's famous Christmas Oratorio (all six parts).  
Concerts will be on Dec 21 and 22 at the Basel Minster.   
If you are interested in joining this once in a lifetime experience  don't hesitate to contact me or just come to the  Bischofshof (address:  Rittergasse 1, Basel) at 7:30 pm on Wed 4th of September  (or any other  Wednesday). 
Especially people with some singing experience under age 50 and men are needed! 
Come and join! Don't be shy, give it a try!            "	Posts: 6	Join Date: Feb 2013	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 2 Times in 2 Posts	no particular reputation at present

I went to their gig in Islington earlier this summer and had the opportunity to meet them, speak to them etc. It's amazing how down-to-earth and unpretentious they are.   
The new album is also highly recommended - great simple tunes travis style.         
(and of course it is raining today...kind of normal with travis and ""why does it always rain on me?"")

You don't half get about mate. As for gyms, I'm at Indigo fitness its other side of the water from claraplatz. There is one called Migros fitness near you which is a lot cheaper.   
I'd be well up for Maximo, their lead singer Paul Smith lived round the corner from me in Billingham, so wouldn't mind seeing hearing a good old Teesside accent.   
Hope you enjoyed Pickwicks the other night lad,

I can no longer go to the Zürich gig on 30th June, so am considering going to the Stuttgart one. I would prefer to return tonight, rather than stay over, but the last train back to Zürich leaves Bad Cannstadt at 22:11, and the gig will certainly still be going on at that time.   
If anyone happens to be going, please let me know, and I'll share transport costs.

			I went to several open air festivals in Switzerland a few years back and had a great time at them all. There are designated camping areas and depending on time of arrival you can be closer or farther from the festival itself- but even the farthest site wasn't far in my opinion.  Many of these are in the mountains so its a beautiful setting to enjoy in addition to the festival fun.  They seem to get larger every year but there are expected numbers on the respective websites.  I would highly recommend, however, they do sell out quickly and many have no more tickets available for this year.  If you have any specific questions feel free to PM me.

			Even though played in German it is going to be a big show.       
The open-air performance in the forecourt of the impressive Einsiedeln Benedictine monastery will take place from 21 June to 7 September with 600 people being involved in the theater production.   
""Taking up the tradition of the medieval mysterious plays,    by the Spanish writer Calderón de la Barca (1600 - 1681) was for the  first time performed in 1924 on the abbey square by the population of  Einsiedeln. Since then, the play has been staged every five years or so;  the last time in 2007.""   
It is a short, action-packed play in which entire lifespans of a  society  from king to beggar, rich merchant to peasant, are explored. God here is the omnipotent director, who appoints his stage manager,  The World, and selects his players and their roles (not individuals,  but archetypes). Then, in line with the doctrine of free will, he pushes  them on stage. From the cradle to the grave, theyre free to chart  their own choices; only then will the Supreme Being intervene again to  decide their ultimate fates.

There's still lots of stuff on tomorrow.

Der Choir of Gonville and Caius College in Cambridge gilt als einer  besten Chöre Englands und geniesst auch international einen  hervorragenden Ruf. Neben seiner intensiven Konzerttätigkeit in England  absolvierte er unter anderem bereits Tourneen in Frankreich,  Deutschland, China und Südafrika. Nun treten die rund dreissig  Sängerinnen und Sänger in Biel erstmals mit einem Schweizer  Berufsorchester auf.    
Hope it helps.

			We would like to invite you the first showing in Europe of Being Becoming winner of the excellence award at the New York Fringe Festival. Being Becoming is based on Bharatnatyam the dance of Gods .    
Being Becoming is a 75 minute Indian classical dance performance that explores an idea central to Hindu and Buddhist philosophies: that one can become the object of their devotion, meditation, or desire. Devotional transformation, or the idea of losing oneself or being consumed by the other, is extensively expressed in Indian traditions of poetry, music, painting, and dance. Each piece in Being Becoming explores the different ways in which the individual seeks to become one with the other, as well as traditional Indian theater techniques that enact the transformation from actor to character. Being Becoming is made up of five different pieces for solo, duet, and trio.     
For further information on Malini please consult the website:

I came across a banner while walking in Neuchatel about a month ago, advertising a series of Classical concerts in the region starting this month and going into March next year. Sadly I can't find the banner, the website or any information on this online.    
Does anybody know of this or have any information regarding this?    
If you know of any other concerts being held in the region, I'd be interested in hearing about them. Please let me know, I would much appreciate it. Thank you!

			Date: Saturday, 6th of October 2012 
Time: 13 hours 
Venue: Saal, Villa Grünfels, 8645 Jona   
30 CHF / 25 CHF (with discount) 
To buy tickets on the day at the box office: from 12 hours   
Reservations: 
Tel. +41 (0) 55 210 51 54 or per e-mail       will be playing new, original compositions as well as selections from his two acclaimed solo albums in the four CD Art of Sound series.   
Known for  , Johns aim is to make the improvising sound like its been composed and the compositions as simple and direct as if theyve been improvised there and then. In addition he brings to jazz a love of wide dynamic range and different touch at the piano, something which can best be experienced in the solo format.   
As well as an interest in advanced harmony and rhythm, Johns compositions and playing also explore harmonic simplicity and straight grooves.   
John Law, a prize-winning classical prodigy on piano, turned away from classical piano studies to pursue jazz and improvised music when he was 23 and has been involved in, and acclaimed for, his work in a wide area of different jazz, as well as modern classical, projects: from solo piano albums based on plainchant through trio and quartet work covering the whole spectrum from freely improvised music through standard jazz repertoire and works by Thelonious Monk, right through to composing large scale works for his semi-classical ensemble Cornucopia.  
His three main current projects are the acclaimed trio Congregation, with Yuri Goloubev and Asaf Sirkis, his new trio Three Ways, exploring both jazz and classical music, with Yuri and Julian Argüelles and solo piano concerts.

315	Concerts	Seating plan in KKL Luzern - Ute Lemper in concert	"""shabar"	1518	0	Location: Rotkreuz	10.09.2012, 20:06	" 
			
			I've just noticed there is a planned concert of Ute Lemper in KKL hall, on November the 17th.  
Mrs. B. and myself are big fans of this extraordinary performer and I thought it would be an excellent opportunity for us to visit this hall for the first time. 
My question is regarding the floor plan, and I would appreciate if someone who visited there could tell me if row No. 3 on the parquet floor is much lower then the stage.  The lowest price category is for Reihe a,b then there is second category for Reihe 1-2.The third one is for Reihe 3 and 4.  
There are nice seats available in the center of Reihe 3.  
Generally we enjoy seating close to the stage and feel the ""sweat"" of the performers, but I was wondering if we would need to stretch our necks in order to watch the concert, which obviously would not make it fun. 
The next available seats are in Reihe 5, which is another price category.    
If anyone enjoys good cabaret, and would like to listen to THE BEST performer of Kurt Weill's music - come and join us!

It is on the same floor as the restaurant Don Camillo. You can also come to us by entering the restaurant, we are located behind the door with the opaque glass.    
Michael Northam 
Over 20 years involved consistently with a self-taught style of sound-painting with a combination of electronic, acoustic and organic sound sources. 
Sound has been for Michael a primary artistic form to explore indeterminate states of perception and consciousness.  Provoking questions about what are the building blocks of human experience and exploring that with extended and suspended states provoked by intuitively 'tuned' sound fields. 
This working direction is a two decade refinement techniques to explore complex, but deeply patterned phenomena found in nature and how such 'stochastic' sources are the essential elements of our most intimate inner and outer tapestries of experience. 
Michael records from nature elemental sound materials from wind, water, plant material and incidental man-made phenomena - often where these elements interpenetrate each other.  Using these kinds of sounds he then practices in primitive-musical ways to imitate elemental phenomena with various instruments (percussive, electro-acoustic, acoustic) such as playing sea shells, bird calls, japanese pentatonic flute, resonating metal objects, etc.  Furthermore years of auto-dictactic acousmatic studio experience produces 'compost' of interwoven live and recorded materials into ever unfolding new works that been left behind over the past years as internationally published recordings and site-specific installations. Most recently a series of works entitled 'watchthingsgrow' which have been 8-channel aleatoric sound-works for Botanical Gardens. The work ""Frozen Illuminations"" has been presented on Radio Deutschland Kulture, last year, as well as, numerous self-published collector edition items on Michael's personal label OROGENETICS. 
Because of years of developing a personal sound, he is increasingly sought after for extremely precise and unique experiential sound-design for international dance, performance and cinematic projects.  Works premiering in Belgium, India, United States and Germany. 
Currently developing a project with Bavarian performance/installation artist Judith Egger concerning indeterminate states of consciousness.            
B°TONG 
B°TONG is Chris Sigdell, former member of the German experimental/industrial group NID (1995 - 2005). With B°TONG, he reaches for the nether regions of experimental electronic sound, and has established himself as an acknowledged experimental soundscape creator. So far he has shared the stage with such known artists as: B°TONG has appeared at festivals like Sinus-Series (Basel 2006), Ausklang (Hamburg 2006), Shift (Basel 2007 & 2008), Lab 30 (Augsburg 2009), and has performed on various radio stations. B°TONG has collaborated with other artists, is part of installations (Polarkreis & 95° by Brigitte Gierlich & Camilla Schuler), video-projects (Images by Ulrich Fischer), and does his own clips to assorted pieces of his musical catalog. The video to Sphere II was shown at the 2007 Miami Art Fair as part of the Urban Nomad film-festival; the videos to Black Dog Dream and 95° were shown in Beijing (Taiwan), and his latest, Fragile Package, made by a local video artist.   
The music is a choice of dark brooding layers of sound, high pitched tones, and weird electronic sounds that give birth to images of darkness and tranquility, the solitude of an icy polar night or the equivalent of an underwater journey into the bottomless pit. 
B°TONG uses samples from television, radio and film, and processes these on the computer with recordings of his voice and other. There are no instruments involved! In a live-situation Chris relies on instruments like microphone, metal-sheet, electric toys, and kitchen utensils. The sounds made with them are fed and put through various effect-pedals giving him that trademark sound.                   
The concert is kindly supported by Kaskadenkondensator.

Some of you might have heard of them (probably the canadian indie-pop/rock lovers)    
will be stopping in Zurich on October 22nd, there'll be a small and intimate gig at LangStars on Zurich's famous Langstrasse.    
After releasing their new album ""The Age Of Peace"" on September 14th they will be doing a couple of release-shows in Europe. There is only 1 show in Switzerland, so you should be there!

Check out their awesome music on    
Come by, have a drink at the bar and enjoy great live music...   
Hope to see some of you there!       "	Posts: 3	Join Date: Jul 2012	Newbie	Groaned at 0 Times in 0 Posts	Thanked 1 Time in 1 Post	no particular reputation at present

			Hey all!  (Or...ya'll!)  Last night my husband and I stumbled across a little country music weekend fest thing in Ouchy.  You know how they do a different cultural theme each weekend, well this weekend it seems to be American/country music.  There was a cover band playing some old faves from Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and the like.  They even had a line dance group called ""Happy Boots"" which I kind of want to join!     Anywho, I was pretty delighted at the whole thing, and we are going back tonight because at 8pm there is a country singer from the US performing.  I don't remember his name, and I didn't recognize it when I saw it, but who cares.  Should be pretty nifty!  Anyone going to go too?  Come say hi!

For those not in the know - they're full-on 80s style hair metal, with a comedy schtick going on. They recently toured with Motley Crue and Def Leppard.   
Anyone else on here going?

337	Concerts	Organising charity gig - do you have experience?	"""Gillyscadd"	984	4	Location: Zurich	21.07.2012, 19:50	" 
			
			So far i've not organised or been part of any events in CH except as a muso. My event management experience is all based in UK so far.  But i understand it's much harder there due to the regs set out by Suisa.    
You'll find the 100Db limit nigelr mentions to be standard in the EU nowadays. Even major festivals in the UK are limited to 95Db for outdoor stages and 93Db for inside tents.    
The earplugs rule is a new one on me ..... though I'm already half deaf as it is lol It just means you have to stand a little closer to the Sub's so you can feel the Bass hitting your whole body .. works for me   lol

Actually it is usual, for new members to sort of introduce themselves and let us know a little about you. 
Why don`t you create an event for the concert - you may find that it would generate a bit of interest if people could go in a group .

363	Concerts	Rich Hopkins & Luminarios / Richard Buckner | Monday May 21, 20:20	"""jeanius_1"	717	0	Location: Zurich	19.05.2012, 12:06	    Ever since 1992,  The Luminarios have delighted, enlightened and surprised us in various  member formations of three, four or five. But whether like that or in loosely put together sessions  with musician buddies, it's always been nothing but a true original  Rich Hopkins' thing. To be sure, that's as far as The Luminarios go, others of his numerous projects and collaboations have been with Sidewinders, Sand Rubies, Underbelly, Woodcocks and many others.

When he showed me his computer screen there were ten or twelve red dots indicating available tickets. I was happy it wasn't sold out so I bought two in a corner where maybe the view isn't great.

			Hank Chinaski aka Charlie Bukowski, would have loved this band. He'd  been much obliged and honored by them, picking ""Barfly"" as the title for  their first studio album in 37 years. Rocket from the Tombs was founded  in 1974, burnt out in 1975 and their recorded work survived mainly in  the form of bootlegs. Some say, this Clevland band originated  'punk'.  (Wayne Kramer, Wayne County, Johnny Rotten, Sylvain Sylvain a.o. might  disagree...). Actually, so does founding member and Pere Ubu frontman,  . 'Punk' was nothing but a fad, he says. Shortlived and  destroyed by it's own (but unavoidable) gargantuan consumption of drugs  and alcohol, that would have made even Keith Richard blush. (Can you  just see that...)

			Yea.. we were there too, right down the front getting thrown about. These guys have allways been a big part of my music al influence really , I play in a Swiss ""rock"" band but we are all really old punk rockers at heart, Stranglers, Clash and Killing Joke being in the top 3. 
If you guys like KJ then for sure your gonna like us too ( ) our EP solid state nation comes out this weekend (28th) ..spotify, amazon and so on. 
We also play at Rock City in Uster on Saturday night & if anyone wants free tickets to our London Camden show on May the 11th, just ask, I got 30 comps for that night.   
So lets debate .. 
is KJ a punk or a rock band or where are they .. Post punk alternative maybe. 
Or are unique?

Apart from the DJ kit and DVS software, I'm working mostly with the Quartz Composer, which is completely free and amazingly versatile, and started out with a bunch of hand me down projectors, though I've since got myself a nice short throw projector.

			Well, its got to be said again -   IS part of the royalty of real jazz festivals in Europe.   
This is not Montreux Jazz festival's little cousin; this is   on the Lac Leman.   
Cully Jazz Fest still has a heart and soul and vibe, unlike, IMHO, its bigger cousin/cousine east of it on the lake.   
Check out the program. Absolutely outstanding.   
This Jazz festival is going from strength to strength, year by year.       
And probably on the finest location of Lake Geneva too.   
Plenty of ""Off"" gigs in about 12-ish wine caves dotted around the wine village, besides the more head line gigs by some real jazz monsters.

412	Concerts	Anne Clark concerts Zurich	"""sbobwilliams"	1178	0	Location: Zurich	28.01.2012, 11:13	" 
			
			For more than thirty years Anne Clark has held a unique place in contemporary music.   
  Combining literary, socially engaged texts with innovative and  genre-breaking music, she has covered every kind of style, while at the  same time maintaining her own identity on each and every recording,  whether it be the samples (before sampling became a concept) and  electronically treated acoustics of The Sitting Room (1982), to the  ground-breaking analogue synth classics of Sleeper In Metropolis (1983) and Our Darkness (1984).   
  In 2011 Anne Clark and her long time pianist Murat Parkal contributed  an arrangement of the Charles Baudelaire poem Enivrez-Vous (Be Drunk) to  the audio book and radio play Die Künstlichen Paradiese, (Hörbuch  Hamburg/Radio Bremen). The project was further developed into a “live”  concept with a performance at the Volksbühne in Berlin.    
 After  public and critical acclaim the “duo” are now taking the project  further, collaborating with LordMasters artists collective in Zurich.   
  LordMasters is an independent collective of artists and performers who  have stepped out of the main stream to follow their own personal path,  and whose artistry comes from a keen observation of the world.   Consisting of artists coming from all parts of the world, dance, music,  film, visual arts or literature, each medium is an equally important  part of a more global work.    
  After responding to the worlds  system overload, the constant bombardment of information and societies  over consumption of everything… “Enough” is an intimate concert  stripping back to the raw elements of music, words and movement.    
  Words: Anne Clark 
  Piano: Murat Parlak

			Hi all. 
Just to add some more info about finding Metal shows - have a look at this website:    
I saw this website advertised in the Volkshaus when I went to the Eluveitie fest and it shows a lot of upcoming Metal shows such as Judas Priest, Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, Steel Panther, Mastodon, Tarja Turunen (ex-Nightwish) and if you like the more Rock/Nu-Metal scene then there is 3 Doors Down, Korn, Black Stone Cherry, and more.  
Check it out!     
ALSO!!! 
Anyone into Metal should know about the Sounddock 14 club. It's a small club (but very intimate) in Dietikon with a lot of great band performing regularly and a generally good atmosphere. You can buy CDs, merch, and sometimes ""Viking"" stuff like honey wine, drinking horns, etc. outside.

			I was there and it was amazing! Pieces presented in Alhambra were created and performed as multichannel spatial ""music"". Technical equipment of Alhambra was on very high level so the effect of spatial reproduction was enormous. I will not comment particular interprets since this would be subjective. In general I can say that concerts in Alhambra offered unique experience in terms of featured artists as well as quality of sound reproduction. If you like experimental electronic music, don't miss Presences Electroniques Geneve next year!

			Trombone Shorty and Orleans Ave.will be playing at the Hotel Murten on Nov.30 and again in Zurich at the Kaufleuten on Dec.10. He plays a very interesting mix of funk, punk, jazz, and rock that is undeniably all New Orleans. I caught his show at Montreux this year, and believe me you do not want to miss this show. Of every set I attended at the New Orleans Jazz fest last year, his was by far the most attended. He is our pride and we simply adore him in New Orleans. He got his nickname because when he started playing the trombon it was bigger than him. He is an amazing talent backed by an equally talented band.

			Hi I'm John Lyons from the John Lyons Band and I wanted to everybody to know that we'll be playing a NO Cover Charge, yes thats FREE concert Thursday December 1 at Bar Rossi in Zürich. I'm not putting any links because I'm guessing the mods will anyways censor them, right?    
I write some of my own songs and we also play cover versions of blues, classic rock and funk stuff. Think of it as a very high level bar band that leans more towards the artist direction, we make the covers ' our own' so to speak. Would be great to meet some of you there, just come up an introuduce yourself.

434	Concerts	Sleaze/Punk Metal! Sister and Sister Sin support UDO in Pratteln	"""pumpkinspiced"	1130	0	Location: Basel	14.11.2011, 17:24	" 
			
			Anyone up for some good honest sleazy rock n roll in Pratteln on the 7th of December?   
Sister are the exciting newcomers on the Swedish Sleaze and Grunge Metal scene, and they are promised to be supporting German heavy metal legends UDO on their European tour this year in December.    
Sister, who are the prodiges of Martin Sweet of Crashdïet - a Swedish sleaze staple and cult favorite since the early 2000s - combine dirty guitar riffs with gritty vocals and ever so slightly cheesy, anthemic lyrics, and they promise to be a grand old show. My favorite songs from the album are: 
Bullshit & Backstabbing ( ) 
and 
Werewolves on Blackstreet ( )       
As for UDO and Sister Sin - I can't really speak for them much, except that UDO must have been doing something right to last this long.      
I will probably be reviewing this concert anyways, but I always appreciate company at the bar! Anyone up for a grungey night out in Pratteln?

			We just took our two older children (12 and 9) to Cats in Zurich.   
It was awesome.    
Our son was a little embarrassed when the doorman told him he had to check his backpack into the cloakroom - but we followed the instructions and discovered that they issue booster seats to short kids! - 10chf deposit and you get your money back when you return the booster at the end of the show.   
We took back row seats, which meant we could sit up as high as we wanted and wiggle to the music without bothering anyone...   
Oh, and during intermission 'Old Deuteronomy' sat on stage and we were allowed to have our photo taken with him !   
Unfortunately the final show is tomorrow, and it'll sell out - but we are thinking it might be worth saving up for the 'Thriller' show which is scheduled for Basel before Christmas and Zurich just after.   
The venue was Hardturm-Areal, in the big tent. And it was fully heated too!     
Absolutely fantastic !

453	Concerts	looking for an electronic musician or multi-instrumentalist in zurich to collaborate	"""yourmomsp"	1057	0	Location: Zurich	16.09.2011, 19:06	" 
			
			hello,   
i'm not sure if this is the right place to post but maybe someone who checks this area would find this of interest.  i'm 30 and recently moved to zurich from the US where i was very active in writing, recording, and performing music.   i sing, play guitar, bass, and keyboards.   i'm poking around for a musician to collaborate with.  i'm looking for someone specific..... either...   
1) someone who has a lot of experience making electronic music as well as music production who would be willing to collaborate in writing and recording together.  i have particular strengths in writing melodies, lyrics, and arrangments.  i'm looking for someone who likes to tweak and experiment with sounds who could help to flesh out the sonic environment the songs would inhabit... influences along these lines would be....the faint, new order, the cure (early period), cut copy, passion pit, joy division, depeche mode   
OR   
2) someone who is a multi-instrumentalist, capable of switching from piano to guitar to trumpet to cello etc.  the idea would be to perform songs that i've previously written and/or potentially come up with some new material.    music would be more singer-songwriter in the vein of bright eyes, the good life, elliott smith, etc.   
if you think you might fall into either of these categories or if you may know someone who does, feel free to drop me a line.   
many thanks,   
j

			Haven't been posting on EF for a long time.....spending too much time exploring the wonder of this amazing country.     
Went to the Bernex country music festival tonight...what a great place.  Listened to some good music - some Zydeco, a little Bluegrass, some good bands singing some (to me) familiar songs in both English and Franglish....    
It looks to be going in tomorrow as well.     
Enjoy, if you go.

			Have a look at Matthieu Grillet's website and you will see him playing, aged 12, with Steve. Lukather has taken him under his wing and invites him to play with him whenever he has gigs in Europe- lucky Matthieu. (he is home taught and I teach him English and German). Steve has invited him to LA when he has finished his studies. He's also done master classes with Guthrie Govan.

Anybody know how close the festival grounds are to the station? When would I need to leave to get the train?

461	Concerts	Bon Jovi Open Air	"""goddess of soul"	995	3	Location: pfaeffikon sz	17.08.2011, 22:08	"    Well, I was not exactly standing close to the stage because we got two tickets with seats. I guess the real Swiss Bon Jovi fans were all closer to the band. But then again, we also bought ticket with seats in their concert in Stuttgart in 2008. Even those Germans closer to our seats were all standing up from the beginning till the end to sing along..So that's why I make the comparison...

			Saturday, August 13, Wendy McNeill will be doing a show in Wetzikon. I'm a big fan of hers, so I definitely plan on going. I'm pretty sure she doesn't speak German, Swiss or High, so the show will likely be in English or French. Most of her songs are in English.

			Well decided to go and though it was chucking it down while the Wailers were on, it dried up for most of Jack Johnson's set which was superb but there I was with my clear waterproof poncho.   
Crowd looked like a ghosts convention all swaying to the music with clear waterproofs on...very spooky   
Highlight was two male streakers walking nonchalantly through the crowd having a general chat until security caught up with them.   
Can you guess what was the only thing Security had to dress them in when caught????   Yes a clear waterproof each..sort of defeated the object of covering them up!

			Did you try taking them to the Ticket office to swap?  We did that with an indoor show in January.  I went to the Basel tatto office with no expectation that they would change tickets for us but they did!!  And the new tickets were in cheaper seats and they refunded the tickets.  Worth a try.  The office is now in front of the Kaserne.

			I managed to get in by virtue of the fact that the sound guy is a fellow Houston Astros fan -- he's actually from a town near where I grew up too -- but I was fortunate for the hook-up.  It was a really good show and quite crowded by the standards of the shows I've seen here.  Not only that, but the crowd was very engaged, which always improves the experience.   
Whoever is booking the Viadukt is doing nice job of getting solid Americana acts.

480	Concerts	Journey & Foreigner in Winterthur, Sunday 6/19	"""olygirl"	2029	9	Location: d' Innerschwiiz	18.06.2011, 17:37	"    Hi Olygirl we also enjoyed it a lot!   
Here is my rating (and sorry I didn't reply earlier in the week, didn't see the post): 
-Night Ranger was ok, at least they had a bit of connection with the audience 
-Saga: disappointed. I felt them distant. No   (difficult to play, maybe that's why),   or  , my three favorites! 
-Kansas: Fantastic 
-Foreigner: superb! I was hungry for more. Loved  ! 
-Journey: worthy our three-hours trip to the concert! I am not too much into  , so not a miss for me. Don't stop believin' was just too good! and the finishing with   was perfect (btw   is with Steve Perry as solo singer, not part of the Journey repertoire, so I am afraid it will be a bit difficult to have that one  ). Arnel Pineda simply revived the band. Agree too many new songs (three too many!  ), but I guess, that is a good thing (although am with you, not the best!)     
Grade: A++ for less than a 100CHF it was a real bang for our buck!

"""grumpygrapefruit"	1274	2	Location: Mostly Zurich	01.06.2011, 12:38	"    I'm not working there today, but I doubt it'd be a problem, they were playing very gently and the horns were pointing in the direction of the tracks, away from the market. I'll be there from 5 though and will report back if they become a pain!

			Yeah, it's tough to track things on that string.  Also, this is more show than concert, at least in my provincial usage.  I've found it a bit tough (only having been here for 5 weeks) to find out about small shows and was pleased to see that this one was right next to my flat.  I used to see Biram regularly in Austin, for about 1/5 the price.  My wife and I will be there for sure.

As one can only buy a combi-ticket for that festival (=180 francs..), this concert seems like the best option.   
I saw them about two years ago at Rote Fabrik in Zürich, performance that truly blew me away.

549	Concerts	linkin park-teenagers and music	"""starshine"	3445	51	Location: Adliswil	02.11.2010, 03:17	"    You can help, though. While I agree it really is very personal and some find classical through pop or rock, some the other way around, it does not hurt to try and expose. I wouldn't try too hard and too obviously, though, since it is a turn off for teens, fo sho. Nonchalantly try.      
You can also have a teen who will do anything to be different than his stereotypical teen peers. Some teens so go for being different, what ever it means. If you play it right, exposing them to classical might be exactly the difference (the new uncool and untrendy) they will opt for to make themselves stick out of the blob. I enjoyed classical, but also appreciated help I got from others in terms of interesting choice to experiment with (parents, teachers, music classes, gigs, etc.).

			Hi everyone, I'm putting this under daily life because it's such short notice and perhaps more eyes will see this.    
Tomorrow, Sunday, Dec 5, I will give a free concert at the Sacre-Coeur Church in Basel, on Feierabendstrasse. The name of our baroque ensemble is ""Les Fabulists"" and we will be playing a short program of pre-Classical oboe sonatas from little-known composers from Italy, France, and England. The program won't be very long and is really suited to a lazy Sunday, as we'll be playing at 11:30 AM, after the mass. Just perfect for the time right between your first and second breakfasts.   
As mentioned, the concert is free (though donations are gratefully accepted), and is an easy way to get some culture into your diet! No need to RSVP, just show up if you're in the area. Hope to see some of you there. Go ahead and introduce yourself if you do decide to come.

I'd start with a band if I were you, post a flyer at uni (unimail, bastions, etc.) looking for a band. I haven't found that many open mic events compared to what I am used to, but no reason to not do things.

			Dear All,   
I got a chance to attend this very well organized concert/festival by  Union Basel   . The Festival was celebrated with both Indian community residing in Basel as well as the local admirers of Indian culture and dance forms.   
The Festival started with Pooja ""Worshiping Godess Lakshmi ""The Godess of Wealth and Prosperity"" followed by some great Indian dance forms by the students and team of this organization having participants from both Indian as well Swiss society. After many classical dances there was also a much awaited ""Bollywood themed "" dances as well....the performers have done a great job with the last dance wherein they danced with lighted lamps in the hand.   
A very enjoyable evening indeed !!   
Wish you all a very Happy Diwali, 
Vik

Same rules apply as before. Landlockedblues is (as of now) only but   one man.  If there is a gig coming through I am missing, especially   outside of Zürich, drop me a note. If this is the sort of thing you are   interested in contributing to on a regular basis, now is your chance.     
Hopefully some new concert previews to come shortly.

The MTV and Skyliner stages were stopped at the border and it took Swiss customs about 36 hours before they even let the stage material into Switzerland...  
The main stage crossed the border with similar paperwork 1 day earlier without any problem.... 
This means there is a lot of late shifts for the guys building the other 2 stages but it will still be ready on time...

Thought I would feedback about a recommended artist as I found the original link to the Zurich music scene here in the first place    
I went to see a lady called Lesley Meguid play a set at La Catrina last week, and she was brilliant! She's half American, half Swiss, sings in English and if you like live acoustic sets you should give her a look. She plays there again tomorrow (20/07/2010), see link below.

			My name is Brandy. Some of you may know may because I used to run the Zuerich Open Mic.    
On August 25th, I will be premiering my new program with my band Chamber Soul in the Kaufleuten's summer sound series. We, chamber soul, are a trio composed of voice, trombone and guitar. The idea is to take a classical chamber approach to modern pop/soul music.    
In our new program we have invited the world famous string arranger Larry Gold to write arrangements of our songs. Larry is the man behind not only the ""Philadelphia Soul sound"", but has written string arrangements for everyone from Justin Timberlake, to Kanye West, to Al Green.   
The amazing local Galatea quartet will be joining us to play these arrangements.   
Chamber Soul puts on a great show, and have been written as "" a great band that presents a magical concert evening that feels more like dinner with great company.""     
Check us out at Chambersoul.ch   
Id love to see you all there!

			I went (For the second time), great little festival but I won't be going again! For the two headline acts, The Strokes and Kasabian, they dropped the volume to about half of what it had been during the day. We were about 50 metres from the stage and we could talk to each other without raising our voices. Totally ruined what should have been two mind blowing acts. Real real shame, which was second only to the disappointment of watching England get a thrashing from the Germans on the last day of the festival!

			At Stevie Wonders last concert in North Korea the crowd were so ecstatic thay began to shout out asking for requests.    
 It just so happend that Kim Jong-il (a massive Stevie Wonder fan BTW) was in the crowd. Excited and overjoyed he shouts out ""Do ah jazz chord""    
 So Stevie, amazed at the leaders request, plays a ten minute solo on the keyboard and the crowd goes wild.   
Kim Jong-il, now looking a little confused shouts out again ""no, no do ah jazz chord!"" Stevie, loving the enthusiasm of Kim Jong-il, decides to oblidge and plays yet another jazzy number. once complete, again Kim Jong-il, now a looking a little angry, shouts out AGAIN ""NO, No, No do a jazz chord! damit""- tired of this Stevie says ""Look man, how about you come up here and do it yourself if you're not happy!""    
 Kim Jong-il jumps on the stage, grabs the mike from Stevie and begins to sing ""ah jazz chord, to say, I love you""...

639	Concerts	Alternative bars and clubs	"""cyrus"	8817	44	Location: Emmenbruecke	23.10.2009, 17:28	"    Check out (as you probably know) Tillate and Usgang for what's going on. Um, there is new club, Ill see if I can get you info (a friend works there) and I think it might be what you are looking for (you might be able to play too).    
The reason I asked to be more specific was to find out what you meant by alternative- it can have different meanings (well at least to  me)  as I previously mentioned and deffo is different to what Chemmie wrote.

			Yep that's this Saturday. Almost a year after they played last in Switzerland, they are back to put on another blazing show. This time at Fri-Son in Freiburg. Tickets are only 22 CHF (25 with the starticket service charge).   
I would  classify the music as electronic but without computers, samplers as all  of the music is played live with keyboards and guitar pedals, drums.  Definitely one of the best live shows I've ever been too and I will  definitely be going to this one.   
Here's some examples of their stuff (check out Lovely Allen) from their  myspace page (the link gets filtered, but it should be the first thing that pops up on a google search).   
If anyone is interested in other details or the music appeals to anyone and folks are interested in  coming along PM me.

			This is the only information I've got at the moment, but I do have a contact email for anyone interested. PM me for that.   
------------------------------------------------------------   
Upstart Entertainment Presents       Auditions on May 25, 2010 from 6:30 p.m. (venue will be announced on registration) 
  This new musical weaves together the songs of Jacques Brel in a trip around the world. Brel was an accomplished sailor and aviator who dreamed of one day making a trip spanning the globe. Brels World uses his music to take the audience on the journey that Brel himself never made. 
  Jacques Brel is a Belgian singer-songwriter who was active in the 1950s and 60s and into the 70s. He died in 1979 at the age of 49. His songs draw on the French chanson and troubadour traditions while also blending in pop music. His lyrics span a wide range of feelings and emotions. They are romantic, loving, tough, cynical, hopeful. 
  Cast of Brels World: Strong characters who can portray the depth of Brels lyrics and verse.     The songs will be sung in four languages, the narration and dialogue is mostly in English The cast will be required to sing in English, French, German and Dutch.  
  For the auditions, please prepare one Jacques Brel song plus a song of your own choosing. In addition, you will be asked to deliver a monologue of your own choosing. Your choice of audition material should reflect your major strengths. Previous knowledge of Brel is not required although an affinity would be an advantage. 
  A list of songs from Brel's World is available on request.

			I mentioned Nyon as that is the closest town and I didn't think ""in the middle of a cow pasture near Nyon"" would fit in the title.   
I never go to hear an actual band, usually just to hang out and eat at the stalls, and laugh at the Milk stand... and sometimes there is a not very well known band that surprises me    
You have to buy a ticket to go in, there are is no free stuff outside the gates like at Montreux Jazz or Cully.   
There is a bus-shuttle from the Nyon train station to the festival grounds.  You can also drive, though if you don't get there early enough you have to walk almost the same distance as from the train.

You need a ticket to get into many places, but a ticket bought at one will get you into all, 25CHF on the night I think, or 20CHF before (bit late for that)

			Bluebird Productions, the Swiss-Canadian-American company, is premiering their next concert Sinnlich Verstrickt in Zurich and Rapperswill this March 2010. Founded in 2007 by Canadian choreographer Sarah Stead, Swiss mezzo-soprano Valerie Arias and American costumer-sculptor Kate Hamilton, Bluebird's forthcoming presentation blends artistic disciplines and draws on historical references to address contemporary issues of sensuality and stress, death and rebirth, love and choice.

			The Underground Sessions steps it up a gear with 2 fantastic musicians. There have been a lot of changes at the venue and there will be a few more before this gig but rest assured that this is going to be a defining moment for the Sessions. 
Mark Kelly is a fantastic singer/songwriter originally from Manchester but currently residing Swiss side we are really excited to have him play, a real honour! 
Joining him will be the elusive James Carrington, he pulled a little on the line but we finally managed to reel him in to play for definate this time! His music has been used in such shows as Smallville and E.R. and he is signing to a major label too! He flys over from London exclusively to play this night! 
All in all an amazing night of acoustic pleasure awaits ...... look forward to seeing you all there, 
all love 
David  
Underground Sessions 
this will be the last one for a few months so get down and show your support for great live music!

			Portuguese pianist, Maria Joao Pires will be performing in Luzern's KKL on  She will be performing in a charity concert with the Human Rights Orchestra which includes many instrumentalists from Europe's major orchestras such as the Berliner Philharmoniker, Lucerne Festival Orchestra, Orchestra Mozart Bologna, who offer their services to raise awareness of human rights issues as well as to raise funds to support grassroots organizations.   
Considered one of the best interpretors of Chopin, Schubert and Mozart's music, she is a poet amongst many musicians. She is also famously reclusive and her concert appearances rare - hence definitely an opportunity of a lifetime!! WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!

			Hello everyone!   
Just thought I'd drop this one in.   
On the 13th of February five Swiss bands will be rocking the stage at the Papiersaal. The whole thing's called ""Monkeys on Stage"":    
It's a concert series that has started last April and is on going successfully, it's the third MOS, and it's gonna be great.   
So for anyone who likes rock'n'roll and a good concert, for all those who are interested in what good swiss rock sounds like. See you there!    
Cheers

Next event is in February 2010 -

Wanted to let you know that British/U.S. Band Alberta Cross is playing at the Gaswerk in Winterthur on Nov. 25.     
If you haven't heard them play before check out a few of their songs at albertacross.net   
I'm biased because we are friends with them, but if you are looking for a great rock band - definitely check them out!

			The Fish era concluded in 1988, since then (21 years) their lead singer has been Steve Hogarth ""h"". They have now released 15 albums and were the first rock group to really use the internet to interact with their fans and also pre-finance their forthcoming work. Their last studio album ""Happiness Is The Road"" was an absolute belter - great atmospherics, good songs and pure musicianship.

			Sick concert, but a little short.    
We were late getting in and only got the end of the support group who were pretty good and made much more effort to interact with the crowd then Linkin Park themselves.

			Yeh cheers for the tip....it was last night 
and I try to achieve that lounge type feel for my evenings candles on the tables etc... I think acoustic music is best served in such a setting....of course theres always a little moshing space up front 
was a great night thanks to all that came and I hope to see you all at the next one....I may try and organise my own venue for the next one.... 
and thanks for the beer tip 
cheers!

Tickets are 16 CHF (possible to reserve up to 17:00 day of concert). Doors open at 20:00, concert starts at 21:30. 
Return ticket to Rorschach from Zürich is 36 CHF (with a halbtax). 
Possibility to come back after concert (trains at 00:39 and 2:11) or to stay over in Rorschach in a new hostel on the lake ( ).   
It's going to be a great show!!!

liquid dnb has elements of soul, funk and jazz. makoto is one of the world's best producers from Japan and Deeizm is a beautiful & talented singer/mc/producer from the UK. Brookes Brothers are probably one of the most successful dnb acts from the UK who will also be in the line-up.

			I wish we could go see Squarepusher tomorrow, he is definitely worth seeing. It is not the usual let's party music, that's fo sho, you might get tired of the work one does listening to him  ..It is not stuff to chill to, but I enjoy the intricacies and weirdness. If you want to hang with some interesting people and want to meet some not so usual crowd, go see him. He plays fretless bass or custombuilt 6string, whoa. It is definitely something else to listen to him online on some not so good speakers and see him live at a good sound place.

How about making an entry instead of placing the information here as 
a discussion.  Once the date is passed, the calendar will no longer be of
